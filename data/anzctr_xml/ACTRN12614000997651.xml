    <summary>Background Whilst pregnancy is a risk factor for urinary incontinence (UI), this condition may precede pregnancy. The prevalence of UI in nulligravid women has not been reported.
Objective To investigate the prevalence of UI in young nulligravid women, potential risk factors and the impact on quality of life.
Design Single centre, cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire-based study.
Setting University clinical research department
Participants Nulligravid Australian women aged 16 to 30 years. Measurements The Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis, the Psychological General Wellbeing Index (PGWB), the Kings Health Questionnaire and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Demographic variables and potential risk factors were also documented.
Results 1002 women, mean age 22.4 (SD 3.2) years, provided data. The rate of any UI was 12.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), 10.5-14.7%).  The rate of stress-only UI was 6.2% (95% CI, 4.7-7.7%), urge-only UI 4.5% (95% CI, 3.2-5.8%) and mixed UI 1.9% (95% CI, 1.1-2.7%). In logistic regression analyses, ever being sexually active (OR 2.33, 95%CI 1.40 to 3.88)  was associated with an increased likelihood of UI, whereas current use of the combined oral contraceptive (COC) was associated with a reduced likelihood of UI (OR 0.38 95% CI 0.24 to 0.61). Women with UI had significantly lower wellbeing than women without UI (mean difference in total PGWB score 5.3 (95% CI 2.3-8.3). Statistically significant lower scores were seen for the PGWB domains of for anxiety (P&lt;0.001), depression (P&lt;0.001), positive well-being (P=0.02) and self-control (P=0.001).
Limitations The findings relate to a relatively healthy and active cohort.
Conclusions UI was common in this sample of healthy, nulligravid young women and was significantly associated with lower general psychological wellbeing. Further study is required to understand the pathophysiology of UI in young women and management options.
