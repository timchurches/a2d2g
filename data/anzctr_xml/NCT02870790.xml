  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A new NSW Ministry of Health HIV Strategy released on 1 December 2015 aims for the virtual
      elimination of HIV transmission in NSW by 2020. Critical to the new strategy's success is the
      population-based, targeted roll-out of HIV PrEP. PrEP involves taking one pill daily of
      co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)/ emtricitabine (FTC). This large-scale
      study aims for the rapid roll-out of TDF/FTC to individuals at high risk of HIV, who will
      comprise mostly gay and bisexual men (GBM) but will also include small numbers of
      heterosexuals, injecting drug users, and transgender men and women. The drug will be used
      according to existing NSW Ministry of Health Guidelines. By rapidly rolling out this new
      intervention over a 12 month period, and following participants for two years on treatments,
      a reduction of about 50% in new HIV diagnoses in NSW is expected.

      The study aims to assess the incidence of HIV among PrEP study participants and measure the
      population-level impact of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on HIV diagnoses among GBM in NSW over
      a two-year period.

      It will also evaluate the rate of PrEP uptake among high risk GBM in NSW, assess the
      incidence of STI (gonorrhoea, chlamydia and infectious syphilis) among people prescribed PrEP
      and measure the effect of the rapid roll-out of PrEP on the overall number of notifications
      of gonorrhoea, chlamydia and infectious syphilis in NSW, describe patterns of PrEP use and
      medication adherence, and monitor behavioural risk practices among PrEP users.

      The main population group will be more than 3700 gay men at high risk of HIV infection. All
      procedures of this study are guided by the NSW Guidelines on PrEP.
