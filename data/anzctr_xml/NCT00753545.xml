    <primaryOutcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) (According to RECIST) - For each treatment group, the ORR was the number of Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) divided by the number of patients in the group in the FAS with measurable disease at baseline (displayed as a percentage below).

      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response = time from assessment prior to timepoint where PR or CR confirmed (i.e. initial assessment of PR/CR), until earliest date of objective progression or death. [Responding patients only]. There were insufficient responses to enable conclusions to be drawn.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>RECIST and CA-125 Response Separately and Combined - RECIST and CA-125 response separately and combined [Patients evaluable for either CA-125 response or RECIST response]</outcome>
      <timepoint>Radiologic scans performed at baseline then every 12 weeks (+/- 1week) for the first 60 weeks, then every 24 weeks (+/- 1 week) thereafter and monthly for CA-125 measurements, assessed maximum up to 14 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Earlier of CA-125 or RECIST Progression - Time from randomisation to the earlier date of radiological progression (per RECIST criteria) or CA-125 or death by any cause in the absence of objective progression. [FAS]</outcome>
      <timepoint>Radiologic scans performed at baseline then every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) for the first 60 weeks, then every 24 weeks (+/- 1 week) thereafter and monthly for CA-125 measurements, assessed maximum up to 14 months.</timepoint>
