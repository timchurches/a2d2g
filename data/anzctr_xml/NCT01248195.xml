  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Amisulpride open label
Treatment: drugs - 6-week amisulpride double blind treatment
Treatment: drugs - 6-week olanzapine double blind treatment
Treatment: drugs - 12-week clozapine open-label treatment
Behaviour - Psychosocial intervention

Other: Phase I: 1 arm 'amisulpride open label' - For 4 weeks, all patients will be treated with amisulpride open label.

Active Comparator: Phase II: 'amisulpride double blind' - Patients who do not meet remission criteria during phase I (4 weeks open label amisulpride), flow to phase II where they are randomised to 1 of 2 6-week double blind treatment arms, one of which is 'amisulpride double blind'

Active Comparator: Phase II 'olanzapine double blind' - Patients who do not meet remission criteria during phase I (4 weeks open label amisulpride), flow to phase II where they are randomised to 1 of 2 6-week double blind treatment arms, one of which is 'olanzapine double blind'

Other: Phase III: 1 arm 'clozapine open label' - Patients who do not meet remission criteria during phase II (6-week double blind amisulpride vs olanzapine), flow to phase III, where only 1 arm is available: 'clozapine open label'

Experimental: Psychosocial intervention - Patients who meet remission criteria during any of the phases of the medication component, patients who drop out of the medication component and patients who did not meet remission criteria at the end of the medication component, will flow to the psychosocial intervention component, where they are randomised to 1 of 2 arms, one of which is the 'Psychosocial Intervention' arm.

No Intervention: Psychosocial Intervention phase: 'TAU' - Patients who meet remission criteria during any of the phases of the medication component, patients who drop out of the medication component and patients who did not meet remission criteria at the end of the medication component, will flow to the psychosocial intervention component, where they are randomised to 1 of 2 arms, one of which is the 'Treatment as usual' arm.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PANSS - Study consists of multiple components, each with their own objectives. For this (medication) component: number of patients in remission, based on PANSS scores (criteria of Andreasen et al.; 2005) after 4 weeks open label amisulpride, after 6 weeks double blind amisulpride or olanzapine and after 12 weeks of open label clozapine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Jan 2016</timepoint>

      <timepoint>Jan 2016</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biological profile - Biological predictors component, objective A: drug response (remission vs non-remission) as a function of biological profile, after 4 weeks, 10 weeks and 22 weeks (after each medication phase).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is optimising current treatments in schizophrenia and explore novel
      therapeutic options for schizophrenia. The study intends to both address basic, but so far
      unanswered, questions in the treatment of schizophrenia and develop new interventions. It is
      expected that the project will lead to evidence that is directly applicable to treatment
      guidelines, and will identify potential mechanisms for new drug development.</summary>
