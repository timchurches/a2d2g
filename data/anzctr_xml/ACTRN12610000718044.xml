  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects were instructed to consume either 2 serves of approximately 150 g of salmon per week, or 6 fish oil capsules per week; each of which was estimated to provide an average of approximately 1000mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day.  In a randomised cross-over design each person consumed fish and fish oil for 12 weeks each, with 12 weeks washout between interventions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Erythrocyte omega 3 index, ie the proportion of DHA and EPA in the total fatty acids in red cell membranes.
Red blood cells were isolated and fatty acids assessed using gas-liquid chromatography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, after 12 weeks on the first intervention, 12 weeks later at end of washout and at 36 weeks after 12 weeks on the second intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure measured using an automated blood pressure monitor (Omron model T9P (HEM-759P-CI), Omron Healthcare Co. Ltd, Japan).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, after 12 weeks on the first intervention, 12 weeks later at end of washout and at 36 weeks after 12 weeks on the second intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We conducted a randomised cross-over dietary intervention trial to compare the effects of 1g EPA+DHA per day from two different sources  fish and fish oil capsules. Subjects were randomised to begin on one arm of the intervention for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week washout period and finally the alternate arm for another 12 weeks. Various cardiovascular risk markers were measured at each time point. Statistical analyses were performed to compare changes with each intervention, and the changes between the two treatment arms.

11 participants (10 males and 1 female) with a mean age of 50.9 years were recruited from St. Vincents Hospital, Melbourne from September 2008 to May 2009.
Both treatments increased erythrocyte omega-3 index significantly, while the fish treatment also appeared to have beneficial effects on blood pressure.</summary>
