Treatment: surgery: Sterile air injection
Injection of 20 microlitres using Novofine 5mm needle of sterile air into either abdomen or thigh using either a pinched or unpinched skin fold and either a vertical or angled approach.

Treatment: surgery: Placebo injection
Injection of either 20, 40 or 60 IU of placebo media into either abdomen or thigh using either a vertical or angled Novofine 5 mm needle. Leakage of fluid will be blotted and then weighed to establish fluid loss.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus are required to inject insulin daily.
      The injection technique should reliably deposit insulin into subcutaneous fat while
      minimizing inadvertent delivery into either the skin or the underlying muscle, both of which
      are associated with suboptimal outcomes. The use of shorter, thinner needles reduces the
      incidence of intramuscular delivery and is associated with reduced discomfort, but increases
      the risks of both shallow (intradermal) delivery and of loss of insulin through backflow to
      the skin surface.

      In the current study, 240 subjects (children and adults) will receive multiple injections of
      small volumes of sterile air in the thigh and abdomen using 5 mm Novofine® needles, to
      simulate insulin injections performed at the two sites using various injection techniques
      (perpendicular or angled needle, with or without skin fold). Ultrasound visualisation of the
      injected air will allow determination of the incidence of intradermal or intramuscular
      delivery using the various delivery methods in the trial. In addition, adult subjects will
      receive injections of a liquid test medium in order to determine the incidence and extent of
      backflow. Qualitative data on perceived discomfort and information on body composition will
      also be collected. This investigation will form the basis for recommendations regarding
      preferred injection technique where 5 mm needles are used.</summary>
