  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study intends to examine the effect of early exercise engagement on various cardiovascular, cerebrovascular
and psychosocial outcome measures in high risk TIA patients and ischaemic stroke patients. 

Participants randomized to the early or delayed exercise conditions will visit the Massey University recreation centre, twice a week, for 12 weeks to take part in a group focused exercise session. Those individuals randomized to the early exercise programme will commence their exercise sessions within 7 days of TIA or stroke diagnosis. Those randomized to the delayed exercise programme will commence their exercise sessions 28 days after TIA or stroke diagnosis. Despite differences in when the exercise programmes commence (early vs delayed), identical exercise programmes will be implemented (see below)

Each exercise session will last 60 mins, incorporating approximately 30 to 45 minutes of aerobic exercise. Participants will take part in walking, cycling (seated and recumbent) and cross-training aerobic exercise. The remaining exercise session will consist of flexibility and balance exercises. Blood pressure, heart rate and RPE will be measured prior to, during and following each bout of aerobic exercise. It is anticipated that participants will exercise between 40 and 85% of age-predicted maximal heart rate during each aerobic exercise tasks. The exercise intensity will typically increase by ~5 % each week, although the rate of progression will be dependent upon how the subject feels during each session. The exercise sessions will be adminsitered by exercise physiologists working at Massey University. To monitor participant adherence to the exercise programme, attendance records will be monitored.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition will complete identical assessment procedures as those individuals randomized to the exercise group.  Those randomized to the control condition at the completion of the baseline assessment will receive normal care (i.e. no additional supportive strategies will be implemented) during the 12 week exercise intervention.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The Stroke Department at Wellington Hospital receives referrals for all those with possible TIA and stroke in the Region. Referrals are received via telephone, fax or e-mail from General Practitioners, the Emergency Department and Paramedics. All referrals are reviewed by a specialist physician and appropriate diagnostic tests undertaken, as per the NZ TIA and stroke guidelines. Thosewho meet the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate. 

Following the baseline assessments participants will be randomized to either an early or delayed exercise programme,  or to a normal care control group. the Randomization will occur via 'allocation concealment'. Allocation concealment will occur via sealed opaque envelopes which will be sequentially numbered.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computerised sequence generation

The randomization sequence will be generated using the following internet source (http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm). The randomization sequence (i.e. A = Early Exercise; B = Delayed Exercise; C = Control) will be placed in a sequentially numbered envelope (from 1-45) based on the derived sequence generated by the website.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Due to the pilot nature to this study it was decided that 15 subjects in each condition (15 in early exercise condition; 15 in delayed exercise condition' 15 in control condition) would elicit enough data to provide statistical and power calculations for a fully randomized controlled trial. 

A series of two way repeated measures analyiss of variance (aNOVA) will be used to assess the effect of the treatment condition on primary and secondary outcomes reported at baselineand post-intervention. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of chronic disability in many developed countries, causing both physical and cognitive impairments. Research strongly suggests that rehabilitation should be started early with this population group. However, on closer inspection, it is evident that there is little clear consensus about what constitutes early and thus what the optimal time to start a rehabilitation program is. As such, there is limited evidence available to help guide best practice. In the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke care, getting the balance right between diagnosis, the start of therapies, medical interventions and exercise rehabilitation can be challenging. Improving our understanding of the impact of the rehabilitation intervention on brain recovery and functional restoration should be a priority.

The purpose of this research study is therefore to investigate the effect of early vs delayed exercise engagement (following stroke diagnosis) on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular health, cognition, psycho-social markers and physical fitness parameters in newly diagnosed stroke and high risk transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients.
