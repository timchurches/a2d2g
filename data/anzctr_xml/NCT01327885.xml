  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time in months from the date of treatment start until death, regardless of cause. In the absence of confirmation of death, participants were censored either at the date that participant was last known to be alive or the date of study cut-off, whichever was earlier. Participants who died on the date of randomization had a survival time of 0.5 day. Allocation of randomization numbers were performed based upon the following stratification factors: (a) Histology (ADI or LMS), (b) Region (Region 1: USA and Canada; or Region 2: Western Europe, Australia, Israel; or Region 3: Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia), and (c) Number of prior regimens for advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) (2 or &gt;2 prior regimens).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of treatment start until date of death from any cause, assessed up to data cutoff date (02 Jan 2015), for up to approximately 3 years 11 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurred first). The date of disease progression was defined as the date of radiologic disease progression as assessed by the investigator or designee based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Participants who did not have an event (i.e., participants who were lost to follow-up or who did not progress or die at the date of data cut-off), were censored. Participants who discontinued study treatment without disease progression were censored on the date of their last radiological assessment (scan date).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization (day 1) to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death (whichever occurred first)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Rate at 12 Weeks (PFR12wks) - The PFR12wks was defined as the percentage of participants who were still alive without disease progression at 12 weeks from the date of randomization. Tumor assessment by the investigator or designee was based on RECIST criteria 1.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of treatment start until Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - CBR was defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of CR, or PR, or duration of stable disease (dSD) greater than or equal to 11 weeks, between Arm A and Arm B. CBR was estimated by treatment arm based on the tumor response evaluation performed by the PI or designee according to RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the longest diameter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of treatment start (Day 1) until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, participant's choice to stop study treatment, or up to data cutoff (02 Jan 2015), for up to approximately 3 years 11 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation greater than or equal to 1 menstrual cycle prior to
             randomization, or have undergone a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy).

             Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use two forms of highly
             effective contraception from the last menstrual period prior to randomization (or use

                  subjects who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of
                  the same hormonal contraceptive product from the last menstrual period prior to
                  randomization, and must continue to use the same hormonal contraceptive product
                  during study treatment, and for 3 months after the first dose of study treatment.

             of highly effective contraception from the last menstrual period of their female
             partner prior to randomization (or use a double barrier method as described above
             until they are on two forms of highly effective contraception for at least one
             menstrual cycle), during study treatment, and for 3 months (or 6 months if they
             received dacarbazine) after the final dose of study treatment. If currently abstinent,
             must agree to use a double barrier method of contraception if they become sexually
             active, or until they are on two forms of highly effective contraception as described
             above.
