  <interventions>
    <interventions>OM-85 capsule powder (3.5mg) in five blocks of 10 days treatment plus 20 days no treatment, during the first two winter viral seasons (April to September) of a child's life. Capsule powder can be dissolved in fruit juice, water or milk for administration. Parents/guardians will be contacted toward the start of each treatment block as a reminder. Parents/guardians will be given a calendar as a reminder to start treatment blocks and to record doses given or missed. Parents/guardians will return empty and full blister packs at study visits to monitor adherence.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Persistent asthma is a major problem yet none of the current therapies do more than control the condition. The long-term solution is to prevent asthma from progressing to the persistent form. The major risk factors are: family history, early allergy and recurrent severe lower respiratory infections (sLRI) in the early life. We will conduct a randomized clinical trial to prevent sLRI using a novel bacterial-derived immunostimulant (OM-85) in infants at high risk of developing asthma. OM-85 works by priming the immune system so that body can respond quickly to infections. This will help reduce damage to the lungs during sLRI's and may prevent asthma from developing.</summary>
