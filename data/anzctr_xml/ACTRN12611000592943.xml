    <interventions>Rasping of anterior femoral cortex prior to abductor repair to the anterior femoral cortex in closure of the Hardinge's approach for total hip replacement.

The Hardinge's approach involves exposing the hip joint for total hip replacement by detaching the anterior one third of the insertion of gluteus medius and minimus on the anterior proximal femur (the 'abductors'). After the hip replacement has been completed this tendinous attachment is repaired using sutures. 

Rasping the site of boney attachment of the abductors would involve using a surgical instrument called a rasp to roughen the smooth cortical  boney surface and expose underlying vascular boney architecture. This may take an additional one to two minutes of operating time when compared to repair of the abductors without rasping.

This is a one-off intervention at the time of closure of the Hardinge's exposure.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients will be asked at the time of consenting for routine primary total hip replacement if they are happy to be involved in the trial. If they are happy to consent after discussion and reading the patient information sheet they will be included in the study. At the time of abductor repair an OR nurse will open the envelope which will either allocate the patient to rasping or no rasping prior to abductor repair. The surgeon will be aware which group the patient was in as he will be performing the procedure. The patient will blinded to which technique was used. The technique used will not be included in the routine operation note so post-operative assessment of outcomes is somewhat blinded to which technique was used. (Note that no attempts will be made to prevent the operating surgeon from performing the post-operative assessments so blinding may not be complete in this respect). The patients ID sticker will be placed with the envelope randomisation card into a confidential collection box until the conclusion of the study period.</concealment>

    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine whether rasping (freshening using a surgical instrument) of the
surface of the femur (thigh bone) prior to re-attachment of tendons routinely detached to perform total
hip replacement improves their healing to the femur and their function as stabilisers during walking and
standing on one leg after hip replacement.

Pre-study statistical analysis performed by Mr Cameron Walker, Statistician from the University of
Auckland. Desired power 80%. Desired significance level 0.05. Effect size 0.5. 50 patients required in
each group for one-sided tests of significance. The analysis was performed using the pwr library in the R
package.

Block envelope Randomisation. First 100 consenting patients undergoing primary total hip replacement
by either Mr Dray or Mr Bentall using a Hardinges approach analysed. Randomised to either closure
of the abductor mechanism with or without rasping of the anterior femoral cortex prior to re-attachment.
Surgical clips secured on both ends of abductor repair for radiographic analysis of repair integrity. All
other aspects of surgery as per usual routine. Routine clinic follow-up post discharge at six weeks and six
months. Assessment of patients gait for abductor lurch, trendelenbergs test and radiographic review with
AP and lateral plain film X-rays of the hip. At the conclusion of the study Fishers exact test will be used to
compare rates of abductor lurch, positive trendelenbergs test and radiographic evidence of repair failure
between the two groups.</summary>
