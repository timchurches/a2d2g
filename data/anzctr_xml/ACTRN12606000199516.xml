  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will compare the outcomes of colorectal surgery (bowel resection and possible stoma formation) versus colonic stent insertion using Ultraflex or Wallfex Precision Colonic Stent manufactured by Boston Scientific (TGA approved in Australia) to determine optimal management of non-curable colorectal cancer. Comparisons will be made between quality of life, length of stay, complications and cost to identify which group has the optimal outcome. The study will be conducted over 3 years.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For patients with malignant bowel obstruction that cannot be cured, palliative surgery is often required to relieve the obstruction. This usually requires the formation of a stoma or opening where the bowel is brought to the suface of the skin. An alternative to surgery is the placement of a metal tube or stent through the obstruction to allow the passage of stool. As these surgical interventions are palliative the most important outcomes are those relating to the patients quality of life. This study will determine whether patients' quality of life is greater following stent insertion than surgery to relieve bowel obstruction. It will also compare complication rates and resource utilisation for each intervention. An economic evaluation will determine the relative cost-effectiveness of the 2 procedures.</summary>
