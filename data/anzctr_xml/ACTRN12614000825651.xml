  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an 8 week internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (i-cbt) program.  The i-cbt has been developed  as a treatment for depression and anxiety in older adults. The therapy involves 5 lessons released sequentially over 8 weeks.  The therapy is clinician supported through brief contact via telephone or email each week (approximately 10 minutes).  In addition to the core lessons there are homework activities and supplementary resources.  Reminder emails to indicate the release of lessons are part of the protocol. Engagement in the program is monitored through clinician contact, tracking of lesson completion, observation of downloads of resources  and observation of participant time spent online. The approximate time required to complete each lesson is 60 minutes. It is expected that participants will spend some additional time during the week engaging in the program through reading the lesson summaries, completing homework, practicing the skills and reading the supplementary resources.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Estimates for the required sample size, calculated with GPower software, indicate that 450 people will be required for the study.  This estimate is based on using F tests, an effect size of 0.17, a two group design, power of .8, five time points and one covariate.  The effect size was taken from a meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of depression in older adults (Forsman et al., 2011).  To allow for the hierarchical, non-independent nature of the data, linear mixed models will be employed for the analysis. Baseline outcome measures will be used as a covariate and the models will be used to compare change over time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an 8- week internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) as a preventative intervention for depression in older adults with  two or more chronic diseases.  It is hypothesised that, on the primary outcomes of depressive symptoms and rate of depressive disorders, the iCBT group will have fewer depressive symptoms or diagnoses of depression at post-treatment and follow-up than the control group who receives no intervention. </summary>
