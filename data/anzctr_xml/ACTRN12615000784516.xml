  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multimedia falls prevention education with between 2 and 4 individual health professional follow-up sessions for each participant in the week prior to hospital discharge. Delivered by physiotherapist who is the educator. Each participant in the intervention group to receive education individually by being shown a DVD and also being given written materials with workbook. The DVD and written materials contain information about falls prevention in the post discharge period, including information about the risk factors for older adults for falls, falls interventions for older adults, addressing individual risk factors, vision for falls prevention, home modifications, use of gait aids, exercise for falls prevention, benefits of exercise for strength and balance, problems encountered that could lead to falls in the post discharge period. Materials are discussed with educator, with participants assisted to develop goals for discharge. The education is based on evidence for falls prevention in the post discharge period. Participant receives individual tailored discussion and feedback that allows them to develop goals and strategies depending on their falls risk and individual medical conditions. Participants are asked to read the workbook which varies according to the reading ability of the participant. An estimated time is 15 minutes. participants are allowed to rewatch the DVD if they wish. participants are encouraged to write and make notes in their workbook and if unable to write are assisted to make notes that are relevant to their situation. This will vary between participants but the total median time is described below. this has been determined by the piloting of the intervention. 
Between 2 and 4 meetings will occur and most usually one meeting per day. Each meeting time is estimated to be a maximum of 15 minutes and may range from 10 to 25 minutes. The number of intervention sessions and the time for each session and the total amount of intervention time  is determined by clinician assessment of participant. An approximate median time of 45 minutes per patient is estimated. No group activities.
Once per month for three months after participants leave hospital those participants in the intervention group receive a coaching telephone call from the educator (the same physiotherapist), which uses active learning principles and health behaviour change principles to reinforce and personalise the contents of the education for the participant. The time estimated for all telephone calls is 45 minutes. the time for each telephone call and the total time for all telephone calls is determined by the educator when they speak with the participant according to the participants response to the educator and questions that the participant may have.

    <comparator>The control group will receive 3 x 15 minute sessions in the week prior to hospital discharge with a trained health professional person who will discuss positive ageing with participants in the control group, using a scripted program, but will not give any specific falls prevention information to the participant.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients approached and written consent sought. Participants are enrolled by the research assistant. They are randomly allocated to groups in a 1:1 ratio in consecutive order after they are enrolled. The allocation is performed by the educator who phones the research officer of the co-investigator at an external university who is off site and not involved in recruitment, data collection or providing interventions. The officer at the co-investigator's university opens an opaque sealed envelope with the participantâ€™s study identification number on it. The paper inside the envelope contains the group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The group allocation is determined by a computer generated random number sequence that is produced by a project collaborator at an external university who is not involved in recruitment, intervention or data collection. The external university prepares the envelopes.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using an intention to treat analysis for all primary analyses using an alpha level set at 0.05. The primary outcome measure (rates of falls) will be analysed using negative binomial regression with adjustment for participants length of observation in the study. Secondary outcomes of functional ability (ADL and IADL) and HRQoL and will be compared between groups using linear regression with adjustment for levels of participation measured at baseline in hospital.The proportion of people who become fallers during the observation period will be analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for length of observation in the study. Rates of injurious falls will also be analyzed using negative binomial regression with adjustment for participants length of observation in the study. Primary analyses will include pre-planned adjustment for baseline levels of covariates (history of falls during hospital admission or in 6 months prior to hospital admission, receiving assistance with ADL (as a dichotomous outcome), presence of depressed mood as measured by GDS and use of walking aid).

 Total sample size is N=390 (allows for drop out of approximately 5%). Power calculation based upon detecting a 30% relative reduction in the rate of falls (negative binomial incidence rate ratio =0.70) from a control rate of 0.80 falls per person over the 6 month follow-up. Using these data with a two-tailed alpha =0.05, power =0.80, and a 1:1 control to intervention allocation ratio in the "Poisson regression" procedure from G*Power 3.14 determines that a total sample size of N=372 was required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalisation in older people in Australia. Older people are at increased risk of falls after hospital discharge and these falls can lead to injury and loss of independence and quality of life. However older people have been found to have low levels of knowledge about falls and may be reluctant to engage in falls prevention activities, such as exercise.  

The primary aim of this trial is to determine if providing tailored falls prevention education that includes the provision of multimedia materials as well as individual health professional consultations and reinforcement in hospital and after discharge reduces falls rates in older people after discharge from hospital. A randomised trial will compare outcomes between a group that receive the education in addition to usual care and a group that receive social visits in addition to usual care.
