Active Comparator: Consolidation Arm A: single myeloablative consolidation - Patients receive melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on days -7 to -5, etoposide IV over 24 hours and carboplatin IV over 24 hours on days -7 to -4, and G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0.

Experimental: Consolidation Arm B: tandem myeloablative consolidation - Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -7 to -5, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2, and G-CSF SC or IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Following clinical recovery from initial myeloablative therapy, patients also receive melphalan, etoposide, and carboplatin as in Arm A. Patients undergo autologous PBSCT on day 0.

Other: Not Assigned - Patients either failed during Induction therapy or refused randomization, and hence did not receive any of the Consolidation therapy (i.e., Consolidation Arm A: single HST (CEM) myeloablative consolidation or Consolidation Arm B: tandem HST (CEM) myeloablative consolidation).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial compares two different high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy
      regimens followed by autologous stem cell transplant as consolidation treatment of younger
      patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. All patients receive the same 6 cycles of initial
      multi-agent chemotherapy induction regimen. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected after
      the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal tissue that needs to be removed. Patients underwent resection of their primary tumor
      mass after 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Those patients without progressive disease at completion
      of induction therapy who has sufficient stem cells collected and had adequate organ function
      were eligible to proceed to consolidation therapy. Those patients who met consolidation
      eligibility were randomized to either a single myeloablative regimen or 2 myeloablative
      regimens delivered in tandem followed by re-infusion of autologous stem cells. Patients
      received radiation therapy after recovery from the assigned myeloablative therapy. It is not
      yet known which regimen of high-dose chemotherapy is more effective for patients with
      high-risk neuroblastoma undergoing a peripheral blood stem cell transplant.</summary>
