    <interventions>Intervention Group:
Participants will be required to undertake a minimum of 60 minutes of volunteer work per week for a six-month period. Participants will be able to select the nature of the volunteer work, and will be provided with assistance by Volunteering WA to source potential volunteer activities.
All participants will be asked to keep a daily record of their physical activity and volunteering activities during the six-month period. This will be used to monitor adherence to the intervention.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will assess the relative and combined effects of volunteering on seniors physical and mental health. Comparisons will be made between a cohort undertaking volunteering activities and a cohort in a control condition (customary activity). A multi-method intervention approach will be used to obtain experimental and attitudinal data from individuals aged 60+ years. Data will be collected over six months to capture information relating to activity initiation, continuance, and attrition. The study will identify the health benefits for older people of different levels and types of volunteering and the major factors impacting the recruitment and retention of older volunteers. </summary>
