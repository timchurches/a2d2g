  <interventions>
    <interventions>180 pregnant women with history of recurrent unexplained pregnancy loss classified into 2 groups Group 1 included 90 women received low dose aspirin orally 75 mg once daily and heparin 5000 IU subcutaneous every 12 hours started at 8 weeks gestation till the end of 12th week.  Group 2 included 90 women received no treatment. Monitoring adherence to treatment was done by counting drug tablets return and counting number of used syringes every 2 weeks</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Results are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) or number (%). Comparison between the mean values of different variables in the two groups was performed using unpaired student t test.
Comparison between categorical data was performed using Chi square test. SPSS computer program (version 12 windows) was used for data analysis. P value less or equal to 0.05 was considered significant and less than 0.01 was considered highly significant
Power analysis: As the primary outcome in the study, power analysis was done on the completion of first trimester. Fisher Exact test was chosen to perform the power analysis, the a-error level was fixed at 0.05 and the sample size was entered to be 180 participants divided equally into 2 groups . completion of first trimester had occurred in 73.33% of cases in group I and 43.33% in group 2.According to this effect size, the calculated statistical power was &gt; 99.9%. Calculations were done using PS Power and Sample Size Calculations Software, version 3.0.11 for MS Windows (William D. Dupont and Walton D. Vanderbilt, USA).
