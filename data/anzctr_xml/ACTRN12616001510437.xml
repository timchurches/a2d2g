  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a retropsective cohort study looking at GASP data collected during routine/standard care of patients with asthma from November 2008 till June 2016. All data are stored at Comprehensive Health Ltd (Waitemata Dirtrict Health Board) in a confidential secured database and only anonymised patient data are used for analysis.  

The online GASP tool is used as part of the standard asthma assessment in priomary care. It includes standard asthma assessment questions and provides an online patient record. GASP aids the nurse/doctor in their assessment by providing prompts during the assessment process, aids with diagnosis and recommends treatment (medication) options including allergy avoidance.  This assessment tool is used everytime the patient visits the practice with the patient consenting to the use of their data for unannoynomised data analysis at a future date. The GASP tool records all patients demographics, medical history, symptoms, lung function results, medication use, smoking hisytory, adherance and inhaler technique. </interventions>
    <comparator>A retrospective cohort study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of GASP. Data for patients aged 5-64 years in primary care (Waitemata district of Auckland) with uncontrolled asthma who had completed a minimum of two GASP assessments between 1 November 2008 and 16 June 2016 was extracted from a secure self-populating database. Outcome measures were compared between each patients visits 1 (November 2008)  and 2 (June 2016) assessments. All patients first assessments was done in the month of November 2015 and their last/final assessment was completed in the month of June 2016. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Giving Asthma Support to Patients (GASP) is a new and unique online tool developed to provide asthma education at the point of care, as well as to provide healthcare professionals with skills and knowledge to undertake a structured asthma assessment. 

GASP tool is unlike previous tools as it has a built in decision support, based on current guidelines, which encourages best practice. The GASP online tool also includes the following: spirometry testing, asthma symptoms scores, exacerbations, peak flow, triggers, medication adherence, inhaler technique and review of action plans. In this retrospective cohort study we aimed to measure the effectiveness of the GASP tool in improving asthma outcomes such as exacerbations, hospital admissions and medication usage. Patients assessed initially in the month of Novemebr 2008 (before any GASP assessment) were comparted to their own assessment in the month of June 2016. All in between assessment were done on an as required bassis and usually on a three monthly basis from November 2008 to June 2016. However, for this study we are only comparing data obtained in November 2008 to that obtained in June 2016. </summary>
