  <interventions>
    <interventions>The internet-delivered Health Anxiety program comprises 6 lessons completed over 10 weeks. It includes all treatment components typically seen in face­-to­-face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (the first­-line treatment for severe health anxiety). One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons and a maximum of 14 days). Each lesson will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, email contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist) after completion of the first two lessons, then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email.

Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to evaluate the acceptability and clinical efficacy of the online Health Anxiety Program.

Up to 25 people with elevated health anxiety (either IAD or SSD) will be assigned to the active treatment group. The treatment group will commence the Health Anxiety Program immediately.

The efficacy of the Health Anxiety Program will be determined by comparing the health anxiety symptom levels before and after treatment, and at 3 month follow-up. </summary>
