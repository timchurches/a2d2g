    <interventions>The Dantonic Pill (DP) is derived from traditional Chinese herbal medicines, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Panax notoginseng and Borneol, and is used in China for the prevention and management of atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular disease. This project aims to assess the tolerance and physiological response to DP in 56 healthy adult Westerners. The participant (volunteer) will orally take a single dose of Dantonic Pill at 60, 80, 100, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, or 180 pills (25mg/pill), with 4-6 subjects for each dose group. The symptoms, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be assessed before and at 1.5 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours and 7 days after the Dantonic therapy. Blood and urine samples will also be collected for the laboratory assessments.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dantonic Pill (DP) is a pharmaceutical product derived from medicinal herbs Salvia miltiorrhiza and Panax notoginseng. DP has been registered in China for the prevention and management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for over ten years. Clinical trial studies in China have demonstrated that DP has few side effects and Asian people are well tolerant of the DP therapy. To date, DP is also availbale in many herb shops in Australia and however, the data concerning the tolerance and side effects of this product in Western population   are limited. This project study aims to investigate the tolerance and general physiological responses to DP in Western people, through assessment of the symptems, blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), bloof cell count, blood lipids and glucose, and liver and renal function in healthy adult Westerners folllowing a single dose of DP therapy.</summary>
