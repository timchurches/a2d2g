    <statisticalmethods>We require about 60 subjects (30 subjects for BRVO group and 30 subjects for control group). Differences between the two groups for thrombophilic parameters will evaluated using by a t-test according to Bonferroni procedures for multiple comparisons. The level of significance was set at &lt;0.05. 

For a study power of 80%, we determined 30 subjects will enough to test all parameters. The power of the test is pathfinder to know the probability that the test will give the right result when there is a real effect. The power of the significance test is the same thing as the sensitivity of a screening test. The effect size was 0.5.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose: To search platelet activation via detecting three important platelet activation parameters; Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), Platelet Distribution Width (PDW), and Plateletcrit (PCT) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in comparison to those in healthy adults as controls.
Design: A prospective case control study
Participants and Controls: 30 patients within the BRVO (Group 1) and 30 age-and sex-matched healthy controls will included into the study (Group 2).
Methods: All patients and control subjects will undergo complete ophthalmologic evaluation. MPV, PDW, and PCT were measured in the studied groups.
Main Outcome Measures: Alterations in platelet activation parameters.
The mean level of MPV PDW and PCT value in Group 1 and in Group 2 will determined. </summary>
