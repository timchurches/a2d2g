  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be asked to perform exercise tests during two testing sessions. One exercise test will involve a single bout of cycle ergometer exercise at 80% (HI) VO2max for 38 minutes which expends ~400 kcal). This is a crossover study with the order of the exercise tests being randomised. The second test will occur a minimum of 1 week following the commencment of first exercise test (maximum of up to 4 weeks). This washout period will be based on participant availability, work place availability, and human physiology (ie: females will be asked to perform exercise trials only within the proliferative phase of their menstral cycle).</interventions>
    <comparator>Lean, overweight and obese participants will be there own controls (crossover study). Participants will be asked to perform a single bout of cycle ergometer exercise at 40% (LO) VO2max for 70 minutes which expends ~400 kcal</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to identify key differences in cellular pathways involved in energy metabolism at rest and following an acute bout of exercise between healthy overweight and obese and lean individuals. Forty age-matched and fitness-matched (20 lean, 20 overweight and/or obese) healthy males and females between the ages of 20 and 50 years will be recruited. Participants will perform a buccal swab and donate a venous blood sample to obtain a genetic and metabolic signature profile at rest. Participants will perform a low (40% VO2peak-LO) and high-intensity (80% VO2peak-HI) exercise bout for approximately 70 and 38 minutes, respectively, separated by 2 weeks. A DEXA scan will be performed prior to the first exercise test. Venous blood will be sampled prior to, immediately after, 15 minutes, and 3 hours following completion of the exercise. Muscle biopsies will be sampled prior to, 15 minutes and 3 hours following completion of the exercise. Urine samples will be collected prior to, 90 minutes and 3 hours following the completion of the exercise. This proposed project will allow parallel measurement of metabolism in response to exercise intensity and to be mapped against variations in genetic disposition. This will help identify and contextualize biomarkers of metabolic flexibility or inflexibility in healthy overweight and obese individuals. These biomarkers can then be used as targets for exercise, nutrition and pharmacological interventions.</summary>
