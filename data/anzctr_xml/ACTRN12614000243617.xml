  <interventions>
    <interventions>13 week intervention: A package of on-line pain coping skills training (PCST), physiotherapy guided exercise delivered on-line via SKYPE and on-line general education. On-line pain coping skills training and online general education will commence in week 1. Physiotherapy SKYPE sessions will commence after this in week 2 in order for participants to complete 1-2 PainCOACH sessions prior to commencing the physiotherapy intervention. 

PCST program - participants will complete on-line pain coping skills training (PCST) in the form of the PainCOACH program consisting of 8 interactive modules, each taking approximately 45 minutes. Participants will be asked to complete one module per week. At the completion of the 8 week modules participants will be asked to continue applying their pain coping skills.

General education made available on-line - The on-line education component will consist of short fact sheets covering topics such as what is OA, healthy eating, importance of exercise, sleep etc. There will be 18 fact sheets in total which will be available to access online through a password protected site. There is no required access schedule. Participants may access the fact sheets at any time throughout the duration of the trial, 36weeks. They will take approximately 5 minutes each to read.

Physiotherapy guided exercise delivered on-line via SKYPE - participants will complete 7 Physiotherapy exercise based sessions using Skype over the 13 week intervention, commencing in week 2 at intervals of approximately 2 weeks. Session one will be 45 minutes in duration and all subsequent sessions will be 30 minutes. Participants will be prescribed a home exercise program of 4-6 exercises for knee strength and range of motion. Home exercises are to be completed 3 times a week and will take approximately 15 minutes. Participants will commence their home exercise program in week 2 and are encouraged to continue their exercise program until the end of the trial at 36 weeks.
We will monitor adherence to the home exercise program through participant log books. Pain coping skills training will be monitored using a PainCOACH specific logbook.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A trained research assistant will conduct telephone screening of volunteers. Eligible consenting participants will complete baseline questionnaires online following which they will be randomised into one of two treatment groups: (i) control: on-line education alone; or (ii) intervention: on-line PCST “PainCOACH”, exercise based  physiotherapy delivered on skype and general on-line education.

To conceal randomization, consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be prepared by a researcher with no other involvement in
the study. The envelopes will be stored in a locked location and will be
opened in sequence to reveal group allocation by a different researcher
not involved in the sequence generation or concealment.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint of the trial is change in knee pain on walking (NRS) and change in physical function (WOMAC) between the combined treatment group and the control group. Sample size calculations are based on a two-arm trial with 80% power and significance level at 0.05. The minimum clinically important difference to be detected in OA trials is a change in pain of 1.8 units (out of 10) 32 and change in function of 6 points (out of 68) 33. Based on data from our recently completed RCT of face-to-face physiotherapist-delivered exercise and PCST with a comparable patient population in 67 people with chronic knee pain), we estimate a between-participant standard deviation of 2.2 for pain and 11.0 for WOMAC physical function and a baseline to 6-month correlation in scores of 0.29 for pain and 0.51 for physical function. Using these estimates would enable the detection of treatment effects of 0.8 for pain and 0.55 for function. As smaller treatment effects of around 0.5 have also been found for pain and function following individual exercise programs in people with knee OA, this study will be adequately powered to also detect these smaller effect sizes. Therefore allowing for 15% attrition rate, to enable the detection of at least a 0.5 effect size in either pain or function, we will recruit 74 participants in each group or a total of 148 participants.

Our biostatistician will analyse data in a blinded manner. Main comparative analyses between groups will be performed using intention-to-treat. For continuous outcomes (e.g. pain, physical function), differences in mean change (baseline minus follow-up) will be compared between groups using linear regression modelling adjusted for baseline values of the outcome. Proportional odds models will compare improvement between groups based on perceived ratings of change. We will also perform a per protocol analysis as appropriate. Linear regression modelling will assess associations between treatment group and other follow-up measures at each time-point, adjusted for baseline values. Effects of patient characteristics related to treatment outcomes will be assessed by including relevant terms in the models. Variables will be included if they are significant at the 5% level.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Persistent knee pain, in people over 50 years, is usually attributable to knee osteoarthritis (OA), a common health problem that causes physical and psychological dysfunction. 
Exercise, delivered by physiotherapists, and pain coping skills training (PCST), normally delivered by psychologists, can help reduce the symptoms and impact of persistent knee pain. Access to specialised health professionals is not always available, however. Usual care, especially to those living in remote areas, often involves hand-out educational information alone. In a time of advancing technology and increasing access to the internet, remotely delivered internet-based treatment approaches, may provide novel alternatives for healthcare delivery of exercise and PCST. 

This study will evaluate whether a physiotherapy-guided home exercise program, delivered via the internet, combined with an online PCST program (PainCOACH) is more effective in improving pain and function than a control intervention (on-line provision of educational material alone).
