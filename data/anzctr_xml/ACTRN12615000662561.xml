  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Physiotherapist led, structured physical exercise (PE) intervention consisting of a circuit of exercises targeting strength, balance and endurance for up to 5 participants + usual care for a 12 week period. The PE intervention will consist of exercises in sitting and/or standing, dependent on the individual's capabilities. Suitable exercises will be individualised and determined by physiotherapist leading the PE intervention.

Arm 1: PE intervention delivered for 45 minutes x 1 times per week plus usual care for 30 minutes x 4 times per week (weekly total duration 165 minutes) for 12 weeks

Arm 2: PE intervention delivered for 15 minutes x 3 times per week plus usual care 30 minutes x 4 times per week (weekly total duration 165 minutes) for 12 weeks</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator/ control: Usual care of non-specialist recreational physical activities undertaken at the nursing home where the participants live such as, seated exercise classes, carpet bowls and bingo for up to 50 participants. 

Usual care: 30 minutes x 4 times per week (weekly total duration 120 minutes) </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A power calculation was completed that determined between 8 and 63 participants were required to show statistically significant differences between the groups. However, due to the discrepancy it was decided Cohen's effect size estimations would be used to determine the sample size instead. To show a large effect size (80% power) 26 participants were required in each group (78 participants in total). The type 1 error rate was set at 5%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical exercises are well established as having a wide range of physical and psychological health and well-being benefits for individuals, including older individuals. However, less is known about the effects of PE interventions for individuals with dementia, specifically in nursing homes.

The aim of this PhD study is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a physiotherapist-led PE intervention for individuals living with a dementia in nursing homes in Adelaide.

The primary outcome will be a measure of agitation levels using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory, and the secondary outcomes will be physical performance (timed up and go test, six meter walk test, five time sit to stand test, (modified) functional reach test, timed static pedalling and number of falls) and interviews with family and staff. </summary>
