  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this project is to define the role of neuropeptides and gut hormones in the regulation of adipose and bone metabolism in patients undergoing massive weight loss.

Each patient will attend 6 study visits: at baseline 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24months

The following tests will be carried out during the study: 

Height, weight and waist measurements: these will be measured at each study visit.

Blood Collection at each visit: for biochemistry including urea, creatinine, electrolytes (UEC), full blood count (FBC), liver function tests (LFT), HbA1c in patients with DM, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL  and triglycerides, fasting BSL and insulin, mineral and vitamin levels relevant to this study as well as gut hormones:  peptide YY, measuring both full length (PYY 1-36)  and the fragment (PYY 3-36), ghrelin, glucagon like peptide (GLP-1), leptin as well as adiponectin.For the surgical subjects, screening prior to the study will be done to exclude abnormal hormonal status such as hypercortisolaemia, hypogonadism and thyroid dysfunction.   

Meal studies at visits: 0 and 12 months to assess postprandial response of gut hormones 

Bone and calcium markers:  at baseline, 3, 6, 12 months and 24 months calcium balance will be assessed by 24-hour urine calcium collections.  Calcium, phosphate, albumin, intact parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D as well as markers of bone formation (serum osteocalcin) and bone resorption (urinary N telopeptide (NTx) will be measured at these time points.

Bone mineral densitometry scan (BMD DXA): at visits: 0, 12 months and 2 years  to assess BMD and body composition
Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT): at visits: 0, 12 months and 2 years  to assess BMD and abdominal fat mass

3 day food diary analysis with nutrient assessments at each visit.

Questionnaires including:
The Satiety Assessment Questionnaire 
The Physical Activity Questionnaire (3-day recall, once a month) 

Calcium and vitamin D supplements will be recommended to all subjects to aim for total calcium intake from diet and supplements&gt; 1000mg a day and 25(OH) vitamin D level&gt;75nM.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Obese subjects undergoing intense diet and lifestyle changes represent an active control group for this study. For non-surgery patients overall dietary intervention will be based on individualized calorie goal (1000-1500 calories/day) determined from the patients baseline body weight. The fat intake will be restricted to 20% calories. This ideally should be achieved with optifast meal replacements.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will directly compare changes in bone mass caused by intense medical treatment for obesity and by three different types of weight loss surgery (gastric banding, gastric sleeve and gastric bypass). 

The aim is to determine the future risk of bone loss and osteoporosis in patients who lose a large amount of weight after the weight loss surgery and through intense dieting. 

As surgery has been increasingly used for treatment of obesity, there is growing evidence that these procedures may result in bone abnormalities. 

This project will examine if hormonal changes related to surgery have an effect on the human skeleton, particularly on thickness or strength of bones. In addition, it may explain whether changes hormones (peptide YY, ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide1) are responsible for the bone mass loss, which is experienced after these procedures, independently of weight loss. 

This study will also investigate if the weight loss and rapid improvement in diabetes control observed after gastric bypass surgery are driven by the changes in hormones such as leptin and peptide YY.
	
Importantly, our study will pave the way for development of diagnostic test, which will predict if the prospective patient will benefit (or not) from the different forms of weight loss surgery.
