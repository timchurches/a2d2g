  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of SMOFlipid 20% in comparison
      to a standard lipid emulsion Intralipid 20% in patients requiring long-term parenteral
      nutrition. The safety and tolerance will be evaluated by biochemistry, hematology and
      coagulation variables, vital signs and adverse events. Further objectives to evaluate are the
      influence of SMOFlipid 20% on inflammation processes, the efficacy of anti-oxidative
      properties of vitamin E supplemented to SMOFlipid 20%, and the fatty acid pattern in red
      blood cells and serum.</summary>
