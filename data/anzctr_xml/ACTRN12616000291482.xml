  <interventions>
    <interventions>The uptake of 10 g lactulose and 5 g mannitol incorporated into (a) 50 g of uncooked extruded pasta pellets (mean diameter: 3.18 millmetre ) made of maize flour (b) 50 g of uncooked hydrated (1:2 w/w in water) powdered pasta pellets  and  (c) a control consisting of 50 ml of the two probe sugars dissolved in water. All of these interventions were mixed with 150 g of 'fruit sauce' containing 0.1 % Guar gum (Grindsted (Registered Trademark), DaniscoPvt Ltd, Australia), 0.3 % Xanthan (80 Mesh, ISXANT8.1, IngredientStop) and 0.02 % vanilla flavouring (Batch 181110, Zymus) and a standard volume of water. Lactulose and mannitol was determined by measuring their excretion in urine by high performace liquid chromatography (HPLC).  
These foods each were fed to 22 healthy female participants (screened by questionnaire) in random sequence at weekly intervals. The subjects were asked to empty their bladder every half-hour over a six hour period. Venous blood was collected every half-hour over four hours and thereafter at five and six hours for plasma blood glucose and plasma insulin determination. Comparisons of the temporal pattern of absorption of each of the two probe sugars sugar and the blood glucose values for six hours after consumption of each food with that of the control will provide an indication of the effect of processing on the rates of absorption of nutrients from the gut lumen.</interventions>
    <comparator>The temporal patterns of absorption of lactulose and mannitol will be determined after consumption of either of the following foods that contain 10 g lactulose and 5 g mannitol incorporated into them (50 g of uncooked extruded pasta pellets &lt; 1 m made of maize flour, (b) 50 g of uncooked hydrated (1:2 w/w in water) powdered pasta pellets and  (c) a control consisting of 50 ml of the two probe sugars dissolved in water. </comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quantification of nutrient uptake index (NUI) which represents the speed at which simple sugars are liberated from the food matrix into the lumen of the small intestine and absorbed by the mucosa. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Urine samples were collected from subjects every half-hour over a six hour period. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A composite secondary outcome was to compare the rates of appearance of glucose and insulin in the systemic circulation with the rate of absorption of mannitol and lactulose to better quantify the differences in kinetics of active absorption from those of passive absorption
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Along with urine samples, venous blood was collected from an indwelling cannula every half-hour over four hours and then at five and six hours respectively. The temporal pattern of absorption of each of the two probe sugars and the plasma blood glucose and plasma insulin values for six hours after consumption of each food and after the control will be compared.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Female volunteers between the age of 20 and 40 years were screened by questionnaire for general medical health, gut health, ongoing consumption of medication, dietary supplements, dietary peculiarities and smoking. Inclusion criteria is as follows: (1) Participants were non-smokers with no history of gastrointestinal diseases including recent gut infection evidenced by a recent history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, passage of blood and mucus in stools. (2) Participants were not taking any ongoing prescription or OTC medication or multivitamins except for contraceptive pills. (3) The number of Standard alcohol drinks consumed per week were calculated from results of alcohol consumption in the questionnaire to ensure that participants did not exceed a moderate alcohol intake. (4) Participants did not have high levels of endogenously produced mannitol or lactulose in the urine.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants were screened by a Health Questionnaire (attached) to determine participation in the study. Volunteers who were excluded are: Those that had high levels of endogenously produced mannitol or lactulose in the urine, smokers, exceeded the intake of one standard alcohol drink per day, had a history of gastrointestinal diseases including recent gut infection evidenced by a recent history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, passage of blood and mucus in stools, had a history of or current urinary tract infections, vaginal conditions that cause discharge, took ongoing prescription medication, antibiotics, OTC medication or multivitamins, took prebiotic and probiotic supplements such as lactulose. </exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed. All subjects were screened by health questionnaire to exclude those with a personal or strong family history of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders or recent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, passage of blood and mucus in stools. Similarly smokers, those with an intake of alcohol in excess of one standard drink per day and those taking regular prescription or over the counter medications (OTC), consuming vitamins, prebiotics or probiotic supplements such as lactulose were excluded. Subjects were also asked to refrain from taking any NSAIDs for at least a week prior to the test, to refrain from consuming alcohol for three days prior to the test and to avoid exercise on the day before and the morning of the test. All subjects were reviewed by a clinician to validate their medical history and their responses to the questionnaire before they were admitted to the study. Each participant received each of the three treatments in a randomized sequence at weekly intervals. The order of the treatments was randomized based on a computer generated sequence and was blinded to the subjects.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>No data was available regarding absorption of mannitol or lactulose from pasta pellets or powder. Hence meaningful test of statistical power were not available and the number of subjects was chosen based on previous studies conducted by us using the lactulose mannitol solution that have used a similar sample size and obtained statistically significant results. Differences between interventions was assessed by using parametric multivariate analysis of variance  </statisticalmethods>
