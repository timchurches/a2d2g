  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Desflurane is a widely used inhalational anesthetic. It allows for rapid anesthesia induction, rapid recovery of consciousness, and for the recovery of the general motor function. Its shortcomings are that it causes airway irritation, and increases cerebral blood flow (CBF), and in intracranial pressure (ICP). Furthermore, when a high concentration is administered, it stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. 
Remifentanil is a synthetic opioid that is a specific Âµ-receptor agonist.
When used together with desflurane, remifentanil is considered to be able to make up for the limitations of desflurane and reduce MAC of the anesthetic vapor when maintaining anesthesia.
The goals of this study were to determine the effects of a target-controlled concentration of remifentanil combined with desflurane for decreasing end-tidal concentration of desflurane.</summary>
