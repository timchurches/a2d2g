  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 2 has a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single cohort design. This part of the study will enroll 12 subjects in a single Dose Cohort (MRX-I Tablets 800 mg given once every 12 hours or placebo). Subjects will be screened and then randomized to study drug (active MRX-I or placebo) within this single Dose Cohort. Equal numbers of males and females will be randomized to either active or placebo study drug: 10 active MRX-I (5 M:5 F) and 2 placebo (1 M:1 F).  Subjects will be treated for 14 days.  Subjects will be confined in a Clinical Research Unit during the dosing periods and will be monitored to ensure compliance with dosing.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability as assessed through the determination and recording of the occurrence of AEs as well as by adverse changes in vital signs, ECG (e.g. QTc interval) parameters, and laboratory data. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetics of MRX-I as assessed through blood and urine collection during the study</outcome>
      <timepoint>Part 2: On Day 1, obtain blood for PK analyses immediately prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 24 hours after the first administration study drug; obtain the 24-hour sample prior to the second administration of study drug on Day 2. On Day 5 and Day 6, obtain blood for PK analyses immediately prior to the first administration of study drug for that day.  On Day 14, obtain blood for PK analyses immediately prior to the final administration of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after the final administration of study drug.  On Day 1, obtain urine for PK analysis immediately prior to the first administration of study drug and at 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, and 12-24 hours after the first administration of study drug; obtain the 12-24 hour sample prior to the second administration of study drug on Day 2. On Day 14, obtain urine for PK analysis immediately prior to the final administration of study drug and at 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, and 24-36 hours after the final administration of study drug.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study on healthy volunteers is to determine the safety and tolerability of MRX-I, an orally administered antibiotic.  There will be three Parts to the study.  Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single dose administrations of MRX-I compared with placebo.  Part 2 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a 14 day administration of MRX-I compared with placebo. Part 3 will compare the safety and tolerability of a 28 day administration of MRX-I with linezolid an active comparator. (please refer to ACTRN12613001206718)</summary>
