    <interventions>This is a prospective study examining the safety and performance of using neural stimulation incorporating feedback to treat patients with chronic pain. Patients will be diagnosed with chronic pain. All patients will be candidates for stimulation and be scheduled to undergo implantation of a trial lead followed by a trial evaluation. Up to 110 patients will be enrolled (trialled). The assessment of performance against the criterion will be performed at visit 1 (1 month post implant), safety will be assessed by analysis of AEs throughout the study period. The performance criterion defined by the sponsor is based upon successful delivery of neuromodulation in feedback mode in 80% of implanted patients (i.e. patients who have successfully passed the trial phase and proceed to surgery for the fully implanted system).  
After eligible patients have signed informed consent and baseline data will be collected. They will be enrolled in the study when they undergo implantation of trial stimulation leads. This procedure, performed by pain specialist, will be followed by a trial of stimulation (7- 10 days period) using the EvokeTM External Closed Loop Stimulator (eCLS). During this period various parameters will be tested and ECAPSs will be recorded. Feedback will be assessed and may be used. Patients who have had a successful trial, success is determined by a 40% reduction in pain using the visual analogue scale, will then be implanted with the EvokeTM Closed Loop Stimulator (CLS). 
Patients will return to the clinic for evaluations 1 month + 7 days, 3 months + 14 days, 6 months + 14 days, 12 months + 21 days, 15 months + 28 days, 18 months + 28 days, 21 months + 28 days, and 24 months + 28 days post implantation. Evaluations will include measures of pain, functional disability, quality of life, patient satisfaction and paresthesia characteristics. All adverse events will be recorded. Patients may be asked to have their evaluations videotaped. This will involve the patient signing an additional consent.
At the end of the study, patient may be able to continue Spinal Cord Stimulation with his implanted device if it is found to be of benefit to him in treating his pain. This decision will be made in consultation between patient and his treating doctor. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Programmability in feedback controlled stimulation mode is defined as the systems ability to automatically adjust stimulation output to maintain a desired ECAP setting determined by the FCE/coordinator or clinician with the subject. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Data will be collected at the trial assessment and following the permanent implant on follow-up visits. follow-up visits will be after one, three, six, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty one and twenty four months after permanent implant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All reported adverse events.
The adverse event can be any change, undesired, noxious or
pathological in a patient or participant illustrated by signs, symptoms
and /or laboratory changes that occur during a clinical trial, whether or
not considered drug/treatment related.
If adverse experiences occur, the first concern will be the safety of the
patient. Appropriate medical intervention will be made. Any device
related adverse experiences or complications observed by the
investigator or reported by the patients will be recorded in the
appropriate section of the patient's case report forms in accordance with NSW Health GL2010_014</outcome>

      <outcome>Oswestry Disability Index: The Oswestry Disability Index contains topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the subject's life relating to the topic. The subject then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement being 5 indicating most severe disability. The final score ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is equated with no disability and 100 corresponds to maximum disability.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The performance criterion defined by the sponsor is based upon successful delivery of neuromodulation in feedback mode in 80% of implanted patients (i.e. patients who have successfully passed the trial phase and proceed to surgery for the fully implanted system).  

In order to demonstrate statistically that this threshold is achieved in this study, a non-inferiority test will be conducted utilizing a non-inferiority margin of 10%. Therefore, the following hypothesis statements will be employed:
 
H0: P= 0.80-d
H1: P&gt;0.8- d; where d=0.10
 
It is anticipated that the true success rate associated with feedback capture is at least 90%.  In order to have 85% power to determine that an observed rate of 90% can be considered non-inferior to the target of 80%, with a d=10%, a minimum of 28 subjects are required.  This calculation assumes a 1-sided significance level of 0.05 and is based on an exact testing methodology. 

This statistical test will be conducted on data from visit 1 (1-month post implantation of the permanent system), no assumptions will be made for missing data but we will include a conservative 15% attrition rate to ensure enough data samples are captured. As such up to 32 subjects who receive the fully implanted system will be required.  

Secondary Endpoints and Baseline Measures
The subject demographics, diagnosis and previous treatments  will be tabulated and descriptive statistics will be estimated. These include means (or medians) and standard deviations (or inter-quartile ranges) for continuous or ordinal variables and proportions for categorical variables. Questionnaire instruments will be analysed consistent with their validated methodology but at a minimum will include complete summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals. 
Exploratory subgroup analyses will be conducted to determine if there exist relationships suggestive of enhanced effectiveness. Such findings will be used to generate hypotheses for future studies In addition, a number of multivariate techniques may be employed to address the impact of baseline covariates on score over time including repeated measures analysis and general estimating equations (GEE).

    <summary>The primary objective of this study is demonstrating the performance and safety of EvokeTM spinal cord stimulation with feedback control on neural stimulation in patients with chronic pain with regard to pain relief and stimulation side effects.
A new technique has been developed to measure Evoked Compound
Action Potentials (ECAPs) or neural responses to neural stimulation, on the
same lead that delivers the stimulation.
This research will help advance neurostimulation technology.</summary>
