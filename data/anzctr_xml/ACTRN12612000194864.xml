  <interventions>
    <interventions>Four modules will be delivered as 2 hour group sessions, one a week over four weeks, in the NICU by psychology graduates that have completed Triple P facilitator training. Session 1 includes explaining positive parenting, understanding a baby's behaviour and development, goal setting, and developing a positive relationship with your baby. Session 2 includes strategies for teaching new skills and behaviour, responding to your baby and managing crying and sleeping. Session 3 includes parenting traps, unpleasant emotions and how these affect parenting, coping strategies, and changes a baby brings to your life. Session 4 discusses partner support, including partner traps, communication, changes to your relationship, planning partner activities and dividing chores. A parent workbook accompanies the program and is given to parents for use with exercises and as a reference. Between sessions, parents complete homework tasks to consolidate learning. After hospital discharge, 4x30-min telephone consultations are conducted at 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks corrected age (ca) with the family in their community by the trained Triple P facilitator who conducted the initial NICU-based sessions. The telephone sessions provide additional support to parents as they put into practice what has been learnt and the facilitator will assist parents in setting and reviewing parenting goals. This is followed by a facilitated transition to community based Triple P services with interventions continuing until the infants are 2 years of age using the established Triple P providers and with parents able to access all Triple P services available in their community including seminars, groups and enhanced individual support if required. Triple P has a range of community programs which include tailored variants and flexible delivery modes, to target different groups of high risk or vulnerable parents. The programs have a variety of outcomes including improved parent-child relationships, reduced child behaviour problems, reduced depression, stress and anxiety, decreased dysfunctional parenting and personal distress, and increased levels of self-efficacy, work commitment and work satisfaction. Prem Baby Triple P features different content to the community Triple P as it focuses on babies, particularly those born premature. The community component will be linked seamlessly to the neonatal component. Families transferred early to regional hospitals will be able to complete all modules of the neonatal aspect of the program through watching a DVD at home with follow-up telephone consultations with providers at Royal Brisbane &amp; Women's Hospital and Mater Mothers' Hospital. Intervention group participants will also receive Triple P tip-sheets every 3 months up until 24 months corrected age and fortnightly text messages reiterating program content.</interventions>
    <comparator>Infants randomly assigned to the Care as usual control group will receive standard follow-up after discharge which does not involve a structured preterm parenting program. It does include the standard medical and nursing care, resusitation instruction and discharge information that all families routinely receive. Exposure to any structured parenting programs will be measured at 2 years by parental recall.  Prem Baby Triple P is not available outside this RCT. Baby Triple P is not yet available in the community.</comparator>

    <concealment>Allocation was concealed as the research nurse who determined if the subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, as to which group the subject would be allocated to. Group allocation was contained in opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Infants will be assessed for eligibility and their parents approached as soon as their infant is clinically stable. Stratification will be for risk of brain injury on routine cranial ultrasound into (i) normal (NAD) or IVH grade 1 or IVH grade 2 (ii) IVH grade 3 or IVH grade 4 or PVL.  Once the participants have been stratified, they complete baseline measures, then are randomised into the control or intervention group. Multiple births will be assigned to the same group.Randomisation will occur using a computer generated sequence that has been created off-site. A research student not associated with this study will create and seal the opaque randomisation envelopes. These envelopes will be opened in front of the participant after randomisation by the research nurse who is blind to the group allocation concealed in the envelope.</sequence>
