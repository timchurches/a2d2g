  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete one of the three interventions described below.

The internet-delivered Mindfulness-Enhanced Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Program comprises 6 lessons completed over 14 weeks. It includes all treatment components typically seen in face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as well as a number of formal and informal mindfulness exercises (including guided mindfulness meditations (provided on a CD) and written instruction for using mindfulness in daily life). One lesson will be completed every 7-14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons). Each lesson will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, for each lesson. Clinician guidance will be provided in the form of email and/or phone contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist) after completion of the first two lessons, then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email.

Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Treatment as Usual Control Group/usual care control group (TAU) will receive care as usual for a 14 week period until the treatment groups have completed their intervention. Usual care refers to any treatments the participant would typically receive (e.g., counselling, psychology sessions). That is. the TAU group will not be restricted from receiving any treatments during the waiting period. At that time (14 weeks), the TAU group will be offered the opportunity to take part in the Mindfulness-Enhanced CBT program. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A pre-to-post-treatment improvement of effect size (ES) 1.0 is expected for the CBT and Mindfulness-based CBT treatment groups on the primary depression and anxiety measures. A between-groups effect size greater than 0.6 is expected between the intervention groups and the usual care control group. 


All analyses will be undertaken using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) ANOVA with measurement occasion as a within-groups factor and intervention as a between-groups factor. Relationships between observations at different occasions will be modelled with an unstructured covariance matrix. For each experimental group, planned contrasts will be used to compare changes from baseline to post-test and 3 month follow-up. At each measurement occasion, participants will be asked whether they are currently undertaking any adjunctive treatment for their depression, and this variable will be included as a covariate in the regression models.
How number of participants needed to achieve study objectives was determined: 50  subjects in each cell had an 80% power to detect a significance p&lt; 0.5 if the difference between the treatment groups and the usual care control group of 1.0, and of a 0.6 ES difference between ME-iCBT and iCBT.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to compare the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of three internet-delivered programs for adults with depression and/or anxiety symptoms: an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy  program versus an internet-delivered mindfulness-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy program versus mindfulness skills training program, compared to usual care. 

Up to 200 people with elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups or the treatment as usual control group (TAU). All groups will commence their intervention immediately, except for the TAU group who will receive the mindfulness-enhanced iCBT program after the 14 week waiting period.

The efficacy of the three programs will be compared at post-treatment (immediately after the treatment period finishes) and 3-month follow-up by comparing their symptoms of depression, anxiety and distress. </summary>
