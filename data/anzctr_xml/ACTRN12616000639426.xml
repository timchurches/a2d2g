  <interventions>
    <interventions>Breast Cancer e-Support (BCS) program is a mobile application program. The participants in the intervention group need to scan the two-dimension code in the website of http://breastesupport.xmu.edu.cn/ and download the APP. It has a fixed structure that cover four cycles of chemotherapy, which is about 12 weeks. Banduras self-efficacy theory and the social exchange theory were used to guide the development of BCS. BCS has four modules: 1) Learning centre; 2) Discussion forum; 3) Ask-The-Expert; 4) Personal stories. These four modules are visually recognizable on the homepage of BCS. It is up to women how often and how long they make use of the intervention.

In the Learning centre part, 12 topics related to symptom management and library will be provided in this part. 12 topics with learning materials will include: 1) nausea and vomit management; 2) improving diet by making healthier food choice; 3) choosing appropriate exercise; 4) stress management via relaxation training; 5) weight management; 6) how to deal with body changes; 7) fatigue management; 8) sleep management; 9) alopecia management; 10) improving communication with health care providers; 11) processing and communicating emotional experiences to people inside of ones existing network; and 12) How to deal with negative emotions. To create the 12 topics, detailed discussion with multidisciplinary Chinese oncology professionals were carried out. Women will be encouraged to go through a topic and practice the corresponding strategies each week. All the learning materials are geared towards skills building on symptom self-management. The library will provide basic information about symptoms, diagnosis, stages, treatment options, community support service, and answers to frequently asked questions. There will also be links to reliable cancer websites. 

The discussion forum is where social networking occurs. Women will be encouraged to provide feedback and encouragement to each other. They will be invited to discuss the topics in the learning material. The discussion will be moderated by a qualified healthcare professional. She will provide encouragement and suggestions to women regarding their progress on symptom management. Women will be encouraged to post message to the discussion forum any time. They can ask questions and discuss topics with a safe environment. They can share information and experience, ask questions, offer insight into their own personal situations, and share hopes and fears. 

The Ask-The-Expert service provides women with the opportunity to anonymously ask health related questions by email at any time. Healthcare professionals (one doctor and one head nurse in the studying hospitals) will provide response to the question within 48 hours. Only the health care professionals and senders have access to the questions and the responses.

In the personal stories part, Five recorded interviews with women who completed chemotherapy after breast cancer diagnosis and surgery will be available in this part. Women who have different breast cancer stage, ages, and socio-economic status will be interviewed and recorded in these videos to provide role model for women with different background. women will be encouraged to post their feedback and share their feelings after watching the videos. 

All the modules aim to enhance womens self-efficacy, social support, and symptom management. Mastery experiences include the discussion of symptom management related to chemotherapy in the learning centre. Vicarious experiences involve reading others personal stories and share their own stories. Verbal persuasion includes feedback and verbal cues from peers and healthcare professionals in the Discussion forum and Ask-The-Expert. Arousal state includes the learning materials and sharing experience that expect symptom which might occur during chemotherapy and the management strategies. In addition, Discussion forum and Ask-The-Expert are designed to build womens social network, thus women can obtain structural support and functional support from peer and healthcare professionals. 

Fidelity of the intervention
It is important to maintain the fidelity of the intervention to enhance the internal and external validity of the program. Different strategies will be used to enhance the fidelity of BCS such as maintain the consistency in the delivery of the intervention and monitoring and reinforcing womens compliance with the intervention.

To maintain the consistency in the delivery of the intervention, the same researcher (ZJM) will organize the topics, give feedback and verbal cues in the Discussion forum in the program. The moderator (ZJM) will also moderate the online forum by reading all messages each day, facilitating online discussion, providing expert information when requested, and intervening appropriately if message posted is inappropriate or hostile. The researcher is a PhD nursing student who is familiar with the knowledge of breast cancer and chemotherapy. To encourage women to comply with the intervention, the benefits of BCS such as their questions being answered by healthcare professionals within 48 hours will be emphasized to women. 

To assess the intervention adherence, the website contains tracking system. The researchers could monitor who access to BCS, how often, the modules that they access in and how long they spend their time in each module. The internet usage data such as frequency and duration of logins, website activity of each module of BCS will be recorded and evaluated 

</interventions>
    <comparator>Women in the control groups will receive routine care provided by the hospital. The routine care involves support by nurses and doctors while they stay for two days in the hospital during each cycle of chemotherapy. As usual, the nurse will provide information on chemotherapy and side effects before women start treatment. There are currently no BCS for education and social support provided by healthcare services in the studying sites. The control group may freely use internet to search information about breast cancer. They do not have access to the BCS intervention which need authorization from the main investigator to log in the APP. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination
The primary outcome of self-efficacy is used to estimate effect size basing on power analysis (Cohen, 1992). Previous study on IIPs for women with breast cancer measured QoL, social support, and health competence and reported medium effect size (0.46), but the effect size of self-efficacy was not mentioned (Gustafson et al., 2008). Previous research on psychoeducation to enhance self-efficacy on Chinese patients with colorectal cancer (Zhang et al., 2014) demonstrated medium effect size of self-efficacy as 0.60. We estimated 20% attrition rate, based on the dropout rate of 10-15% in previous studies on internet-based interactive programs (Gustafson et al., 2008; Loiselle, Edgar, Batist, Lu, &amp; Lauzier, 2010). To achieve a power of 0.80 at 0.05 level of significance, a minimum of 106 women (53 in each group) are required for this study.

Data analysis
All outcome measures will be analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp, 2013). Intention-to treat analysis will be adopted to manage missing data. The baseline differences between the interventional and control groups will be assessed with the Chi-square (?2) test for the binary demographic data and the independent sample t-test for continuous variable. Adjusted for the possible confounding factors of demographic variables, the repeated measures triply MANCOVA will be conducted to determine whether the BCS intervention is effective in improving self-efficacy, social support, QoL and reducing symptom distress, and anxiety and depression across three time points of data collection (Baseline, immediately and 12 weeks after intervention). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The major objectives of this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to evaluate the effectiveness of a BCS program (Mobile Application) in improving self-efficacy, social support, and QoL, reducing symptom distress, and decreasing anxiety and depression for Chinese women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. It is hypothesized that when compared with the control group, women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in the experimental group will have statistically significant:
1.	improved self-efficacy, social support, QoL, as well as significantly reduced symptom distress, anxiety and depression (baseline, post-test 1, and post-test 2), 
2.	higher satisfaction level towards health care during chemotherapy.
