  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will take part in six, 60-minute sessions of cognitive-reminiscence therapy. These sessions will be administered one-to-one and face-to-face by a psychologist, and held once weekly over a period of six weeks. This intervention is aimed at building skills in better understanding the self, others, and the world, and to improve problem-solving when faced with challenges. In this approach individuals learn cognitive reappraisal and problem-solving techniques to rationally and adaptively recall and reframe memories of themselves, others, and the world. Past experiences are discussed with a focus on remembering positive memories, and reframing and reinterpreting negative experiences. Continuity between ones past and present is highlighted with a focus on rediscovering or rebuilding a sense of meaning in life. Active problem-solving strategies are also discussed in the context of individuals own personal experiences, and used to enhance self-efficacy, self-esteem, and coping. Individuals are taught to see their current difficulties in the context of past difficulties and apply this understanding to more adaptively cope with life stressors.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by the intake team at the participating youth mental health service during
intake assessments, on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion critieria. Once identified on this
basis, their suitability for inclusion in the project will be assessed more comprehensively by the clinical team
at the service. Once participants have been identified as suitable for recruitment, the individual will be offered participation from a case worker at the service and permission will be sought for a member of the research team to contact them. Once participants have agreed to participate and informed consent has been obtained, they will be randomised to either the intervention or treatment-as-usual condition.</concealment>
    <sequence>Once participants consent to participate they will be randomised by a third-party (not a member of the research team or youth mental health service) using a biased-coin approach with computer software. This bias-coin method will be used to preserve balance in groups due the small anticipated sample size.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although cognitive-reminiscence approaches to the treatment of depressive symptoms have been shown to
be highly effective in older adults, to date no studies have determined its efficacy with younger adults. The current study aims to trial a manualised and validated cognitive-reminiscence intervention for depressive symptomatology with young adults. This intervention utilises both cognitive and problem-solving therapy frameworks within a reminiscence-based approach. Individuals systematically review various events, circumstances, and turning-points in their lives while learning adaptive techniques for appraising and interpreting themselves, others, and the world, and applying these techniques to present-day issues. Individuals over the age of 18 who present at a community youth mental health services in Melbourne with elevated depressive symptoms will be recruited and randomised to either six sessions of individual cognitive-reminiscence intervention or treatment as usual. Outcomes in both groups will be assessed by measuring depressive symptomatology, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and meaning in life at baseline, three
weeks, six weeks, and one and three month post-treatment. The intervention is predicted to lead to significant reductions in depressive symptomatology.</summary>
