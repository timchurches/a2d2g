    <studytitle>Reliability and validity of the Acute Care Index of Function tool in critical care patients.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In a homogeneous group of critical care patients in a tertiary intensive care unit, does the Acute Care Index of Function tool, as used by physiotherapists, have adequate inter-rater reliability and validity?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have been in intensive care for 3 or more days will undergo usual daily assessment and treatment by the physiotherapists. Each day from Day 3 onwards (until ICU discharge), the treating physiotherapist will complete the Acute Care Index of Function tool to obtain a numerical score of overall function. Completion of the assessment tool will take less than 5 minutes, presuming the physiotherapist undertook a comprehensive functional assessment as part of the patient's routine care.This ACIF score will be stored electronically.</interventions>
    <comparator>A second physiotherapist will also complete an Acute Care Index of Function assessment, independently of the first assessor, using a paper-based format. 
The ICU Mobility Scale (IMS) will also be recorded daily after Day 3 of admission, to allow validation against an established functional measure.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Correlation coefficients (Pearsons) will be calculated between ACIF scores of 2 independent physiotherapy assessors.
Correlation coefficients (Pearsons) will also be calculated between ACIF and IMS scores.
Sub group analysis may be performed based on experience of the assessors involved.
Based on previous reliability studies of ACIF in neurological patients, and the recent reliability study of the IMS (Hodgson et al 2014), we calculated that a sample size of 100 patient assessments would be sufficient to demonstrate adequate inter-rater reliability and validity with reference to the IMS.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to test whether the Acute Care Index of Function tool, a measure of global function used by Physiotherapists, has adequate reliability between therapists to be useful as an outcome measure in critically ill patients. This tool has been found to be reliable and valid in acute neurological patients but has not yet been tested in a heterogeneous critically ill population. This study will also test the validity of the ACIF by comparing it to the ICU Mobility Scale (IMS) which has been found to have adequate reliability and validity in critically ill patients.</summary>
