  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised controlled single centre trial where surgeons will be asked to wear a clear plastic visor, in addition to protective clothing normally used during surgery. Surgeons performing open abdominal surgery at University Hospital Geelong will be asked to participate. Participation in this research will not affect the choice of procedure or care provided to patients. No samples will be collected at any time during this study. Surgeons will be randomly allocated either to use Alexis retractor or not to use it during their operations. Blood spatter caught on the surgeons visor will be quantified after surgical procedures involving the abdomen. Clear plastic visors will be examined on a black background. Macroscopic blood spatter will be graded by size and count, and whether the blood is dripping or not. Microscopic blood spatter will be counted. Counted blood droplets will be marked with a black marker to prevent double-counting. Results will then be compared for surgeries in which the Alexis Wound Retractor was used compared to those during which this instrument was not used. Surgeons participating in the study will be allowed to insert and remove the Alexis retractor in their usual method with no restriction to the style of insertion or time taken to remove it. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Does the Alexis Wound Retractor increase the risk of conjunctival contamination from blood splashes during surgery?

Background: Blood splashes to the face/ eyes are a recognised risk to the surgeon and assistants

Alexis retractor 
is commonly used during laparotomy, laparoscopic operations and caesareans
Increase exposure, protect wound, reduce wound infection

Concern: blood droplets spraying into the air/ face/ eyes during removal

Aim: Assess whether there is an increased risk of blood splashes during operations when the Alexis retractor is used

Design: Double blinded randomised trial including all abdominal operations in which Alexis retractor may be used
Surgeons and assistants will wear visors
Randomised to Alexis or no Alexis
End point: number of blood splashes on visors
Power calculations 44 in each group 
Aim to recruit 50 in each group
