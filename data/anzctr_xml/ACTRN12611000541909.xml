  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is comparing three different treatment conditions.

Arm 1: Cognitive Processing Therapy only.  CPT will follow the manual written by Resick, Monson, and Chard (2007). Therapy will be administered weekly, in a one on one setting (i.e., therapist and client).  Therapy will be conducted over 12 to 15 weekly sessions. Sessions will last between 60 and 90 minutes. Sessions one and two will introduce the concepts of PTSD and CPT and will involve the client writing an impact statement. The impact statement will allow the therapist and client to identify stuck points (i.e., problem areas in thinking).  During session three the client will be taught to identify and label their thoughts and feelings and the relationship amongst events, thoughts and emotions. During sessions four and five the client will generate and read their trauma account to the therapist. Through Socratic questioning the therapist will begin questioning self-blame and other distorted thoughts. The therapist will continue to work through stuck points during session six. Thus, sessions one through six will aim to teach the client to challenge their thoughts of the trauma and to identify problematic cognitions.  The following sessions will teach the client cognitive therapy skills and focus on topics that have been disrupted by the trauma. During session seven clients will use worksheets to develop and practice using more balanced self-statements.  Sessions eight through 12 will ask the client to focus on one theme each week (i.e., safety, trust, power, esteem, intimacy) and correct overgeneralised beliefs related to the theme.  Within session 11 the client will write another impact statement and this revised statement will be used in session 12 to evaluate gains made in treatment and where the client wishes to continue working.  During session 12 clients will also receive information related to relapse prevention. The core therapy protocol will consist of 12 weekly sessions. However, in order to increase the clinical validity of the protocol, up to 3 additional sessions will be offered if necessary to target any residual PTSD or depressive symptoms still present after 12 weeks of treatment. This is routine clinical practice in a community setting.

Arm 2: Behavioural Activation then Cognitive Processing Therapy. Therapy will be manualised. Therapy will be administered weekly, in a one on one setting (i.e., therapist and client). The treatment will be based on the Behavioural Activation intervention for depression (Martell, Addis, &amp; Jacobson, 2001), and CPT for PTSD (Resick, et al., 2007). Therapy will consist of 15 sessions lasting between 60 to 90 minutes each.  The first five sessions will be depression focussed and utilise Behavioural Activation techniques. The first five sessions will focus on the link between behaviour and mood and involve psychoeducation, activity monitoring, and mastery and pleasure tasks (Martell et al., 2001).  During session one clients will receive a treatment rationale along with information regarding PTSD and depression symptoms. During session two clients will discuss the cycle of depression and its relation to inactivity. Clients will be presented with a weekly activity scheduling task in which they must monitor what they do during the week and how these activities make them feel. This task aims to allow the client to become aware of their mood/anxiety levels, triggers and consequences.  During session three the activity monitoring task will be reviewed and the TRAP (trigger, response, avoidance, pattern) model discussed. The therapist will then explain the importance of scheduling pleasant events and the significance of elevating activity. The client will then be assigned a pleasant event scheduling task to complete during the following week. Through the use of role plays and worksheets session four and five will then aim to teach the ACTION model and demonstrate the importance of elevating pleasant activities in everyday life. The ACTION model contains the following components:

Assess how the behaviour serves you (what outcome/consequences do you expect when you decide not to go out with friends? Why do you choose to be alone? Scared to get hurt again/embarrassment, etc.)
Choose to either avoid or activate (what will be the outcome of you going out with friends? Distraction from negative thoughts, social support, etc.)
Try out the behaviour that has been chosen (or try out a new behaviour that you find might lead to a positive outcome)
Integrate any new behaviour into a routine (make those behaviours that make you feel good part of your daily life)
Observe the outcome (continue your detective work)
Never give up!

The remaining sessions will be trauma focussed. These sessions will incorporate exposure, and cognitive therapy with a focus on the themes of safety, trust, intimacy, power/control, and esteem (Resick, et al., 2007).  Session six will provide the client with information about PTSD symptoms and CPT. During session seven clients will write an impact statement. In session eight clients will identify thoughts and feelings and the connection between thoughts and feelings. During sessions nine and ten clients will work through their trauma accounts and stuck points will be identified. Sessions 11 and 12 will ask clients to further work through stuck points and patterns of problematic thinking.  Sessions 13 through 15 will then ask clients to work through themes of safety, trust, power, esteem, intimacy and correct overgeneralised beliefs related to the theme. Session 15 will also involve the provision of relapse prevention information.

Arm 3: Cognitive Processing Therapy than Behavioural Activation. Therapy will be administered weekly, in a one on one setting (i.e., therapist and client).  This condition will follow the same procedures as the Behavioural Activation then CPT condition but the CPT and Behavioural Activation components will be presented in the reverse order. That is, the first set of 10 sessions will be trauma focused and the next five sessions will utilise Behavioural Activation techniques.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be recruited from Yarrow Place Rape and Sexual Assault Clinic and a variety of other sources including University campuses, general practitioner offices, police stations, hospitals and victim support services.  

A proportion of participants will be recruited from Yarrow Place, a sexual assault counselling service in Adelaide.  Female adult sexual assault victims who meet the criteria for PTSD and major depression will be randomly allocated to receive CPT then behavioural activation, behavioural activation and then CPT or, CPT alone.  Randomisation will be stratified according to PTSD severity and age. Randomisation will be conducted by an individual external to the study and randomisation will occur using a randomisation table created by a computer. In this way personnel providing the treatment protocols will not be aware of group allocation ratios, nor will treatment allocation be influenced by the pre-treatment assessment. 

Participants will be recruited from the natural referral process that occurs at Yarrow Place.  When an individual makes contact with the service, potential participants who are seeking counselling for post traumatic stress disorder as a result of a sexual trauma and do not met obvious exclusion criteria, will be informed about their ability to be involved in the study by Yarrow Place staff.  If a participant expresses interest in the research study they will be given the researcher’s details so that they can learn more about the study.  Or alternatively, if the potential participants would prefer and if they give verbal consent to the Yarrow Place staff, they could be contacted by the researcher. Following this, a formal informed consent procedure will occur and an initial assessment will be booked. This will be the 3rd treatment trial the investigator has conducted in collaboration with Yarrow Place, thus we have good procedures in place in terms of such recruitment methods and liaising with Yarrow Place staff around recruitment issues. 

Further participants will be recruited from a number of sources including local hospitals, victim support centres, police departments, mental health centres, universities, and through advertisements in local newspapers and radio (as approved by the Flinders Clinical Research Ethics Committee). These participants may have experienced a wider range of traumas (i.e., not confined to sexual traumas).  These additional participants will be recruited via the following methods:

1. Relevant departments within Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) (e.g., Psychology, Psychiatry, Social Work) will be sent a letter informing them of the study. Accompanying the letter will be a copy of a handout with details of the study and how to contact the investigators which can be made available to potential participants by the FMC departments. 

2. Participants from other sources will be recruited through the use of the same letter/handout (e.g., GP’s, community noticeboards, police stations and victim services agencies). Approval will be sought from the relevant organisations if this is required before the advertisements are posted in waiting rooms etc.

3. FMC Website – Information regarding the study will be posted on the website.

4. Generic pamphlet – because the Investigator is currently conducting three treatment outcome studies, a generic pamphlet summarising the research treatment studies being undertaken by the Investigator’s Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Research Unit at Flinders University has been developed. Accordingly this pamphlet will also be used for recruitment at clinical services that see a range of clients that might fit criteria for any of these studies.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants are allocated to treatment condition based on block randomisation.  The randomisation spreadsheet is held by an individual unrelated to the study.  After participants complete their pre-treatment assessment, the individual is contacted and the participant’s condition is then disclosed.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a randomised design participants will be allocated to one of three conditions. Participants in the first condition will receive the standard CPT treatment. Those in the second condition will receive behavioural activation then CPT.  And those in the third condition will receive CPT then behavioural activation.  Given that research has not specifically examined the utility of using a combined treatment protocol for those with comorbid PTSD and MDD, the third condition will be added in an attempt to examine whether treatment presentation order makes a significant difference to treatment outcomes.  Participants will be assessed at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment and at a 6-month follow up. The project will use standardised self-report and structured clinical interview measures, and will use assessors blind to treatment condition at post- and follow-up assessments. 

It is predicted that:
1.Participants in all conditions will demonstrate a significant reduction in depression and PTSD symptoms. 
2.Participants in the combined treatment conditions (behavioural activation then CPT or, CPT then behavioural activation) will show a greater reduction in PTSD and depression symptoms compared to participants in the CPT condition. 
3. The relationship between depression symptoms and treatment outcomes (i.e., reduced PTSD and depression symptoms) will be mediated by emotional engagement.</summary>
