  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single 60 minute intraduodenal infusion at 4mL/min of
a) 0 kcal/min (saline control)
b) 1.5 kcal/min (Whey Protein Hydrolysate)
c) 3 kcal/min (Whey Protein Hydrolysate)
in 16 obese subjects

A single 60 minute intraduodenal infusion at 4mL/min of
a) 3 kcal/min (Whey Protein Hydrolysate)
in 16 lean subjects

Appetite sensation questionnaires in the form of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), blood samples.

A buffet meal will be provided at the end of the 60 minute infusion from which the volunteer has 30 minutes to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices white bread, 4 slices brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions mayonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and a 14g milky way bar.

Each obese volunteer will receive one of each infusion solution over three study days. Each study visit will be seperated by no less than 3 days.

Each lean volunteer will receive the 3kcal/min infusion,  requiring only 1 study visit.

Each study visit will last approximately 3-6 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both lean and obese volunteers will be deemed as controls for this study. 

Obese volunteers will act as their own control via administration of a single 0kcal/min intraduodenal infusion of saline solution, delivered at a rate of 4mL/min for 60 minutes, to enable comparison to nutrient containing infusions in obese volunteers.

Age-matched lean volunteers will act as a control via administration of a single 3kcal/min intraduodenal infusion of Whey Protein Hydrolysate, delivered at a rate of 4mL/min for 60 minutes, for direct comparison between response in lean and obese volunteers to the 3kcal/min infusion.</comparator>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A screening questionnaire and three factor eating questionnaire are answered by the volunteer, and a blood sample taken for determination of ferritin levels. Eligibility is determined based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A signed informed consent form is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit (obese volunteers only) using a randomisation table created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involves contacting the holder of the randomisation table (study assistant) to inform them of the subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution for infusion on each study day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been designed to investigate how the load of Whey Protein Hydolysate effects gut motility, gut hormones, and appetite sensations in obese individuals. Further, how response to a specific load of Whey Protein Hydolysate differs between obese and age-matched lean individuals will be investigated.

There is evidence that protein more potently suppresses appetite and energy intake than carbohydrate and fat, however, the mechanisms behind this are not clear, and many studies show variable results due to differences in methodology. 

Our team has developed an intraduodenal infusion protocol appropriate to characterise the effects of varying protein loads in lean individuals on antropyloroduodenal motility, hormone release, and energy intake. Evidence suggests that normal hormone release and motility responses are perturbed in obese individuals. 

Thus, this study aims to characterise the effects of protein loads on gut motility, gut hormones, appetite sensations, and subsequent energy intake in obese individuals. We hypothesise that protein will modulate these parameters in a load-dependent manner, however, obese subjects will be less sensitive to loads of protein infused into the duodenum, compared to a healthy lean population. 

The results of this study may aid food and pharmaceutical industries in identifying appropriate responses to aid body weight management.</summary>
