  <interventions>
    <interventions>Osteopathic manipulative treatment of C7-T1.
Administered only once from each side at the level T1, by a trained physiotherapist with with 11 years of experience and training in osteopathy in accordance with European standards of 1400 hours.

Description of intervention:

Position the patient: prone.
Position of the Therapist: standing, up to the patient's chest on the left side first and then the right.
 
Contacts:
A hand comes into contact with the thumb on the side of the spinous process of T1, by taking skin fold of the trapezius with the rest of the hand. The forearm is placed perpendicular to the spine.
The other hand on the temporary contact who has his head turned the opposite side to the hand that manipulates.

Parameters: we must put some extent, being careful not to lose double chin to protect the upper cervical. Then you rotate and set the head on the table.

Implementation: realization of thrust, direction from outside to inside, ballistic with short-range, with your thumb on the spine. And repeat on the other side.

Duration of intervention one minute both sides.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group subjects received a placebo technique, is to be placed in the same position with the same therapist contacts, the same time that its takes the true technique, but without manipulation, only with slight tension.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The forward head position is a common posture imbalance that causes a variety of musculoskeletal pathologies. There is evidence of the impact, we have reliable methods, noninvasive, in order to measure the position of the head relative to the cervical spine, there are also studies showing effective techniques to improve this imbalance of posture. But still many other techniques to be evaluated and one of them is studied in this research.</summary>
