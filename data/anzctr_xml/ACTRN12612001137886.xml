  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) Single treatment arm 
b) multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) prostate followed either by MRI prostate biopsy and ultrasound prostate biopsy; OR ultrasound prostate biopsy alone
Decision to perform MRI guided biopsy is based on MRI findings using PIRADS scoring system (Eur Radiol. 2012 Apr;22(4):746-57. Epub 2012 Feb 10.
) - PIRADS 1 and 2 scored MRI patients only have TRUS biopsy
 - patients with MRI scored 3,4 or 5 have both an MRI guided biopsy and TRUS biopsy
c) MRI prostate - 30min; MRI prostate biopsy 40 min; US biopsy of prostate - 15 min
d) Modes - MRI and ultrasound imaging of the prostate</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating a novel diagnostic technique for prostate cancer, known as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male who has been referred to a urologist with a high or concerning PSA (Prostate-specific antigen), or abnormal prostatic rectal examination. 

Trial details
All participants in this study will undergo current treatment guidelines for diagnosis of prostate cancer, including PSA measurements and 12 core Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided needle biopsies of the prostate. In addition, a highly specific imaging process, known as multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (multiparametric MRI or mpMRI), will be used to further assess the prostate gland and be used to take MRI guided biopsy of any MRI detected lesions. This examination takes 20-30 minutes and involves the administration of a gadolinium contrast agent. 

It is anticipated that the results of this study will lead to better informed treatment of prostate cancer and suspected prostate cancer, for example by decreasing the number of men who need biopsies, decreasing the number of biopsy cores in those men who need them from 12 to 2 or 3, and decreasing the overtreatment of non-significant prostate cancer</summary>
