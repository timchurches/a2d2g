  <interventions>
    <interventions>ARM 1:Very Low Energy Diet (VLED) - Optifast plus exercise
Optifast is a commercially available Very Low Energy diet.
The diet prescribed to the participants will consist of 1 sachet/bar/soup prepared as per directions on box, for each of breakfast and lunch.
Dinner will consist of a serve of lean protein (lean red meat/fish/tofu) plus a serve of non-starchy vegetables plus a teaspoon of oil to contract the gallbladder.
The target energy intake is 800kCal per day and the duration of the intervention is 12 weeks.
Exercise: 3x45 minute sessions per week, for 12 weeks. The program is called "Heartmoves" and was designed by the National Heart Foundation especially for older people. It involves resistance, balance, strength and endurance components. The intensity of the exercise will be guided by the participant as the moves can be modified. The classes will either be delivered by a trained Heartmoves aerobics instructor or the patient can do the exercise at home by watching a DVD. A physiotherapist will be involved in the study to treat/monitor any injuries.
Arm 2: Hypocaloric Diet Plus exercise
Hypocaloric diet: A diet will be prescribed by a dietician tailored to the participant. The diet will contain enough nutrients for the participant but have fewer calories than what they need (approximately 2000kJ/day deficit from basal requirements), which will result in slow weight loss.
The duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks. The participant will have a long (1 hour) consultation at the beginning of the trial and shorter (approx 30 minute) consultations every 2 weeks during the trial).
The exercise component will be Heartmoves as above.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical function - 
The De Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) will be used. This is a test of 19 items, from the very basic (bridging in bed) to more advanced (jumping, picking up a pen from the floor). This index is validated in community dwelling older adults.
Other tests of physical function will be the 6 minute walk test and a questionnaire called the human activity profile, which gives a more qualitative account of what the participant can do (eg. walk on uneven ground, walk up steps etc)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognition - via the Victoria Stroop Interference test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test and Trail Making Tests A and B. These tests are responsive to changes in diet and take about 15 minutes to administer.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to investigate which strategy is best in terms of preserving physical function in older adults (greater than 65 years) who are obese. The interventions are a very low energy diet (VLED - Optifast) plus exercise, diet plus exercise or exercise alone. The trial will last for 12 weeks. We will also look at the effects of these measures on body composition, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol and memory/thinking.</summary>
