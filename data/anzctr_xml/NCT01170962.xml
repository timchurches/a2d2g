    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether BMS-790052 added to Peginterferon Alfa-2a
      and ribavirin can result in higher cure rates in patients who previously failed therapy and
      may have limited response to retreatment with Peginterferon Alfa-2a and ribavirin alone.</summary>
