  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lymph node grafting from groin to upper limb. This technique is carried out by trained Plastic and Breast Surgeons and involves an incision in the groin with removal of two lymph nodes under local anaesthetic. Lymph nodes are then grafted into the subcutaneous tissue of the elbow and wrist of the affected limb. Surgeons will have a minimum of five years experience. This surgery is carried out in one surgical procedure and takes approximately 60 minutes.
In this is a randomised controlled trial participants will be randomly assigned to; 
	The control group (standard care): Will receive standard lymphoedema therapy alone. This includes self-administered massage, therapeutic exercise, use of a compression sleeve and skin/nail care; OR
	The intervention group: Will undergo lymph node grafting surgery as well as standard lymphoedema therapy. 
Adherence to the intervention won't be assessed. Standard lymphoedema therapy provided by Waikato lymphoedema therapists will be standardised.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard lymphoedema therapy is the control: Usual treatment as carried out and instructed by a lymphoedema therapist (either physiotherapist or registered nurse lymphoedema therapist) and consists of self-administered massage, therapeutic exercise, use of a compression sleeve and skin/nail care.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lymphoedema Volume (LV): Expressed as the inter-limb Truncal Cone Volume (TCV) difference and change (including percentage) from baseline. A clinically significant change will be taken as &gt;10% or 80 ml reduction from baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Bioimpedance: Lymphoedema Index (L-dex) score change from baseline. All participants will be assessed in person at six, 12 and 24 months by a research (registered) nurse. L-dex scores (and also bilateral arm and leg circumference measurements) will be taken at these time points.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six, 12 and 24 months post surgery/post enrolment to trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) Requirement for compression therapy: Whether a compression garment is still required.
All participants will be assessed in person at six, 12 and 24 months by a research (registered) nurse. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six, 12 and 24 months post surgery/post enrolment to trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) Self rated quality of life: SNAC Study Specific Scales score change from baseline. The minimum clinically important difference will be taken as a 10 point difference on the 150 point scale.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six, 12 and 24 months post surgery/post enrolment to trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4) Episodes of cellulitis: requiring antibiotic treatment. All participants will be assessed in person at six, 12 and 24 months by a research (registered) nurse. Participants in the surgery arm will also be followed up at one month post-operatively to assess for the presence of surgical morbidity. Note at some follow up appointments participants will also be assessed by a Surgeon e.g. at the one month post-operative visit, or when trial follow-up coincides with annual breast cancer follow-up, or as required.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six, 12 and 24 months post surgery/post enrolment to trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5) Early surgical morbidity: Assessed for; a) haematoma requiring operative evacuation; b) seroma requiring aspiration; c) superficial surgical site infection (as defined by the Australian Infection Control Association)</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month post surgery (for intervention group only)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6) Assessment of grafted lymph nodes. lymphoscintigraphy will be used to assess for: a) uptake/no uptake of grafted nodes; b) lymphatic transport index; c) lymphoscintigraphic classification of lymphoedema. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months post surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Upper limb lymphoedema is a common and often distressing sequelae of breast cancer treatment. Reconstructive lymphatic microsurgery may be considered if conservative treatment fails but is highly specialised and expensive. This phase two, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial will compare a novel surgical technique; lymph node grafting (LNG) in addition to standard lymphoedema therapy, against standard lymphoedema therapy alone. Study participants will be those with residual stage one to two breast-cancer related lymphoedema despite initial treatment with standard lymphoedema therapy. The aim is to determine whether LNG plus standard lymphoedema therapy produces a greater reduction in lymphoedema volume (LV) and improved quality of life compared with the control group; standard lymphoedema therapy alone. A further aim is to demonstrate that LNG is a safe treatment, with acceptable surgical morbidity.</summary>
