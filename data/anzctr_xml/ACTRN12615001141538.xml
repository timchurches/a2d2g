  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total of 18 participants will receive three single subcutaneous doses of gerilimzumab (5 mg or 20 mg) or placebo at Day 1, Day 28, Day 56 .  

Each dose will be administered by a train site staff (i.e. nurse) and will be documented in the clinic notes.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of gerilimzumab administered as 3 subcutaneous doses at 4 weekly intervals .

Outcomes are measured by evaluating physical exams, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory results, and adverse events

This is the first time gerilimzumab will be given to humans in multiple doses.  Therefore, the risks to human participants have not yet been fully evaluated.  Gerilimzumab is a monoclonal antibody and while nothing in the non-human drug development data suggest it, it is likely based on other human studies with monoclonal studies, you may experience symptoms of apparent allergic reaction, also known as cytokine release syndrome.  Symptoms of this can vary but can include:
 
*Mild to moderate fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting
*Moderate to severe symptoms such as swelling of the skin, low blood pressure, and pulmonary infiltrates (e.g. blood and mucus in the lung).
 
Although nothing in pre-clinical and preliminary clinical testing of gerilmzumab to date indicates that an allergic reaction is likely, a reaction to any drug is possible.  Some symptoms of allergic reactions are:
*	Rash
*	Wheezing, or difficulty breathing
*	Dizziness or fainting (also a possible outcome of a drop in blood pressure)
*	Swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes
*	A fast pulse
*	Sweating

Participants will be closely monitored with regular assessment of  vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, and safety blood results.  The study doctor will be looking out for side effects.

    <concealment>A total of 18 participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts.  Each cohort has 9 participants with 6 randomized to received gerilmzumab ( cohort 1:  5 mg; cohort 2: 20 mg) and 3 participants to receive placebo.  

A randomisation list will be generated by an Unblinded Statistician at CNS and will be transferred electronically to the Investigational Site at least 2 days prior to enrolment.

Eligible subjects enrolled into the study will be assigned a randomisation number by the Nucleus Network Unblinded Pharmacist in accordance with the Randomization List generated by CNS.

The Randomisation List details the randomisation numbers and the associated treatment.

Each participant will receive the treatment which corresponds to their randomisation number (as assigned in the Randomisation List).

The Randomisation List will be available only to clinic pharmacy staff preparing the drug who are not involved in any other aspect of the study. The Randomisation List will not be made available to the Sponsor, subjects, or members of the staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments (i.e. all blinded study members) until
study completion and database lock, unless a full unblinding of the study is required.</concealment>
