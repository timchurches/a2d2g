  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ibrutinib
Treatment: drugs - Venetoclax
Treatment: drugs - Placebo Oral tablet to match Venetoclax

Experimental: Safety Run-in Period - Subjects are enrolled into the open-label Safety Run-in Period to evaluate the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and DLTs with the concurrent administration of ibrutinib and venetoclax.

Experimental: Phase 3: Ibrutinb + Venetoclax - Subjects will be randomized to receive ibrutinib and venetoclax/placebo until clinical disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

Placebo Comparator: Phase 3: Ibrutinib + Placebo - Subjects will be randomized to receive ibrutinib and venetoclax/placebo until clinical disease progression or unacceptable toxicity


Treatment: drugs: Ibrutinib
Administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: Venetoclax
Administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: Placebo Oral tablet to match Venetoclax
