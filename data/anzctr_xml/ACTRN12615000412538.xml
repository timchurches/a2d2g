  <interventions>
    <interventions>The sample included subjects with mechanical non-specific NP, that were randomly distributed into three groups. The cervical group received a high-velocity low amplitude (HVLA) spinal manipulation over the lower cervical spine (C7), the thoracic group underwent a HVLA spinal manipulation over the upper thoracic spine (T3), whereas the placebo group (PG) received a sham-manual contact. Measurements were taken before intervention and immediately afterwards of the pressure pain threshold over the median, ulnar and radial nerves and free-pain grip strength with a hydraulic dynamometer.The intervention performed a physiotherapist and lasted five minutes in a single session.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo manouvre consisted in the therapist placing her hands on the patient's head. The aim was to provide a manual stimulus and the therapist presence. The intervention time for the placebo technique is five minutes and it will be performed only once.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) over the upper limb nerve trunks
The PPT, as the primary outcome measure, was assessed with a digital dynamometer with compression force between 5-20 kg, (PCE Instruments UK Ltd, Southampton), model FM200, and with a contact probe size of 1 kg / cm squared. Measurements were made alternatively on both upper limbs, starting with the right side. A increasing pressure of 1kg/cm squared was used, with a resting period of 30 seconds between measurements. The reference PPT score was the mean of three measurements in each spot. Subjects were instructed to tell the evaluator to stop when the sensation changed from pressure to slightly unpleasant pain. PPT was evaluated over the upper limb nerve trunks, with the subject lying supine, and in the following order: (a) median nerve, which was located in two diffferent sites. First, the nerve was located at the carpal tunnel site, lateral to the flexor carpi radials muscle. Second, the nerve was also marked in the ulnar fossa, medial to and immediately adjacent to the tendon of biceps brachii; (b) the ulnar nerve was palpated in the space between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon, once the elbow was previously flexed; and (c) the radial nerve, which was located  in the humeral tunnel torsion, between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps brachii at the mid third of the humerus. Pressure algometry is a valid tool that has shown a high inter-examiner reliability, ICC = 0.91 (95% CI 0.82-0.97). The standard error of measurement (SEM) in healthy individuals ranges from 0.52kg / cm squared  0.64 kg / cm squared</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Grip Strength (GS) 
The pain-free grip strength (GS) was evaluated with an isometric, hydraulic hand dynamometer (JAMAR registered trademark, mod 5030J1, Illinois, USA). Dynamometry is a reliable, reproducible and easy-to-use tool. Following the guidelines of the American Society of Hand Therapists, the subject was standing, with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, arm and elbow along the body, elbow flexed to 90 degrees, forearm in the neutral position, and the wrist with a subtle dorsal flexion and ulnar deviation, if needed, or in the neutral position. This procedure has shown an excellent test-retest reliability, with ICC values ranging between 0.81 and 0.98. The subject was instructed to squeeze the handle as strong as possible without feeling pain or discomfort. Three measurements of 5 seconds each and with a 15-second resting period between them, to prevent fatigue, were carried out, taking the mean as the reference value.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The statistical processing of the data was conducted using the statistical package PASW Advanced Statistics 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Findings are expressed as the mean with the corresponding standard deviation and/or 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), or as percentage frequencies. Normality of the study variables was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The comparison between-groups for baseline data was made with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for quantitative variables with normal distribution, the Kruskall-Wallis test for quantitative data with no normal distribution, and the chi-squared test for qualitative variables. To compare the effectiveness of the interventions on pressure algometry over upper limb nerve trunks and free-pain GS a separate 2-by-3 mixed-model ANOVA, with time (pre intervention or postintervention) as within-subjects variable and group as between-subject variable. Effect sizes were calculated using the Cohen d coefficient. The Bonferroni test was used for post hoc analysis. All the analysis were conducted considering statistically significant a p-value &lt; 0.05. The sample size is performed through a pilot study (n=20) and statistical analysis, and calculation of effect size considering statistically significant a p&lt;0.05 and power 80%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Widespread sensory changes have been observed in some subgroups of mechanical NP, although this is still a matter of discussion we hypothesized that, in decreasing neural mechanosensitivity will have a positive impact in parameters that are strongly related to the functionality of the cervical and thoracic spine. So after the spinal manipulation, we will find an immediate increase in neural mechanosensitivity and grip strength.</summary>
