  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this 3 month, parallel randomised controlled study in individuals with type 1 diabetes, we will compare two methods of adjusting the dose of insulin to match the nutrients in a meal.  The intervention group will use a novel algorithm based on the foods normal insulin response in healthy subjects (the Food Insulin Index or FII).  Participants randomised to the FII intervention group will received 1x 2hr group education workshop, including presentation &amp; discussion of relevant information, demonstration &amp; practical activities on using FII counting and estimating food portion sizes;  and 1x 30min individual appointment to reinforce the education and apply FII counting to individual food choices/preferences (note: diet not provided - subjects continue normal eating patterns).  All education sessions will be delivered by an Accredited Practising Dietitian.  Participants will be given a written education materials (pictorial reference book, pocket-sized reference book and session manual) and access to the study website and an iPhone app.  Subjects are emailed weekly throughout the 3 month trial to see how they are going with the FII counting and offer assistance if needed. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and postprandial glycaemia and the occurrence of hypoglycaemia (recorded using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, CGMS) will be compared at baseline and after 3 months. We hypothesize that using the novel FII to adjust mealtime insulin dose will improve blood glucose control, compared with carbohydrate counting.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be recruited through private endocrinology clinics.

Potential participants will be identified using the clinicâ€™s records.  Preliminary information about the trial will either be mailed to potential participants or provided through a third-party not directly involved in the research or their medical care (e.g. the receptionist).  Potential participants who are interested in the study will be invited to contact the researchers for more information and to enrol in the study.

Participants will be screened to ensure they meet the eligibility criteria and will be randomised using randomisation tables and sealed, opaque envelopes (preassigned and only opened at the time of randomisation).

    <sequence>Randomisation sequence will be generated using randomisation tables and the outcome for each participant sealed in an opaque envelope prior to the commencement of recruiting for the study. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>There will be 36 subjects recruited for the study, with 18 subjects in each group. This number is sufficient to detect a 20% difference in mean glucose levels as determined by final continuous glucose monitoring output with 80% power and P less than 0.05 based on the previous research in similar patients. Data will be analysed using the SPSS statistical package version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).  Means, standard deviations for each variable at each timepoint and the change between time points will be calculated.  Differences in coefficients will be considered statistically significant if P is less than 0.05, and highly significant if P is less than 0.01 (two-tailed).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this parallel randomised controlled study in individuals with type 1 diabetes, we will compare two methods of adjusting the dose of insulin to match the nutrients in a meal.  One method, known as carbohydrate counting, uses an algorithm (= formula) that matches the dose of insulin to the carbohydrate content of the meal. The second method uses a novel algorithm based on the foods normal insulin response in healthy subjects (the Food Insulin Index or FII).  Participants will be randomised to either the carbohydrate counting or FII intervention group and will receive education regarding the practical implementation of their corresponding algorithm.  Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and postprandial glycaemia and the occurrence of hypoglycaemia (recorded using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, CGMS) will be compared at baseline and after 3 months. We hypothesize that using the novel FII to adjust mealtime insulin dose will improve blood glucose control, compared with carbohydrate counting. </summary>
