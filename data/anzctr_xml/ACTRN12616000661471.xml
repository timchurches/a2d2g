  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be two different intervention groups as described below.

1) Basic app: Participants in the basic app group will be provided with and supported to access the basic app in addition to standard care. This app has basic features to provide daily simple timed reminders to take the medications with no further interactivity. The basic app will act similarly to an alarm or a text-message by showing a reminder on the smartphone screen at a set time every day. Participants will be encouraged to set daily reminders to take each cardiovascular medication at the prescribed time. The duration of the intervention period will be 3 months. 

2) Interactive app: Participants in the interactive app group will be provided with and supported to access the interactive app in addition to standard care. This interactive app has the ability to provide daily reminders to take medications and, in addition, it has more customisable and interactive features, including features to mark doses as taken or missed, to snooze the reminder, to interact and share data with family members and health professionals, multiple user support, adherence statistics, customisable alert sounds and visual cues like tablets and syringes icons. Participants will be encouraged to set daily reminders to take each cardiovascular medication at the prescribed time. In addition, participants will also be encouraged to track their doses daily by clicking in one of the following options every time a reminder pops-up in the smartphone screen: taken on the schedule, taken on a different time, snooze or skip the dose. The duration of the intervention period will be 3 months. Information about engagement with the app will be obtained by extracting the adherence data from the app at the end of the study. 

These apps were selected through a stepwise approach to identify the best available apps to be tested in this trial. A comprehensive and systematic search of all available apps in the Australian iTunes and Google Play app stores was conducted and the apps were selected using a pre-defined set of criteria. The highest quality apps were selected. Both apps are available for free in iTunes and Google Play stores and have ongoing technical support, having been recently updated in April 2016. </interventions>

      <outcome>Medication adherence to each and all indicated cardiovascular medications, including anti-platelets, statin, angiotensin conversing enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and beta-blocker, measured by self-report using a questionnaire designed specifically for this study. At the 3-month follow-up visit, a blinded researcher will ask the participants the names and dosages of all prescribed and over-the-counter medications currently being taken. Participants will also be asked the number of days that each indicated cardiovascular medication was missed in the week prior to the follow-up visit. Participants will be defined as adherent if medication was taken for at least 6 days during the week preceding the study-related visit, accounting for 85% of the days in that week. Participants not taking one of the indicated CV medication due to contra-indications will be considered adherent.</outcome>

In addition, participants will have to meet the following criteria: 1) be an adult (&gt; 18 years), 2) own an active smartphone that operates with iOS or Android operating systems, 3) have sufficient English skills, and 4) provide written informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients will be excluded if they already use a medication reminder app or other electronic reminder systems to help them adhere to their medication regimen, e.g. calendar alerts in their phones. In addition, smartphones that are not capable of downloading the apps, for example older Apple iPhones, such as iPhones 4, that operate with older iOS versions, will be excluded, as the basic app is only compatible with iOS version 7.0 or later and the advanced app with iOS version 8.0 or later. </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations are focused on the difference between proportion of adherent patients between control and intervention groups (basic and advanced medication reminder groups). The calculations assume a ratio of 2:1 for intervention and control subjects and that 50% of patients are fully adherent to all cardiovascular medication. Analysis of pooled data of previous studies that investigated text-message reminders in a population with coronary heart disease demonstrated significant improvements in adherence with an estimated absolute improvement of 29%. Therefore, a total sample size of 156 patients is needed to provide 90% power to detect an increase in the proportion of adherent patients from 50% to 79%, with a two-sided a of 0.05 and allowing for a 20% loss of follow-up.

Primary analysis will be unadjusted, following an intention-to-treat principle. If necessary, multivariate analyses will be conducted to adjust to any significant difference between groups. Data will be presented as means or medians or as frequencies and proportions. Continuous variables will be analysed using independent t tests and categorical variables using Chi-square tests as appropriate. Mann-Whitney U tests will be used if data are not normally distributed. We will also calculate relative risks, 95% confidence intervals and two-sided p-values for both primary and secondary outcomes. Participants with missing data for medication adherence will be considered non-adherent. Pre-specified sub-group analyses will be performed for age, sex, level of education, adherent/non-adherent participants at baseline, basic app/interactive app, basic app/usual care and interactive app/usual care. Statistical significance will be set at a 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Poor adherence to medication is a global concern, especially in chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. In Australia, it is estimated that between 14 to 43% of patients with cardiovascular disease do not adhere to medications. The use of smartphone apps has been proposed as a potential solution for this problem. In recent years, the increasing popularity of apps is evident as there has been exponential growth in numbers of apps available in online stores. Despite the plethora of health apps, there is a lack of information on the quality of apps, how they differ, which are more effective and why, making it difficult for health professionals to recommend a useful app to patients. In our systematic search of app stores, we have identified around 300 medication adherence apps. About half of these apps identified had basic features involving simple reminders for patients to take medication at appropriate times. The other half included additional customisable and interactive features that could increase engagement with the app and motivate sustained usage. Through a quality assessment, we selected two high-quality apps to be tested in this study. In this trial, we aim to determine whether smartphone apps to remind patients to take their medication can improve medication adherence, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. We also aim to compare and contrast the features of the smartphone apps through a detailed qualitative evaluation that will provide evidence on which features consumers perceive to be most useful, enhance engagement and optimise effects.. Our results will inform future research about the role of apps in improving medication adherence.</summary>
