  <interventions>
    <interventions>participants randomly assigned to dental recall intervals of 12-, 24-, 36-months and no specific recall interval. Participants will be contacted for a review appointment at allocated intervals by staff of the South Australian Dental Service. All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and at 12-month intervals. Follow-up will conclude at 36-month recall appointments.</interventions>
    <comparator>No specific recall interval; participants will not be contacted for a specific review appointment, but will be advised to contact the local dental clinic if and when they feel they need to consult an oral health practitioner.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presentation for emergency care outside of scheduled recall interval at any dental clinic, including private practices or hospitals will be obtained from patient data held by South Australian Dental Service via data linkage. Specifically designed questionnaire will seek information on attendance outside of South Australian Dental Service clinics at the completion of the 12-month questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at time of presentation, monitored from enrolment for the duration of the study (36 months).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>oral health related quality of life assessed through completion of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) at the yearly questionnaire completion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>dental fear and anxiety assessed through the completion of the index of dental anxiety and fear scale (IDAF-4C) at the yearly questionnaire completion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Services received by patients will be coded at the level of individual service items using the three-digit coding scheme of the Australian Dental Association (ADA). Using this coding scheme, service items will be aggregated into one of 10 main areas of service, namely Diagnostic, Preventive, Periodontic, Oral Surgery, Endodontic, Restorative, Crown and Bridge, Prosthodontic, Orthodontic and General/Miscellaneous.</outcome>

    <concealment>eligible participants attending selected South Australian Dental Service clinics will be issued with an information/consent pack and a self-complete questionnaire. Consenting participants will complete the questionnaire and sign a consent and return forms via reply-paid envelope to central study coordinator. Central study coordinator, off-site, will use computer-generated block random numbers to allocate participants, stratified by dental caries experience.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence will be generated using computer generated numbers stratified at two levels in blocks, stratified on caries experience and age-groups.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimation based on retrospective analysis of data from South Australian Dental Service over the period 2002-2012 of service use and attendance patterns among its patients and the frequency of attendance for emergency care after a course of general dental care. Forty-two percent attended for emergency care. The study is intended to reduce the proportion attending for emergency care by 50% with the institution of a scheduled recall to enable early care. The difference was to be statistically significant at alpha 0.05 and 0.80 power. Advice from the South Australian Dental Service was to anticipate an annual loss to follow-up of up to 50%. Allowing for loss to follow-up, an initial sample size of 720 in each group was required, rounded up to 3,000 for the entire sample.
Data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis and analysis of variance will be undertaken to determine services provided and resources consumed among the randomised groups. Group analysis of the proportion presenting for emergency care will be
undertaken using the Chi square statistic. Multiple linear modelling will be undertaken to determine factors of importance in changes to oral health related quality of life and dental fear and anxiety. </statisticalmethods>
