    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Emicizumab

Experimental: Emicizumab 1.5 mg/kg/week - Participants who received episodic treatment with FVIII prior to study entry will receive emicizumab prophylaxis at a dose of 3 milligrams per kilogram per week (mg/kg/week) subcutaneously for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab subcutaneously until the end of study (maximum up to 2 years).

Experimental: Emicizumab 3 mg/kg/2 weeks - Participants who received episodic treatment with FVIII prior to study entry will receive emicizumab prophylaxis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for 4 weeks, followed by 3 mg/kg/2 weeks emicizumab subcutaneously until the end of study (maximum up to 2 years).

Active Comparator: No Prophylaxis - Participants who received episodic treatment with FVIII prior to study entry will be randomized to continue episodic FVIII treatment when they start the trial; they will have the opportunity to switch to emicizumab prophylaxis after 24 weeks on-study.

Experimental: Emicizumab (Pre-study FVIII Prophylaxis) - Participants who received FVIII prophylaxis prior to study entry will receive emicizumab prophylaxis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab subcutaneously until the end of study (maximum up to 2 years).


Treatment: drugs: Emicizumab
Participants will receive emicizumab prophylaxis at the specified dose subcutaneously until the end of the study (maximum up to 2 years).

    <summary>This is a randomized, global, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 clinical study in participants
      with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors against Factor VIII (FVIII) who are 12 years or
      older. The study evaluates two prophylactic emicizumab regimens versus no prophylaxis in this
      population with emphasis on efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics.</summary>
