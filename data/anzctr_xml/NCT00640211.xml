  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as
      prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in patients who are prescribed a long term
      course in the context of a place of employment or profession. The study is observational
      only. The primary measure used in this study will be the incidence of symptomatic pandemic
      influenza in patients receiving prophylaxis. Seroconversion to pandemic influenza, the
      incidence of adverse events and the relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir
      prophylaxis will also be examined. This project will commence upon pandemic influenza being
      declared in Australia, Hong Kong or Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible
      to help inform the continued use of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the
      public health agency response to pandemic influenza.</summary>
