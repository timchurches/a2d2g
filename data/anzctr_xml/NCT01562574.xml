  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is conducted in Oceania. The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of
      activated recombinant human factor VII and standard treatment compared with standard
      haemostatic replacement therapy in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery for paediatric
      congenital heart disease.</summary>
