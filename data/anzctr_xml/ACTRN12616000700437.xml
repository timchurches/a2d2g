  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a phase I, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, single ascending dose study of APL-2 administered intravenously to healthy volunteers. It will be conducted at a single site in Australia. The study will recruit four dose cohorts each comprising four subjects receiving APL-2 and one subject receiving placebo. A fifth cohort may be recruited if required.
Subjects will receive a single intravenous bolus injection of APL-2 administered over 30 minutes. Meals will be restricted from 1 hour prior to dosing to 4 hours after dosing.
Safety will be assessed throughout the study; serial blood samples and urine samples will be collected for these assessments. Blood samples will also be collected for the pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and immunogenicity assessments of APL- 2. The safety, PK, PD and immunogenicity profiles of APL-2 will be compared to placebo. On Day 1 of each cohort, 4 subjects will receive APL-2 and 1 will receive placebo.
APL- 2 will be supplied as a sterile solution in acetate-buffered saline at a concentration of 24 mg/mL.
Dose escalation to the next dose level (i.e. next cohort) will not take place until a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) comprised of the Principal Investigator (PI), the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor have determined that adequate safety and tolerability from the previous cohort has been demonstrated to permit proceeding to the next cohort. The planned dose for cohorts 1 and 2 is 200 mg and 600 mg respectively, the dose for cohorts 3 and 4 will be determined by the SMC following their review of safety, PK and PD data from the previous cohort(s).
Subjects will be resident in the Unit (Nucleus Network Ltd) from the day before dosing until 168 hours (Day 8) after dosing. Subjects will return for follow-up visits on Days 15, 22 and 29 and the exit visit on Day 43 for subsequent study procedures. The study duration per subject is approximately 70 days with a screening interval of up to 28 days.
Interim PK analyses will be performed to guide the dose-escalation decision and to reconsider the sampling time points as the study progresses.

    <concealment>This study is a randomized, double-blind study. Study subjects, site staff including the principal investigator and sub-investigators, monitoring staff and sponsor staff will all be blinded to treatment allocation. Unblinded personnel will include the site pharmacists, one biostatistician and the local depot staff. Subjects will be centrally randomized to either APL-2 or placebo in a 4:1 ratio.</concealment>
    <sequence>Central randomization will be undertaken with randomization numbers assigned sequentially to each subject as they are confirmed eligible for dosing and enrolled in the study.
The study plans to enrol up to 20 subjects in 4 cohorts, with a possible 5th cohort. All subjects within a cohort will be dosed on the same day; thus no blocking or stratification will be performed.
Upon enrolment, a randomisation number will be assigned to each subject by the unblinded site pharmacist in accordance with a computerized randomization list generated by the unblinded statistician.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Safety Data Analyses
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarised by dose, System Organ Class and Preferred Term, according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number of subjects reporting each AE preferred term will be tabulated for all TEAEs and separately for those considered as possibly related to study treatment by the Investigator.  Number of subjects reporting SAEs will also be tabulated.
Changes from baseline in laboratory, vital sign and ECG parameters will be summarised by dose, study day and nominal time post-dose (if appropriate).  The number of patients reporting QTcF values greater than or equal to 450 ms for males and greater than or equal to  470 ms for females, or an increase from baseline of greater than or equal to 30 ms will also be tabulated. Baseline will be taken as the last measurement prior to the start of dosing.
For the laboratory safety data, out of range values will be flagged in the data listings and listed separately.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses
     Pharmacokinetic Parameters
PK parameters for APL-2 will be computed from the individual serum concentrations-time data, using actual sample times using a non-compartmental approach. Appropriate validated PK software (e.g., Phoenix WinNonlin 'Registered Trademark' Version 6.3 or higher) will be used.
AUC0-t	The area under the serum concentration versus time curve, from time 0 to the last measurable concentration, as calculated by the linear-log trapezoidal method.
AUC0-inf	The area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity. AUC0-inf is calculated as the sum of AUC0-t plus the ratio of the last measurable serum concentration to the elimination rate constant.
Cmax	Maximum observed serum concentration.
tmax	Time of the maximum measured serum concentration. If the maximum value occurs at more than one time point, tmax is defined as the first time point with this value.
kel	Apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the serum concentration versus time curve. The parameter will be calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the maximum number of points in the terminal log-linear phase (e.g., three or more non-zero serum concentrations).
t1/2	Apparent first-order terminal elimination half-life will be calculated as 0.693/kel.
CL:	Total body clearance after IV administration, calculated as Dose/AUC0-inf (parent only).
Vz:	Total volume of distribution after IV administration, calculated as Dose/(AUC0-inf x kel) (parent only).
Statistical Methods for Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Descriptive Statistics
PK parameters will be summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics (arithmetic means, SD, coefficients of variation [CV], N, minimum, maximum and median). In addition, geometric means will be calculated for AUC parameters, and Cmax. Figures will be created to display median and individual APL-2 concentration-time curves. Additional PK analyses may be performed if deemed appropriate.
No value for kel, t1/2, AUC0-inf, CL, or Vz, as appropriate, will be reported for cases that do not exhibit a terminal log-linear phase in the concentration versus time profile.
Additional analyses will be performed as deemed necessary upon review of the data.
Dose Proportionality Analysis
Dose proportionality will be evaluated for APL-2 AUC parameters and Cmax. Due to the complex nature of the association between the systemic exposure and the dose, the assessment of the dose proportionality will not be based solely on a strict statistical rule given the small sample size for each dose level. 
The relationship between dose and PK parameters of APL-2 will be examined graphically and a power law model will fitted to the data. For the power law analysis a linear regression model will be fitted to the ln transformed PK parameters using ln transformed dose as the linear explanatory variable. Quadratic and cubic terms for ln-transformed dose will be added to test for departures from linearity; if these are not significant (p-value greater than 0.05) the linear slope and associated 95 per cent confidence interval will be estimated. Dose proportionality would be implied by a slope of 1, but to be able to conclude proportionality the confidence interval will need to exclude clinically relevant deviations from proportionality.
Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
Absolute values and changes from baseline in complement level and immunoglobulin parameters will be summarised by dose and study day.  Individual subject and median profiles of the absolute and change from baseline data will be plotted by dose and study day. Baseline will be taken as the last measurement prior to the start of dosing.
Handling of Dropouts and/or Missing Data
No imputation of missing data for early terminations will be performed. 
Missing dates/times will be reviewed on a case by case basis for potential imputations, but the original data will always be presented in data listings. 
PK concentration values below the limit of quantification will take the value of 0 in individual linear-linear profile plots and the limit of quantification in linear-log profile plots.
Other Data Analyses
Demographics will be summarised by dose and overall.
Physical examination, concomitant medication and medical history data will be listed for each dose. WHO and MedDRA coding dictionaries will be used for the concomitant medications and medical histories respectively.
Interim Analyses
There will be a planned review of safety/tolerability, PK and PD data between cohorts.
