  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - blood or stool samples will be collected

Normal subjects - blood or stool samples will be collected from people referred for screening colonoscopy

Colorectal cancer - blood or stool samples will be collected from people with colorectal cancer detected at colonoscopy or resection

Polyps &lt;10mm and no high risk features - blood or stool samples will be collected from people with no polyps or low risk polyps (&lt;10mm, no villous component or dysplasia) detected at colonoscopy

Advanced Mucosal Neoplasia - blood or stool samples will be collected from people with AMN detected at resection

Sessile Serrated Adenoma - blood or stool samples will be collected from people with SSP detected at resection

non-colorectal neoplastic disease - Participants with disease that is not colorectal neoplasia. Analysis of this cohort is not a primary endpoint but the investigators will report assay positivity in this group on an opportunistic basis. This cohort will include patients diagnosed with, for example, inflammatory bowel disease or extracolonic cancer.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of methylated DNA in circulation - The process will use an automated extraction procedure incorporating state-of-the-art magnetic silica-coated beads on a QIASymphony (Qiagen). The extracted DNA is bisulphite-converted and further purified (automated on a QIACube HT liquid handler) prior to analyzing 12uL of bis-DNA in a multi-plexed (BCAT1, IKZF1, ACTB (control assay)) real-time PCR for measuring the methylation levels of target amplicons.</outcome>
      <timepoint>5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of haemoglobin in stool - Suspended stool collected in the HM-JACKarc sampling device will be processed for Hb measurements using commercially available reagents and the bench-top analyser instrument, HM-JACKarc, according to manufacturer recommendation (Kyowa Medex Co Ltd, Japan). Measured haemoglobin concentrations will be reported as ug Hb/g stool. A 20 ug Hb/g stool a cut-off concentration will be used for qualitative reporting.</outcome>
