  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ultrasound-guided lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block using 1-5ml of 1% lignocaine.  5ml will be the maximum used.  More commonly 1-2ml will be required. 

The exact amount will be determined by the operator performing the block who can visualise when the nerve is surrounded by local anaesthetic solution.  

The entire process (from start to adequate nerve block with area of numbness mapped out and incision sites drawn on) will take between 10 minutes and 30 minutes.  This will depend upon the technical difficulty of the nerve blockade itself and how long it takes for the nerve block to work.</interventions>
    <comparator>No control.  All participants will have a nerve block performed, the anaesthesia of the skin will be mapped out and the usual site of skin incision will be marked out.  The distribution of the numbness will be compared with the usual site of incision (in all volulnteers).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgery on the hip joint is common but the provision of pain relief during and after the operation is challenging, especially since the patients are often frail and elderly.  

Injection of a local anaesthetic drug near to the nerves that supply the hip (a nerve block) can be very effective but a number of different nerves supply the skin over the hip joint and blocking the whole of the surgical wound is difficult.  

We plan a pilot study to map out the distribution of achievable pain relief when the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) is blocked under ultrasound guidance and relate this to the usual site of surgical incision for a variety of hip operations.  This will indicate whether the block could provide reliable and effective pain relief to a predictable area of the hip.</summary>
