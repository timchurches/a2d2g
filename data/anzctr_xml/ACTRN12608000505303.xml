  <interventions>
    <interventions>Vapour (steam) is infused into a targeted emphysematous lung segment for approximately 3 - 10 seconds.  Up to 7 lung segments within the right and left upper lobes of the lung will be treated in one procedure.  Patients in the first cohort will receive a prescribed amount of vapour (target vapour dose) delivered to each lung segment of 7.5 calories per gram of lung tissue.  A second cohort of patients may be treated with a target vapour dose of 10 calories per gram of lung tissue after 3 month follow-up results are reviewed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulmonary Function:  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) &gt; 15% or 200 mls</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety:  The occurrence and frequency of serious and non-serious adverse events following BTVA treatment.  Examples of adverse effects include respiratory infection, pneumothorax, and increase in COPD related symptoms.  Adverse effects will be assessed by the physician's evaluation, laboratory tests and chest x-rays / computerized tomography (CT).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed each week for the first 4 weeks after treatment and again at 2, 3 and 6 months.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>3 and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulmonary Function:  increase in Functional Residual Capacity (FRC), decrease in total lung capacity (TLC), increase in functional vital capacity (FVC), decrease in residual volume (RV), increase in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in exercise capacity by the 6 minute walk test (6MWT)</outcome>
