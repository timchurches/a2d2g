  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study will assess the efficacy, safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of emicizumab administered at a dose of 6 milligrams
      per kilogram (mg/kg) every 4 weeks in participants with hemophilia A with or without
      inhibitors against factor VIII (FVIII). The study consists of 2 parts: a pharmacokinetic (PK)
      run-in part followed by an expansion part.</summary>
