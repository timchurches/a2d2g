  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise therapy (40 minutes) - All participants do this
  The program starts with a 10 minute aerobic exercise warm-up (treadmill walking or stationary cycling). Subjects then perform a series of strengthening, stretching, and neuromuscular control activities which are core exercises for the program and mandatory. In addition to the above core exercises, therapists have the option to select additional optional exercise activities, based on the initial examination findings. These exercises will address strength or flexibility in the hip, and ankle if impairments are identified in the initial examination.

Manual therapy (40 minutes)
  The manual therapy (MT)techniques are maneuvers that are applied with manual force from the treating therapist. The MT techniques will include a series of accessory motion techniques, manual stretching , and soft tissue manipulation (deep massage to muscles and connective tissues associated with knee function). Core techniques include anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior tibiofemoral translations, superior-inferior and medial-lateral patellofemoral mobilizations, knee flexion and extension mobilizations that may be combined with varus-valgus stresses,medial-lateral tibial rotations, manual stretching of the quadriceps, rectus femoris, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles, and soft tissue manipulations of the quadriceps, peri-patellar tissues, hamstring, hip adductors, and gastroc-soleus muscle groups. There are optional MT techniques for the hip, and foot and ankle joints that can be selected by the therapist based on initial examination findings.

Booster sessions (40 minutes)
  Subjects in the standard (comparator) arm receive 12 treatment sessions in 9 weeks. Subjects in the booster (experimental) arm will receive 12 treatment sessions delivered with booster sessions (8 sessions in the first 9 weeks, 2 sessions at 5 months, 1 session at 8 months, and 1 session at 11 months).

All treatment sessions are supervised, delivered by physiotherapists to individual patients.

This study features a 2x2 factorial design: Factor 1: manual therapy vs no manual therapy Factor 2: booster vs no booster. All participants receive exercise therapy. By random allocation, participants may be assigned manual therapy and/or booster sessions in addition to exercise therapy.

Cost will be assessed using the Otago Osteoarthritis Costs and Consequences Questionnaire (Pinto et al 2011 BMC Med Res Methodol). Utility will be derived from the EQ-5D. We will calculate cost per quality adjusted life years gained (cost/QALY) and present these as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), from both a societal perspective (primary analysis) and health system perspective (secondary).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aim of the project is to examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of utilizing booster sessions (periodic face-to-face follow-up appointments that take place several weeks or months following discharge from the supervised therapy program designed to review the patient's current rehabilitation program, troubleshoot any problems with the program, and make recommendations for program progression or modification) in the delivery of exercise therapy, and supplementing exercise therapy with manual therapy techniques (manually applied treatment techniques such as joint mobilization/manipulation, manual traction, soft tissue manipulations, passive stretching and range of motion). The investigators will do this in a randomized, multi-center, clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that adding manual therapy techniques will be more clinically effective than exercise alone and that using booster sessions will maintain longer term clinical effects and be more cost-effective than not using booster sessions. This is the NZ study affiliated with the US multi-centre trial ID: NCT01314183: http://clinicaltrials.gov /ct2/show/NCT01314183</summary>
