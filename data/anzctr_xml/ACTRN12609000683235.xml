  <interventions>
    <interventions>A home based, computerised cognitive rehabilitation programme to be used for 4x forty-minute sessions per week for a total of 15 weeks (i.e. 40 hours).
There are five training exercises that form the core of the program, each targeting a different area of brain functioning. These cognitive targets include visual precision, divided attention, working memory, useful field of view and visual processing speed. Each exercise has an accompanying assessment that sets an improvement goal and measures progress against that goal. The exercises adapt to an individuals performance and all patients will complete a recommended schedule of training as per the programme design.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive standard medical care, which for most is routine review with their oncologist.  

Both groups will in addition receive a single 30 minute telephone consultation teaching strategies to manage cognitive impairment. The consultation will occur following randomisation, but prior to commencement of the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint is self reported cognitive function as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Cognitive Function (FACT-COG).
The primary outcome will be the difference between the intervention group and the control group in the change in FACT-COG score on completion of the cognitive rehabilitation program compared to the baseline score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Self reported cognitive function as measured by FACT-COG will be evaluated at 3 time points. These assessments will be at baseline, on completion of the 15 week intervention and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The major secondary outcome is objective neuropsychological testing as assessed by the CogState battery of tests. The CogState tool is a computerised battery of tests evaluating memory, attention and decision making.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Neuropsychological testing as assessed by the CogState battery will be performed at 3 time points including baseline, on completion of the 15 week intervention and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General questionnaire (FACT-G)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The quality of life questionnaire (FACT-G) will be administered at 3 time points including baseline, on completion of the 15 week intervention and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression/Anxiety as assessed by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The depression and anxiety questionnaire (GHQ) will be administered at 3 time points including baseline, on completion of the 15 week intervention and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stress as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The stress questionnaire (PSS) will be administered at 3 time points including baseline, on completion of the 15 week intervention and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatigue as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue subscale questionnaire (FACT-F)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The fatigue questionnaire (FACT-F) will be administered at 3 time points including baseline, on completion of the 15 week intervention and 6 months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating a home and internet based brain training programme (cognitive rehabilitation programme) in cancer survivors who have noticed changes in their memory, concentration and thinking (cognition) following chemotherapy. 

This trial will recruit cancer survivors aged 18 and above who have completed a minimum of 3 cycles of chemotherapy in the last 6  60 months for an early cancer. There should be no evidence of cancer recurrence. Potential participants must report changes in their memory and / or concentration.

All study participants will take part in a telephone session where they will be given skills to help manage their cognitive difficulties. In addition, half of the participants will receive the computer programme which is to be used for 4 x forty minute sessions per week for 15 weeks (i.e. 40 hours). 

Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their memory, mood, energy levels, quality of life and stress. They will also be asked to perform a 20 minute computer cognition exercise. The questionnaires and cognition exercise will take approximately 45 minutes to complete in total and these tests will be completed on 3 occasions during the trial (i.e. at baseline, on completion of the brain training programme and 6 months following completion of the brain training programme).

The computer programme, questionnaires and cognition exercise can all be completed at home and participants will therefore require access to computer and internet facilities.

This study will measure the effectiveness of the computer programme in improving self reported cognitive function and performance, mood, energy, quality of life and stress.</summary>
