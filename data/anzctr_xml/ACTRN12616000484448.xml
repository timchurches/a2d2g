  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of supplementation with a bioavailability enhanced curcumin supplement, Longvida (registered trademark) Optimized Curcumin, on cognition and mood and wellbeing, in healthy individuals aged 50 to 85 years. To better understand how cognitive and mood benefits might be achieved the study will also investigate the effects of curcumin on cardiovascular function and a range of blood markers of health. In a subset of participants an MRI component of the study will explore the effects of curcumin on brain function.  Finally the study will investigate whether difference in genetic make-up influence the effects of curcumin.

Participants will attend 4 study visits; a practice and screening visit at which consent will be taken, eligibility will be ensured and participants will be familiarised with study measures and procedures, and assessment visits as baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks. Participants taking part in the fMRI part of the trial will complete 2 additional assessment which, where possible, will be performed on the same day as their baseline and 12 week study visits.
