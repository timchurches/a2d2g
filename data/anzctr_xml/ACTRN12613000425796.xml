    <interventions>Office hysteroscopy for evaluation of endocervix in cases with CIN

The office hysteroscopic procedure is carried out with:
1. A 4-mm continuous-flow office operative hysteroscope with a 30-degree rod lens 1.9-mm optic.
2. A xenon light source of 175 W. Because the endocervix
is generally small-sized, the light intensity should be as low as possible to avoid the reflection phenomenon, which may hamper the identification of the acetowhite areas.
3. A digital endo-camera
4. A high resolution monitor .
5. Distension of the endocervix is obtained using saline solution.  

The next step is the application of 2 mL of 5% acetic acid on the endocervix through the operative channel.  

a vaginoscopic approach may be used. The vagina may be distended by introducing the fluid distention medium through the hysteroscope placed into the lower vagina at the same pressure used for the subsequent distention of the uterine cavity. As soon as the external uterine orifice is visualized, the irrigation of saline is stopped and a syringe with 2 mL of 5% acetic acid is connected to the inflow channel of the hysteroscope. In this way the impregnation of the cervix may be directly and clearly visualized, provided that a few minutes elapse before reconnecting the continuous-flow irrigation to the hysteroscope
the duration of patient observations depending on the results of gold standard histopathology (period from diagnostic hysteroscopy till results of histopathology)
The observation period of the trial will be 6 months

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>assessment of the ability of office hysteroscopy for diagnosis of endocervical lesions. The assessment based on visualization of the endocervical abnormalities by office hysteroscopy and after application of 5 % acetic acid to delineate the abnormalities. these finding will be compared to endocervical curettage. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of examination, all abnormalities will be recorded and will be compared with the results of endocervical curettage. At the end of the study the overall results of hysteroscopy will be compared with the overall results of endocervical curettage.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will be performed with statistical software (SPSS version 20, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). The data will be assessed with visual (histogram and probability plot) and analytical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to evaluate
normal distribution. The ?Â² test (chi-square test) or Fisher exact test will be used to compare proportions of outcome grades in different groups. Pearson product moment correlation will be performed for correlations. Statistical significance is defined by P = .05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of our study is to evaluate the role of office hysteroscopy (endocervicoscopy) as a new technique for the diagnostic work-up of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. This technique combines, conventional hysteroscopic instrumentation with the colposcopic classification system for the evaluation of the endocervical mucosa</summary>
