  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective of the study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF) monotherapy versus emtricitabine (FTC) plus tenofovir DF
      combination therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) in participants in the
      immune tolerant phase of HBV infection.

      The efficacy of tenofovir DF monotherapy versus FTC plus tenofovir DF combination therapy was
      evaluated for suppression of the virus (decrease in HBV DNA), serological response
      (generation of antibodies to the virus), biochemical response (changes in liver enzymes), and
      the development of drug-resistant mutations. The safety and tolerability of both tenofovir DF
      monotherapy and FTC plus tenofovir DF were evaluated by routine monitoring for adverse events
      and changes in laboratory parameters.

      Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive tenofovir DF monotherapy or FTC plus
      tenofovir DF. All subjects were to continue on blinded study medication until the last
      subject reached Week 192. Participants who permanently discontinued study drug (on or before
      Week 192) were followed for a 24-week treatment-free follow-up period, or until initiation of
      alternative HBV therapy, whichever occurred first. Subjects who discontinued study drug on or
      after Week 48 because of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss or seroconversion to
      antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), however, were to have returned for their
      regularly scheduled through Week 192 and every 16 weeks thereafter until the last subject
      reached Week 192.</summary>
