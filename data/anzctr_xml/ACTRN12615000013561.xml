  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a Phase IIa, double-blind, randomized, 2 period crossover study in patients with PHN Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either POH001-05 (23.4 mg of oxycodone in a 40 cm2 patch) or placebo (vehicle) patch in Treatment Period 1. The patch will be applied on Visit Day 1 and will remain for 72 hours. Between Treatment Period 1 and 2, there will be a 10 day washout period. During Treatment Period 2, patients will cross over to receive the second treatment (i.e., either POH001-05 patch or vehicle patch), whichever treatment was not received during Treatment Period 1. The second patch will remain 72 hours. Each patch will be assessed for adherence and durability before it is removed by study site staff.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Approximately 46 screened patients are needed (assuming an approximate 30-40 percent screen failure rate) to yield approximately 28 randomized patients (assuming a 20 percent drop-out rate) for a total of 22 evaluable patients (11 patients per treatment sequence). These calculations are based on a mean difference in NPRS at 72 hours of 1.4 units in the vehicle arm and 1.8 units in the TPM (registered trademark) /Oxycodone arm; a 1-sided test significance level of 0.05 with 80 percent power; standard deviation (SD) of 0.7; and a crossover analysis of variance (ANOVA) sqrt (MSE) of 0.495.

All statistical processing will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS(registered trademark)) unless otherwise stated. Analyses will be of a descriptive nature. Descriptive statistics will consist of, summary statistics (number of observations, mean, standard error (SE), SD, minimum, median, and maximum) for continuous data and frequency counts and percentages for categorical data. For systemic exposure data, descriptive statistics will also include the coefficient of variation. Depending on the study population, data compiled up to the point of discontinuation will be used for analysis. Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study treatment will be included in all analyses (up to the date of withdrawal), regardless of the duration of treatment. There will be no imputation for missing data. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group. All data will be presented in patient data listings</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research study to see if the TPM (registered trademark)/Oxycodone Patch (study drug patch) is safe and effective in treating participants with PHN compared to a patch which contains no Oxycodone but includes all of the other non-active components of the TPM (registered trademark)/Oxycodone Patch (placebo patch or vehicle patch). 
Oxycodone is an analgesic (pain reliever) which has been used, in tablet form, for the treatment of longstanding (chronic) moderate to severe pain, for many years. In tablet form it acts via the blood system. The patch also contains a form of vitamin E, called Tocopheryl Phosphate Mix (TPM), which can help some medications absorb across the skin.  
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the study drug patch provides pain relief when applied to an affected painful area in participants with PHN when compared to a vehicle patch. The study drug patch is designed to treat the area of reported pain locally (at the site of pain in the skin) rather than systemically (via the blood system).  This TPM helps the drug to enter through the skin. 
Study participants will be required to wear a patch containing oxycodone (study drug patch) on one occasion and a vehicle patch on another occasion. Participants will be required to wear each patch for 3 days (approx. 72 hours) at the site of worst PHN pain. 

In addition, this study will determine how safe the patch is:
 1. measuring the level of oxycodone that enters into blood (this is expected to be low and thus avoiding issues associated with euphoria, sedation and addiction)
2. monitoring symptoms that may be experienced while wearing the patch
3. observing results from assessments carried out during the course of the study
