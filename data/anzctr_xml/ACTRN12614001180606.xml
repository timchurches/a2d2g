  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed research will be an open label, single dose pharmacokinetic study. Each volunteer will receive a single dose of metformin 500mg orally followed by 7 blood samples over 24 hours. The sampling schedule is based on the known pharmacokinetics of metformin (half life ~ 6 hours) with intensive sampling in the first 2 hours to capture drug absorption, followed by further sampling over 24 hours to capture drug excretion (e.g. 15-30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 90-120 minutes, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours for the measurement of metformin, gentamicin, creatinine (3 samples), urate (3 samples), and cystatin C (1 sample)).  Timed urine samples (0-3, 38, 824 hours) will be collected to determine the renal clearances of metformin, urate, creatinine, and gentamicin.  Note that urate will provide a control for tubular function. In addition, we
will administer a single dose of gentamicin 40mg by IV injection at the same time as the metformin dose. This a commonly used antibiotic but it being used here as a marker for glomerular filtration rate
(GFR). This will provide an accurate control for GFR. Subjects will be stratified into 3 groups based on kidney
function; eGFR 1) &gt; 60mL/min, 2) &gt;30 and =&lt; 60mL/min, 3) =&lt;30mL/min. This will allow us to quantify the impact of
different stages of renal disease on metformin renal handling. We intend to recruit 45 subjects (15/group). </interventions>

We intend to recruit 15 subjects into each renal function group for a total of 45 subjects. There are no published studies designed to investigate the relationship between GFR and metformin renal clearance and therefore no basis for a sample size calculation. A previous study looking at the pathways of renal drug elimination using a cocktail of markers included 12 subjects total, while a previous study by our research group examining tubular function in those with impaired renal function used 45 subjects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Metformin is the first-line treatment for Type-2 diabetes. There is currently no clear consensus on the safe prescribing of metformin in patients with impaired renal function and concern that these individuals are at increased risk of serious side effects. The renal handling of metformin in patients with kidney dysfunction is poorly understood. This project aims to clarify the impact of kidney function on metformin renal handling. This information will provide the scientific basis for a revised dosing guideline for patients with renal impairment.</summary>
