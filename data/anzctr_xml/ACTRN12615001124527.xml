  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prescription of an early active movement arm program to patients with arm weakness in the acute stage post-stroke by a Physiotherapist. This will be provided in addition to usual care and routine therapy.
An evidence-based algorithm in the form of an smartphone application developed by an international working party including the applicant will be used to guide the intervention for the intervention group. This algorithm directs the therapist towards the most appropriate evidence-based therapy interventions based on the amount of residual movement in their affected arm (www.viatherapy.org/about). This will allow for the most appropriate therapy to be provided to the patient.
The research physiotherapist will prescribe a set of exercises, based on this approach, and teach them to the patient with the assistance of either their carer (where available) or the research assistant. Participants will be asked to complete their exercises for one hour each day, every day for 4 weeks. They will complete an exercise diary, and their exercises will be reviewed, progressed and updated weekly. </interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care and routine therapy provided by a Physiotherapist. This currently involves daily physiotherapy in the acute hospital, and daily sessions of up to hour each for physiotherapy and occupational therapy on transfer to the rehab setting.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will determine feasibility with a composite outcome including number of sessions completed and total exercise time, time spent in supervised therapy with the research assistant or caregiver, and adherence to the program. 
Participants will be required to keep a diary of exercises completed, and duration of each exercise session, with the aim of achieving 60 mins of exercise each day. This diary will be reviewed by the research physiotherapist each week, as the exercise program is updated.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The proposed analysis of this study will involve using descriptive statistics. These will describe the amount of use and quality of use with the arm. A between-group analysis using mixed models to examine time effects, group effects and group by time effects will be conducted. As there has been no research published in this area, using family members to assist with early arm rehab, we will be conducting a pilot study with 10 participants in each group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose of study is to explore the effect of an early intensive arm movement program in patients who have suffered a stroke within the past four weeks, in order to see if greater neuroplastic changes are driven resulting in improved functional recovery.

It is hypothesised that an increase in the amount of arm movement by patients in the intervention (early intensive arm movement) group will have greater arm functional recovery compared to patients in the control (usual care and routine therapy) group.</summary>
