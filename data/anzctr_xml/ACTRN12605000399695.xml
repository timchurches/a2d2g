  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study consists of a randomised six-month dietary intervention with individuals assigned to either the intervention group (HVM diet) or the control group (High carbohydrate, low fat: HCLF diet).  Each group receives individualised dietary education and is provided with written dietary education materials.  Subjects attend for review at 3 and 6 months, and are also contacted by telephone after the first month.  Outcome measures are assessed at study entry and after six months of dietary therapy.   Measures of glycaemic control and standard lipids are analysed and analysis undertaken for assessment of biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell function as well as markers of dietary adherence.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Odd numbers are assigned to the intervention group (HVM diet) while even numbers are assigned to the control group (HCLF diet). Randomisation is noted blinded as the clinician provides dietary education to enrolled participants and participants upon allocation are aware of the dietary intervention that they have been assigned to.</concealment>
    <sequence>As subjects were recruited they were systematically assigned a random number moving downward on the first of Table8, Random Sampling Numbers Cambridge Elementary Statistical Tablesâ¿¿, Cambridge University Press.</sequence>
