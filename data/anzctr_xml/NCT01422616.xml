  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Low-dose rtPA
Treatment: drugs - Standard-dose rtPA
Other interventions - Intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering
Other interventions - BP management policies

Experimental: Low-dose rtPA (Recruitment completed in August 2015) - low-dose 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 60 mg) i.v. rtPA

Active Comparator: Standard-dose rtPA (Recruitment completed in August 2015) - standard-dose 0.9 mg/kg (maximum of 90 mg) i.v. rtPA

Experimental: Early intensive BP lowering - The trial is an assessment of BP lowering management strategies, using routinely available drugs.
Intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering to a target systolic BP range 130-140 mmHg within one hour and to maintain this level for at least 72 hours (or until hospital discharge or death if this should occur earlier). A standardised i.v. BP lowering regimen using locally available and approved i.v. BP lowering agents (e.g. Labetalol Hydrochloride, Metoprolol tartrate, Hydralazine Hydrochloride, Glycerol Trinitrate, Phentolamine mesylate, Nicardipine, Urapidil, Esmolol, Clonidine, Enalaprilat, Nitroprusside) will be used, commenced in the emergency department and later in a high dependency area (e.g. acute stroke or neurointensive care unit) as is usual for patients receiving rtPA.

Active Comparator: Control / guideline-based BP management - The trial is an assessment of BP lowering management strategies, using routinely available drugs.
Patients allocated to the control group will receive management of BP that is based on a standard guideline, as published by the American Heart Association (AHA). For this group, the attending clinician may consider commencing BP treatment if the systolic level is greater than 180 mmHg, however and the first line treatment will be oral (including nasogastric if required) and/or transdermal routes. Should control of systolic BP not be achieved via these routes, i.v. treatment may be started until the target systolic BP of 180 mmHg is achieved.


Treatment: drugs: Low-dose rtPA
Patients allocated to low-dose will receive 0.6 mg/kg (maximum of 60 mg) i.v. (15% bolus [maximum bolus dose of 9mg] and 85% infusion over 60 mins) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA).

Treatment: drugs: Standard-dose rtPA
Patients allocated to standard-dose will receive 0.9 mg/kg (maximum of 90 mg) i.v. (10% bolus and 90% infusion over 60 mins) rtPA.

Other interventions: Intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering
Intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering to a target systolic BP range 130-140 mmHg within one hour and to maintain this level for at least 72 hours (or until hospital discharge or death if this should occur earlier). A standardised i.v. BP lowering regimen using locally available and approved i.v. BP lowering agents will be used, commenced in the emergency department and later in a high dependency area (e.g. acute stroke or neurointensive care unit) as is usual for patients receiving rtPA.
The trial is an assessment of BP lowering management strategies, using routinely available drugs. There is some flexibility in the use of particular BP lowering agents to achieve BP targets.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ENCHANTED is an independent, investigator initiated, international collaborative,
      quasi-factorial randomised controlled trial involving a package of 2 linked comparative
      randomised treatment arms, which aims to address 4 key questions in patients eligible for
      thrombolysis in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. (1) Does low-dose (0.6 mg/kg)
      intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) provide equivalent
      benefits compared to standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) rtPA? (2) Does intensive blood pressure (BP)
      lowering (130-140 mmHg systolic target) improve outcomes compared to the current guideline
      recommended level of BP control (180 mmHg systolic target)? (3) Does low-dose (0.6 mg/kg)
      intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) reduce the risk of
      symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH)? (4) Does the addition of intensive BP lowering
      to thrombolysis with rtPA reduce the risk of any intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)?

      The rtPA dose arm of the study addressing questions (1) and (3) concluded with a publication
      of the results in May 2016. The BP intensity arm of the study is ongoing.</summary>
