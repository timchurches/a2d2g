  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise: progressive supervised resistance exercises
(e.g. upper and lower body resistance based
exercise using weight machines) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling, rowing etc.) twice weekly (60 minutes session) for 12 weeks. These sessions will be undertaken in small groups of participants (up to 6) and will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. Participants will continue their usual care for prostate cancer including treatment with the drug Lucrin for the duration of the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: usual care delay exercise group. Participants in this group will receive usual care for 12 weeks then will receive the 12 week exercise intervention following the completion of the initial usual care period. Usual care will be determined on a case by case basis by the individual participants oncologists.</comparator>

    <summary>This study looks at the role of exercise in improving the quality of life in prostate cancer patients commencing treatment with the drug Lucrin. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are a man with prostate cancer which has not spread to distant sites (metastases) and you are about to begin therapy with the hormonal treatment Lucrin. 

Trial details: 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will take part in progressive supervised resistance &amp; aerobic exercises (e.g. upper and lower body resistance-based exercise using weight machines as well as aerobic exercise including walking, jogging, cycling and rowing) twice weekly (60 minutes session) for 12 weeks. The second group will receive usual care only for 12 weeks and then will take part in the 12 week exercise program. 

Quality of life will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).  Physical and muscle function, body composition and psychological distress will also be assessed.</summary>
