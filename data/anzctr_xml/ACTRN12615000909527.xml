  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the rate of progression free survival (PFS) at 12 months in pNETs, and at 24 months in mNETs. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Progression free survival (PFS) will be measured from date of patient randomisation to the date of first evidence of disease progression, the occurrence of new disease or death from any cause.  In patients who received treatment on study without a progression date or death, the PFS will be censored on the date of last clinical assessment, tumour assessment or enrolment, whichever is the later event. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Object tumour response rate (OTRR) will be defined as the number of patients with documented partial or complete response (PR or CR) divided by the number of patients evaluable for response as defined as per the RECIST version 1.1 criteria.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Objective tumour response rate (OTRR) will be assessed retrospectively at 12 months in pNETS, and 24 months in mNETS participants. In order to be considered evaluable, participants must have received at least one cycle of therapy and had their disease re-evaluated afterwards. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be defined as the number of patients with documented partial or complete response or stable disease (PR or CR or SD) divided by the number of patients evaluable for response as defined by the RECIST version 1.1 criteria. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be assessed retrospectively at 12 months in pNETS, and 24 months in mNETS participants. In order to be considered evaluable, participants must have received at least one cycle of therapy and had their disease re-evaluated afterwards. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine in each treatment group overall survival (OS). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the interval from the date of registration to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known follow-up alive.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine in each treatment group safety (rates of adverse events).  The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (NCI CTCAE v4.03) will be used to classify and grade the intensity of adverse events after each treatment cycle.  Acute adverse events are those occurring within 30 days after completion of CAPTEM or 90 days after completion of PRRT or PRRT/CAPTEM treatment, classified and graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be assessed at D1 &amp; D29 of each cycle (all treatment arms), at end of treatment (30 days after final CAPTEM/PRRT+ 90 days after final PRRT), and then 2-monthly during follow-up to 12 months (pNETS), and 24 months (mNETS). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine in each treatment group Quality of Life (QoL). Questionnaires for Quality of Life (HR-QOL) assessment are EORTC QLQ C30, QLQ-GINET21 and EQ-5D-5L.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>QoL will be assessed prior to D1 of each cycle every 8 weeks until disease progression. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine in each treatment group resource utilisation and cost effectiveness. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used, and Medicare (MBS) and PBS data will be obtained.</outcome>
      <timepoint>EQ-5D-5L will be assessed prior to D1 of each cycle until the end of the follow-up period (ie: 12 months pNETS, 24 months mNETS).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Cohort A - pNETs will require 90 patients with 60 patients receiving PRRT/CAPTEM and 30 patients receiving CAPTEM alone.  This will provide an 80% power with 95% confidence to exclude a PFS rate of 60% in favour of a more interesting rate of 77% at 12 months. 
Therefore in Cohort B - mNETs, 50 patients will receive PRRT/CAPTEM and 25 patients PRRT alone.  This will provide an 80% power with 95% confidence to exclude a PFS rate of 52% in favour of 70% at 24 months, which would warrant further investigation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The CONTROL NETS study aims to determine the activity of capecitabine + temozolomide (CAPTEM)/peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), alone and in combination, in both pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETS) and mid-gut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETS) patients. 

Who is it for? 
Participants must be at least 18 years of age, with advanced, non-operable mNETS or pNETS who have received 2 or fewer lines of treatment for their disease. 

Study details 
The study involves randomly allocating (by chance) participants to receive treatment. pNETS patients will receive either CAPTEM alone, or the experimental combination of CAPTEM/PRRT, whilst mNETS patients will receive either PRRT alone or CAPTEM/PRRT. Participants have a 2 in 3 chance of being allocated to the PRRT/CAPTEM treatment arm. Treatment on each arm continues for 32 weeks, followed by 12 months of follow-up (pNETS), and 24 months (mNETS). CAPTEM is chemotherapy (Capecitabine and Temozolomide) taken as tablets. PRRT is an injection of a radioactive compound called Lutate which is given into a vein on 4 occasions during treatment. Study participants will be asked to come to the clinic for study visits between 9 to 12 occasions during the treatment stage, depending on which treatment they receive. The visits will vary in length between 2 and 6 hours. CONTROL NETS will look at rates of progression free survival, overall survival, adverse event rates, quality of life, and cost-benefit analyses across both cohorts. 

It is hoped that this study will shed light on the activity of the combined CAPTEM/PRRT treatment in patients with pNETS/mNETS, and inform the design of larger future clinical trials aimed at determining the best treatment for these diseases. </summary>
