  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will involve 4 stages:
1.	Pre-study period (2 weeks)
2.	Study period 1 (intervention 1) (6 weeks)
3.	Washout period (4 weeks)
4.	Study period 2 (intervention 2) (6 weeks)
In the pre-study period patients will have measurements taken and discuss with the dietitian about healthy eating for kidney disease. During the study period 1 (intervention 1)  the patient will be provided with either placebo powder and tablets (these are designed to have no physical effect) or prebiotic powder and probiotic tablets to take for six weeks. During intervention 2, patients will crossover to the other powder and tablets (ie: if they received placebo in the first six weeks, they will receive the prebiotic powder and probiotic tablets in the second six weeks and vice versa).

Probiotic dose= 40billion CFU 2 x daily
Prebiotic dose= 7.5g 2 x daily

Adherence to the supplements will be monitored through a supplement count and weighing, and adherence to a stable diet will be monitored using 24hr food recalls</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>With 1:1 recruiting, we will require 26 patients to be recruited and to complete both arms. Accounting for 20% dropout, dialysis commencement or mortality (adjustment factor 1.56), 40 patients will be recruited.  This sample size is based on an alpha of 5% and power of 80%.
 The data will be analysed in accordance with intention-to-treat analysis, using Stata Statistical Software v12. The results will be presented as difference in change (95% CI) between the treatments at the end of each 6 week intervention (controlled for baseline level).</statisticalmethods>
