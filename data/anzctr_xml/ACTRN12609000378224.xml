  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: Verbal and video-tape feedback after the client completes a functional task. The participant and the therapist will watch the video of their functional task completion, and rate the client's performance using a standard rating form.

This group will complete four intervention sessions of an hour's length, held within 4-6 weeks.  The functional task is a hot meal preparation, with the participant's choice of spaghetti bolognaise or pizza.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2: Verbal feedback after the client completes a functional task. The participant and the therapist will review the participant's functional completion of the task, and use a standard form to rate the participant's performance.

Group 3: Experiential feedback (standard treatment) after the client completes a functional task.

Both groups will complete four intervention sessions of an hour's length, held within 4-6 weeks.  The functional task is a hot meal preparation, with the participant's choice of spaghetti bolognaise or pizza.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Online awareness will be operationalised as the number of errors made by the participant during a standardised functional task. Following the guidelines of Ownsworth et al. (submitted) errors during task performance will be classified as self-corrected errors or therapist-corrected errors. The number participant "checks" (i.e. asking the therapist for directions or confirmation) will also be recorded. An Error Self Regulation Form has been developed for this purpose and will be completed blinded assessor after watching the videotape recordings of the participant's performance</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Main Objective:

To determine the effectiveness of video feedback in improving on-line awareness and adjustment in persons with traumatic brain injury compared to verbal feedback and experiential feedback only.

Hypothesis:

1. Treatment Group A (video &amp; verbal feedback) &amp; Treatment Group B (verbal feedback) will demonstrate greater improvement in on-line awareness compared to the control (experiential feedback) group.

2. Treatment Group A (video &amp; verbal feedback) will demonstrate greater improvement in on-line awareness than Treatment Group B (verbal feedback).

3. Gains in on-line awareness will be maintained for Treatment Group A (video &amp; verbal feedback) at four-week follow-up.

4. No hypotheses have been generated about the impact of the treatment on measures of intellectual awareness (AQ) or emotional status (DASS), as these are exploratory variables.</summary>
