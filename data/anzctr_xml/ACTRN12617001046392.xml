    <statisticalmethods>The number of volunteers chosen was standard for a PK/PD study of this type (n=12). Treatment arms were compared for common PK parameters and for the free concentrations achieved for 30%, 50% and 70% of the usual dose intervals.    Statistical analysis was undertaken using Graphpad Prism (student t-test and bioequivalence testing if no difference was identified).  Modelling was undertaken using Monolix to predict steady-state pharmacokinetics. The probability of target attainment (PTAs) for each arm were plotted against a range of MICs of common skin-infecting bacteria</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Flucloxacillin is usually recommended to be given on an empty stomach, because food reduces and delays peak concentrations.  It is now known that for penicillins, the time the free (unbound) concentrations are above the minimum inhibitory concentrations is more important for bacterial kill than peak concentrations.  In this study, the effects of food on flucloxacillin PK-PD were assess using a modern assay to accurately quantify free flucloxacillin concentrations.  Total and free flucloxacillin concentrations were measured for 12 hours after a single oral dose of flucloxacillin  1000 mg, after a standardized breakfast and in a fasting state separated by a week's washout.
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were compared in the fed and fasting states.
Food reduced the total and free flucloxacillin  area under the curve by about 20%, and the peak by about 50%, and increased the time to reach peak concentrations by approximately 2-fold.   These changes did not importantly impact on parameters such as free time above MIC and probability of target attainment suggesting that flucloxacillin can  be taken with food without compromising efficacy in most cases.</summary>
