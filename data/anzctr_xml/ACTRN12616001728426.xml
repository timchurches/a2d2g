    <interventions>Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS).

iTBS is a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique. It involves the introduction of weak electrical current in the brain, which is achieved by delivering powerful but brief magnetic pulses to the scalp with a plastic-coated metallic coil.

The intervention will be delivered by a nurse who is highly experienced in the application of rTMS (minimum 2 years experience). iTBS will be administered at the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre (MAPrc), St Kilda Rd, Melbourne. 

Each of the two arms of rTMS will be administered each consecutive weekday for a four-week period (e.g., 20 treatments in total for each of the two treatment arms, which will be six-months apart).

One arm involves stimulation of right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), while the other treatment arm involves stimulation of bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The site of stimulation (i.e., where the coil will be positioned) will be determined by co-registering the participants head to their structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan, and determining the scalp positions that sit over the target brain regions (rTPJ and dmPFC).

Each iTBS treatment will last for 3 minutes and 10 seconds. Including setup time, each iTBS treatment is expected to take approximately 10 minutes. 

TBS will be delivered at an intensity equivalent to 70% of the participants resting motor threshold (RMT), which is the minimum stimulator intensity required to produce a discernable hand-muscle response following a single TMS pulse delivered to the primary motor cortex. 

In terms of stimulation frequency, iTBS involves the administration of 3 TMS pulses at 50Hz, repeated 5 times per second, for 2 seconds, followed by an 8 second rest. This is repeated until a total of 600 pulses have been delivered.

Treating nurses will use a standardised treatment form to monitor adherence (e.g., number of sessions attended, percentage of protocol delivered).</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment will be iTBS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). This is an active control. 

iTBS to dmPFC will be administered for 3 minutes and 10 seconds each consecutive weekday for a four-week period (20 treatments in total).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Impairments in social relating are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Neuroimaging research suggest that this may be underpinned by abnormal activation with the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), which is a brain region that is important for social understanding (including recognising other's mental states and making social inferences). We have previously demonstrated that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to another part of the "social brain" network, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), can improve social aspects of ASD. Our recent neuroimaging work, however, suggests that rTPJ is a more appropriate target than dmPFC.

This study will involve theta burst stimulation (TBS), which is a newer form of rTMS that has several advantages over traditional rTMS protocols. TBS treatments are quick (3 minutes) and delivered at a low stimulation intensity (thereby reducing participant discomfort).

Adolescents and young adults with ASD (n = 20) will completed a randomised, single-blind cross over study comparing TBS to the rTPJ with TBS to the dmPFC. Participants will be administered intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), which can enhance brain activity and strengthen brain network connections. Participants will undergo various assessments before and after undergoing each of the TBS conditions, including magnetic resonance imaging, clinical interviews, and computerised experimental psychology tasks.</summary>
