  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to one of 2 diets for 10 weeks. The diets will be:
1) a control diet based on best practices for nutritional counselling and the New Zealand dietary guidelines and food pyramid


Participants will be required to maintain their baseline weight for the first 4 weeks. From  week 5 participants will be counselled to eat as much as required to feel satisfied while adhering to their dietary regime.

Participants will meet with a study researcher on a weekly basis for 20 minute nutritional counselling sessions and to be weighed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insulin resistance (IR) is an underlying cause of most cases of type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in New Zealand is estimated to be 4% in the general New Zealand population and as high as 12% in Maori and Pacific Peoples. These are likely to be underestimates and the prevalence is further increased when including estimates of undiagnosed cases. Furthermore diabetes is believed to be increasing at an alarming rate in New Zealand and throughout the world. Given that IR is associated with severe health risks including obesity, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia (abnormal blood fats), raised blood sugar and damage to blood vessels it is not surprising that insulin resistance is also associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in both diabetic and non-diabetic adults. 

Lifestyle interventions indicate that improvements in insulin sensitivity of 20-30% may be achievable. However we currently have little indication of which dietary modifications will achieve the greatest change. This study will attempt to determine the extent to which IR and other related risk factors for cardiovascular disease can be reduced by a diet high in both dietary fibre and dietary protein, both with and without weight loss.</summary>
