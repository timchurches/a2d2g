  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten infants classified as less-skilled and more-skilled reachers were evaluated both at the acquisition of reaching and after one month of spontaneous practice in three different body orientations: supine, reclined and seated positions. The infant was positioned in a baby chair. In each position, before starting the toy presentation, a 20seconds interval was allowed for infant to get used to the position. The first toy was offered for 2 minutes at the infant's midline, at shoulders height. After reach, the toy was taken away and presented again. The same procedure was follow with a second toy. The total time of the experiment was about 13 min.</interventions>

      <outcome>higher frequency of unimanual reaching in seated position and hands next to the body in reclined and seated positions for less-skilled reachers</outcome>
      <timepoint>Acquisition of reaching, i.e. in the first lab visit in which reaching occurred (at 4- or 5-month-old).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>higher frequencies of unimanual reaches (supine and seated), and hands next to the body (reclined) for less-skilled reachers. More reaches followed by grasping (seated) and hands away from the body (supine) for more-skilled reachers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After one month of spontaneous practice, i.e. during the subsequent lab visit after reaching ocurred (5- or 6-month-old).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
