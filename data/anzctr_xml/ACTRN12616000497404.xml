    <interventions>Description of intervention(s) / exposure: The aim of this study is to evaluate a culturally tailored 8 week physical activity intervention among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults in rural communities. The objectives will be to measure overall levels of physical activity and step counts, metabolic markers, perceived quality of life and other health behaviours and outcomes before, immediately after and 12 weeks after the intervention. The program will be delivered through one-hour, face-to-face group sessions, four times per week for eight weeks. Two of the weekly session will moderate intensity sessions, will be delivered with the assistance of the principal investigator who is a qualified Sport and Exercise Scientist. The moderate intensity session will include circuit training and team sports, with adaptations made to incorporate individual fitness levels. The remaining two sessions will self-paced low intensity walking sessions (male and female groups) will be conducted by community leaders. Involving community leaders is important to assist with the eventual changeover and sustainability of the program. Moderate and low intensity will be alternated during the intervention period. Each session will have a sign in sheet to monitor the program dose responses and implementation fidelity. The activities will be conducted at free community facilities such as walking tracks and football fields so there is no cost to participants. A cost benefit analysis will be conducted to determine if the project was 'value for money'. A focus group will be conducted after the intervention to explore participants experiences with the program and suggestions for future programs.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study will consist of an intervention group and a wait-listed controlled group. Both groups will receive an 8 week physical activity program. The control group will receive the physical activity program immediately after the intervention group have completed the post program data collection. </comparator>

      <outcome>Premedical and lifestyle questionnaire:
The pre medical questionnaire includes questions about participants current state of health such as illness and injuries, family medical history, their own medical history and if they had been told not to participate in exercise. We have added questions on socio-economic status, education level and number of dependent children in the household. Health behaviour questions, such as fruit and vegetable and alcohol intake, were taken from national surveys such as the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey 2012-13 and the 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey. The survey questions will allow for more comparable results for the community data against national averages.

    <inclusivecriteria>The sampling frame is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 18-45 years old who have a chronic disease or a risk factor for chronic disease and are residing in the communities of interest. Risk factors for chronic diseases are based on the definitions by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare guidelines, such as having a BMI of/or greater than 30, waist circumference of/or greater than 94 centimetres for men and 80 centimetres for women and less than 150minutes of physical activity per week. </inclusivecriteria>

    <designfeatures>The intervention is an 8-week physical activity program to be conducted in two Indigenous communities using a pragmatic study design. This intervention is considered a complex intervention due to the large number of discretionary behaviours and actions required between the sites. Flexibility and tailoring of the program in the delivery and reception will be important factors for success. During discussions with the Indigenous mentors, it was agreed between the participating communities that an appropriate way to standardise the intervention would be through the number of sessions and the intensity. There will be four physical activity sessions per week, two with low intensity and two with a moderate intensity. The choice of activities will depend on what is most appropriate for the community and for the participants.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>Although this is a non-randomised controlled trial statistical analysis and reporting will follow the SPIRIT guidelines. Participants characteristics including the outcome measures of the intervention and control communities will be compared at baseline to detect any potential confounding variables. Numerical data will be compared using a Students t-test if symmetrical and Mann-Wilcoxon test is skewed; and categorical data will be compared using Chi-squared tests. 

The main outcome measure is the difference in the distance walked in the six minute walk test. Potential confounding will be further investigated using Analysis of Covariance. If the main outcome measure is not fitting assumptions of normality, it will be log transformed for the multivariate analysis. Further, multiple linear regression analyses will be used to examine associations between health behavioural variables and differences in the distance in the six minute walk test.

Statistical significance will be assumed when p-values are less than 0.05.The statistical analyses will be undertaken using Stata 13.

The group sample size of 42 per community is estimated to achieve 81% power to detect a significant difference in six-minute walk test distance at a p-value of 0.05, on the assumptions participants will increase their walking distance by 50 metres. An additional 8 participants per group will be included to account for attrition, making the total sample of 50 participants per community. </statisticalmethods>
