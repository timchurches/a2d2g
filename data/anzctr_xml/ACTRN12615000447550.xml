    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data from all patients who match Study inclusion criteria (but not exclusion criteria) and receive &gt;1 dose of Pomalidomide will be analysed on a modified intention-to-treat basis for safety and efficacy.
The primary outcome variable will be the proportion of patients who respond (PR, VGPR, CR, sCR) to pomalidomide/ dexamethasone salvage therapy. Currently there are 33 active patients on the LEOPARD study. Most of them will eventually develop progressive disease.  A sample size of 30 (n=30) is expected. 
Simon's two-stage design will be used. An estimated response probability of standard salvage therapy with Thalidomide Dexamethasone of 0.35 and an estimated response probability with study drug Pomalidomide Dexamethasone of 0.60 are used. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.35 will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage, 9 patients will be accrued. If there are 3 or fewer responses (partial responses or better) in these 9 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 21 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 30. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 14 or more responses are observed in 30 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 0.8 when the true response rate to pomalidomide is 0.60. The first major analysis of results will take place after all patients have either come off trial (due to death, progression, intolerance or patient choice) or received 12 months of protocol treatment. A further analysis will take place after all patients have had a minimum of 2.5 years follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate whether ongoing treatment with prednisolone and dexamethasone can supress multiple myeloma as post-autograft maintenance therapy.
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have received lenalidomide maintenance as part of the LEOPARD study as immediate therapy prior to relapse or progressive disease. 
Study details.
All participants in this study will receive a therapy consisting of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone. Both will be taken orally at a 28 day cycle, Pomalidomide at a dose of 4mg (starting dose) daily from Days 1 to 21, and Dexamethasone at a dose of 40mg (starting dose) weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, 22. Blood tests will be taken every cycle (28 days) to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy of the treatment. A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at the beginning of the study and whole body x-ray will be taken at the beginning and end of the study. Participants will be followed-up until they complete the study to determine response rates, survival and safety and toxicity of the this treatment. </summary>
