  <interventions>
    <interventions>A  four times daily topical application (0.5 g per application) of 2 g gel containing 60 mg of active AKP-11 on affected joints for 7 days to arthritis patients. An adherence will be monitored by used and unused sachets return.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of AKP-11 gel. The safety endpoints are; adverse events (AEs). physical examination. vital signs, ECG, laboratory assessment (haematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), an application site irritation assessment. An AEs can be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptoms such as skin irritation, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Patient Global Assessment of Response to
Treatment (PGART) from baseline</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 3, 7 &amp; 14</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in pain score from baseline. The pain severity score represents a daily self-assessment by each participant of the severity of pain in 11-Point Numerical Pain Rating Scale during the previous 24 h in the participant diaries. Participant will also be asked to complete a Pain Self Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) at each visit.

      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 1, 7 &amp; 14 </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in swelling score from baseline, using four point severity scale, where Score 0 refers to No swelling and Score 3 refers to severe swelling (bulging beyond joint margins).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 3, 7, &amp; 14</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in tenderness score from baseline, using four point severity scale, where Score 0 refers to No pain and Score 3 refers to Severe (patient states there is pain, winces and withdraws).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 3, 7 &amp; 14</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
