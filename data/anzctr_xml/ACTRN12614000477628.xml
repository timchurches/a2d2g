    <statisticalmethods>Data are presented as mean +/- (SD) for normally distributed data. Baseline characteristics and outcomes across the groups were compared using the Student's t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for nominal data. All analysis has been calculated using SPSS V.16. A P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

In deciding sample size we assumed that respiratory complications in obese children with recent cold will be greater than asymptomatic obese children at least by fivefold, if we assumed that complication in asymptomatic obese children will be 5% so we expected incidence of 25% complications in obese children with recent cold, from previous frequencies, based on a previous study on obese children without cold in our hospital a sample size of 29 children in each group will be convenient(a = 0.05 and a power of 0.8 with 95% confidence interval). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight and obesity in children become a wide problem facing anesthetists' every day. Furthermore, cold is a viral origin infection that commonly occurs in children, there is always debate for years whether to proceed in anesthetizing with general anesthesia or not for children with recent cold because risk of increase incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events. 

 this is a prospective randomly unblinded study in 64 obese children (BMI&gt;95% of child age and sex) with recent cold aged 2- 8 years undergoing elective upper airways surgery to compare the incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events in manipulation of airways either by LMA or ETT (primary outcome), early detection and optimizing the anesthetic management of complications may occur (secondary outcome).
