Irinotecan/leucovorin infusion will follow bevacizumab infusion in selected patients to receive standard dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg). Irinotecan 180 mg/m^2 together with leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 will be administered intravenously, over approximately 90 minutes and 2 hours, respectively, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, following bevacizumab infusion or at least 2 hours following the first daily dose of napabucasin if bevacizumab is not administered. 5-FU 400 mg/m^2 bolus will be administered intravenously immediately following irinotecan/leucovorin infusion, followed by 5-FU 1200 mg/m^2/day (total 2400 mg/m^2) continuous infusion. This regimen will be repeated on Day 1 of every 14 day cycle.

    <inclusivecriteria>1. Written, signed consent for trial participation must be obtained from the patient
             appropriately in accordance with applicable ICH guidelines and local and regulatory

          3. Must have failed treatment with one regimen containing a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin
             and bevacizumab for metastatic disease. All patients must have received a minimum of 6
             weeks of the first-line regimen that included bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and a
             fluoropyrimidine in the same cycle. Treatment failure is defined as radiologic
             progression during or &lt; 6 months after the last dose of first-line therapy.

          4. FOLFIRI therapy is appropriate for the patient and is recommended by the Investigator.

          5. Imaging investigations including CT/MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis or other scans as
             necessary to document all sites of disease performed within 21 days prior to

             disease are eligible.

          6. Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          7. Must be = 18 years of age.

          8. For male or female patient of child producing potential: Must agree to use
             contraception or take measures to avoid pregnancy during the study and for 180 days
             for female and male patients, of the final FOLFIRI dose. Patients who receive single
             agent napabucasin without FOLFIRI must agree to use contraception or take measures to
             avoid pregnancy during the study and for 30 days for female patients and 90 days for
             male patients, of the final napabucasin dose.

          9. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test within 5 days prior to randomization. The minimum sensitivity of the pregnancy
             test must be 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG.

         10. Must have alanine transaminase (ALT) = 3 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

             randomization.

         15. Must have platelet count = 100 x 10^9/L within 14 days prior to randomization. Must
             not have required transfusion of platelets within 1 week of baseline platelet
             assessment.

             days prior to randomization.

         17. Patient must consent to provision of, and Investigator(s) must confirm access to and
             agree to submit a representative formalin fixed paraffin block of tumor tissue in
             order that the specific correlative marker assays may be conducted. Submission of the
             tissue does not have to occur prior to randomization. Where local center regulations
             prohibit submission of blocks of tumor tissue, two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block
             and 10-30 unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue are
             preferred. Where two 2 mm cores of tumor from the block are unavailable, 10-30
             unstained slides of whole sections of representative tumor tissue alone are
             acceptable. Where no previously resected or biopsied tumor tissue exists or is
             available, on the approval of the Sponsor/designated CRO, the patient may still be
             considered eligible for the study.

         18. Patient must consent to provision of a sample of blood in order that the specific
             correlative marker assays may be conducted.

         19. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must receive protocol treatment and be followed at the participating center.
             This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits placed on patients being
             considered for this trial. Investigators must ensure that the patients randomized on
             this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, response
             assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

         20. Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 calendar days of patient randomization.

         21. The patient is not receiving therapy in a concurrent clinical study and the patient
             agrees not to participate in other interventional clinical studies during their
             participation in this trial while on study treatment. Patients participating in
             surveys or observational studies are eligible to participate in this study.</inclusivecriteria>
