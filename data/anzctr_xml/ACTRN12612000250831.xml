  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a 6 month intervention using a mobile device to collect food intake data using an investigator-designed application which users will be provided with on a study iPod touch or downloaded into the user's iPhone. The 4-day mobile device food record will be completed by all participants at baseline and at six months completion. They will take images of all food and drinks consumed over a continuous four day period. Intervention groups 1 and 2 will receive dietary feedback on the number of serves of fruits, vegetables and extra food (junk food) consumed compared with recommended serves by a message sent to their mobile phone. Intervention group 1 will also receive additional ongoing tailored nutrition messages (motivational messages on fruits, vegetables and extra foods or recipes) to promote dietary change via a mobile telephone. Arm 1: Intervention Group 1: 4-day mobile device food record, dietary feedback, weekly Text Messages for six months. Arm 2: Intervention Group 2: 4-day mobile device food record, dietary feedback, no Text Messages over six months.</interventions>

    <concealment>Names and address of current electors in WA will be selected from the electoral roll by the Data Linkage Unit (DLU), Department of Health (WA). These samples will be checked against death registrations to remove any one who has died. The names and addresses will be encrypted and burnt to disc and delivered to Quickmail who will do the recruitment letter mail out. People who wish to take part in the study will contact the research team by email, telephone or via a web form. Participants will undergo a screening questionnaire. If they meet the selection criteria, once being informed of the details of the study and if willing to participate, they will be asked to attend a training session on the use of the mobile device food record (MDFR) at Curtin University. The study objectives and requirements will be explained to the subjects who will complete an informed consent, questionnaires and 4-day MDFR. The following week, participants will return the mobile device and will then be randomized to one of three treatment groups. Six months later they will be asked to repeat the 4-day MDFR and evaluation questionnaires.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation will be conducted by a biostatistician not involved in the implementation of the trial on site (therefore not in contact with the study participants). Participants will be randomised to one of three treatment groups using a randomisation table created by computer software. A hard copy of the code will be kept in locked filing cabinet. The electronic file will be kept in a secure server.</sequence>
