Partial renal response is defined as: (1) = 50% reduction in uPCR from Day 1 (Baseline; from a 24-hour urine collection) and, (2) with one of the following: (a) uPCR of &lt; 1.0 mg/mg if the Day 1 (Baseline) was = 3.0 mg/mg, or, (b) uPCR &lt; 3.0 mg/mg if the Day 1 (Baseline) ratio was &gt; 3.0 mg/mg; and stabilization of renal function (eGFR + or - 25% of Day 1 [Baseline] or serum creatinine within normal range).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Renal Response in Participants Who Achieve Complete Renal Response at Week 52 - Duration of response was calculated as the days in between the date of Week 52 visit and the date when the participant last became complete renal responder on or before Week 52 visit.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Renal Response (Partial or Complete) in Participants Who Achieve Renal Response at Week 52 - Onset of renal response was calculated as weeks elapsed from baseline date to first visit where renal response was achieved. Complete renal response is defined as: (1) uPCR &lt;0.5 mg/mg with = 50% reduction of uPCR from Day 1 (Baseline) (from a 24 hour urine collection); and (2) eGFR within normal range. Partial renal response is defined as: (1) = 50% reduction in uPCR from Day 1 (Baseline; from a 24-hour urine collection) and, (2) with one of the following: (a) uPCR of &lt; 1.0 mg/mg if the Day 1 (Baseline) was = 3.0 mg/mg, or, (b) uPCR &lt; 3.0 mg/mg if the Day 1 (Baseline) ratio was &gt; 3.0 mg/mg; and stabilization of renal function (eGFR + or - 25% of Day 1 [Baseline] or serum creatinine within normal range).

Inactive urinary sediment is defined as: &lt; 5 RBC/HPF and &lt; 5 WBC/HPF, or within the laboratory reference range, and no cellular casts (no RBC or WBC casts).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and AEs Leading to Study Discontinuation During the Run-In Period - AEs that had an onset on or after dosing of MMF on run-in Day 1 up to the first double-blind dose, or any pre-existing condition that worsened. AE: any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE: any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.</outcome>

    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of BIIB023 as an add-on
      treatment to background therapy compared with placebo in combination with background therapy
      in the treatment of participants with active, biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB023 compared with
