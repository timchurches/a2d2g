    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The 1st primary endpoint, the number of patients who demonstrate an adverse response following 64Cu-SARTATE administration will be reported, and the point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the true underlying adverse response rate will be estimated using an exact method.
For the 2nd and 3rd primary endpoint, basic descriptive statistics (mean, median and range) will be provided for the % of injected dose and the absorbed dose for each organ of interest, as well as for the whole body dose.
As a Phase 1 trial, evaluating a single dose level, a pragmatic sample size of 10 has been decided upon to enable initial experience with this imaging agent within a reasonable period of time.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to investigate if a novel tracer called 64Cu­-SARTATE can be used to help accurately image neuroblastoma on PET/CT in pediatric patients.

Who is it for?
Paediatric patients aged 16 years or less diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma and life expectancy of 12 weeks or more are eligible for this study.

Study details
Eligible patients will be administered a single dose of 64Cu­-SARTATE and undergo whole body PET scans at 4hrs &amp; 24hrs. Complete safety evaluations will occur during visit 2 (day 2) &amp; the visit 3 (day 8). Three blinded assessors will compare the new scans to the standard of care imaging to determine if they are superior.

We hope that by testing this investigational product in paediatric patients, we can confirm that the biodistribution of 64Cu­-SARTATE will facilitate specific and more sensitive identification of malignant tissues using PET/CT scanning. It is hoped that this method can then be translated into everyday clinical care.</summary>
