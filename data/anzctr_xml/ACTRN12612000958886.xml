    <studytitle>Sitting Time AfteR Stroke (STARS). A phase II safety and feasibility trial of counselling sessions aimed at encouraging stroke survivors to 'move more and sit less'.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Can a series of counselling sessions aimed at encouraging people to 'move more and sit less' change the amount of time community-dwelling stroke survivors spend sitting each day, compared to a 'sham' intervention (counselling to optimise calcium intake).</scientifictitle>

Series of 4 counselling sessions, based on Motivational Interviewing principles with the aim of encouraging participants to 'sit less and move more'. The first counselling session will occur at the beginning of week 2 of the trial, will be provided face-to-face and will last for approximately one hour. Subsequent sessions will be provided over the phone at the beginning of week 3, 5 and 9 and will last between 10 and 30 minutes.
Outcomes will be assessed by asking participants to wear activity monitors for one week at baseline (pre-intervention) and for one week at post-intervention (week 10)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sitting for long periods of time each day is detrimental to health and has been linked with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Stroke survivors are among the most sedentary members of society and face significant barriers to maintaining recommended levels of physical activity. This project aims to investigate the safety and feasibility of an intervention aimed at encouraging stroke survivors to 'sit less and move more' each day.</summary>
