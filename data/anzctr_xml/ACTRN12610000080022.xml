  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will attend on 2 separate days. On each day they will receive a nebuliser containing 5mg of salbutamol and 500mcg of ipratropium bromide followed after 5 minutes by another nebuliser containg 5mg salbutamol only. On 1 day the nebuliser will be driven by air and on the other day by 8L of oxygen. Patients attend on 2 seperate days so washout period will be at least 24 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each subject will receive the nebulisers driven by air and oxygen as described above. Subjects will act as their own comparators</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with COPD are sensitive to the effects of oxygen, especially so those who are on oxygen at home. When these patients suffer an exacerbation they are frequently given nebulisers in the anbulance whilst in transit to hospital. Nebulisers are often driven by oxygen, sometimes large amounts. On long journeys they may be given multiple nebulisations with high flows of oxygen. Our hypothesis is that this may increase CO2 to dangerous levels whereby patients are at risk of develeoping an altered state of conciousness. We aim to compare different flows of oxygen given with nebulisers to assess what effect this has on the CO2 of patients with COPD.</summary>
