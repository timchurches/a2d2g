    <summary>This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety , efficacy and
      tolerability of the combination treatment RO5466731, RO5190591, ritonavir and Copegus
      (ribavirin) with or without RO5024048 in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. In
      Part 1, treatment-naïve patients will be randomized to receive treatment with RO5466731,
      RO5190591 plus ritonavir, and Copegus, with or without RO5024048. In Part 2, further
      treatment-naïve patients will receive a successful regimen from Part 1, or a reduced
      intensity regimen, and patients who have previously experienced null response to
      interferon-based treatment will be added to the study.</summary>
