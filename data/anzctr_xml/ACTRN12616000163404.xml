  <interventions>
    <interventions>The NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem is currently comprised of three existing online resources:

1.	HAPPINESS CENTRAL  developed by the Brain and Mind Centre (The University of Sydney) in collaboration with the Young and Well CRC, young people identify their current needs (eg. managing stress) and through the use of smart algorithms and interoperable apps and etools, develop a personalised wellbeing plan;

2.	ReachOut.com Next Step  developed by ReachOut.com Australia, The University of Melbourne and 13 youth service partners in collaboration with the Young and Well CRC, ReachOut.com Next Step is a web-based tool that uses creative algorithms designed to help young people work out whats going on, find free and paid support services, as well as suggest practical tips for immediate use;

3.	Mental Health eClinic  developed by the Brain and Mind Centre (The University of Sydney) in collaboration with the Young and Well CRC, the Mental Health eClinic is a real-time primary care clinic that offers young people immediate online assessment, as well as timely support and programs, via a video-visit with a health professional and share plan.

Note, each of these apps and etools currently has their own Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) approvals: HAPPINESS CENTRAL (The University of Sydney, Protocol Number 2014/862); ReachOut.com Next Step (The University of Melbourne, Protocol Number 1341063.6); and, the Mental Health eClinic (The University of Sydney, Protocol Number 2014/689).

The NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem will be piloted in NSW but restricted to three target communities including the Central Coast, Western Sydney and Far West. The boundaries of these regions have been determined by the geographical boundaries used by the Local Health District (LHD) of each region: the Central Coast LHD, Western Sydney LHD and Far West LHD, including their associated broader catchment areas. Note: the trial will not be conducted within the physical health services of any of these LHDs.

Participants aged 16 to 25 years are free to use (or not use) any of the three resources at their discretion throughout the 90-day intervention period. Adherence to the intervention will be assessed via online surveys at five time points (Day 1, Day 15, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90).</interventions>

* The number of participants.

* The average number of page views per participant  a high number would indicate that the average participants go deep inside the site, possibly because they like it or find it useful.
* Average visit duration  the total length of a participants visit.
* Average page duration  how long a page is viewed for.
* Busy times  the most popular viewing time of the site.
* Most requested pages  the most popular pages.
* Most requested entry pages  the entry page is the first page viewed by a visitor and shows which are the pages most attracting visitors.
* Most requested exit pages  the most requested exit pages could help find bad pages or the exit pages may have a popular external link.
* Top paths  a path is the sequence of pages viewed by visitors from entry to exit, with the top paths identifying the way most visitors go through the site.</outcome>

The naturalistic study will involve a total of 300 participants (n = 100 each from the Central Coast, Western Sydney and Far West) which is ample given calculations predict a total of 151 participants based on a small effect size (d=0.25) for three groups, an alpha level of 0.05 and 95% power for a repeated measures MANOVA design as well as accounting for an anticipated attrition rate of 30%.

Population to be analysed
The population to be analysed are young people aged 16 to 25 years currently living in the NSW target communities of the Central Coast, Western Sydney and the Far West. This population also has regular access to a smartphone (iPhone or Android) as well as the Internet and are interested in actively improving their general health and wellbeing (including mental health).

Statistical Analysis Plan 
Utilising a naturalistic research design, the NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem will be evaluated by using a range of descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses, which will essentially look at baseline vs post-test outcomes. Further, longitudinal repeated measures MANOVA will be used to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Finally, where combinations of influential variables are identified, regression analyses will be used to identify the unique variance associated with different factors.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem is a new and innovative web-based resource of integrated apps and etools designed to help young people (aged 16 to 25 years) manage their general health and wellbeing (including mental health). If needed, the NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem also provides a seamless transition into web-based (or face-to-face) primary care.

The study will employ a naturalistic research design wherein potential participants (young people aged 16 to 25 years; living in the NSW target communities on the Central Coast, Western Sydney or the Far West; with regular access to a smartphone [iPhone or Android] and the Internet) will be given access to the NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem.

Participants will be given access to the NSW Synergy Online Ecosystem for a period of 90 days only. Participants are then able to navigate the website (or online system) at their own accord, naturally engaging with the recommended apps and etools. At five time points (Day 1, Day 15, Day 30, Day 60 and Day 90), participants will be asked to complete a short questionnaire via LimeSurvey. This questionnaire will include items regarding engagement with, efficacy and effectiveness of the website (or online system).</summary>
