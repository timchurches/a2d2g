  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised controlled dietary intervention trial, involving healthy (BMI &lt;30kg/m2) human adults. Subjects will receive in random order the following treatments with a washout period of at least one week between the treatments:

1.	raw almonds (approx. 60g)
2.	almond extract or milk (apprrox. 300mL)
3.	almond oil emulsion (approx. 300mL)
4.	almond oil (approx. 30g)

At each of the 4 study visits, subjects will donate a blood sample at 0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 5.0 and 6.0 hours for assessment</interventions>
    <comparator>Active (cross-over study). There is no control group as each participant's fasting blood sample will act as the control and compared to blood samples collected following each of the treatments. This will be for each of the 4 interventions.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the community using media advertising. Potential participants will contact the study investigator and be given a copy of the Information Statement for the study to consider their participation and consent. Participants will be screened for eligility by the researcher either in person or over the phone using the inclusion and exclusion criteria as mentioned previously. Elibigle participants would then be allocated a number using central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be assigned to a participant identifcation number (PIN) once enrolled. The numbers will have already been assigned to a treatment group which determines the treatment allocation of the participant.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although the association of nutritional composition of foods with health parameters is well established, the physical structure can influence the digestion, absorption and consequently may affect caridovascular health indices namely, circulating lipid levels, inflammatory mediators and satiety hormones. Interactions between the nutrients due to food processing can change, influencing the accessibility of the digestive enzymes for hydrolysis. In this context, although type of dietary fat consumed has been shown to modulate blood cholesterol levels, the matrix of the food may influence its cholesterol raising/lowering potential. Accordingly, the rate of absorption of fat from a meal containing whole almonds has been shown to be much slower compared to almond oil.

The aim of this project is to examine the effects of matrix in which almond lipids are complexed on postprandial lipid levels, inflammation markers, and satiety hormones. This will be achieved by determining the effects of feeding four different almond preparations, i.e. lipids trapped within the cell walls (raw almonds), oleosin-stabilized lipid emulsion (almond extract or milk), casein-stabilized lipid emulsion (almond oil emulsion) and lipids as free oil (almond oil).

We hypothesise that the rate of absorption of fat from almonds, almond oil and emulsified almond oil will be different and in turn may influence cardiovascular disease risk factors.</summary>
