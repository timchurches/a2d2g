  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is to investigate the impact of seminal plasma Galectin-3 levels on sperm parameters in terms of total count per mL, motility and morphology in subjects undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART). Association between Galectin levels and spermatogenesis will be determined. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline Galectin-3 levels will be determined at the time of assisted reproductive services along with sperm evaluation of subjects.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the association between seminal plasma Galectin-3 levels and cycle outcomes of patients undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART); briefly:
Subjects will be divided into groups according to their sperm counts/mL. Following appropriate distribution of all cases, study groups will be compared according to their baseline sperm parameters and IVF cycle outcomes in terms of embryological data, embryo grading, biochemical pregnancy, clinical-ongoing pregnancy and abortion rates. Assessment of outcomes will be considered following completion of all IVF/ICSI cycles till pregnancy test. Baseline Galectin-3 levels will be determined at the time of assisted reproductive services. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of outcomes will be considered following completion of all IVF/ICSI cycles till pregnancy test. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Galectin-3 is beta-galactoside binding protein that plays active role in immune modulation, cell interaction, cancer progression and in pathogenesis of infectious diseases (Jones JL, 2010). As a member of Galectin protein family, Galectin-3 is available in both cell cytoplasm and nucleus (Fukumori T, 2007). 
Galectin-3 (Gal-3) plays role in apoptosis and prolifertaion. Recently, Gal-3 has been associated with embryo implantation and related with uterine receptivity (Yang H et al, 2012). Gal-3 has also been detected in spermatogenetic cells, epydidimis, Sertoli cells, vas deferens, prostat, seminal vesicle and in sperm protein extracts. To date, many in-vivo studies have evaluated Gal-3 nd finally have revealed association between this protein and implantation process. However, no study have elucidated Gal-3 levels with regard to fertilization process of sperms. Our aim is to investigate the seminal plasma Gal-3 levels of subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment with different indications and to reveal outcomes.  </summary>
