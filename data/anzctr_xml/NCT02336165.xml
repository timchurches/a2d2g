  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Efficacy, as judged by survival, is the primary objective of the study for all cohorts but the primary endpoints differ by cohort due to the difference in patient populations. - In Cohort A, the primary endpoint is the Overall Survival (OS) rate at 12 months.
In Cohort B, the primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects who remain progression free at 6 months (PFS-6)
In Cohort B2 and B3, the primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects who remain progression free at 6 months (PFS-6).
In Cohort C, the primary endpoint is the Overall Survival (OS) rate at 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6-12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability - Subjects are evaluated on an ongoing basis while they are on study to evaluate any toxicities or side effects they may experience due to study treatment. These may be identified by lab tests, physical exam or other methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 15 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of Clinical Efficacy by median Progression-Free Survival, and Overall Survival as well as overall response rate (ORR). - Progression-free survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression.
Overall survival (OS) will be measured for each subject with time origin at the date of study day 1 until recorded date of death or last follow-up.
Overall response rate (ORR) will be assessed by modified RANO criteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 36 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic profile of MEDI4736, including half-life, Tmax, Cmax and other parameters. - Samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be collected based on the protocol schedule while the subject is on study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 15 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-30/BN20). - Health related quality of life (HRQoL) will be self-reported and measured with the use of the validated core quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and a quality of life questionnaire specifically for subjects with brain tumors (BN-20) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer in each treatment cohort.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 12 months</timepoint>
