  <interventions>
    <interventions>Procedural sedation in the ED, All procedures involving sedation which occur in the ED during the study period, will be observed by study staff and complications monitored as they occur. Participants will also then be contacted by telephone 1-6 weeks post sedative episode to assess any further complications which occurred following discharge.   Patients are observed for the duration of the ED sedative episode, generally 45 minutes or thereabouts, for the recovery period (generally 1 hour), and as well will be followed up by phone between 1 and 6 weeks post discharge from the ED.  Patients who are unable to be contacted during this 1-6 week time frame will have phone contact attempts made for up to 3 months.  After this point, if still uncontactable, patients willbe deemed lost to follow-up</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major airway complications: Aspiration pneumonitis and/or intubation.
Aspiration pneumonitis assessed clinically by the occurence of cough, wheeze, O2 desaturations (as per pulse oximiter) and new Chest Xray findings consistent with aspiration pneumonitis (Features can be variable and can range from a pulmonary oedema pattern to areas of consolidation or new infiltrates. These changes may have a gravity dependant distribution)
Intubation is assessed by whether the patient is intubated or not.
, 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>During ED visit, in sedative  period, (usually 45 minutes or so from start point of sedation) and the immediate recovery period (estimated 1 hour post sedation)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minor airway complications, such as:
 Apnoea (cesation in respirations for &gt;20 seconds), 
laryngospasm,(acute onset of short lived stridorous inspiratory sounds)
 O2 desaturation,(via pulse oximitry)
 hypersalivation, (excessive salivation manifest by drooling of saliva)
minor airway interventions performed in ED during sedative episode (Chin lift, jaw thrust, Assisted ventilation) all are clinical actions and will be recorded as occurrring if they are performed</outcome>
      <timepoint>During ED visit, in sedative  period, (usually 45 minutes or so from start point of sedation) and the immediate recovery period (estimated 1 hour post sedation)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other non-airway complications related to the sedation episode, the patient will be observed  by the medical officer for complications, these will be recorded on a prospective data collection tool, if complications occurr (as per standard practice during ED sedation or anaesthesia):
 vomiting, (noted if it occurrs)  as per standard practice during ED sedation or anaesthesia
 emergence delirium (combative, excited, or agitated behaviour requiring transient physical or chemical restraint), as per standard practice during ED sedation or anaesthesia
hyper- or hypo-tension, given the wide range of patient ages and deviation of systolic blood pressure by 30% either above baseline (hypertension) or 20% below baseline (hypotension).  Blood pressure will be measured using an automated sphygmomanometer as per standard practice during ED sedation or anaesthesia</outcome>
      <timepoint>During ED visit, in sedative  period, (usually 45 minutes or so from start point of sedation) and the immediate recovery period (estimated 1 hour post sedation)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite secondary outcome.  Post-discharge follow-up for post-discharge effects of sedative medications given in ED.  Assessed using a questionnaire designed specifically for this study.  Asessed by patient repsonse at telephone interview.
Assessed for:
Vomiting post discharge from the ED
Awareness during sedative episode
Memory of pain occurring during sedative episode
Ongoing pain at IV cannula site
Motor unsteadiness or incoordination post discharge
</outcome>
      <timepoint> Patients will be followed up by phone between 1 and 6 weeks post discharge from the ED.  Patients who are unable to be contacted during this 1-6 week time frame will have phone contact attempts made for up to 3 months.  After this point, if still uncontactable, patients willbe deemed lost to follow-up. Hence the 3 month time limit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedure related complications, will be based on the procedure performed.  If the procedure performed is a fracture reduction, then successful healing of the fracture or review in fracture clinic with no requirement for further intervention would be a secondary outcome.  Similarly if sedation was for wound exploration for removal of a deep foreign body, and repair, then outcome would be successful healing of the wound, or wound review that led to no further intervention.  Assesed on phone follow-up</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be followed up by phone between 1 and 6 weeks post discharge from the ED.  Patients who are unable to be contacted during this 1-6 week time frame will have phone contact attempts made for up to 3 months.  After this point, if still uncontactable, patients willbe deemed lost to follow-up</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Emergency Department Procedural Sedation is performed many times each day in Emergency Departments around the country. It is becoming an increasingly important skill in the practice of Emergency Medicine. It allows the performance of procedures (including reduction of fractures and dislocations, suturing of wounds, draining of abscesses etc) which in the absence of sedation would be painful and distressing for patients and or technically more difficult or impossible for Doctors. This sedation is increasingly valuable in health systems which demand more efficient use of resources. Effective, safe procedural sedation offers this by saving operating theatres (which are resource intensive) for more complicated procedures. This study aims to add to the current knowledge base by ongoing data collection on procedural sedation done in the Emergency Department. The actual procedural sedation for the patients in the study period will not be influenced by this study. This study will simply  document techniques and outcomes of sedation which is done in the normal practice of Emergency Medicine at our Hospital.  Complications of the sedation and the procedure will be recorded.</summary>
