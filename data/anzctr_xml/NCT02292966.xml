  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine whether neurocognitive impairments experienced by
      patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be reversed by treating HCV, with
      a new combination of direct acting antiviral drugs (daclatasvir (DCV), asunaprevir (ASV) and
      beclabuvir (BCV)). The study will assess the effect of HCV on the central nervous system
      (CNS) by assessing neurocognitive function and brain injury prior to treatment, and comparing
      it to the end of treatment, and 4, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment.</summary>
