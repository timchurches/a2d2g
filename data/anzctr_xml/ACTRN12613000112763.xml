    <concealment>Research assistants will liaise with treating staff about the suitability of potential participants. Initial suitability will be established by the fact that the young person is being treated for depression, falls within the targeted age range and appears competent to consent to the study. If the young person meets one of the exclusion criteria, they will clearly be deemed ineligible and hence not approached for the study. We will keep a de-identified record of all participants considered for the study so that we can prepare a consort flowchart when we describe the overall population at the time of publication.

If a young person appears to fall within the inclusion criteria, the research assistant will approach the young person and ask them to take part in the study. The responsibility to consent participants will be clearly delegated to the research assistant from the coordinating investigator in the study delegation log. At this point, research assistants will make it clear to the participants that the screening process may render them ineligible for the study. 

Consent will only be sought from participants who are deemed competent to provide informed consent and who have the maturity and capacity to understand the research being proposed. This competency will be determined by the treating clinician or research assistant and will take into consideration a broad range of factors as suggested within the NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Research in Humans. In determining whether a young person can understand the research, the informant will provide an overview of the research and will engage the young person in a conversation about the risks and benefits associated with the research.

After the baseline assessment has been completed, the participant will be randomised to one of the three treatment groups. Randomisation will be enabled by computer generated numbers programmed into the electronic CRF (eCRF). Once a research assistant has entered all the requisite inclusion information into the eCRF, they will be able to click on the randomisation button. If an inclusion criterion is contravened or an exclusion criterion is met, the eCRF will detect this and randomisation will not be permitted. Upon randomisation, an email will then be sent directly to the pharmacy with the participantâ€™s randomisation number (thereby allocating them to receive rosuvastatin, aspirin or placebo).  Participating pharmacies will have the randomisation code, to unblind participants if required.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised strictly sequentially, as they are eligible for randomisation.  If a participant discontinues from the study, the participant number will not be reused, and the participant will not be allowed to re-enter the study. The randomisation will be stratified by site, gender and age (&lt;18 vs &gt;18). Randomisation schemes will be organised and administered centrally by Orygen Youth Health Research Centre. A unique site number will be allocated to each participating site. Each participant will have a unique identification number (Participant ID#) for anonymous data analysis.  

The randomisation will be double-blind and only the pharmacist will know which group the participant has been allocated to. Unblinding envelopes will be available to cater for emergency situations where it is imperative that medical staff know whether the participant is on rosuvastatin, aspirin or placebo.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is 12-week acute treatment trial for moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD). It is designed to establish whether the use of (i) rosuvastatin or (ii) aspirin, reduces symptom severity and prevents recurrence of depression in young people. In this 3-arm controlled design, add-on therapy to treatment as usual (TAU) with rosuvastatin or aspirin will be compared to placebo.

Aims

Using a randomised placebo controlled trial, we aim to assess in individuals presenting to specialised early intervention centres with moderate to severe major depression if:  

1. 12 weeks treatment with either 10 mg rosuvastatin or 100 mg aspirin treatment reduces severity of depression compared to individuals taking treatment as usual: Primary aim. 
2. 12 weeks with either 10 mg rosuvastatin or 100 mg aspirin treatment will improve self-reported symptom burden, quality of life, overall functioning and clinical impression and reduce symptoms of anxiety.
3. There are continued benefits following cessation of trial treatment assessed at 6 months following baseline.
4. whether 12-weeks treatment with 10 mg rosuvastatin or 100 mg aspirin reduces serum markers of inflammation, and 
5. whether the reduction in inflammatory and oxidative markers correlates with change in depressive symptomatology

Primary Hypothesis
1. 12-weeks of adjunctive rosuvastatin or aspirin treatment will be superior to placebo for reducing symptoms of depression using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).  Analysis of rosuvastatin compared with placebo will be conducted separately to aspirin compared with placebo.  Changes in MADRS scores in each medication individually are the primary outcomes.

Predictors of outcome
The study will also aim to explore predictors and moderators of treatment response. Predictors are variables present before treatment that influence a person's response to treatment, regardless of the type of treatment received; whereas moderators differentially predict response to the different treatments. We will explore questions such as whether young people with comorbid substance abuse and borderline personality disorder traits are less likely to respond to treatment overall and less likely to respond to one treatment compared to the other. We will also examine whether baseline cognitive factors predict response to the trial medication.</summary>
