  <interventions>
    <interventions>The research project described is an independent evaluation of the clinical and economic outcomes of an intervention called the "Reducing the Use of Sedatives Project" (RedUSe). The clinical and economic outcomes were assessed between the baseline of the RedUSe project and four months after implementation of the intervention.
The RedUSe project consists of educational sessions supported by auditing and benchmarking of sedative prescribing. There is also a sedative review component where pharmacists, nurses and doctors work together in consultation with the resident and/or relatives to review regularly used sedative medications (predominantly benzodiazepines and antipsychotics).
The educational component includes pharmacist-led sessions with nursing staff at the residential aged care facility at baseline and three months. Prescribers also receive academic detailing at these time points. Within these sessions, the health care providers receive the results of an electronic audit of antipsychotic and benzodiazepine prescribing that takes place at baseline, three and six months of the RedUSe project.
Additionally, residents identified by the audit as receiving regularly charted antipsychotic and/or benzodiazepine medications receive a medication review performed by a nurse, pharmacist and their usual general practitioner at baseline and 3 months of RedUSe.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis
Changes in resident psycholeptic medication use between baseline and four months will be used to group residents into clusters representing a decrease or increase/no-change in psycholeptic medication use. 
Demographic information will be included as descriptive data for publication. This data will be described in a group format with percent of categorical variation and mean and standard deviation values on numerical data being reported.
Relationships between changes in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory- Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) total scores, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory total score, Multidimensional Observational Scale for Elderly Subjects-withdrawal subscale score, Assessment of Quality of Life- 4 dimensional total and dimensional scores, number and severity of falls, activities of daily living score, caregiver distress (subscale of NPI-NH), measure of job satisfaction, and psycholeptic medication use will be sought via statistical analysis. This will be done using regression techniques and a possible mediation analysis. 
The research team plan to conduct paired t-tests with two categories to assess associations between outcome variables. Analyses will be performed using SPSS version 24 (IBM, Chicago II). All tests will be two-sided and p-values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

Economic analysis
The economic analysis will be a cost-utility analysis. The cost of healthcare per resident will be estimated and comparisons will be made between residents whose psycholeptic medications are reduced and residents whose medications are not reduced. Variables (and severity) including falls, challenging (behavioural) events, hospitalisations and general practitioner visits will be accounted for in the cost-benefit assessment.
We will also determine the quality of life (measured with the AQoL-4D tool) of residents in each of these scenarios. This will enable us to calculate quality of life adjusted life years (QALYs) to perform the cost-utility analysis of the project. This economic analysis will ultimately provide policymakers with an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) from which they can determine whether it is beneficial to fund similar projects in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in the cost and quality of life estimates, a sensitivity analysis will also be conducted to determine a range </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A multifaceted program (the Reducing the Use of Sedatives; RedUSe project) was implemented across 150 Australian residential aged care facilities (RACFs). 
The RedUSe project consisted of educational sessions supported by auditing and benchmarking of sedative prescribing. There was also a sedative review component where pharmacists, nurses and doctors work together in consultation with the resident and/or relatives to review regularly used sedative medications (predominantly antipsychotics and benzodiazepines). 
We aimed to review the clinical outcomes of the residents and nursing home staff, and economic outcomes for the health care system resulting from this intervention. 
We hypothesised that reduced use of antipsychotics and/or benzodiazepines, as a result of this project, will:
- Not negatively affect behavioural and psychological symptoms
- Improve resident quality of life
- Decrease the rate of resident falls
- Increase activities of daily living
- Decrease general practitioner visits
- Decrease hospitalisations
- Decrease caregiver burden
- Increase the job satisfaction of nursing staff
- Be associated with lower costs to the health care system than 'usual' practice. 

Nursing staff were interviewed with validated questionnaires to assess behavioural and psychological symptoms, social engagement, activities of daily living, and caregiver burden at the start and four months of RedUSe. 
Additionally, nursing staff were required to record the number of falls, challenging episodes, hospitalisations, and general practitioner consultations the residents had each month for the same four month period (a minor addendum to their existing recording activities). 
To asses job satisfaction, an anonymous survey was made available at the start and four months of RedUSe.
