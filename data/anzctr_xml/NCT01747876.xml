  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>LEE011 is a small molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6. LEE011 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo
      activity in both tumor models.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended dose for expansion (RDE) in pediatric patients and to delineate a clinical dose
      to be used in future studies. This study will also assess the safety, tolerability, PK and
      preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of LEE011 in patients with MRT or neuroblastoma.</summary>
