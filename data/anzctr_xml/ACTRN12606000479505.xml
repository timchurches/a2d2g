  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to work with the NSW Stroke Recovery Association's Stroke Club network to establish and evaluate community -based sustainable exercise programs for stroke survivors.  We hypothesis that the experimental intervention ( weekly exercise class and home program for 12 months) will prevent falls and enhance mobility and increase habitual physical activity levels among people following stroke.</summary>
