  <interventions>
    <interventions>An 8-week double-blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled RCT to examine the effects of a fruit and vegetable supplement vs placebo (3 capsules twice daily with meals) on gene expression of inflammatory pathways, systemic inflammation, lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, CVD risk and plasma antioxidant levels, in obese adults aged 50 years or older. 

Participants will be screened for study eligibility, including medical history, medication usage, blood pressure and blood chemistry. Blood samples will be obtained by venepuncture by trained personnel for determination of full blood count, liver function tests and electrolytes, urea, creatinine. 

Once the screening blood test results have been received, eligible participants will be booked in and given advice on how to restrict fruit and vegetable intake to no more than three serves per day from two weeks prior to visit 1.

Visit 1: This is the study randomisation visit. Participants will arrive at the HMRI clinic after a 12-hour overnight fast. They will have a fasting venous blood sample collected, and their weight and waist circumference measured. Blood samples will be collected, and blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (arterial stiffness) will be recorded. Participants will complete quality of life, food frequency and 24-hour food recall questionnaires, and medication use and medical history will be checked. Body composition will be measured by full body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). At the completion of this visit, participants will receive capsules: fruit and vegetable supplement, or placebo. Participants will be instructed to take 3 capsules twice daily with meals. Participants will be advised to continue their usual diet, noting that they will need to continue to restrict fruit and vegetable intake to no more than three serves each day for the study duration. Subjects who have a higher regular fruit and vegetable intake will receive advice on suitable substitutions, to assist them with adherence. Participants will also receive a pill diary to record supplements use daily for the 8 weeks.

Phone call 1, 2 and 3: During the intervention period, subjects will be telephoned fortnightly for motivational purposes, to collect information on compliance with the supplements and dietary restriction, and to establish whether any side effects have been experienced. 

Visit 2: Visit 2 will be conducted eight weeks after visit 1. Participants will arrive at the HMRI clinic after a 12-hour overnight fast. They will have a fasting venous blood sample collected, and their weight and waist circumference measured. Blood pressure and pulse wave velocity (arterial stiffness) will be recorded. Body composition will be measured by a full body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. Participants will complete quality of life and 24-hour food recall questionnaires, and medication use and medical history will be checked. Participants will return any unused capsules and their completed pill diary, and will be instructed to resume their usual diet.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on our previous studies of expression of multiple genes involved in inflammatory pathways, we can calculate an appropriate sample size using RT-PCR confirmation of gene expression data. In order to have 80% power to detect a mean difference of 20%, with SD = 30%, we will need n=26 subjects per group. Allowing for 20% dropouts, we need to recruit 32 subjects per group, a total of n=64 participants.
Baseline data: (demographics, biomarkers, dietary intake) will be compared using the unpaired Students t test (parametric data) or Mann Whitney U test (non-parametric data). 
Intervention results: Following the intervention, study outcomes will be analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for differences between treatment groups after adjusting for baseline values.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which a fruit and vegetable supplement modulates systemic inflammation. Based on previous studies utilising fruit and vegetable supplements and our own fruit and vegetable withdrawal study, we hypothesise that the extract will modify systemic inflammatory pathways, including NF-kappaB, AMPK, MAPK, PPARalpha/gamma and TLR2/4, among others. In addition, various proteins associated with inflammation, lipid metabolism and insulin resistance will be improved. Determining whether the supplement is an effective treatment for reducing systemic inflammation in obesity and identifying the mechanisms involved may assist in reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and diabetes. This is critically important for reducing the burden of disease in this subgroup of the population for whom weight management/ weight loss has not been achievable.</summary>
