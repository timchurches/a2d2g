    <studytitle>In patients having key-hole surgery for appendicitis, does it matter if we use a thorough washout of the contaminated area or just suck out the contamination? This is a study to compare the rates of post-operative infection with the two methods.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients undergoing laparoscopic appendicectomy, does the use of suction-only as compared to irrigation-and-suction lead to a decrease in intra-abdominal infections?</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>During laparoscopic appendicectomy, irrigator-suction catheters will be used which irrigate the surgical field with normal saline prior to suction.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intra-abdominal abscess. We will search medical records for re-presentations to Emergency or admissions to the surgical unit. Diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscess will be with radiological confirmation (CT or ultrasound) or intra-operative findings at re-operation. Furthermore, a 6-week post-operative phone call will capture any patients who present to their GP or another hospital.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>As there is already an RCT in children demonstrating no difference, we have designed an equivalence design for our randomised trial. A sample size calculation was based on a clinically meaningful difference of 15% (calculated from exisiting studies suggesting abscess rates of 3.5% and 18.5% for the different groups - 18.5-3.5% = 15%). This resulted in a sample size of 61 patients per group. Allowing for protocol violation and loss to follow up, we will include 70 patients per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Laparoscopic appendicectomy is one of the most commonly performed urgent abdominal operations. Current practices of Irrigation or Suction-only are largely determined by individual surgeons bias based on intra-operative findings. To date, there is only one randomized, controlled trial comparing irrigation with suction only in children and none in adults. There is some retrospective data in children and adults. All of the existing data suggests no difference between these operative methods; in fact, some retrospective data suggest higher intra-abdominal abscess rates in irrigation groups, however there has never been a randomized trial in adults. There remains clinical equipoise and current practice is widely varied. 
Our hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two surgical methods and we aim to demonstrate that it doesn't matter to the patient which method is used.</summary>
