    <statisticalmethods>This study is an investigator initiated, phase II, open label single arm study that will investigate the efficacy of BYL719 in the setting of potential Pi3K pathway dependency. It will generate hypotheses about the efficacy of BYL719 in advanced breast cancer characterized by PI3K-related genomic alterations.
The study will have two cohorts.
In the first cohort, patients with unselected metastatic TNBC will be recruited, with a two-stage Optimum design. The null hypothesis is that the ORR will be 5% or less. The alternative hypothesis is that the ORR will be at least 25%. Further study of BYL719 will be warranted if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. As TNBC has been shown to have a very high frequency of PI3K pathway genetic abnormalities, we will enroll all eligible TNBC patients.
Therefore, for the unselected TNBC with a Simons two-stage design with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, the first stage will accrue 9 patients. If no responses are seen, the TNBC cohort will stop further accrual. If at least one response is seen, the study will proceed to the second stage for a total of 17 accrued. If greater than 2 responses are seen, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.
Therefore a minimum of 9 TNBC will be recruited.
For the second cohort, patients with metastatic/advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer will be recruited.
Again with a P0=5% and a P1=25%, 80% power, a maximum of 17 patients will be recruited. We will not have two stages here, given the potential for mutational heterogeneity in ER+/HER2- patients. If greater than 2 responses are seen, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.
Therefore, there will be a minimum of 26 patients and a maximum of 34 patients in this study.
With the exception of the primary endpoint, which is the basis of the study sample size, this studys other objectives will be hypothesis generating. All genetic aberrations will be grouped together for the primary endpoint.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether BYL719, an oral selective PI3K alpha specific inhibitor, is a safe and effective drug treatment for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have progressed after first line anti-cancer therapy. Patients who enrol in this study are required to have their breast cancer genetically characterised so we can understand the mutational profiles of their tumor. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are over 18 years old, male or female, with advanced metastatic or locally recurring breast cancer which has progressed after first line therapy. It is a requirement of the study that some of your tumor tissue will evaluated in the laboratory for genetic alterations in their DNA. Regular blood tests will also be required to try to understand if we can detect the breast cancer's abnormal DNA in the blood. 

Study details
All participants enrolled in this study will take the study drug, BYL719, which is an oral selective PI3K alpha specific inhibitor. Dose will commence at 350mg orally daily. This will involve taking tablets daily. Even though the study medication is taken daily, cycles are considered every 4 weeks. Visits to the Oncologist will be required every 4 weeks. Study medication will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or requirement for new anti-cancer therapy. 

Participants will attend regular follow-up visits for up to 2 years in order to evaluate objective response rate, clinical benefit rate, progression free survival, safety and tolerability of treatment.  Regular CT and/ or bone scans as well as blood tests will be performed.

There will be two cohorts of participants involved in this study  those with advanced/ metastatic TNBC and those with advanced/metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancers with a genetic mutation in the PI3K pathway. We plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BYL719 in these patients and associations with genetic features in order to try to identify biomarkers that can indicate those breast cancers more likely to respond to the study medication.</summary>
