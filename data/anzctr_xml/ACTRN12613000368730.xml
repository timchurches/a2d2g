  <interventions>
    <interventions>To evaluate the adjuvant effect of B.lactis Bi-07 on the immune response to pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13) vaccination in healthy infants.
The  probiotic powder is freeze-dried Bifidobacterium Bi-07 and silicon dioxide.The probiotic will be mixed with 10mls of cooled boiled water and administered orally via a syringe.  Packaged in 1.0 gram white sachets, 100 per carton. The probiotic will be administered once daily. 
Once infants have been recruited, the study period will be 6 months from the first day of treatment (at 4 weeks of age) until 7 months of age which spans the 3-dose PCV13 schedule (at 2,4,6 months).
Compliance to the probiotic treatment will be monitored by a study diary that will completed by the parents/guardians on a daily basis. As this is a pilot study, we will also be able to determine feasibility of compliance during the study period and develop appropriate strategies to maintain this.

    <comparator>Placebo - sucrose plus silicon dioxide.
The placebo will be given to the control group of infants and will be matched for taste and appearance to Bi-07.
The placebo will be mixed with 10mls of cooled boiled water and administered orally via a syringe packaged in 1.0 gram white sachets, 100 per carton. The placebo will be administered once daily.

    <statisticalmethods>A trial statistician has been appointed by CEBU and will be supervised by Dr katherine Lee. Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised trials and the analysis will be by intention to treat.
Comparisons of proportions of children with NP carriage of PCV13 serotypes will be performed using Fisher's exact test. If data satisfy the test for normality, they will be analysed with Student's two-tailed t-test for significance. Otherwise, data will be analysed with the Mann-Whitney test. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
Given that this is a pilot study there is no formal sample size calculation. The sample size for this pilot study was chosen to be 30 infants (15 infants in the B.lactis Bi-07 and 15 in the placebo-treated groups) since 30 infants will provide data on the feasibility and magnitude of effect of this intervention and will inform us on sample size calculations for future studies.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to develop a new approach to improve protection against pneumococcal disease, using a probiotic (Bifidobacterium Bi-07) to boost immune responses to and reduce invasion by the pneumococcal bacteria. We are particularly interested in whether Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 given early in life, together with vaccination, can improve protection against pneumococcal infection and therefore reduce disease. This study will involve 30 babies and the use of Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 is currently experimental.</summary>
