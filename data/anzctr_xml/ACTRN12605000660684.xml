    <interventions>This study compares the pharmacokinetic profile of a new saquinavir 500mg formulation to the standard 200mg formulation currently in use. Patients will be sequentially treated with both formulations and pharmacokinetic properties will be measured and compared. This is a 48 week study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Saquinavir and Atazanavir are drugs used in combination therapy to treat HIV 
disease. Saquinavir is currently available in a 200 milligram capsule.  Most individuals
currently on saquinavir require to take 5 tablets twice a day.  In an attempt to reduce
this number of pills, a new capsule has been developed containing 500 milligrams of
saquinavir. This study will assess: i) blood drug levels in individuals taking both
saquinavir formulations, ii) blood drug levels in individuals taking both saquinavir
formulations when given with atazanavir, iii) 48 weeks of follow up for individuals
receiving the new saquinavir formulation with atazanavir as HIV therapy.</summary>
