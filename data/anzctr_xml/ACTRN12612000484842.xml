Arm 5  Healthy control participants

Methylphenidate will be Ritalin LA capsules equivalent to a dose of Ritalin IR (immediate release) 0.3 mg/kg twice daily (bid). A maximum daily upper limit will be set at 60 mg bid. Lactose in identical capsules will serve as placebo. Methylphenidate and placebo will be administered daily at 8am for 7 weeks. 

A qualified clinical neuropsychologist will deliver the computer-based Attention Process Training (including strategy training). Attention Process Training is an attention training program that consists of a series of computer-based visual and auditory exercises designed to rehabilitate attention deficits. Attention Process Training exercises include tasks such as matching clock times, listening for two numbers amongst a sequence, watching for multiples of 3, and matching faces and emotions. The tasks start off quite easy and get progressively more challenging as the participant demonstrates that they have mastered that skill. Attention Process Training sessions will last for 45 minutes and will occur three times a week for 6 weeks.

In week 1 all participants (arms 1-5) will complete a baseline assessment. The healthy control participants (arm 5) will only complete the baseline assessment with results used to further delineate the types and severity of attention deficits following traumatic brain injury.

The traumatic brain injury patients (arms 1-4) will then take the drug (methylphenidate or placebo) for 7 weeks. Participants in arms 1 and 3 will receive Attention Process Training for 6 weeks. Two assessments will occur in week 8 (on the drug) and week 9 (drug-free). A follow-up assessment will occur at 6-months.</interventions>

Previous studies suggest that side effects are not likely to occur frequently or severely. It is unlikely that participants will experience significant discomfort or harm from participating in this study, however possible side effects may include decreased appetite, nervousness, insomnia, irritability, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, increased heart rate and/or blood pressure, dry mouth, nausea or rash. Participants may have none, some or all of these effects.</outcome>

    <concealment>An independent researcher will create a blocked randomisation table, which they will forward on to an independent pharmacy. Recruitment to the trial will be completed initially by the patient’s rehabilitation physician and followed-up by the researchers involved in the study. Once recruited, the participant will be allocated a study ID number. A prescription containing the participant’s study ID number will be sent to the independent pharmacy, which will dispense the appropriate drug (methylphenidate or placebo) based on the randomisation table.</concealment>
    <sequence>An independent researcher will create a permuted block randomisation table. Blocks will be of varying sizes and the order of the blocks will be randomly determined using a simple randomisation table created by computer software. The researchers recruiting the participants will be blinded to the order of the block presentation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of methylphenidate combined with individualised Attention Process Training (APT-3) in enhancing performance on neuropsychological measures of speed of thinking, complex attentional functions, and everyday attentional behaviour in a seven week randomised, placebo-controlled drug trial, with functional follow-up at 6 months. A secondary aim is to identify which factors, including injury severity and baseline attentional performance, will be associated with response to Attention Process Training and methylphenidate interventions.</summary>
