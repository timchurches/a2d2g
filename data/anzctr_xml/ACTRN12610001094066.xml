  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients scheduled for vasectomy reversal are prospectively included into the study. Vasectomy reversal is done in regional anesthesia with an ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block instead of general or neuraxial anesthesia. The ultrasound-guidance is done under sterile conditions 15 minutes before surgery on each side at the inguinoscrotal level by injection of 5ml short- and 5ml long-acting local anesthesia. Before, during and after the operation pain-level by visual-analogue-scale (VAS) and general anesthesiological values are monitored on a regular base. Postoperatively, monitoring of first request of an analgetic treatment, first alimentation, first mobilization and discharge is noted until discharge of the patient, which usually takes place within 24 hours. Analysis of complications until 7 days postoperatively. End of monitoring 7 days postoperatively.</interventions>
    <comparator>A consecutive historical comparison group of the same number of patients having had vasectomy reversal in general or neuraxial anesthesia is analyzed and compared in terms of postoperative analgetic treatment, first alimentation and mobilization, discharge and complications.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Success rate of the spermatic cord block, which was defined as surgery with no or light pains VAS &lt;= 3 (0 no pain up to 10 worst imaginable pain) without any substitution of opioids, additional local anesthetics, or conversion to general or neuraxial anesthesia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pains and eventual substitution of opioids, additional local anesthetics or conversion to general or neuraxial anesthesia are assessed before the injection of the block (15 min before surgery) for baseline, during the injection of the block (15 min before surgery), at the beginning of surgery, during surgery every 30 min, and at the end of surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intraoperative microsurgical conditions evaluated by the surgeon according to a scale-system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the microsurgical part of surgery, which takes place 15 min after start of surgery. Reevaluation until the end of surgery, if conditions change.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pains assessed by the VAS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>5 minutes before block (baseline), during the injection of the block, 15 minutes after the begin of surgery, then every 30 minutes until the end of surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of inadvertent vascular punctures during ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block. This outcome is assessed visually by ultrasound during the ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block. Assessed are intracordal bleedings and hematomas.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During injection of the block.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of intraoperative spermatic cord haematoma, assessed by visual control of the spermatic cord at the level of injection by the surgeon.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of patients reporting postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and urinary retentions. PONV is assessed using reports of the postoperative care unit. Urinary retention is assessed using questioning of patient by the surgeon and ultrasound of residual urine, if postoperative bladder voiding has not taken place until 6 hours postoperatively and a feeling of a full bladder exists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the first 24 hours after surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time between end of surgery and first mobilization (assessed by postoperative care unit, when patient calls for immediately postoperatively offered first mobilization), first alimentation (assessed by postoperative care unit, when patient calls for immediately postoperatively offered first alimentation), and demission (time noted in files).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed regularely (on call) as soon as requested until discharge from hospital.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of the block, which was defined as time between injection of the block and first request of postoperative analgesic by the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed regularely (on call) as soon as requested because of discomfort in the operated area until discharge from hospital.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall patient satisfaction with the spermatic cord block as the method of anesthesia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed by telephone interview 7 days after surgery, pointed out as follows: 1 = very satisfactory, 2 = satisfactory, 3 = indifferent, 4 = unsatisfactory, 5 = very unsatisfactory.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Between 5 and 8% of men having had a vasectomy wish a vasectomy reversal. Vasectomy reversal, also called vaso-vasostomy or vaso-epididymostomy, depending on the technique, is used to be in general or neuraxial anesthesia. Performing ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block avoids the potential risks of first general and neuraxial anesthesia and second vascular damage by the injection of the block. Moreover, it provides long-lasting postoperative analgesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the ultrasound-guided spermatic cord block in patients scheduled for vasectomy reversal and to compare the results with a corresponding retrospective series in general or neuraxial anesthesia.</summary>
