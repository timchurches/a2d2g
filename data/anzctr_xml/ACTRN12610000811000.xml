  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CL2 is a cementless coated femoral stem made of titanium alloy.  The stem tapers proximally to distally in order to achieve fixation within the patient femur, the stem body is 100% hydroxyapatite coated to aid in the biological fixation between the bone and the stem.  

The C2-cup is a cementless hemispherical shell made of titanium alloy.  The shell has a sintered three-dimensional asymmetric titanium powered coating.  The coating is an aid in the biological fixation between the bone and the titanium shell. The plastic liner is manufactured from highly cross-linked high molecular weight polyethylene that is manufactured by a 7.5 Mrad irradiation cycle, melt annealing and subsequent Ethylene Oxide sterilisation.  It is manufactured in sizes to accept a 32 &amp; 36mm femoral heads  The locking mechanism is a tapered interference fit with locking lugs

 Surgical procedure is unilateral. Approximate duration of the surgical procedure time is 70 minutes. Theatre time is 2 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the migration of the CL2 cementless femoral stem and the C2 cup in primary total hip replacement using an RSA technique to predict long-term safety and effectiveness of the CL2 stem and C2 cup from early post operative outcomes in small numbers of patients.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate the clinical complication rates for the cementless CL2 Total Hip System using clinical evaluations for disease specific scores (Oxford hip score) and non-disease specific scores Hip Dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) in addition to collation of any adverse events including clinical and radiological underperformance.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this clinical study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Cementless Total Hip System (CL2 stem/C2 cup). This will be done by collecting information and data  on measured outcomes on the Total Hip System, using the Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) method to provide early results on the implant. The intended use of this implant is for patients with degenerative joint disease who require a primary total hip replacement.</summary>
