  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of the effectiveness of articaine 4% against lignocaine 2% in obtaining dental local analgesia among children when delivered as a buccal infiltration or inferior alveolar nerve  block injections for restorative procedures in mandibular posterior teeth. Dosage of trial anaesthetic limited only to a maximum of 2.2 ml cartridge of the local anaesthetic agent. Dosage of local analgesic agent titrated to maximum of 5 mg/kg body weight. If local analgesia was not achieved with the trial anaesthetic patient reappointed for another appointment for the treatment to be completed using standard treatment protocol or supplement with standard local anaesthetic (Lignociane 2%) if the weight of the child allowed supplementation, doseage not to exceed 5mg/kg body weight. Mode of administration, buccal or inferior alveolar block,  and type of local anaesthetic used at first visit, test or control, determined by random allocation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Lignocaine 2% with 1:100,000 adrenaline. Mode of administration the same method as determined for the test anaesthetic, but on the contralateral side of the mouth.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of children with successful local analgesia  to complete restorations in mandibular posterior teeth. Child's response and report of no sensation of pain on undertaking restorative procedures using conventional air-turbine and engine driven rotary cutting hand-pieces was used as indicator of adequacy and success of local analgesia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The restorative procedures commenced 5 minutes after completion of local anaesthetc administration with a further wait of another 5  minutes if discomfort was reported.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine if Articaine was more effective than Lignocaine in achieving local analgesia for dental fillings  in the back teeth in the lower jaw among children when using two different techniques of anaesthetic delivery. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in achieving local analgesia between Articaine 4% and Lignocaine 2%.</summary>
