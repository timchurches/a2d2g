  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement of the symptoms and parameters associated with AHDS (including normalization of the thyroid hormone levels, and/or weight gain, and/or preventing of further neurological deterioration). The tests are tabulated in the protocol. In brief these are:
 Safety and Tolerability Assessments
*	Physical examination including weight
*	Vital signs (heart rate (including sleeping heart rate), non-invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature)
*	Neurological examination and imaging (including EEG and MRI)
*	Echocardiogram, ECG, Holter 24h ECG
*	Cranial and abdominal ultrasounds
*	Thyroid function tests (including TSH, fT3, rT3 and fT4, and thyroglobulin)
*	Bone metabolism
*	Blood gas analysis
*	Blood chemistry (including urea, electrolytes, creatinine, creatinine kinase, uric acid, bone metabolites, ferritin, sex-hormone binding globulin and liver function tests)
*	Haematology
*	Urine dipstick
*	Adverse Events

Pharmacodynamic and Response Assessments

*	Levels of TSH, fT3, rT3 and fT4 and thyroglobulin in blood
*	Levels of DITPA in blood
*	Weight gain
*	Neurological examination
*	Growth parameters and Feeding pattern
*	Neuroanatomical development
*	Neurophysical development
*	Vision and Hearing
*	Motor function assessment
*	Neurodevelopment assessment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments at 2-monthly intervals between 6-12 months from starting treatment. Then assessments at 3-monthly intervals between 12-24 months from starting treatment.</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>The protocol has not been registered elsewhere.

1.	Proven mutation of the SLC16A2 / MCT8 Gene, with a presumptive diagnosis of MCT8 Deficiency made based on elevated fT3, decrease of serum rT3 concentrations, low fT4 in the blood.
2.	Commenced on treatment of DITPA as per protocol DITPA 01-10 (HREC no. 10328B). The continuation will be a protocol titled "A Multi-Centre, Open-Label Study to Determine the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacodynamics of Orally Administered 3,5-Diiodothyropropionic Acid (DITPA) in Patients with Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS) (6 months  2 years after commencement of treatment)"

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS) that is a rare condition that usually results in severe physical and mental impairment and for which no licensed treatment is available. The study aims to provide an experimental treatment for children with AHDS. It is proposed that the daily oral administration of a compound called 3-5,Diiodothyropropionic Acid (referred to as DITPA) be provided to children with AHDS as the experimental treatment. We hypothesise that DITPA will improve the symptoms and abnormal thyroid function associated with AHDS.</summary>
