  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multi-centre, open-label, 96 week study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and extent and duration of improvement in HIV-1 infected subjects with antiretroviral induced facial lipoatrophy, randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive immediate or deferred deep subcutaneous injections of poly-L-lactic acid (PLA).
Subjects will receive 4 treatments of PLA approximately every 2nd week, either at trial entry or following a delay period of 24 weeks.</interventions>
