  <interventions>
    <interventions>Currently knee replacement surgery is performed using external jigs or a computer navigation system to guide bone cuts necessary to implant the metal and plastic prosthesis. The computer navigation system is considered the most accurate for guiding and evaluating the cuts but it has been shown to increase surgery time. Many surgeons still prefer the conventional external jigs calculating alignment with an intra medullary rod for the femoral component and an external rod to align the tibial component. These surgeons feel the time saved by using the conventional methods outweigh the small increase in alignment accuracy achieved by the navigation technique. There is however new technology developed that allows patient-specific instruments to be manufactured based on a pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan and x-rays of the affected knee. These instruments should allow bone cuts and thus implants to be positioned more accurately than conventional intra-medullary rod method in addition to decrease overall surgical time. Additional factors are that much less equipment is needed when using the patient-specific instruments as the prosthesis size is known pre-operatively. This has the potential to cut cost significantly. The current study will include 50 patients that have met the criteria for total knee replacement. The patients will require a pre-operative MRI and full-leg x-rays. Their surgery will be performed with the custom instrumentation. All bone cuts will be evaluated intra-operatively using a micrometer to measure actual bone resection thickness compared to that which is predicted by the MRI data. Any cut that is inappropriate will be revised using the standard conventional alignment method. It will be within the surgeons capacity and at the surgeons discretion whether they over-ride the patient specific jigs and continue with the surgery using conventional techniques for alignment. The surgery time will vary but expected average times will be 80 minutes. The patients will require a post-operative computed tomography [CT] scan to evaluate the limb and implant alignment. This scan will be performed at least 6 weeks post-operatively. The recovery and post-operative follow-up will be unchanged from that expected for routine knee replacement surgery. The participants will also be assessed for range of movement, Knee Society Score, General Health Questionnaire and the Oxford Knee Score pre-operatively, and at three, six and twelve months post operatively.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently knee replacement surgery is performed using alignment rods that correctly position the cutting blocks which guide bone cuts necessary to implant the metal and plastic total knee joint. Using a computer navigation system during surgery is considered the "gold standard" for guiding the cuts. Many surgeons however find this extends the time of the surgery for what is considered only a marginally better aligned knee and for much of the time the alignment is the same. These surgeons feel that the accuracy of the alignment of the total knee replacement without computer navigation is very good anyway and it is quicker to do. There is however new technology that has been developed that allows patient-specific cutting blocks, which are said to guide the cuts more accurately, to be manufactured based on a an MRI scan and x-ray of the affected knee taken before surgery. In this way it may be possible to have the accuracy of computer navigation in addtion to decreasing surgical time. This would be potentially good for the patients for a number of reasons including shorter operation time resulting in less chance of complications. In addition to this, less instuments will need to be used during surgery because the surgeon will already know the size of the knee replacement needed. This will reduce the cost of surgery while potentially increasing the accuracy. The current study will include 50 patients that have met the criteria for total knee replacement on the waiting list. The patients will require a pre-operative MRI and full-leg x-rays. Their surgery will be performed with the custom instrumentation. All bone cuts will be measured during surgery and compared to the bone cuts the MRI scan predicted. The surgeon can override the custom made blocks at any time and continue surgery in the conventional way if they feel the blocks are in any way inaccurate. The surgery time will vary but on average it should require approximately 80 minutes. The patients will require a post-operative computer tomography [CT] scan to evaluate the limb and implant alignment and information will be collected including pain levels, how far a person can walk and the affected knee's range of motion. This scan will be performed at least 6 weeks after surgery and the other information will be gathered before surgery and also at 3,6 and 12 months after surgery. Otherwise, the recovery and post-operative follow-up will be unchanged from that expected for routine knee replacement surgery. Our hypothesis is that the patient-matched instrumentation will align the bone cuts, implants, and the mechanical axis of the limb at least as well as would be expected using the conventional alignment rods, will cost less and on average speed up the surgery.</summary>
