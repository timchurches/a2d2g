    <studytitle>Can omega 3 fatty acids improve respiratory outcomes in preterm infants?</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In preterm infants born at &lt;29 weeks gestation is an emulsion containing a higher amount of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) more effective than an emulsion with no additional DHA in reducing the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks post menstrual age?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Tuna oil emulsion containing 120 mg/mL of DHA to provide 60 mg/kg/day of DHA (0.17 ml/kg three times a day).  The intervention will be given enterally within 72 hours of the first enteral feed and continue until 36 weeks post menstrual age or discharge home (whichever occurs first).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be defined on a physiologic basis that combines oxygen and ventilation support with an assessment of saturation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia will be determined at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (36 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 6 days inclusive) or day of discharge home, whichever occurs first.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia as defined by US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute/Office of Rare Diseases Workshop on Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks postmenstrual age (36 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 6 days inclusive) or day of discharge home, whichever occurs first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Respiratory support requirements including the duration of respiratory support, the requirement for any supplemental oxygen or respiratory support and the use of steroids, caffeine or diuretics for lung disease. </outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks postmenstrual age (36 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 6 days inclusive) or day of discharge home, whichever occurs first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of DHA supplementation as assessed by number of days to full enteral feeds and number of days on which feeds were interrupted.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (36 weeks and 0 days to 36 weeks and 6 days inclusive) or day of discharge home, whichever occurs first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The length of hospital stay, respiratory support requirements, growth rate, grade of intra-ventricular haemorrhage (IVH), confirmed sepsis, confirmed necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), grade of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 40 weeks postmenstrual age or discharge home whichever occurs first; length of hospital stay will be calculated from birth to first hospital discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attention (ability to resist distraction) and other aspects of attention in a side study to the N3RO trial. 
A small subsample (n=80) of the N3RO trial children born at the Flinders Medical Centre and the Women's and Children's Hospital will be eligible inclusion in the side study for this secondary outcome. Assessments will take place when children reach 2 years corrected age (plus or minus 3 months) and will commence in March 2015. 
Attention will be assessed with an exploratory measure used in the field of developmental psychology. Children will be given a series of toys to play with, whilst sitting on their caregivers lap. The toy-play will be videorecorded, so that their eye movements to and from the toys can be measured, as an indication of their attention to the toys. </outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years (corrected age) plus or minus 3 months  </timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III): A psychologist-administered Cognitive Scale, Motor Scale and Language Scale are standardized according to (corrected) age to have mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. The cognitive scale evaluates sensorimotor development, exploration and manipulation, object relatedness, concept formation, memory, and simple problem solving. The language scale is a composite of receptive communication (verbal comprehension, vocabulary) and expressive communication (babbling, gesturing, and utterances). The motor scale evaluates both gross and fine motor functioning.  </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child general well being as assessed by the Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire via survey. </outcome>
