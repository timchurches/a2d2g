  <interventions>
    <interventions>Under local anesthesia and/or procedural sedation a sterilized Karl Storz Endoscope will be inserted into a 28F intercostal catheter (ICC) and under full aseptic technique inserted through a standard ICC chest incision into the pleural space by the operating emergency or trauma physician. 
This will permit direct visualization and navigation of tissue planes and intra-pleural structures guiding ICC placement. 
Once placed the ICC will be secured to the chest wall and chest incision closed by suturing, the endoscope will be removed and the ICC connected to an underwater chest drain. 
The duration of procedure is estimated at less than 20 minutes for completion. </interventions>
    <comparator>A concurrent control group of 20 adult thoracic trauma patients requiring pleural decompression and drainage using the current standard, 'blind' insertion technique as well as an historical control of 100 patients to account for any Hawthorne effect. Historical data will be derived from the Alfred Trauma Registry data recorded from August to December 2014. 
The current standard of 'blind' ICC insertion involves a surgical incision with blunt dissection of the chest wall and subsequent  puncture of the pleura. Access to the pleura is confirmed via digital exploration using a sterile gloved finger. ICC insertion is then carried out using forceps and digital guidance before being secured to the chest wall by surgical sutures. The procedure takes up to 20 minutes from set-up to securing the ICC.</comparator>

Those patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be prospectively allocated to the intervention group. When principle investigators are not available, patient will be allocated to the control group.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Information to be collected include age, sex, weight, injury diagnoses, vital signs before and during procedure, procedural time, ICC position on subsequent chest X-ray/CT scan, procedural protocol violations, subsequent ICC re-positioning or removal, infection incidence, mortality and hospital length of stay. 
The data will be collected in and analysed using Stata 13.1.
Fishers exact test will be used to calculate the significance of differences. Kaplan-Meier analysis will be undertaken to generate tables and plots of length of time from insertion to re-insertion or removal of ICC.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We wish to demonstrate that in adult patients with thoracic trauma requiring tube thoracostomy, the insertion of a sterile, flexible endoscope into the intercostal catheter at the time of insertion will allow direct visualization and guided placement of the catheter into the ideal position.
The aim of this small, prospective, preliminary Phase 1 equivalent study is to refine the set-up, procedure, logistics and Trauma Team mechanics related to video-assisted ICC placement. It will be the basis for a larger, randomized trial to determine whether this new technique will remove the commonest complication of ICC insertion for trauma and lead to improved outcomes and a reduced length of hospital stay. </summary>
