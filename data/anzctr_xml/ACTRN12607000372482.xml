  <interventions>
    <interventions>Whilst participants (n15) are still sedated following cardiac surgery, a 10F pressure catheter will be inserted into the hypopharynx via the nose. Once awake and extubated, participants will be commenced on the OptiflowTM system. Once settled on the therapy the pressure catheter position will be confirmed using end tidal CO2 monitoring. Pressure measurements will then be carried out with three different gas flow rates:30, 40 and 50L/min with mouth open and then repeated with mouth closed. The pressure catheter will be gently removed at the end of this period. The measurements will take approximately 30mins to complete.  The intervention is OptiflowTM at three different flow rates. We are investigating only the relationship between flow and pressure. We hope to describe a positive and linear relationship between flow and pressure. ie more flow equals more pressure.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Measurement is continuous over one minute. Mean is calculated by averaging the peak and trough pressures over the entire minute of breathing. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will describe the relationship between the flow of gas delivered by the OptiflowTM system and the pressure exerted in the upper airways of 15 cardiac surgical patients. The researchers wish to demonstrate that more gas flow will deliver higher pressures to the airways.This information is needed so that doctors can be guided as to how much flow to administer to patients in order to achieve a desired airway pressure. Such pressure in the airways can assist patients who have breating difficulties. This data will also inform future, more detailed research in this area.</summary>
