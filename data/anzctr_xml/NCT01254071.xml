    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Dutasteride (0.5mg); Tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.2mg); fixed dose combination product of duatsteride (0.5mg) and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.2mg)

Experimental: Fixed dose combination product - Fixed Dose Combination capsule containing dutasteride 0.5mg and tamsulosin 0.2 mg


Treatment: drugs: Dutasteride (0.5mg); Tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.2mg); fixed dose combination product of duatsteride (0.5mg) and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.2mg)
In the first dosing session, twenty-two subjects of each cohort will receive the FDC capsule (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5mg/0.2mg) and the other 22 will receive commercial capsules of dutasteride 0.5mg and commercial tablets of tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2mg co-administered.

             or drugs of this class or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

    <summary>This study will be an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-period crossover study to
      determine the bioavailability of a fixed dose combination capsule formulation of dutasteride
      and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5mg/0.2mg) relative to co-administration of dutasteride 0.5mg
      capsules and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.2mg tablets in healthy male subjects of North East
      Asian and non-Asian ancestry. Subjects will receive single oral doses of a combination
      capsule formulation of dutasteride 0.5 mg/ tamsulosin 0.2 mg in a fed or fasted state or
      concomitant dosing of dutasteride 0.5 mg and the Japan-sourced Harnal-D 0.2 mg in a fed or
      fasted state. Each dose of study medication will be separated by a 28-day washout period.
      Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing.
      Safety will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, safety laboratory data,
      and review of adverse events. The study will enrol 88 healthy male subjects to ensure that 80
      complete the study. At least twenty percent of the study population will be of Japanese
      ancestry, approximately 20% will be of Chinese ancestry and approximately 20% of Korean
      ancestry while the remainder of the population will be of non-Asian ancestry.</summary>
