Experimental: 160 mg LY2157299 - Per the protocol, following an interim analysis, the decision was taken to no longer randomize participants to the 160 mg LY2157299 arm. As of May 25,2012, all newly enrolled participants will receive 300 mg LY2157299.
160 mg LY2157299 given daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. This on/off schedule constitutes a cycle of 28 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.

Experimental: 300 mg LY2157299 - 300 mg LY2157299 given daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. This on/off schedule constitutes a cycle of 28 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.

Experimental: 160 mg LY2157299 + 800 mg Sorafenib - During each 28-day cycle: 160 mg LY2157299 given daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. 800 mg Sorafenib will be given daily for 28 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.

Experimental: 300 mg LY2157299 + 800 mg Sorafenib - During each 28-day cycle: 300 mg LY2157299 given daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. 800 mg Sorafenib will be given daily for 28 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.

Experimental: 80 mg LY2157299 + 8 mg/kg Ramucirumab - During each 28-day cycle: 80 mg LY2157299 given twice a day for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. 8 mg/kilogram (kg) ramucirumab will be given daily for 15 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.

Experimental: 150 mg LY2157299 + 8 mg/kg Ramucirumab - During each 28-day cycle: 150 mg LY2157299 given twice a day for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest. 8 mg/kg ramucirumab will be given daily for 15 days. Participants will continue to receive until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.
