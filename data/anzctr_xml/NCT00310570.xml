  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stubbing of the finger-tip is a common injury in sports such as basketball, volleyball,
      cricket and football. This can result in a Mallet finger deformity, where the end joint of a
      finger cannot be actively straightened out. In most mallet finger cases seen at The Alfred,
      the skin remains intact, and the impairment results from a tear of the extensor tendon or an
      avulsion (a small fracture where the tendon attaches to the bone). Treatment commonly
      involves immobilising the end joint of the finger in a splint for six or more weeks so
      patient compliance is a major factor in the quality of the outcome achieved.

      This study aims to compare two different types of splintage (the commonly used thermoplastic
      thimble splint and the aluminium-foam Mexican hat splint which is in use in Britain) with a
      control splint (thermoplastic prefabricated stack splint with tape). Outcome measures will
      include patient compliance with the splint, degree of extensor lag, active movement of the
      joint, and any complications.

      The null hypothesis is that there are no differences in outcome between different methods of
      conservative splinting treatment for mallet finger.</summary>
