  <interventions>
    <interventions>The footwear intervention was selected based on extensive feasibility work. Four shoes from different brands, identified on the basis of availability and basic characteristics, were trialled. Across all footwear considered, the important characteristics associated with increase in comfort and reduction in pain were superior motion control, good shock attenuation, smooth heel-to-toe transition during the gait cycle and availability of wide-fitting option. The model selected by a majority of participants was the ASICS Cardio Zip, which satisfied all identified criteria. This model also demonstrates a medial side zip closure allowing for ease of fit and release. Each participant will wear the footwear once daily for a minimum of 2 hours per day over 6-months. 

The pragmatic trial will be over 6 months. The time-point of 6 months has been selected as it will allow sufficient time for participants to become accustomed to the footwear and allows sufficient time for measuring changes in function.</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard podiatric rheumatology care will typically include toenail maintenance and scalpel debridement of hyperkeratotic lesions (corns and calluses). This approach has been successfully implemented at our podiatric rheumatology service based at Counties Manukau District Health Board. All participants in the study will receive this care</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We have re-calculated the sample size for the study. We have found the withdrawal proportion is estimated in the worst case at 14% instead of 25%. At the assumed withdrawal rate of 15%, this figure yields a target recruitment of 46 participants per arm, or 92 in total instead of our original sample size of 140 participants</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gout is a major cause of musculoskeletal disability in Aotearoa New Zealand. Foot pain occurs in most people with gout. There is strong evidence that many people with gout wear inappropriate or poor quality footwear, and that ill-fitting footwear may contribute to further foot problems. We have shown in a recent feasibility study that footwear with good cushioning, motion control and adequate width reduces foot pain and disability in the short term. We propose a long-term randomised controlled trial examining the effects of a footwear intervention on foot pain and disability. The trial will compare standard podiatric care with a relevant footwear intervention. The study findings will be used to make evidence-based recommendations regarding footwear intervention for people with gout.</summary>
