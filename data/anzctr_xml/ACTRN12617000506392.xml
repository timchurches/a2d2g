  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will test whether a low cost, self-help intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is perceived as acceptable and helpful by Australian farmers, improves their wellbeing, and leads to effective coping when faced with future challenges. The intervention was developed in close collaboration with Australian farmers and a range of organisations from across the academic, agricultural, health and financial sectors. It has a particular focus on teaching farmers skills to cope more effectively with things beyond their control (e.g. droughts, fluctuating markets, disease outbreaks, government regulations). The program is being developed in the Sansom Institute for Health Research at the University of South Australia in collaboration with the University of Adelaide, the National Centre for Farmer Health, and the Freemasons Foundation Centre for Mens Health.

MATERIALS

The intervention was developed based on ACT by a clinical psychologist with consumer input. All content has been reviewed by an independent clinical psychologist and a social worker with knowledge of rural and drought-related issues.

The intervention website contains five ACT-based modules that include strategies to foster the key ACT processes of defusion, acceptance, values, here and now and psychological flexibility. Users will create a profile (using a pseudonym if preferred) upon first logon. The content starts off with a quiz and practical psychoeducation information sheets. Users are then given carefully tailored feedback and advice, based on their results. Users are given the option of printing off the results of their online assessment and a script that will guide a conversation about their mental health with their GP. Users will also be presented with short videos that will show someone else having that conversation with their GP and another video that shows what it would be like to see a counselor or psychologist, if thats what the users GP recommends. 

Users are able to log on at any time of the day or night. The intervention is a free, password protected resource written for a low reading age, in a friendly way with appropriate humor and farming related metaphors and examples, and fits with farmers ethos of stoicism and determination to help themselves. 

Features include automated text message reminders and messages of support, a read aloud text/an audio narration function for people with eyesight or literacy issues, a very simple website navigation design suitable for use on desktop, laptops, iPads/tablets and mobile devices, options for video resolution, and the whole program available in (downloadable and printable) PDF workbook format to improve access for the small proportion of the farming community who do not use computers.

At the end of each module, the program will put together a list of strategies that users can choose to save to their profile or 'toolbox'. All of the exercises that are audio or video-based will also be available in a written script form, so that if users internet connection isnt working well, they are still accessible to them. 

PROCEDURES

People who are interested in participating will access the website via a link sent by the research team. They will then be presented with an online information sheet and a consent form including screening questionnaire. Consenting participants will then proceed to a page to set up a profile/login, then move on to a suite of validated measures (see 'Outcomes') online and proceed to the online intervention. 

As detailed above, the first stage of the intervention will provide participants with feedback on their current levels of well­-being and inform them if their scores suggest that they should seek professional face-to-face mental health help. More specifically, based on their distress score, they will be advised whether they are experiencing what is considered a low, medium, or high level of distress. They will also be given information on how to seek professional help and be reminded about how to return to their online intervention profile at any time. Participants will be contacted by a suitably qualified member of the research team (clinical psychologist) via phone if their results show that they are highly distressed. All participants will then work through the intervention modules, which are designed to be transdiagnostic (useful for people experiencing a range of problems/conditions). 

At the completion of the five modules, participants will be asked to complete the outcome measures. After 6 months, participants will be emailed a reminder and asked to log in and complete the measures again. Once participants have completed all study-related procedures, they will be eligible for a $100 voucher as partial reimbursement for their time and internet expenses. Approximately 20 participants will also be invited to participate in an interview about their participation in the program. Some participants who indicated willingness to be followed up may also be contacted at a later date (e.g. a period of drought) and asked to re­-complete the measures online. Website usage, usability, and acceptability will also be evaluated through website usage data and additional measures.

DELIVERY

The intervention is delivered online to individuals. Participants complete five modules approximately fortnightly for five weeks, and each module is expected to take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Participants can access the intervention anywhere with an internet connection (e.g. laptop, desktop, tablet, mobile). Adherence will be assessed with website usage statistics.

Individual-tailored content is embedded within the website. Tailored content is delivered throughout the intervention based on participant responses and demographic variables. For example, in doing the baseline assessment, a user may flag that they are having trouble sleeping so they will be provided with a list of practical things to try to improve the quality of their sleep (e.g. sleep hygiene techniques). </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>In our pilot cross-sectional cohort, the mean distress score was 9 (SD = 7, range 0­-35). Being a feasibility study we prioritise the reduction in type II errors over type I. Assuming a within individual correlation &gt;0.5, then with N = 50 a one sample t­-test (1-­sided alpha = 0.10) has 90% power to detect a within individual change in distress of 2.5 units. Assuming a 80% retention rate, we plan to accrue 60 individuals. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will test whether a low cost, self-help intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), developed in consultation with consumers, is perceived as acceptable and helpful by Australian farmers, improves their well-being, and leads to effective coping when faced with future challenges such as drought. The website contains five short, interactive modules designed to teach users new tools to equip them to take charge and reduce the negative impact that stressful situations can have as well as better cope with things beyond their control. The website features text message reminders and support messages, audio and video, interactive exercises, farming-related humour, and functionality for use on laptops, desktops, tablets and mobile devices. 

Interested participants (farmers in Australia over 18, with internet access) will be asked to register online, where they will be asked to complete a short series of questions. Participants will then complete the five modules over several weeks, and at the end, complete the same questions, and repeat them once more six months later. Participants will also be asked to express interest in providing feedback on the intervention in an interview at a later time, or in being re-contacted at a later date (e.g. a period of drought) to complete the questions again.

Farming is known to be one of the most physically and psychologically hazardous occupations. For generations Australian farmers have been independent, stoic and skilled at solving practical problems. However, a characteristic of farming that makes it psychologically hazardous, is the fact that farmers' levels of personal and economic success is largely dependent upon factors beyond their control (e.g. weather, disease outbreaks, commodity prices). Periods of drought are expected to become more frequent and prolonged in the future, therefore it is important to conduct research like this to find effective ways for farmers who are interested, to learn how to better cope with things beyond their control. </summary>
