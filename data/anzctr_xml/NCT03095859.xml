  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Physical rehabilitation.

Active Comparator: Control - Standard care (once daily physical rehabilitation, approx. 30 minutes). Standard care will consist of physical exercise, such as early mobility, endurance training, upper limb, lower limb and trunk activity. This will involve non-physical interventions including respiratory therapy, airway clearance and patient and carer education.

Experimental: Experimental - Early intensive physical rehabilitation, which will consist of standard care plus one additional treatment per day. The additional early intensive physical rehabilitation session provided to the experimental group will allow for progression of aerobic, strength and flexibility exercise and / or completion of a more comprehensive physical rehabilitation program.


Other interventions: Physical rehabilitation.
Early mobility, aerobic exercise, upper and lower limb strength and flexibility training, trunk mobility and core strengthening, inclusive of respiratory therapy and education.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability to deliver intensive inpatient physical rehabilitation (feasibility). - Quantified by number of patients eligible for inclusion; number of patients consented; number of additional, intensive physical rehabilitation sessions completed during the initial, inpatient stay post operatively; reasons for non-completion of sessions; and attrition.
This will be aggregated into an overall percentage of successful delivery of intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient length of stay is typically two to three weeks following lung transplant surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of treatment and non-treatment related adverse events (safety). - Evidence of early, acute rejection on bronchoscopic biopsy and adverse events. Adverse events will be defined as any adverse outcome during the study period, including but not limited to events that could be related to acute physical rehabilitation such as musculoskeletal injury, patient fall and surgical wound dehiscence or breakdown.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient length of stay is typically two to three weeks following lung transplant surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Six-minute walk test. - Distance walked in six minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-transplant results if available. Repeated on inpatient discharge (2-3 weeks), one and three months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity monitoring (DynaportÂ®). - Physical activity levels.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days (5 days of data) at post-operative day 10 and at three months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain visual analogue scale (VAS). - 0-10 pain score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once daily on physical activity monitoring days, from day 10 - 16 post-transplant, repeated for seven days at three months post-transplant.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EuroQol EQ-5D-5L. - Health-related quality of life questionnaire.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale - Revised (CESD-R). - Depression and psychological well-being questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (first time to mobilise), inpatient discharge (2-3 weeks), one month and three months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sit to stand test - 60 second. - Amount of sit-stands completed over 60 seconds.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (first time to mobilise), inpatient discharge (2-3 weeks), one month and three months.</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant-focused qualitative study experience. - Semi-structured qualitative interview questions:
Tell me about your experience with your physiotherapy sessions
How did you feel about the quantity of physiotherapy that you received?
If you had to choose, which group would you prefer to be in?</outcome>
      <timepoint>Inpatient discharge (2-3 weeks).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Modified Iowa Level of Assistance Scale (MILOA). - A valid, reliable and responsive scale of physical capacity in the post-operative patient.</outcome>
