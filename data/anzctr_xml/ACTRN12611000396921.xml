  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will be testing 2 types of wheat breakfast cereals in short (2 hour)  and extended (4 week) interventions by way of a randomised, double blind trial.  During each arm, participants will consume an individualised breakfast dose of 1 of the 2 breakfast cereals based on their estimated energy requirements (EER) of no greater than 30% of their total energy requirements.  The test cereals are both made from wholegrain wheat, they look and taste similar to common breakfast biscuit cereals, however one of the cereals has undergone an additional processing treatment that may have altered the nutritional composition of the cereal.  In Arm 1, participants will be randomised to consume 1 of the test cereals, and arrive fasted for baseline blood collection followed by feeding, blood collection and appetite sensation recording over 2 hours.  This is immediately followed by participants consuming the same test cereal daily for 4 weeks whilst otherwise maintaining their usual diet. Participants will visit the clinic weekly for monitoring, anthropometric measurements, and issue of cereal supply.   At the end of 4 weeks participants will repeat testing to measure the response of eating the test cereal daily over 4 weeks.  After a 2 week wash out period, Arm B commences with the same procedure as Arm A but with the alternate breakfast cereal.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control - cross over.  The control cereal is made from wholegrain wheat and looks and tastes similar to common wheat breakfast biscuits.  The test cereal is also made from wholegrain wheat, however the grain used in the test cereal has undergone an additional processing treatment.</comparator>

    <concealment>20 participants will be recruited from the University population by global email and electronic noticeboard, and pamphlets and posters will be distributed around the university and at local medical centres.  After an initial enquiry, prospective participants will be sent an Information to Participants form outlining the details of the study.  If interested, an interview will follow with questionnaire to determine the participant's health and whether the participant meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If all criteria are met, the participant is invited to join the study and a consent form is completed.  Treatment allocation will be randomised and double blinded.  The person determining the eligibility of participants for the trial will be unaware as to which treatment group the participant will be allocated to.  Allocation will be by way of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a global health epidemic increasing adverse health risks for sufferers. Lifestyle and diet are fundamental to prevention and treatment of obesity-related disorders and attention to the role of staple foods as part of total dietary intake is warranted.  

Wheat grain is a staple food in Western countries, providing energy, nutrients and fibre, and is commonly consumed as a breakfast cereal.  When compared with highly refined cereals, wholegrain cereals are more nutritious beneficial in maintaining healthy weight, blood glucose, cholesterol levels, and reducing cardiovascular and diabetes risks. 

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of consuming 2 types of wholegrain wheat breakfast cereals in overweight and obesity, that have undergone different processing treatments and may differ in chemical composition.</summary>
