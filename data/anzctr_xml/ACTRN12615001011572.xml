  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 3-week intervention of usual physiotherapy treatment with Physitrack: individualised care according to the participant's presenting diagnosis including an exercise program delivered using the web-based exercise programming system (Physitrack). 

The Physitrack group receives their exercise program through the physitrack web based programming system. 

Physitrack is a web based programming system with an extensive library of videos of a range of exercises. The treating physiotherapist determines the appropriate exercises for each of their patients, including the number of repetitions and sets, frequency, duration and exercise progression. The patients can then access their exercise program through the web page or via an App. It can be updated accordingly by the physiotherapist. 

The patients physiotherapist will be able to monitor their adherence to the exercises as the patient can interact with the app or online, and their exercise program and indicate how many repetitions they did of the exercise. Plus the patient can also view their adherence online and via the app.</interventions>
    <comparator>A 3-week intervention of usual physiotherapy treatment: individualised care according to the participant's presenting diagnosis including an exercise program delivered according to usual non web-based methods of the treating physiotherapist. For example, this could take the form of individualised hand written instructions, semi-structured/individualised typed handouts, or standardised/general handouts.

The patients physiotherapist will monitor their adherence as per their usual practice. This will depend upon the physiotherapist.</comparator>

    <concealment>All patients over 18 years of age with a musculoskeletal condition attending an initial session with a participating physiotherapist will be asked to complete a screening survey in reception before they are seen by the treating therapist. Eligible consenting participants will complete baseline measures and following will be randomised into the study at the initial consult by the treating physiotherapist using the National Health and Medical Research Councilâ€™s Clinical Trials Centre Randomisation interactive voice response system. Allocation concealment will be obtained using this. The schedule will be prepared using minimisation stratified for physiotherapist and the affected body region to be treated (upper limb, lower limb, and spine).</concealment>

    <designfeatures>All potential participants will be informed that their physiotherapist is participating in a study that will compare different ways of delivering exercise programs to determine which is better. They will not be specifically informed about the nature of the web-based program and thus will remain blinded to the different treatment arms of the study as well as the specific hypothesis of the study. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Measured at 3 weeks post-intervention. Given the number of factors that affect adherence, and that Physitrack will only target some of these factors, we expect that Physitrack will have a small effect on patient adherence. Thus, to detect an effect size of 0.35 with 80% power and a significance level of 0.05, and controlling for stratifying variables of physiotherapist and body region we require 129 patients per arm (258 in total). To allow for 15% attrition, 152 per arm (304) in total will be recruited. 

Data will be analysed in a blinded manner with p values less that 0.05 considered significant. Demographic characteristics will be inspected to assess comparability of treatment groups. These variables will also be examined for those participants who withdraw from the study and those who remain. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented for each group as means or medians (standard deviation, inter-quartile ranges). Continuous outcomes will be compared between the two groups using between group analysis of variance (ANOVA) controlling for stratifying variables of physiotherapist and body region with significant level set at 0.05. Proportional odds models will compare improvement between groups based on perceived ratings of change. Model diagnostic checks will utilise residual plots. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise is an integral component of the conservative management of most musculoskeletal conditions. However, adherence to exercises is often low and this impacts on treatment effectiveness. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to evaluate whether the addition of a web-based system, Physitrack, to usual physiotherapy treatment improves patient adherence levels to exercises compared to the usual non web-based methods physiotherapists use to deliver exercise programs to people with musculoskeletal conditions. Secondary aims are to evaluate whether Physitrack improves patient satisfaction with the delivery of an exercise program and whether patient confidence changes with Physitrack. 

The primary hypothesis is: The level of patient-reported adherence to a prescribed exercise program will be greater in the group receiving Physitrack in addition to usual physiotherapy treatment (Physitrack group) than in the group receiving non web-based usual physiotherapy treatment alone (Usual care group) after 3 weeks. 

Secondary hypotheses are: i) The level of patient satisfaction with the delivery of the prescribed exercise program will be greater in the Physitrack group than in the group receiving non web-based usual care after 3 weeks; and ii) The level of patient confidence with exercises will be greater in the Physitrack group than in the group receiving non web-based usual care after 3 weeks.
