  <interventions>
    <interventions>Saphenous nerve block for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft. This involves 15cc 0.5% Ropivacaine (75mg) with an ultrasound guided approach picking a spot 10 cm above the patella, after general anaesthesia. 

Both groups will receive multimodal analgesia. This includes IV paracetamol 1g 20min before the end of the case, and Parecoxib 40mg IV during the case. Surgeons will infiltrate hamstring site and knee joint with Ropivacaine 2mg/kg and 10mg of Morphine into the knee joint (intra-articular).</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical power was calculated based on previous similar studies. To detect a difference of 2 in visual analogue scale with 80% power and 0.05 beta value, we require 20 patients in each group. We are aiming for 30 patients in each group to achieve 90% power.

VAS scores and opiate consumption will be compared between control and intervention group, after performing normal distribution test on the data. Linear regression analysis will be performed to look for correlation between outcomes and patient baseline characteristics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is a common procedure. Perioperative analgesia for ACL reconstruction using hamstring autograft can be achieved with multimodal analgesia +/- addition of nerve block. Saphenous nerve block is commonly used in our practice for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction. 

Performing a saphenous nerve block adds cost, time and complications (overall rare) to the overall procedure with a perceived benefit of reduced opiate requirement and increased patient comfort. The benefit of saphenous nerve block for hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction has not been established in the literature. 

We hypothesize that saphenous nerve block in ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft does not improve patient comfort. </summary>
