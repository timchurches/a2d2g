  <interventions>
    <interventions>Femoral nerve catheter placed using either ultrasound or nerve stimulation, needle endpoint.

Ultrasound placement
Needle will be placed just posterior to the femoral nerve using ultrasound imaging then catheter threaded 3 cm past needle tip.

Nerve stimulation placement
Needle will be placed such that a patella response is present at &lt;0.5 mA. Catheter is then threaded 3 cm beyond needle tip.

The duration of each procedure is 15 minutes, and the period of overall intervention is 48 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To compare two techniques for femoral nerve catheter placement: Ultrasound only and ultrasound combined with nerve stimulation. To compare the effect of these two placement methods on catheter placement time and the indices of catheter effectiveness. Secondary outcome measures will include degree of patient discomfort during insertion and number of needle passes needed for catheter insertion.
The use of fluid spread as an end point for correct needle tip position would result in more efficient femoral nerve catheter placement while providing a catheter success rate comparable to that based on a neurostimulatory endpoint.
If the primary hypothesis is confirmed, this study will provide evidence supporting the use of ultrasound only (without nerve stimulation) as an end point for interscalene catheter placement. At present the community standard is nerve stimulation. This may result in future patients undergoing catheter insertions with reduced needle passes. Potential benefits might include  more efficient catheter placements, with less discomfort and with possibly a reduced incidence of short term neurological sequelae.</summary>
