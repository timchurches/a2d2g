    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival by Treatment Arm - Progression-free survival will be measured from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is defined using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST v1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma and assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate by Treatment Arm - Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed CR or PR per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST v1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma and assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete Response (CR) corresponds to disappearance of all target lesions, and Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from randomization to best response to treatment, assessed up to 3 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Disease Control Rate by Treatment Arm - Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants with best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) of = 12 weeks duration</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 3 years.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. Subjects with
      unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio
      to receive either tremelimumab or placebo. Approximately 564 subjects will be enrolled at
      study centers in multiple countries. The study consists of a screening period, a treatment
      period, a 90-day follow-up period for safety, and a long-term survival follow-up period.</summary>
