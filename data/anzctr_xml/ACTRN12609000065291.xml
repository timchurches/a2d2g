  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of tender points (out of 18 possible tender points). This can be achieved through physical examination by the trained reumatologist.</outcome>

    <concealment>Randomisation will not be exposed to those conducting the study and will be provided in closed letters with successive numbers. The envelope will be opened when a patient is going to join the study.
The study will be double blind. The patient, those who conduct the study and those who analyse the results will be unaware of the state of the patient with regard to receiving the active drug or placebo. For this to happen patients will be blinded by using a placebo which is identical to active drug in appearance but the content is a biologically inert substance. To blind those who conduct the study, the person who delivers the study drug will be different from those who examine the patients. Finally the randomisation table will be concealed from research staff by using closed envelops.</concealment>
    <sequence>There are 11 centres. Patients in each centre will be allocated to the intervention or control groups using a separate complete block randomisation method. Randomisation will not be exposed to those conducting the study and will be provided in closed letters with successive numbers. The envelope will be opened when a patient is going to join the study.</sequence>
