  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients originally receiving Lamivudine and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin will now receive lamivudine 100mg orally daily and tenofovir 300mg orally daily- Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) will be ceased once starting tenofovir. Patients will be excluded if they have evidence of HBV viral recurrence. In the screening phase the patients will be HBsAg negative and HBV DNA negative by PCR. At visit 1 the patient will be switched from HBIG and lamivudine to lamivudine and Tenofovir and taken once daily, orally, in the morning. The dose will be adjusted of both drugs according to renal function. The drugs will continue for the duration of the study- which is 5 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The aim of the proposed study is to assess the safety and efficacy of switching to tenofovir and lamivudine
therapy in patients who have been receiving long-term HBIg and lamivudine prophylaxis post-liver
transplant. primary endpoint will be the rate of hepatitis B recurrence as assessed by the appearance of HBsAg and HBVDNA in serum at 96 weeks post enrollment . This will be done on blood tests. Patients will be assessed every 3 months by medical staff and have monthly blood tests monitoring the Hepatitis B sAg and DNA and its recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>An initial analysis of outcomes will be performed at 48 weeks  and then at 96 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>It is expected that TDF/LAM will prove to be both safe and effective when used in this patient population to
prevent HBV recurrence- blood tests will be taken to monitor Hepatitis B sAg levels and Hepatitis B DNA levels. Patients will also be monitored regularly (every 3 months) by medical staff in regards to side effects and adverse events.
Impaired renal function:
Dosing interval adjustment is required in all patients with creatinine clearance &lt;50 ml/min.  Clinical response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients. VIREAD should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent.
It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to initiating therapy and, as clinically appropriate, during VIREAD therapy. Patients at risk for, or with a history of, renal dysfunction should be routinely monitored for changes in serum creatinine and phosphorus.
Lactic Acidosis/Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis:
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of antiretroviral nucleoside analogues alone or in combination, including tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in the treatment of HIV infection. A majority of these cases have been reported in women. The preclinical and clinical data suggest that the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis, a class effect of nucleoside analogues is low for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, as tenofovir is structurally related to nucleoside analogues, this risk cannot be excluded. Caution should be exercised when administering VIREAD to any patient, and particularly to those with known risk factors for liver disease. Treatment with VIREAD should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or hepatotoxicity.
Drug interactions:
Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the potential for CYP450 mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low.
Tenofovir is excreted renally. Coadministration of VIREAD with medicinal products that decrease or compete for renal clearance may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir.
Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, co-administration of VIREAD with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and/or increase the concentrations of other renally eliminated drugs.
HIV and HBV co-infection:
Due to the risk of development of HIV resistance, VIREAD should only be used as part of an appropriate antiretroviral combination regimen in HIV/HBV co-infected patients.
Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity:
In a long-term carcinogenicity study conducted in mice with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate there was a low incidence of duodenal tumours with the highest dose of 600 mg /kg/day. These were associated with a high incidence of duodenal mucosal hyperplasia, which was also observed with a dose of 300 mg/kg/day. These findings may be related to high local drug concentrations in the gastro-intestinal tract, likely to result in much higher exposure margins than that based on the AUC. At therapeutic doses the risk of these duodenal effects occurring in humans is likely to be low. The systemic drug exposure (AUC) with the 600 mg/kg/day dose was approximately 15 times the human exposure at the therapeutic dose of 300 mg/day. No tumourigenic response was observed in rats treated with doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day (5 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose based on AUC).
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was mutagenic in an in vitro mouse L5178Y lymphoma cell assay (tk locus) and in an ex vivo assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes, but it was negative in in vitro bacterial assays for gene mutation and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test for chromosomal damage. Tenofovir base was not active in in vitro bacterial assays for gene mutation, and an equivocal response was seen in the in vitro mouse L5178Y lymphoma assay at a high concentration.
Impairment of fertility:
Male and female rat fertility and mating performance or early embryonic development were unaffected by an oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate dose (600 mg/kg/day) that achieved systemic drug exposures that were in excess of the value in humans receiving the therapeutic dose (5-fold based on plasma AUC). There was, however, an alteration of the oestrous cycle in female rats.
Use in pregnancy:
Pregnancy Category B3. No clinical data are available for pregnant women being treated with VIREAD. Reproductive toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits did not reveal any evidence of harm to the foetus due to tenofovir at respective exposures (AUC) of 4-13 and 66-fold the human exposure. Subcutaneous treatment of pregnant rhesus monkeys with a dose of 30 mg/kg/day of the tenofovir base during the last half of pregnancy resulted in reduced foetal serum phosphorus concentrations. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, VIREAD should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
Use in lactation:
In animal studies tenofovir was excreted in milk after oral administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (rats) and after subcutaneous administration of tenofovir base (non-human primates). It is not known whether tenofovir is excreted in human milk. It is recommended that HIV and HBV infected women do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid transmission of HIV and HBV to the infant.
Bone Effects:
Bone toxicities including a reduction in bone mineral density have been observed in studies in three animal species (see Animal Toxicology, below). Clinically relevant bone abnormalities have not been seen in long term clinical studies (&gt;3 years). However, bone abnormalities may be associated with proximal renal tubulopathy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Post-Marketing Surveillance). If bone abnormalities are suspected during therapy then appropriate consultation should be obtained.
Animal Toxicology:
Tenofovir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate administered in toxicology studies to rats, dogs and monkeys at exposures (based on AUCs) between 6 and 12 fold those observed in humans caused bone toxicity. In monkeys the bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia. Osteomalacia observed in monkeys appeared to be reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of tenofovir. In rats and dogs, the bone toxicity manifested as reduced bone mineral density. The mechanism(s) underlying bone toxicity in unknown.
Evidence of renal toxicity was noted in 4 animal species. Increases in serum creatinine, BUN, glycosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia and /or calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate were observed to varying degrees in these animals. These toxicities were noted at exposures (based on AUCs) 2-20 times higher than those observed in humans. The relationship of the renal abnormalities, particularly the phosphaturia, to the bone toxicity is not known.
Effects on ability to drive and use machines:
No studies on the effects on ability to drive or use machines have been performed. However, patients should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of the combination of lamivudine (LAM) and low dose hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg)
prophylaxis has had a major impact on the rate of recurrence of hepatitis B following liver transplantation.
However, the long-term use of HBIg is extremely costly and very inconvenient for patients. There is a clear
need to develop an alternative more convenient and less costly long-term prophylactic regimen for use in
this patient group.
The aim of the proposed study is to assess the safety and efficacy of switching to tenofovir and lamivudine
therapy in patients who have been receiving long-term HBIg and lamivudine prophylaxis post-liver
transplant.</summary>
