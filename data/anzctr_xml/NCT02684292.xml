  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in the treatment of
      participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either pembrolizumab or brentuximab vedotin (BV) for up to 35
      three-week cycles of treatment.

      The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with pembrolizumab prolongs
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in participants with relapsed or
      refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma compared to treatment with BV.</summary>
