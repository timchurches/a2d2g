  <interventions>
    <interventions>Darbepoetin pre-filled syringer compared to sureclick delivery systems
1. The amount of darbepoetin will be variable according to their usual dosing (range can be from 20mcg 1 to 3 weekly to 200mcg weekly or 1 to 3 weekly).
2. The times and duration of treatment will be variable according to the usual regimen i.e. the participation in this study will not alter the dose and duration of the injections.
3. Cross-over non-drug trial (i.e. darbepoetin is the only drug). The participants will be required to use one device for 4 injections, followed by the alternative device for 4 injections, followed by the first device for another 4 injections. All injections will be taken one after the other according to their treatment regimen.
4. The intervention in this trial will be self-administered by the participants.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients will be randomised to commence therapy with one of the two devices by the use of treatment assignment envelopes.  Consecutively numbered treatment envelopes will be held by the study nurse.  After eligibility is confirmed and the subject is enrolled, the next consecutively numbered envelope will be opened to reveal the treatment assignment.  The treatment assignment will be recorded and the subject will then begin the appropriate treatment sequence.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The majority of patients with kidney failure have anaemia requiring erythropoietin therapy administered either subcutaneously or intravenously. Darbepoetin is a type of erythropoietin, which can be given via the subcutaneous or intravenous route. In patients prescribed subcutaneous darbepoetin, pain during and at the site of injection are common complaints. The aim of this study is to determine the differences in patients perceptions in the administration and pain between pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen darbepoetin in patients already on subcutaneous pre-filled syringe darbepoetin therapy.</summary>
