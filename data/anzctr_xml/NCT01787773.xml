             embolism in patient with venous thromboembolic disease or at high risk for venous
             thromboembolic disease. Patient must meet at least one of the following:

          -  Anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, has failed, cannot be achieved or
             maintained, must be interrupted, resulted in complication, or places the patient at

             bariatric, orthopedic, or pelvic surgery

          -  Past history of thromboembolic disease undergoing surgery

        Therapeutic anticoagulation can be achieved, but the patient has:

          -  Venous thromboembolism such as pulmonary embolism or DVT with limited cardiopulmonary
             reserve

          -  Massive pulmonary embolism already treated with thrombectomy or any thrombolytic
             therapy

          -  Chronic pulmonary embolism already treated with thrombectomy

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Condition that inhibits radiographic visualization of the IVC

          -  Known inadequate venous anatomy to allow insertion or retrieval of the filter from the
             IVC including occlusion of the SVC or jugular veins

          -  Known IVC transverse diameter at target implant site &gt; 28 mm

          -  Known obstructing abdominal mass or anatomy that is not suitable for infra-renal
             placement of IVC filter

          -  Known duplication of IVC or left-sided IVC

          -  Severe kyphosis or scoliosis

          -  Known IVC thrombosis extending to renal veins, or renal or gonadal vein thrombosis

          -  Risk for septic pulmonary embolism

          -  Confirmed bacteremia

          -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 ml/min, or dialysis dependent.

          -  Contrast agent allergy that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Nitinol (nickel-titanium), platinum, Polyether ether ketone
             (PEEK), UV Cure Adhesive or Cyanoacrylate Adhesive

          -  Uncontrolled or active coagulopathy or known uncorrectable bleeding diathesis

          -  Life expectance &lt; 6 months

          -  Female of childbearing potential who is pregnant or plans to become pregnant during
             the duration of the clinical study. (If a female of child bearing potential wishes to
             participate, she must have negative pregnancy test within 48 hours of the implantation
             and any retrieval procedures.)

          -  Has filter in place or underwent filter retrieval in previous 60 days

          -  Simultaneously participating in another therapeutic drug or device clinical trial or
             has participated in such trial in the 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Investigator considers patient to be a poor candidate for the study or that including
             the patient may compromise the study, e.g., suspect patient may not comply with follow
             up procedures, concomitant conditions

          -  Patient does not wish to consent to study or comply with study procedures, including
             possible 2 year follow up</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, multicenter single arm, nonrandomized study that will include 150
      patients at a maximum of 20 investigational sites. It is estimated that it may take 13 months
      to complete enrollment. Follow-up will continue through 24 months post-implant or one month
      post-retrieval, whichever occurs first. It is required that filters be retrieved from at
      least 50 patients and the filter is permanent in at least 50 patients.</summary>
