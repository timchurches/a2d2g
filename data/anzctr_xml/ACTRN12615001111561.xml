  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We designed this comparative effectiveness study as a quick economic model to timely support making an urgent choice for a cost/effective dual antiviral treatment protocol for chronic hepatitis C in a limited resource charity setting.
Methods: Data collected during the period of this interim report from the first 25 patients randomized to either one of two generic Sofosbuvir products (Grateziano or Gratisovir) in a daily dose of one 400 mg tablet plus a weight based ribavirin dose, were analyzed for both the degree and speed of virus load reduction at the end of 1 and 2 weeks from starting treatment. 
Results: 
As we planned to include a sample of 200 patients for a mean follow up duration of 9 months, the full report is expected to be available by the end of the year 2016.
Here we present interim data collected from the first 25 patients included in the study during the first 2 weeks of treatment.

The Log10 transformed virus load (Log PCR) in both groups showed an almost equal markedly significant reduction both at the end of week 1 and week 2 of starting treatment by more than 4 and 5 Logs respectively. The differences between the 2 treatment groups at both analysis points were not statistically significant (p = 602, 728) by both student t test and repeated measures ANOVA test.Whereas the difference between proportions of patients with ultra-rapid virologic response (uRVR) at the end of week 1 and very-rapid virologic response (vRVR) at the end of week 2 in both groups were also not statistically significant (vRVR: 10/13 versus 10/12 respectively (p = 0.95, 0.86 respectively))
Conclusion: We can conclude from this interim report that the two generic products Gratisovir and Grateziano are almost equally effective and equally rapid in reducing the HCV virus load. The predictive accuracy of our suggested markers of efficacy (the vRVR and the uRVR) and the results of truncated 3 months response guided therapy versus the recommended 6 months course duration will be addressed upon full completion of the study in our final report.</summary>
