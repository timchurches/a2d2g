    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Entecavir
Treatment: drugs - Lamivudine
Treatment: drugs - Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2A

Experimental: Peg-IFN-Alfa-2A + Lamivudine or Entecavir - Participants will receive lamivudine or entecavir alone for 8 weeks followed by peg-IFN-alfa-2A in combination with lamivudine or entecavir for 48 weeks.

No Intervention: Untreated Control Participants - Untreated control participants will be observed up to 80 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Entecavir
Participants will receive entecavir, either as a film-coated tablet or oral solution, once daily at a dose of 0.015 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) (maximum daily dose of 0.5 mg).

Treatment: drugs: Lamivudine
Participants will receive lamivudine, either as a film-coated tablet or oral solution, once daily at a dose of 3 mg/kg (maximum daily dose of 100 mg).

Treatment: drugs: Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2A
Participants will receive pegylated interferon-alfa-2A at a body surface area (BSA) based dose of 180 micrograms per 1.73 square meter (mcg/1.73m^2) BSA.
