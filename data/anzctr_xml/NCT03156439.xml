Experimental: BIS-001 ER - The subjects will be dosed twice daily (BID); in an on-site setting at dose initiation and at times of dose escalation to evaluate safety, and for specimen collection for routine laboratory and pharmacokinetic analysis. Subjects will be discharged and compliance of BID dosing will be monitored via twice daily phone calls by site staff. The initial dose will be 0.5mg BID with a dose escalation every 2-3 days until a maximum tolerated dose is observed or a maximum of 2.5mg BID dose is obtained.


Treatment: drugs: BIS-001 ER
BIS-001 ER is an extended release formulation of the nutritional supplement Huperzine A.
