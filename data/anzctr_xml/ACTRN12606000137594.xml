  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a longitudinal prospective cohort study of individuals hospitalised with decompensated heart failure.  Unselected consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary hospital with the primary diagnosis of heart failure will be followed for 12 months. Renal function (measured glomerular filtration rate) and renal blood flow will be measured at selected timepoints during admission and at 6 months, concurrent with detailed measurements of cardiac status (echocardiogram and neurohormonal profile).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an observational study of individuals who require hospital admission for severe heart failure.  At admission and at 6 and 12 months of community follow up detailed measurement of both heart and kidney function will describe the nature, severity and frequency of kidney failure. The study aims to determine the important predictors of kidney impairment in severe heart failure.</summary>
