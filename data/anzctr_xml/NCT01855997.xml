    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Peg-IFN alfa-2a

Adult CHB Participants Treated With Peg-IFN Alfa-2a - Adult participants with CHB infection, and who have completed at least 24 weeks of Peg-IFN alfa-2a with/without nucleoside analogue therapy and at least 24 weeks of follow-up, will be included. Participants will be recruited from Roche clinical trials or general practice; no treatment will be administered in this non-interventional study.


Treatment: drugs: Peg-IFN alfa-2a
Participants received Peg-IFN alfa-2a prior to enrollment for at least 24 weeks. Dosing was chosen according to standard of care or at the discretion of the treating physician.

      <outcome>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion or Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Clearance =24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Positive East Asian (CN) Population: Additive Model - Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of the antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of the antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</outcome>

      <outcome>SNPs Associated With HBsAg Clearance =24 Weeks Post-Treatment in CN Population: Dominant Model - GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response. Only a single SNP (rs7549785) was included in the analysis.</outcome>

    <summary>This Phase 4 study is designed for the collection of blood biomarker samples from
      participants who have completed CHB treatment with at least 24 weeks of a pegylated
      interferon alfa-2a (Peg-IFN alfa-2a) containing regimen and at least 24 weeks post-treatment
      follow-up. Participants may be enrolled from historical studies supported or sponsored by
      Roche, ongoing studies supported or sponsored by Roche, or from general medical practice. The
      follow-up of individuals who choose to participate in this study will be in accordance with
      the ongoing studies or with the general medical practice of the physician. Data from whole
      blood deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples collected in the GV28555 study or available from
      previously collected Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) samples will be used for combined
      analysis with data from other applicable studies. Procedures will include blood sample
      collection (not applicable for participants who previously have consented and donated RCR DNA
      samples) and medical record capture.</summary>
