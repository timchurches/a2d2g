  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of the project is to examine the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and a range of factors that contribute to emotional health. An emotional health program (The Insights program) is being run as part of the Year 8 or 9 curriculum (at secondary schools), The schools provide either an intervention group or a control group or both. 

The 'Insights program'  program is psycho-educational and school teachers themselves are trained in the program implementation (5 hour training workshop delivered by Clinical Psychologists). The teachers deliver the program during pastoral care or PDHPE time with students. The program involves 18 single period lessons (between 50 and 70 mins in length (depending on the school structure). It is delivered either weekly or fortnightly (at some schools it has been delivered, 3 times per fortnight). The delivery frequency is dependent on school preferences. 

The overall objective of the project is to examine the impact of changing intolerance of uncertainty on factors which are associated with emotional health. The program aims to increase the protective factors (through a combination of education and skills training) and to reduce avoidance, ruminative thinking, discomfort with uncertainty, catastrophic thinking, envy and perfectionism in students. The program provides students with the ability to resist and evaluate the pressures that are placed on them. 

Teacher training is supplemented with additional consultation as requested by each school (depending on school teacher availability). School counsellors support the training and coordination of the program at the schools. A teacher fidelity manual is used to record whether all key points are covered in each lesson. Student absences are noted per lesson in this manual. This information is added using the participant ID codes to the research database.

Resources are incorporated within the Insights program - the program covers specific topics including: understanding the role of uncertainty within interpersonal relationships, perfectionism, procrastination, self soothing and self compassion, responses to negative thoughts, body image, social media, exercise, nutrition and sleep. The program incorporates mindfulness and acceptance and covers cognitive behavioural factors required to build resilience, and adolescent physical and emotional health. The program provides students and staff with a framework to understand and discuss pressures experienced by each student.   </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is longitudinal and will measure change in symptoms over time. The design will allow for a mediational analysis to examine mechanisms of change. The factors hypothesized to mediate change are discomfort with uncertainty, a tendency to ruminate and perfectionism. These transdiagnostic factors predict future onset of depression, comorbidity and/or poor response to treatment for anxiety or depression 

The GEE emphasises the change between the group conditions after accounting for within subjects variance, and is an optimal longitudinal framework over alternatives such as mixed models, for comparing change rates between randomised groups. This GEE framework of models can also be applied in multiple types count, or continuous outcomes, together showing an analysis of intervention related in multiple outcomes. Each of the primary and secondary outcome scales of interest, are considered in separate analyses. This is done in order to clarify how the intervention impacts different aspects of emotional difficulties and symptoms associated with media usage. Finally, the way in which cognitive changes can underpin the overall rate of intervention related change will be tested through a framework of moderators and mediators, following the guidelines of Schluchter (2008). 
Power analysis 
A simulation analysis was conducted prior to data collection in order to estimate power and sample size requirements. A model specifying count data (Poisson distribution), minimal effect size for change over time of 0.05, and a within subjects term (minimal random intercept) was simulated using the lme4 package in R statistical software (Green &amp; MacLeod, 2016). 
 The research will examine changes within subgroups. We aim for a strong level of power to detect small differences between the control group and intervention across a number of variables. A sample larger than 400 participants in the intervention and over 300 participants in the control condition was determined as minimally sufficient to detect minute effects and change over time. Processes underpinning improvement will be investigated in the intervention group, therefore, a larger sample is required for this group.  The aim of recruiting 1000 participants will allow for attrition from data collection as measures are being administered within class groups during school hours.
