  <interventions>
    <interventions>An initial session will be conducted by an Exercise Physiologist to teach the intervention subjects the HAMP activities and exercises. This session will be approximately 60 minutes in duration and will include a series of simple physical exercises that can be completed at home with minimal equipment. The HAMP exercises are clearly explained in a booklet containing pictures and instructions which the intervention participants will take home to work from. The HAMP booklet contains a standard set of exercises for each intervention participant.
The home based activities and exercises are then to be completed independently within the participant's own home for a minumum of 30 minutes 3 times per week for a period of 12 weeks. 
Telephone contact will be made with participants at weeks 3, 6 and 9. Additional calls will be taken at any time from subjects to support their participation. Intervention subjects will be re-assessed in week 13.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group subjects will be provided with once off general information on health and maintaining independence in the form of a brief 15 minute consultation with an Exercise Physiologist and will also be provided with a "Eat Well, Be Active" booklet. No contact will be made with control subjects over the intervention period. Control subjects will be offered the HAMP information and training, including telephone support following their final re-assessment in week 13.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional mobility is generally considered a major contributor to maintaining quality of life at any age. Degenerative changes and lower levels of physical activity that often occur with ageing, contribute to impaired function and mobility and increase the risk of falling and loss of independence for older adults. This study will investigate the benefits of the Home Activity Monitoring Program (HAMP) on functional fitness in home dwelling older adults and also report on the incidence of falls in this group.</summary>
