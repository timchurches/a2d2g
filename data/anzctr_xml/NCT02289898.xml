  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, double blind, 3 arm (1:1:1) study in subjects with 1st-line metastatic
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

      The purpose is to test the efficacy and safety of demcizumab, when given in combination with
      gemcitabine and Abraxane® compared to placebo. The administration of gemcitabine and
      Abraxane® is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma.</summary>
