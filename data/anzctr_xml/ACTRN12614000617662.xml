  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effect of drug on volatile organic compounds. The drug will be given to the subject for 10 days. At the end of this period the patient will blow into a tube that would collect the exhaled breath. That tube will be sent for analysis to determine the number and concentration of organic compounds.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed. Patients would be recruited from the public. They would have a diagnosis of COPD and fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They would then be randomised to a treatment. The treatment is an inhaler. The palcebo and treatment inhaler are identical. Only COPD patients would be randomised. 
Healthy volunteers would be recruited from the regular volunteers from theLung Institute of Western Australia</concealment>
    <sequence>There would be simple randomisation using a randomisation table from a statistic book. The subjects would be randomly given an inhaler that may be placebo or treatment. The investigator is blinded to this.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We  initially did a pilot study to identify differences in exhaled volatile organic compunds (VOCs) between healthy and COPD subjects. Based on the differences between healthy and COPD, the data was analysed by RM-ANOVA. The mean SD was a difference of 5 VOCs and for a desired change of at least 5 VOCS difference p = 0.05 and a power of 0.8, the group sizes will be n=25/group for an RM-ANOVA analysis  (PASS, v13, NCSS, USA).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are investigating the effect of Indacaterol on the effect on volatile organic compounds (VOCS) in COPD from exhaled air.
VOCS would be initially sampled from healthy controls and COPD. The COPD patients would be randomised to treatment or placebo and VOCS measured. We would then determine whether there are specific VOCS in COPD that changes with treatment. Thsi would give us insights into biomarkers for this disease.</summary>
