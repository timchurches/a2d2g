  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Gabapentin 
Dose administered: The initial dosing regime will be the same for all participants. For all children, the dosage will be increased over 5 weeks as stated below: 
Week 1  100 mg daily
Week 2  100 mg twice daily
Week 3 - 200 mg twice daily
Week 4  300 mg twice daily
Week 5  300 mg three times a day
However there is the potential for the dose to be escalated beyond this to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day for heavier children, or for those children who have had no change in symptoms and have tolerated the medication. Dosage regime and escalation will be managed by the study doctor allocated to each participant.
Duration of administration: 12 weeks
Mode of administration: Orally, and for children who have a feeding tube in situ, the capsule contents will be dissolved in water and given via a gastrostomy, nasojejunal, gastrojejunal or nasogastric tube.
Weekly phone calls to the study participants will be made by the study doctor to ensure that the dosage regime is being followed and to monitor tolerance to the medication.
The hospital pharmacy will dispense the medication and will only provide families with the amount of medication required to take them to the next study assessment visit, whereby they will be provided with more depending on the dosage at that time point. Pharmacy will maintain records regarding when and how much study medication is dispensed by each patient in the study. Parents will be asked to return all unused capsules at each clinic visit. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing regimen will be recorded. Any discrepencies will be investigated. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This is a feasibility pilot study, and the main objective is to gather preliminary data on gabapentin for managing pain in children with dystonic CP to inform a future RCT. This will include trialling the recruitment process. There will be a composite feasibility outcome of recruitment number, recruitment rate and retention rate, all assessed by review of study records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At conclusion of study - 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications and side effects of the medication, will be assessed by review of daily medication logs completed by parents. For example, possible side-effects such as drowsiness and confusion, upset stomach, weakness, mood or behaviour changes will be recorded by parents on the daily medication diaries. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At conclusion of study - 12 weeks (but side-effects and complications and feedback from parents will all be closely monitored by the study doctors on a weekly basis).</timepoint>

Barry Albright Dystonia (BAD) Scale
Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI 3) Multi-Attribute Health Status Classification System</outcome>
      <timepoint>BAD Scale - Baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks.
HUI-3 - Screening/baseline, and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1)	Confirmation of dystonia after completion of the Hypertonicity Assessment Tool (HAT). Those children who have dystonia or a mixed diagnosis (spasticity and dystonia) will be eligible. 
2)	Severity of dystonia will be determined with the Barry Albright Dystonia (BAD) scale. Children with a score of 15 or higher on the BAD scale will be eligible.
3)	Pain will be quantified using the Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI 3). Those children scoring IV or V will be eligible.

    <exclusivecriteria>Children excluded from the study will be those who:
1.	Are younger than 6 years because they will have more difficulty with reliably self-reporting and will not be able to perform some of the quantitative measurements.
2.	Are currently on gabapentin or have been on gabapentin in the previous 3 months
3.	Have demonstrated hypersensitivity to gabapentin or the inactive ingredients in the capsules in the past
4.	Are currently taking other medications that may interact with gabapentin (i.e. antacid, cimetidine, morphine, and opioids).
5.	Pregnant female participants </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>This study is a pilot to primarily examine feasibility and does not require a power calculation. Descriptive statistics for baseline participant characteristics will include mean age and range and spread of severity of CP as described by the GMFCS, MACS and CFCS. Individual change scores on the COPM, CP CHILD, CCHQ, PPP and BAD will be calculated. The range of change scores for each outcome measure will be reported for the group. Variation in effect sizes for individuals and magnitude in responses will be established. Information about side effects/adverse events, compliance and parental and child acceptance of the treatment will be described. Data analysis will help to inform sample sizes and inclusion criteria for a future trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this feasibility pilot study is to gather preliminary data on the use of gabapentin to reduce pain in children with dystonic CP to inform a future RCT including trialling the recruitment process and retention rate, the outcome measures, and to identify complications and side effects from the medication which could impact on the design of an RCT. The study will specifically examine the variability of results for different outcome measures to determine effect sizes that will be used to inform the planning of a future trial (choice of primary outcome measure, sample size planning).
