    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by investigator based on RECIST 1.1 - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population whose best overall response (BOR) is confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on imaging per RECIST 1.1. According to RECIST 1.1, CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR according to RECIST 1.1 is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions as assessed by the investigator, taking as reference the baseline SOD.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ORR as assessed by investigator based on immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) in conjunction with RECIST 1.1 - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose best response based on imaging is CR or PR per irRECIST. irRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression. The irRECIST modification to RECIST is used in conjunction with RECIST 1.1 to determine the BOR. At initial PD by RECIST 1.1, if participant is clinically stable the investigator may continue to treat and scan again =4 weeks later to see if PD confirmed. CR is disappearance of all lesions (target, non-target, and new lesions if any had appeared). PR is a decrease of =30% in the SOD of target lesions from baseline, with no indication of further progression by non-target or new lesions. BOR during irRECIST portion is the most favorable visit response observed, with no confirmation requirement. BOR for the participant overall is the more favorable of the RECIST 1.1 (pre-PD) and irRECIST (post-PD) BORs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
