    <interventions>Effects of posture and meal volume on gastric emptying, gut hormones, glycaemia, plasma insulin, haemodynamics, absorption, appetite, and gastrointestinal symptoms after gastric bypass.

Gastric emptying will be measured using scintigraphy for 4 hours directly after meal consumption
Gut hormones, glycaemia, plasma insulin and glucose absorption will be measured by taking blood samples at baseline (before meal consumption), and throughout the 4 hour duration of the study (after meal consumption) with the last sample taken at 240mins.
Appetite and gastrointestinal symptoms will be measured using questionnaires filled out at baseline and throughout the study with the last questionnaire filled out at the completion of the study (240mins)

Each subject will undergo concurrent measurements of gastric emptying, gut hormones, blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate and gastrointestinal symptoms on 4 occasions, separated by at least 4 weeks in randomised order: (i) sitting &amp; 50ml water/50g glucose; (ii) sitting &amp; 200ml water/50g glucose; (iii) supine &amp; 50ml water/50g glucose; and (iv) supine &amp; 200ml water/50g glucose.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the effect of meal volume and posture on the rate of gastric emptying in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) patients</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured on 4 separate occasions, separated by at least 4 weeks in randomised order (i) sitting &amp; 50ml water/50g glucose; (ii) sitting &amp; 200ml water/50g glucose; (iii) supine &amp; 50ml water/50g glucose and (iv) supine &amp; 200ml water/50g glucose. Gastric emptying will be measured directly after meal consumption using scintigraphy for the entire 4 hour duration of each study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma concentrations of gut hormones (Cholecystokinin peptide YY, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin) and its correlation to the rate of gastric emptying.</outcome>
      <timepoint>intial baseline blood sample taken before meal consumption, then at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240mins after meal consumption.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood glucose concentrations and its correlation to the rate of gastric emptying.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood glucose concentrations will be immediately determined using a portable blood glucose meter at baseline prior to meal consumption, then at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240mins after meal consumption.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Variations in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) and their correlations to the rate of gastric emptying.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BP (systolic and diastolic) and HR will also be measured with an automated oscillometric BP monitor (DINAMAP ProCare 100) at 3min intervals for the first 2 hours of the study and every 10mins for the remaining 2 hours of the study with the last timepoint at 240mins.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal symptoms</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured on physiological study days with a visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire. This questionnaire will be filled out at baseline before meal consumption and then at 15min intervals for the first 2 hours after meal consumption and every 30mins for the remaining 2hrs of the study. Last timepoint at 240mins.</timepoint>
