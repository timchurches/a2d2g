    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteer subjects will be screened for eligibility and those who qualify will be sent informed consent materials. Consenting participants will then be assigned a study number for randomisation by a central computer to conceal thier allocation.

After randomisation, consenting participants will be sent their clinical trial pack, consisting of blinded study medication (placebo, low dose or high dose) diet diary, medication diary, blood collection forms and migraine diary. Trial then commences with 6 weekly followups to test for compliance and medication status.</concealment>
    <sequence>From the total participant pool for each sex, placebo, low dose and high dose places have been randomised to different participant numbers. Randomisation will be via simple randomisation by computer generated tables. As participants commence the study, they will be assigned the next number and thus enter the treatment goup randomly selected for that number.</sequence>
