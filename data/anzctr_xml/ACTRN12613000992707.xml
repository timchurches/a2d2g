  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of suffering and death in pregnant women. Diseases that are known to affect the heart and circulation in pregnant women include high blood pressure diseases such as preeclampsia, and infective diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). For some women the cardiovascular disease occurs before pregnancy and in others heart disease may occur during pregnancy. Pregnancy itself causes changes in the heart and circulation and therefore it is sometimes it difficult to identify cardiac disease, using routine monitoring techniques, in pregnant women due to these normal changes of pregnancy. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and ophthalmic artery Doppler are ultrasound techniques that can examine a pregnant woman's heart and also her eye to help us understand the changes that occur in these diseases. The aim of this study is to examine women with preeclampsia, women with HIV and women who are critically unwell, as well as healthy pregnant women, using these techniques to understand better the changes that occur when compared with healthy pregnant women.</summary>
