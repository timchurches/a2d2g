  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of belinostat when given
      together with azacitidine in treating patients with advanced hematologic cancers or other
      diseases. Belinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving belinostat together with
      azacitidine may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
