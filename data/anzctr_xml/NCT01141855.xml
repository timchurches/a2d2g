  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Champix
Behaviour - Counselling alone

Experimental: Champix plus counselling - varenicline tartrate will be initiated whilst subjects are inpatients with the standard MIMS dosing schedule (including period of titration). In combination with Quit SA (5A) telephone counselling service

Active Comparator: counselling alone - 5A counselling via Quit SA (quitline) telephone counselling service. (maximum 8 phone calls per subject within a 3 month period).


Treatment: drugs: Champix
Standard MIMS dosage (including period of titration) will be used. 0.5mg daily for 3 days 0.5mg b.d. for 4 days
1mb b.d. for 70 days (full course 3 months)

Behaviour: Counselling alone
Quit SA 5A counselling over the phone. Maximum 8 calls over a 3 month period

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smoking abstinence - Continued smoking abstinence is defined as: less than or equal to no more than 5 cigarettes smoked during the period of 2 weeks to 12 months post enrollment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduced hospital bed utilisation - Hospital casemix/DRG data will be collected for the 5 years prior to enrollment and one year post enrollment. This will be supplemented by SA Department of Health data and PBS/MBS data sets of study completion, to monitor admissions at other hospitals and GP visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>7-day point prevalence - Defined as no cigarettes for the previous 7 days</outcome>
      <timepoint>from 2 weeks to 3 months post enrollment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in health care costs - Reduced health care costs with greater economic value will be relative to other health interventions. Four seperate economic models will be built for vascular diseases: cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases and airways diseases: asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each model will compare outcomes and costs for varenicline and counselling compared to counselling alone, and will incorporate epidemiological data on natural disease progression of smokers and previous smokers from the four disease profiles split by gender if indicated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inpatient craving levels - Craving scales will be used to assess levels during inpatient stay (pre and post intervention delivery)</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline to end of inpatient stay</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of inpatient smoking - Measured by self-report and observation by hospital and study staff prior to discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to end of inpatient stay</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <summary>The Smoking Termination Opportunity for inPatients, (STOP) project is designed to capture the
      opportunity that is provided by admission for acute smoking related illness, to assist
      patients through withdrawal by use of a combination of:

        -  the new medication Champix with

        -  best practice counselling

        -  initiated in an inpatient setting

      to achieve:

        -  sustained smoking abstinence

        -  reduced hospital bed and health service utilisation

        -  reduced inpatient smoking and craving prior to discharge</summary>
