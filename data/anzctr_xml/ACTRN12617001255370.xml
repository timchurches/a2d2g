  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study uses a parallel group comparison design, where usual standard care (control group) or the intervention (HPV self-testing program) will be allocated by primary health care clinic. Inclusion criteria: Maori women who have not had a cervical smear screen in the last 4 years. 
Brief title
Offer of self -testing HPV swab to under-screened Maori women 

1)	Educational Intervention for clinicians and community workers
Materials - Educational material (written/presentation/teaching sessions) given to doctors, nurses, community workers by experts in HPV from research team
Who will deliver intervention -  Research team (Professor oncological gynaecology, professor Obstetrics and Gynaecology,  sexual health physician/ senior research fellow,  family physician/ researcher with expertise in womens health) will provide educational material and sessions for nurse, doctors and community workers
Mode of delivery - Educational sessions to clinicians will be offered to groups of clinicians from intervention primary care practices in small tutorial setting
Number of times intervention offered - Education sessions will be offered twice to groups of clinicians over 3 months - 2 x 1 hour sessions 
Location- Education sessions will be offered in primary care setting/clinic/local community hall

2)	Intervention for participants   under-screened Maori women offered self taken vaginal swab for HPV

Materials - Instructions and diagrams for women being offered HPV self-testing will be co-designed by research team plus input from primary health clinicians, community workers and the women themselves (focus groups) ( draft HPV information and consent is attached to ANZCTR registration form)

Procedures -Women will receive verbal, written and /or pictorial instructions from a doctor, nurse or kaiawhina (community health worker) about how to perform the HPV self-test, a self-collected vaginal sample. Women will self-collect a vaginal sample using a swab. The instructions will detail how to insert the swab into the vagina and place it into a collection container that has been labelled by the healthcare worker with the name, date of birth and unique NHI (National Health Index) number.   Specimens are transported at room temperature to local Laboratories, who have agreed to handle the transportation of the samples, with their daily shipments, to national central Laboratories. HPV genotyping will be carried out using Real-time High Risk HPV assay validated for the use of dry swabs.  This distinguishes HPV-16 and HPV-18 from other high-risk types and from negative samples. 

Who will deliver intervention  the (participants) womans usual primary care clinician (family doctor or nurse) or community health worker will deliver the information to participants

Mode of delivery - HPV swab testing will be offered by doctor, nurse or community worker, face-to-face individually 

HPV self-testing will be offered between 1 - 5 times over one year to under-screened Maori women

Location- HPV self- testing will be offered in patients home, community venues such as local meeting houses (Maraes) if facilities allow, primary care clinic

Results  results of self- testing for HPV will be given by the womans usual primary care clinician ( doctor or nurse.) This can be done by phone or text if the result is negative or if results positive for high risk HPV an appointment will be made for the woman to obtain result and explanation face to face.  Results will be available 7-14 days after test has been taken.
Results will also be entered into the National Screening Unit data base (as per usual cervical smear results). This process has been discussed with the screening unit CEO and clinician in charge of cervical screening database. 
Any positive result will be followed up and referred for colposcopy by the womans usual primary care clinician.

Our study site is Northland where Maori women have almost twice the incidence of cervical cancer compared to non-Maori but almost four times the mortality. In Northland, cervical screening for Maori is approximately 66%. Women fulfilling inclusion criteria will be identified by primary care and matched with the National Screening Unit (NSU) on NHI to confirm screening history. All primary care clinics in the geographical area will be approached and recruited and randomised to intervention or control (usual care). We will recruit until target met.

    <comparator>The study uses a parallel group comparison design, where the control group is primary health care clinic offering usual standard care in the offer of cervical screening to Maori women who are under-screened ( cervical smear &gt; 4 years ago). Once the study is completed and if successful, the four clinics used initially for control (usual standard care) comparisons will be offered access to the HPV self-testing program. 'Usual care' is offer of appointment for cervical smear by letter or phone call to women who have not had a cervical smear for 4 or more years.</comparator>

On average, there will be 100 unscreened Maori women per clinic to give 400 per treatment arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Even though cervical cancer is preventable, our current screening programme is failing Maori women. There are unacceptable disparities being experienced by Maori women, from access to screening to mortality. Maori women are twice as likely to die from cervical cancer than non-Maori women.  Our project - He Tapu Te Whare Tangata - aims to increase cervical screening coverage through HPV self-testing, delivered through community-based health practices.  We will use an innovative technology that screens women for infection with the types of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that cause cervical cancer. This project will enable what works for Maori women to inform any national roll-out of HPV screening. The project is Maori led and Maori centered. It will build Maori research and workforce capability, and improve the detection of pre-cancerous lesions in Maori women. This will ultimately reduce the unnecessary inequity in mortality from a preventable cancer that disproportionately affects Maori women. Eight primary care practices (and their clinicians and community workers) will be allocated to either to usual standard care (cervical screening with a speculum) or the intervention (self HPV testing program). All women (not just Maori) women who have not screened in the last 4 years will be identified through primary care and will constitute the clinic cohort to reach for screening either by standard usual care or by the intervention program. There will be no charge for the HPV test or follow up of abnormal results. Intervention: clinics will offer women in this group self testing including information and education. 
Usual Standard Care 
Clinics will offer women in this group a cervical smear using usual standard care. Any changes over time in this usual standard care for each practice will be documented. Data from the National Screening Unit will identify which women were screened ( by whichever method) within the study period. 
We hypothesise that introducing an HPV self-testing program (He Tapu Te Whare Tangata) will result in higher cervical screening rates than the usual standard care for Maori who have not had a cervical screen in the last 4 years.</summary>
