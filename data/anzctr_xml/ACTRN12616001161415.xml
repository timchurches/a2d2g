  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pedometer intervention arm: Pedometer intervention in addition to usual care. 
Usual care: received by both groups. This includes individualised exercise prescribed by a physiotherapist, carried out by either a physiotherapist or allied health assistant (AHA) in individual and/or group settings. In addition, all participants receive an independent exercise programme with 3-6 exercises that they are encouraged to carry out independently and with supervision as required from family, visitors and staff. All eligible participants will have walking included as an exercise in this program. All participants are provided with a daily exercise recording sheet for this program weekly.  
Pedometer intervention: Participants randomised into the intervention group will receive a Yamax Digiwalker SW200 pedometer (Yamax Corp., Tokyo, Japan). They will be instructed to wear it on the waist band, preferably on a less affected leg. It will be worn for all waking hours once a participant is dressed. It will be taken off when participants change into their night clothes. Those in the pedometer intervention arm will be asked to record the number of steps taken at the end of the day as displayed on the pedometer. Family and nursing staff will be asked to assist. The feedback to participants, family and staff will be to increase number of steps taken every day. No specific target will be given to limit increasing workload of ward physiotherapist. 
Participants will wear the pedometer for the duration of their stay as long as they are a rehabilitation patient. Their adherence will be monitored by staff daily. Activpal step data will also be compared to pedometer data and will show usage in the first 2 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care control arm: usual care in addition to blinded pedometer use
Usual care: received by both groups. This includes individualised exercise prescribed by a physiotherapist, carried out by either a physiotherapist or allied health assistant (AHA) in individual and/or group settings. In addition, all participants receive an independent exercise programme with 3-6 exercises that they are encouraged to carry out independently and with supervision as required from family, visitors and staff. All eligible participants will have walking included as an exercise in this program. All participants are provided with a daily exercise recording sheet for this program weekly.  
Control Arm: Participants will be asked to record an estimate of distance walked each day on exercise recording sheet. Family and nursing staff will be asked to assist. They will be provided with information on common walk distances at JLGRU as measured by a ward plan. The feedback to participants, family and staff will be to increase the total distance walked each day. No specific target will be given to limit increasing workload of ward physiotherapist. They will also be provided with a pedometer that will be fixed shut. Support staff will record number of steps taken early in the morning for the previous day and fix shut again. 
Participants will wear the pedometer for the duration of their stay as long as they are a rehabilitation patient. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this study was based on a previous study conducted in a subacute rehabilitation setting with a similar cohort (de Morton &amp; Lane, 2010). It showed the median De Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) score was 30.2 with a standard deviation of 16.7. Sample size estimation was based on the group achieving a minimal detectable change and clinically meaningful change of 10.5 points on the DEMMI. With a one tailed significance threshold of 0.05 and a power of 80%, 32 participants were required in each group. To account for a 20% dropout rate, 78 participants will be recruited for this study.
The primary outcomes will be analysed on an intention to treat basis. Between group differences in the primary outcome measure, DEMMI, will be analysed using independent t tests if normally distributed, otherwise Mann Whitney tests will be used. The level of significance will be set at 0.05.
Between group differences at discharge for secondary outcome measures, gait speed, time spent upright, discharge Function Independence Measure (FIM) score, steps taken with Activpal, steps taken with pedometer, perceived levels of helpfulness and enjoyment of pedometer use will be analysed using independent t tests. If data is not normally distributed, Mann Whitney tests will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed project will evaluate the feasibility of using pedometers as a motivational tool to improve mobility outcomes in inpatient rehabilitation. All eligible patients on the rehabilitation ward will be invited once they are able to walk with or without the assistance of one person, with our without a gait aid for a minimum of 3 metres. All participants will be provided with a pedometer for the duration of their stay. Those in the pedometer intervention arm will record daily step counts and be encouraged by staff, family and friends to take more steps each day. Those in the control arm will wear pedometers fixed shut and will be encouraged to walk further each day. Mobility outcomes will be measured at two points, before allocation and discharge from the ward. Pedometer usability by participants will also be evaluated.</summary>
