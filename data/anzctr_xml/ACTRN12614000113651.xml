  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.To compare changes in physical activity, fatigue, quality of life (QoL), self-efficacy, sexual interest/function and diet and nutrition for prostate cancer survivors on androgen depravation therapy (PCa-ADT) participating in the Man Plan programme compared to PCa-ADT survivors undergoing usual care (i.e., no physical activity).  The Man Plan programme is a physical activity programme designed for prostate cancer survivors on ADT treatment. The Man Plan consists of an instructional DVD, which goes through a series of exercises, which includes the use of resistance bands.  The men are encouraged to engage in these physical activities on a regular daily basis. Each participant enrolled in the Man Plan component will be told to engage in the physical activities for a 20 minute period each day.  With the exception of the physical activity measure (administered at three time points) and the focus group interviews (at three time points for a sub-group of participants) no strategies will be used to monitor adherence to the intervention. Each participant will enrolled in the study over a 12 month period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Measures will be administered to both groups (intervention and control group) at three times points during the 12-month study period.  Control participants will not be participating in the Man Plan physical activity programme.  Control participants will receive usual care treatment which does not include engaging in a physical activity programme, or specific advice for regular physical activity engagement. </comparator>

    <concealment>Once ethical approval is obtained, the recruitment process will begin.  Participants will be recruited through their clinician's, with Abbvie (pharmaceutical company) contacting on our behalf the urologists and other clinicians throughout the country who prescribe Lucrin.  Potential participants identified by each clinician will then be mailed a Letter of Invitation, an Information Sheet and a Consent Form with a reply paid envelope in which to return their completed Consent Form if they consent to participate in the study.  Potential participants will be given a 2 week period in which to return their Consent Forms.  After this time one follow up phone call will be made, first to ascertain that they received information regarding the study and secondly to ascertain if they agree to take part in the study.  

Once a participant has given consent to take part in the study the enrollment process will begin. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group based on the order in which they enroll (i.e., participant one will be allocated to the intervention group, participant two will be allocated to the control group).  Allocation will be carried by central randomisation by a computer generated list.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Please note that three focus groups will also be carried out with some intervention participants and individual interviews will be carried out with some clinicians.  Three focus groups ideally involving the same group of 8-10 intervention group participants will be conducted in line with the quantitative assessments. 
Individual face-to-face interviews involving 10-15 clinicians (i.e. urologists, general practitioners or oncologists) who prescribe Lucrin will be conducted during the first 18 months of the study to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing the clinicians promotion of the Man Plan to their patients.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A one-way repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be carried out to examine whether any significant changes in physical activity, fatigue, QOL, self-efficacy and sexual health scores occur over the three time points (baseline, 6 months post-baseline and 12 months post-baseline) for participants in both groups.  One hundred PCa-ADT survivors will take part in the main quantitative component.  This number of participants (n=100) meets statistical assumptions for effect size calculations and for conducting post-hoc tests for significance (Pallant, 2013). Previous physical activity interventions that have been carried out with prostate cancer survivors have had similar sample sizes that showed a clinically relevant effect (Culos-Reed et al., 2010; Zahavich et al., 2013).


Qualitative analysis: An inductive thematic approach to analyse themes that emerge regarding the benefits and barriers of the physical activity programme, issues around fatigue, quality of life, self-efficacy and sexual health.  It is envisioned that by carrying out each focus group at three time points within the study period with the same group of participants will help provide information regarding the perceived benefits and barriers that the physical activity programme had on their physical and psychological health status and other/related issues that cannot be ascertained by set questionnaires.  Eight to ten intervention participants will participate in the focus groups.
Ten to fifteen clinicians who prescribe Lucrin and/or endorse the Man Plan programme and/or treat PCa patients and survivors will also be individually interviewed regarding their views on physical activity for PCa-ADT patients and the role of the Man Plan programme. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An intervention study involving two groups: an intervention group and a control group.  Group  1 will consist of 50 PCa participants undertaking the Man Plan programme and group 2 will consist of 50 control PCa participants who do not participate in the  Man Plan programme (usual care group) as advice on physical activity is not currently a part of usual care for PCa-ADT patients in New Zealand.  Both groups of participants will be on ADT treatment of Lucrin.  </summary>
