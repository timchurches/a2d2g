  <interventions>
    <interventions>Over the three week experimental period, participation will receive all of the experimental doses. One dose will be taken at each session (i.e. high, low THC or placebo) and the order of dosing will be randomised. 
1.	THC (high dose), comprising 20mg/kg of THC (0.092mg THC per 5ml dose) in 5 ml bearer oil. 
2.	THC (low dose), comprising 10mg/kg of THC (0.046mg THC per 5ml dose) in 5 ml bearer oil.
Each dose is complete and is not weight related, i.e. participants will not have repeated doses .of the THC oil. The dose will be administered orally in the form of a 5ml bearer sesame oil, to be delivered in an unmarked amber coloured vial. Adherence to the treatment protocol will be confirmed by assessing an empty treatment vial, which will be returned to the research nurse. The dose (high, low THC or placebo) will be randomised and will be provided once to participants at baseline at each of the three testing sessions (to occur one week apart).

The saliva tests employed are the same as those currently used in Policing practice during random roadside drug tests; The Securetec Drugwipe (registered trademark) TWIN oral drug test. Saliva will be obtained using Securetec Drugwipe (registered trademark) TWIN and will be taken at six time points during each experimental session. The Securetec Drugwipe (registered trademark) TWIN drug screen requires an absorbent pad to be placed over the tongue for approximately 20 seconds. 1ml of saliva will be taken per sample, therefore approximately 6ml in total over each of the three experimental sessions. A sample volume of less than 10 micro litres is sufficient for analysis. The device is wiped on the tongue, when the colour has changed from pink to yellow there is the required amount of saliva to obtain the results. The first saliva sample will be used to test for the presence of drugs (baseline sample), and the other samples will be used to test for the concentration of the treatment (or placebo) over time as part of the testing session. Saliva testing will occur at baseline (prior to dosing), immediately post dosing (5 minutes post dosing), 30 minutes post dosing, 1 hour post dosing, 3 ours post dosing and at 4 hours post dosing.

Driving performance will be assessed using the Forum 8 driving simulator, and driving performance will be assessed three times each study session. The simulator consists of a car unit with adjustable car seats and a dashboard and includes a steering wheel, turn sign indicators, gear lever, brake and accelerator pedals for vehicle control. The system generates realistic roadway scenery which is presented on three integrated TV screens 1.90 meters in front of the centre of the steering wheel. The speed and gear number are displayed on the dashboard and screen. Auditory feedback is provided by speakers and included the sound of the engine, braking, speeding in curves, and driving off-road. Driving assessment will take place at baseline (prior to dosing), and at 30 minutes and at 3 hours post dosing.

    <concealment>Randomization of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The randomisation order that has been placed next to the participantâ€™s number will be the allocated treatment order for that individual.

Blinding will be achieved by enlisting a person outside of the project to code the treatments, and maintain the key to this code until data collection is completed. The codes will only be broken in an emergency, such as an SAE that requires knowledge of the treatment being taken in order to manage a participantâ€™s condition. The principle investigator and ethics committee will be informed within 24 hours of the code-break envelope being opened.

    <statisticalmethods>Participants will be 40 men and women aged between 21-40 years. As this is a pilot exploratory study, no formal power calculation is being conducted. No research is available assessing the ability of new generation (Securetec Drugwipe (registered trademark) TWIN single-use saliva-based drug tests to detect the presence of THC, however limited clinical studies have utilised similar, albeit typically smaller samples. Approximately 60 participants will be screened; approximately 50 participants will be randomised with the aim of having 40 participants complete (evaluable population). 

All statistical tests will be performed two tailed at the 5% significance level and performed using IBM SPSS statistical package. Z scores for the distribution will be calculated for each variable and displayed in histogram form. Out of range values will be recoded as missing values.

The primary outcome to be measured will be the scores on the drug screening device as a function of treatment group and will be presented as a binary outcome (detection yes/no). A binary logistic regression model will be used, with detection status (present/absent) as the outcome, and treatment group (high or low hempseed oil or placebo) used as the categorical predictor variable. Baseline data and demographic information will be entered sequentially to assess for possible effect-modification. 

Results for the dose-relative concentration of THC in samples of blood, urine and  saliva for both low and high doses of hempseed oil will analysed using mixed design analysis of variance (MANCOVA), with treatment group (high, low or placebo) as the between-subject variable, time (individual sessions) as the within-subjects variable, and baseline score as the covariate. 

Results for the driving simulator (SDLP, SPS and lapses) will also be compared using a mixed design analysis of variance (MANCOVA), with treatment group (high, low or placebo) as the between-subject variable, time as the within-subjects variable, and baseline score as the covariate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test the whether legally permissible levels of THC available in foodstuff is detected by a commonly used single-use saliva-based drug test when compared to a placebo and if this differs when given in different concentrations (high and low). We will also be assessing whether there are any changes to driving ability as a result of ingesting hempseed oil. </summary>
