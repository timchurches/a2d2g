  <interventions>
    <interventions>Written informed consent will be obtained from all paricipants. 
Participants will have their near vision assessed with their usual correction / glasses. 
Thirdly, they will be asked to recall their own eye medication use; name, dose and instructions for use for each. 
Finally, they will be asked 3 repeat questions on 4 sample eye drop labels. The questions are structured to allow identification of "the name of the medicine", "which eye the medicine is for" and "how often the medicine should be used". Answers will be recorded as either correct or incorrect. 
Participants will be presented 2 standard and 2 large print labels in a set format and permitted a few minutes to examine each before being questioned.
Assessment time approximately 5-10 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Main purpose of this study is to identify if there is a need to offer of a large print label, on eye medications, to glaucoma patients that display certain visual function and disease characteristics.  In turn, this may assist these patients in adhering to their prescribed treatment.</summary>
