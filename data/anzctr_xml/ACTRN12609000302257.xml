This method has been validated as a means of combining multiple independent variables into a composition score, representing overall driving performance of drivers. Pearson correlation and stepwise linear regression will be used to examine the relationships between clinical measures, off-road testing and the on-road driving ability of participants. Multivariate analysis will be employed to investigate the interacting effect of the different potentially contributing variables.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will examine the best way for health professionals to predict the ability of stroke survivors to safely recommence driving. Many effects of stroke can impair driving ability. Return to driving after a stroke is an important part of maintaining independence. It is therefore important that assessment of these people is readily available and accurate. Examining driving ability on the road is the gold standard test; we will investigate what can be measured in a clinical, off-road setting to predict safety in the on-road test. These include: medical factors (type of stroke, position of stroke, severity of stroke etc.); impact of the stroke on driving ability (vision, concentration, memory, reasoning etc.); and ability to drive in a driving simulator (an artificial driving machine with a screen). We anticipate that we will be able to identify several tests which, alone or together, can help to predict which stroke survivors can safely return to driving.</summary>
