  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare a single dose of oral solithromycin to the standard of care
      (intramuscular ceftriaxone plus oral azithromycin) in the treatment of patients with
      urogenital gonorrhea. A completed open-label Phase 2 study with single doses of solithromycin
      resulted in 100% microbiological eradication in male and female patients with uncomplicated
      urogenital gonorrhea.</summary>
