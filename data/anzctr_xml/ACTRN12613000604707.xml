  <interventions>
    <interventions>Bathing in a natural geothermal water : eight twenty minute baths every 2 -3 days over 20 days. An excel speadsheet lists the schedule for each participant , when attendance is due, non attendance, contact deatils etc . A folder contains a section for each partricipant including, consent, baseline recordings, questionnaire and  PASI forms to be written on at each treatment and at two followup visits with no treatment. Questionaire and vital signs at the final visit. Wash Out period 14 days</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Effect of a geothermal water on Psoriasis rash by PASI scoring and verbal comment  to open question; "How has the rash been since your last bathing treatment?" Photographs and Psoriasis self assessment Questionnaire at Baseline and 14 days post intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 20 days of bathing plus 14 days  final assessment = at 34 days
after crossover 34 days = at 68 days after

    <statisticalmethods>The aim of the test will be to test if on average a 50% reduction in PASI score is achieved across all patients enrolled in the trial between baseline and final measurement.  Carlin et al (J Am Acad Dermatol. 2004 Jun;50(6):859-66) found that a 50% reduction in PASI score represents a clinically meaningful reduction in disease and should be the benchmark for future treatment tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Will bathing in a geothermal water reduce skin rashes due to psoriasis? People will be recruited who still have psoriatic skin rash despite other treatments. Participants will be randomly selected to receive either the intervention schedule or the control schedule first. The intervention and the control schedules are to bathe at QE Health at intervals over 20 days and we assess the rash at each visit using PASI scoring for  size, redness and scaling and ask how the rash has been. Assessments include PASI scoring. Plus a questionnaire, photographs of the rash and  vital signs are recorded at the first and last visits of each schedule. 
Participants crossover and do both schedules one after the other</summary>
