    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Has another neurological illness that may have caused cognitive decline (e.g., trauma,
             meningitis, or hemorrhage) before study entry

          -  Requires ventilation support, except for noninvasive support at night

          -  Has received stem cell, gene therapy or ERT for MPS IIIB

          -  Has contraindications for neurosurgery (e.g., congenital heart disease, severe
             respiratory impairment, or clotting abnormalities)

          -  Has contraindications for MRI scans (e.g., cardiac pacemaker, metal fragment or chip
             in the eye, or aneurysm clip in the brain)

          -  Has a history of poorly controlled seizure disorder

          -  Is prone to complications from intraventricular drug administration, including
             patients with hydrocephalus or ventricular shunts

          -  Has received any investigational medication within 30 days prior to the Baseline visit
             or is scheduled to receive any investigational drug during the course of the study

          -  Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with protocol
             requirements, the subject's wellbeing or safety, or the interpretability of the
             subject's clinical data.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B) is a
      severe neurodegenerative disorder. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the
      health problems in patients with MPS IIIB and how to measure these problems over time. It
      will particularly look at how the disease develops in young children. This is an
      observational study, so no experimental drug will be given. The results from this study will
      help us design future studies to measure whether these health problems get better when we
      give experimental drug for MPS IIIB.</summary>
