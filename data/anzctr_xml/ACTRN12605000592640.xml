    <studytitle>The VALID study: is ventilation affected by leaving in dentures?</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>To investigate whether bag-mask ventilation after induction of anaesthesia in patients with dentures is easier with dentures left in or removed.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients randomised to Group A have their dentures removed after induction of anaesthesia but before bag-mask ventilation, while the patients randomised to Group B have their dentures left in for bag-mask ventilation and removed afterwards, prior to placement of endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway. Bag-mask ventilation is attempted in both groups of patients for 30 seconds after loss of eyelash reflex.</interventions>
