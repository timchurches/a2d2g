  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Department of Health and Ageing has asked the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) to develop and pilot a radiation oncology register as part of the ANROTAT (TRP 11.A) project (http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12612000168853.aspx).

The ARORP will include the development and testing of a set of data variables to capture demographics, diagnosis, staging, surgical treatments, quality of Life, follow-up and radiotherapy intervention related data. A cross sectional feedback survey of participating centre staff authorised to enter data into the ARORP will be undertaken to assess the feasibility of the collection of the data items in routine practice as well as the web-based registration, the user manual and the register in general. 

Data will be collected in two groups of patients; 
   1. Prospective ANROTAT (TRP 11.A) study participants at or after the first follow-up visit
   2. Patients who are attending for their annual follow-up appointment (including ANROTAT (TRP 11.A) retrospective patients and NON-ANROTAT patients). 

The data will be collected from the patients medical records, reports, RT plans and from QoL Questionniares. Patients are to be within 60months of completion of RT treament on registration, therefore the year range of the information collected will be from 2006-2012. 

The study population are patients who have undergone; 
- Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) or non-IGRT in patient with intermediate risk prostate cancer
- Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or 3DCRT in patients with prostate cancer (post-proctectomy)
- IMRT or 3DCRT in patients with nasophargeal cancer
- IMRT or 3DRT in patients with anal cancer.

This project will be open for registering patients from December 2011 to March 2012.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ANROTAT Radiation Oncology Register Pilot (ARORP) aims to assess the feasibility of using a practical system to collect accurate and complete treatment and outcome data for patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for their cancer in the following indications:
- Intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with IGRT or non­IGRT 
- Prostate Cancer ­ Post Prostatectomy treated with IMRT or 3DCRT 
- Nasopharynx Cancer treated with IMRT or 3DCRT
- Anal Cancer treated with IMRT or 3DCRT DESIGN

There are two main design components to the ARORP:
1. An observational study in which data are entered into ARORP from a cohort of patients who received radiotherapy treatment for   the indications described above
2. A cross­sectional surveys of users of the ARORP at participating centres

The opinions of ARORP users will be measured via an evaluation survey that asks for their rating (excellent, good, fair, or poor) of the system in terms of access, data entry, navigation, training, support, and overall ease of use. The proportion of users providing an overall rating of excellent or good will be calculated.

Focus group discussions with ARORP users also will be performed at each centre to obtain qualitative feedback on the system (including such things as the burden on the staff collecting the data).</summary>
