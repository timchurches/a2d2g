    <statisticalmethods>Data at the end of the treatment period will be compared using paired t-tests. Between-group comparisons will be performed using independent t-tests. Associations between kinetics of Lp(a) and its protein components, apo(a) and apoB-100, and lipoproteins (e.g. VLDL, IDL and LDL), and other metabolic parameters will be examined using simple and multiple linear regression methods employing causal models based on a priori hypothesis and variables that are significant at p&lt;0.05 in univariate analysis. Statistical significance will be defined at the 5% level using a 2-tailed test.

Sample Size:
Sample size calculations are based on the effect of Alirocumab on Lp(a)-apoB-100 PR. We assume that the reduction in Lp(a)-apoB-100 concentrations is chiefly reflected by the corresponding decrease in Lp(a)-apoB-100 PR. Data from Stein et al (Lancet 2012; 380:29) suggest that a sample size of 15 will give the study 95% power to detect a significant decrease in the PR of Lp(a)-apoB-100 with Alirocumab (n=15 23.2%, SD 20%). We will, however, recruit 18 patients to take into account a potential dropout of 20%. Of note, the investigators have a large database of subjects with a wide-range of plasma Lp(a) concentrations. Participants will be replaced to maintain a sample size of 15.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Objective:
To describe and determine the mechanism by which a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor alters the kinetics of Lp(a) and its protein components, as well as the concentrations and kinetics of apoB-100 containing lipoproteins in statin-treated patients with inherited high plasma Lp(a) who are at moderate-to-high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

Hypothesis: 
Inhibition of PCSK9 increases apoB-100 catabolism and decreases hepatic secretion of apoB-100, and hence, the pool of apoB-100 available for binding to apo(a), resulting in a decrease in the production and plasma concentrations of Lp(a).

Study Design:
A 12-week (treatment period) single-arm, open-label, pre- and post-designed pilot study of the effect of Alirocumab (two-weekly subcutaneously injected dose of 150 mg) on plasma Lp(a) concentration and metabolism in 15 patients with inherited high plasma Lp(a). The CVD risk (low or moderate-to-high) of participants will be determined based on the Australian National Vascular Disease Prevention Alliance (NVDPA) Guidelines for management of absolute cardiovascular disease risk.

Participant Numbers:
N=18 participants, to ensure N=15 complete the study
