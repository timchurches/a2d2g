  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will involve the use of a new medicine called GW642444 being developed for the
      treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose of the
      study is to see how safe and how well tolerated the study drug is when inhaled in two
      different formulations as a fine powder by asthmatic patients. In addition, the study is
      designed to examine the effect of the study drug on the lungs, how the study drug affects
      parts of the body other than the lungs and to see how the body affects the study drug when it
      is given in single doses.</summary>
