  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy of an online self management program for men living with HIV in Australia. Positive outlook is a 7 week online group self management program for men living with HIV. Participants will be asked to log onto the program for approximately 90minutes per week and complete modules, activities and contribute to various discussion boards. The program focuses on the management of physical, social and emotional aspects of living with HIV. Positive Outlook provides participants the opportunity to develop skills for the management of HIV within their daily lives. The group model allows participants to share experiences and to learn from each other. Particular attention is payed to disclosure of HIV and the management of HIV within intimate relationships. We hypothesise that intervention group participants will demonstrate improvements in self efficacy, outcomes of health education, adjustment to HIV, depression anxiety and stress, quality of life and social support compared to control participants at follow up and 12 week follow up.</summary>
