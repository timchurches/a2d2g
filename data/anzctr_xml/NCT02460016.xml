  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male or female subjects of any race or ethnicity with an age adjusted for any
             prematurity of =1 month and =24 months.

          -  Diagnosis of RSV infection by virological.

          -  Subject must weigh &gt;3 kg at screening.

          -  Must have provided written informed consent for the subject to participate.

          -  For patients aged &lt;12 months, and occipitofrontal head circumference (OFHC) within the
             normal range for age and gender.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusiveminagetype>Month</inclusiveminagetype>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>Months</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  The subject has taken, is currently taking or requires any restricted medications.

          -  Subject is known to be HIV-positive (or the mother, if the potential subject is a
             child aged &lt;6 months).

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to the
             date of screening.

          -  Requires vasopressors or inotropic support at the time of enrollment.

          -  Concurrent gastrointestinal conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator,
             prejudice absorption of the Investigational Medicinal Product (e.g. protracted
             vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, a history of necrotising enterocolitis with
             consequent short gut syndrome).

          -  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease requiring assisted ventilation at
             the time of enrollment.

          -  Diminished ventilatory reserve at risk for hypercapnia (e.g. pulmonary hypoplasia,
             sequestration syndromes, cystadenomatoid malformation, a history of surgery for
             diaphragmatic hernia).

          -  Left to right shunt meriting corrective therapy.</exclusivecriteria>
