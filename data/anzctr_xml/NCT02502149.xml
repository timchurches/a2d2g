Experimental: rFVIIIFc (15K scale) 1000 IU vial - Single injection of rFVIIIFc (current 2K scale) followed by 2 single injections of rFVIIIFc (15K scale) 1000 IU vial at PK2 and PK3 timepoints. Prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes is permitted during the 26 week treatment period using the rFVIIIFc (15K scale).

Experimental: rFVIIIFc (15K scale) Higher Strength vial - Single injection of rFVIIIFc (current 2K scale) followed by 2 single injections of rFVIIIFc high strength vial (15K scale) at PK2 and PK3 timepoints. Prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding episodes is permitted during the 26 week treatment period using the rFVIIIFc (15K scale).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) of recombinant
      coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) manufactured at the current scale of
      2000 L (2K) to the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15,000 L (15K) scale in previously
      treated participants with severe hemophilia A. The secondary objectives are: to characterize
      the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at the 15K baseline and after 13 weeks of
      treatment; to characterize the PK of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K scale at 1000 IU/vial
      and a higher strength vial; and to evaluate the safety of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 15K
      scale.</summary>
