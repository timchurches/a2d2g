  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a family-centred tobacco control program which will (i) provide education about the health effects of ETS exposure and use behavioural coaching techniques to help mothers implement strategies to reduce the infants ETS exposure, as well as ii) identify mothers and other household members motivation to quit smoking (if applicable) and deliver culturally appropriate smoking cessation counselling and treatment options (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy) as requested. The program will be led by Indigenous Health Workers and it will be delivered at three face-to-face home visits conducted over the first three months of the infants life.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive 'usual' care through their comunity health provder. Usual care entails routine visits to maternal and child health providers at several defined timepoints during the first 12 months of the infant's life. At these postnatal visits, health providers check developmental milestones and general wellbeing. Additionally, mothers/caregivers routinely receive messages about smoking cessation and ETS exposure in their homes during these visits as part of general health promotion.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of health provider presentations for new primary episodes of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in the first year of life.
A new illness will be defined as onset after at least two days without any respiratory symptoms or signs. To identify episodes of respiratory illness mothers/caregivers will be asked at specific timepoints whether their child has had any presentation to the clinic or hospital and the names of the clinics attended. A research assistant will be responsible for collecting the source data relevant to the primary outcome measures, and will review the individual child's health provider and hospital clinic records (parental consent will be obtained prior to accessing records). Source documents will be photocopied, de-identified, labelled with the participant registration, and stored with the trial records. Two clinicians (blinded to group allocation) will review the wording used in clinic records and confirm documented respiratory illnesses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcome data will be collected at baseline (when the infant is 5 weeks old), and after the intervention program has been delivered at 4 months of age (short term follow up) and 12 months of age (long term follow up).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of hospitalisations for acute respiratory illness (ARI) in the first year of life. Same definition as primary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infant aged 5 weeks (baseline), 4 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mother/caregiver's self-report of infant's exposure to ETS:  Number of days in the preceding seven days in which infant was exposed to ETS (same room in a house with a person who smokes, in a car with a person who smokes, or sitting outside within arm's length of someone who smokes).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infant aged 5 weeks, 4 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mother/caregiver's self-report of smoking restrictions in the home and car.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infant aged 5 weeks, 4 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mother/caregiver's self-report of smoking cessation: defined as mother/caregiver not smoking a single cigarette (not even a puff), in the preceding seven days. We will also be assessing prolonged abstinence (e.g. quit for 3 months at 4 month follow up; quit for 9 months at 12 month follow-up).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infant aged 5 weeks, 4 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mother/caregiver's self-report of number quit attempts: defined as not smoking a cigarette for at least 24 hours</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infant aged 5 weeks, 4 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Process evaluation indicators: a mix of quantitative and qualitative measures will be collected related to the 'intervention' program (e.g. number of 'coaching' activities completed, obstacles and successes in delivering program, parent satisfaction with the program). This will only apply to the intervention arm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infant aged 5 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Infants will be eligible for inclusion if: 1. They are aged between 0-5 weeks. We will review our recruitment rate four months after the trial has commenced. If we find that we are not meeting our enrolment targets, we will consider extending our recruitment to include infants aged 5-10 weeks. This will allow us to approach mothers and their infants at 6-8 weeks when they present at community health clinics for their first immunizations. 2. Their mother/caregiver is Indigenous (defined by maternal self-identification). 3. Their mother/caregiver is aged 16 years or over. 4. Their mother/caregiver currently smokes or if the infant lives in a household where there is at least one other person who smokes (defined as smoking at least weekly). 5. Their mother/caregiver plans to reside permanently with the infant in Darwin or Greater Darwin areas of Australia or within the Counties Manukau District Health Board region, Manukau, NZ. 6. Their mother/caregiver has given signed written consent to participate in this research study. 7. Their mother/caregiver has given signed written consent for study staff to access the infants health records. 8. They are a singleton or the first born in a multiple pregnancy delivery. 9. Their mother/caregiver speaks English and/or Maori.</inclusivecriteria>

2. They have other serious neonatal complications (e.g. seizures, significant sepsis).
3. They have major organ abnormalities (i.e. cardiac disease, congenital lung/diaphragm abnormalities, chromosomal abnormality or syndrome e.g. Downs syndrome).
4. Their mother/caregiver has previously been recruited in this research study.
5. They live in the same household as a mother/caregiver who has previously been recruited in this study.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will conduct a parallel randomised controlled study with concealed allocation using central randomisation by computer. All potential participants (i.e. the infants) will be assigned a unique registration number allocated by a central computer following details submitted on a web-based form.  This number will be used to identify each randomized participant, once consent is obtained.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized by computer with stratification by country (Australia, NZ) and infant age (0-5 weeks, &gt;5 -10 weeks) to ensure a balance in these key prognostic indicators between the intervention and control groups.   The randomization will also use permuted blocks within strata to ensure balance between treatment groups over time.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute Respiratory Illness is the most common cause of acute presentations and hospitalisations of young Indigenous children in Australia and New Zealand. Parental smoking is a significant and preventable source of childhood morbidity, especially related to respiratory illness. Rates of adult smoking amongst Indigenous Australians and Maori are much higher compared with non-Indigenous populations; consequently Indigenous infants in both countries have higher rates of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), compared with non-Indigenous children. The aim of this study is to trial the effect of a family-centred tobacco control program about ETS on the respiratory health of Indigenous infants up to 12 months of age.</summary>
