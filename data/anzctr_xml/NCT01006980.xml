  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - An Overall survival event was defined as death due to any cause. The number of participants with overall survival events is reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization (initiated January 2010) to December 30 2010. Median follow-up time in the vemurafenib group was 3.75 months (range 0.3 to 10.8) and in the dacarbazine group was 2.33 months (range &lt;0.1 to 10.3).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival - A progression-free survival (PFS) event was defined as disease progression or death due to any cause. Tumor response (progression) was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria using computed tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization (initiated January 2010) to December 30 2010.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants With a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response or Partial Response - BOR was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Participants who never received study treatment and treated participants without any post-baseline tumor assessments were considered as non-responders. CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions and no new lesion. Any pathological lymph nodes must have had reduction in the short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion and no new lesion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization (initiated January 2010) until December 30, 2010</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response was defined as the time between the date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of disease progression or death due to any cause. Duration of response was calculated only for participants who had a best overall response of Complete Response or Partial Response and was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization (initiated in January 2010) until December 30, 2010.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Confirmed Response - Time to response was defined as the time from randomization to confirmed response (complete response or partial response).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization (initiated January 2010) until December 30, 2010.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Treatment Failure - Treatment failure was defined as a secondary endpoint in the protocol, defined as death, disease progression or premature withdrawal of study treatment. This endpoint was not included in the Statistical analysis plan; therefore no analyses of time to treatment failure were performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approximately 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - The intensity of AEs was graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE) on a five-point scale (Grade 1 to 5: Mild, Moderate, Severe, Life-threatening and Death). A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution, for example is life-threatening, requires hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization (initiated January 2010) until December 30, 2010.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre and Post-dose Plasma Vemurafenib Concentration by Study Day - The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were assessed at the beginning of each 21-day cycle using pre-dose and 2-4 hours post-dose sampling.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Plasma samples were collected before the morning dose (troughs) and 2-4 hours after the morning dose at the beginning of each cycle (Days 1, 22, 43, 64, 106, 148 and 190).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, open-label study evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      vemurafenib (RO5185426) as compared to dacarbazine in previously untreated patients with
      metastatic melanoma. Patients were randomized to receive either vemurafenib 960 mg orally
      twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Study treatment was
      continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The data and safety
      monitoring board recommended that patients in the dacarbazine group be allowed to cross over
      to receive vemurafenib, and the protocol was amended accordingly on January 14, 2011, as both
      overall survival and progression-free survival endpoints had met the prespecified criteria
      for statistical significance in favor of vemurafenib.</summary>
