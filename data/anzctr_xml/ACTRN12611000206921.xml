  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients presenting to the Emergency Department will be assessed using a newly developed risk stratification process for acute coronary syndrome.
Patients will be deemed HIGH risk according to the high risk criteria of the National Heart Foundation/CS-ANZ guidelines 2006. Patients will be deemed VERY LOW risk if: Age &lt;40, no history of DM, no renal impairment, normal (&lt;= 0.04mcg/L) initial troponin and normal ECG. All others are INTERMEDIATE risk. This risk stratification will be applied in the Emergency Department on presentation, with ECG and troponin results available. This intervention is administered for the period of the index presentation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Diagnosis of ACS-related events, using the AHA/ACC/ESC/WHO task force universal definition of myocardial infarction. 
The primary endpoint is adjudicated by cardiologists using all available investigations, telephone follow up calls and clinical notes for 30 day events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome will include a composite outcome of those admitted to hospital for potential ACS.  That is, those diagnosed with AMI or ACS on admission or those who have a significant EST finding. This endpoint is adjudicated by cardiologists using all available investigations, telephone follow up calls and clinical notes for 30 day events.</outcome>

    <concealment>Procedure for enrolling a subject commences with introduction of a research nurse/staff member to eligible patients.  The research nurse/staff member will provide the patient with an information sheet as well as a verbal briefing of the study and how the patient's care will change.  Once the patient is confident they understand the study and its components, the patient is presented with a consent form which is signed, dated and witnessed. The patient will consent to their participation in the study, to being contacted in the furture, and for the storage of their blood. 

Once the patient has been consented, a newly developed rule  will be applied to further risk stratify patients presenting to the ED with chest pain who are initially assessed as intermediate risk group for ACS.   The advanced risk stratification will place patients in either a very low risk group or an intermediate risk group.  Treatment will be allocated based on which group the patients has been placed. 

Patients initially assessed as high risk group for ACS will be treated as per usual care.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to prospectively investigate the accuracy and safety of an accelerated chest pain diagnostic pathway in patients presenting with intermediate risk chest pain in an Australian setting. 
The primary objective is to demonstrate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the rule for ACS-related diagnoses at 30 days post discharge. 
The secondary objective is to demonstrate the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the rule for the composite oucome of patients who are admitted to hospital for potential ACS.  That is, those with an ACS related diagnosis or significant exercise stress test (EST) findings (positive or indeterminate results).</summary>
