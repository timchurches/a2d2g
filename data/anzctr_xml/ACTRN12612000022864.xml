    <interventions>Plasmalyte 148 Intravenous Fluid Solution

Plasma-lyte 148 (pH 7.4) is a replacement electrolyte commonly used as a crystalloid priming solution for cardiopulmonary bypass prime.  In addition, the presence of bicarbonate precursors (acetate and gluconate) produces a metabolic alkalinising effect that helps counteract metabolic acidosis of patients undergoing cardiopulomary bypass. It is an isontonic solution and compatible with blood or blood components. 

The electrolyte composition of Plasmalyte is as follows: 

3 mEq of magnesium = 3 mmol/L. 
140 Eq of sodium ion = 140 mmol/L. 
98 mEq of chloride ion = 98 mmol/L. 
27 mEq of acetate = 27 mmol/L. 
23 mEq of gluconate = 23 mmol/L. 
5 mEq of potassium ion = 5 mmol/L. 


For this clinical trial Plasmalyte will be used an a one off intervention only for the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.
 
Cardiopulmonary bypass will be performed using a membrane oxygenator (Sorin Monolyth; Biomedica, Mirandola, Italy). The pump rate will be set at 2.4 l.m-2.min-1 and body temperature will be kept at 32 to 34 Degrees.

Plasmalyte will be infused as the cardiopulmonary bypass prime fluid prime fluid together with a standard cardioplegia solution minimising differentiating effects of exogenous ions given by this route. 

Prime volume to be administered:
A crystalloid prime volume of 1500mL Plasmalyte will be used in this study representing 30-35% of the patients blood volume.  Generally, the volume of prime required is either based on a standard empirically derived volume greater than a minimum safe priming volume, or is guided by the patients weight or body surface area. In practice the minimum volume required is that which fills both the venous and arterial limbs of the circuit and maintains adequate reserve volume in the venous reservoir to ensure that air is not entrained into the arterial side of the circuit during initiation of CPB. This volume is determined by both the calibre and length of the tubing connecting the patient to the CPB machine and by the design and therefore capacity of the venous reservoir and oxygenator. The volume of the prime in relation to the patients pre-CPB haematocrit determines the initial haematocrit achieved after the initiation of CPB. In adults, priming volumes are commonly in the range of 1400-1800mL, typically representing 30-35% of the patients blood volume. 

Additional fluid boluses of Plasmalyte solution will be administered to any patient if volume supplementation is required.</interventions>
    <comparator>Hartmanns Intravenous Fluid Solution

Hartmanns solution is a replacement electrolyte commonly used as a crystalloid priming solution for cardiopulmonary bypass prime.  In addition, the presence of bicarbonate precursors (lactate) helps counteract metabolic acidosis of patients undergoing cardiopulomary bypass. 

The electrolyte composition of Hartmanns solution is as follows: 

One litre of Hartmann's solution contains:

131 mEq of sodium ion = 131 mmol/L. 
111 mEq of chloride ion = 111 mmol/L. 
29 mEq of lactate = 29 mmol/L. 
5 mEq of potassium ion = 5 mmol/L. 
4 mEq of calcium ion = 2 mmol/L . 

For this clinical trial Hartmanns Solution will be used an a one off intervention only for the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.

Cardiopulmonary bypass will be performed using a membrane oxygenator (Sorin Monolyth; Biomedica, Mirandola, Italy). The pump rate will be set at 2.4 l.m-2.min-1 and body temperature will be kept at 32 to 34 Degrees.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be informed about the study and consented at the cardiac pre-anaesthesia admission clinic 2-4 weeks prior to surgery. On the day of surgery, an independent anaesthetist or research nurse who is not a study investigator will open a sealed opaque randomisation envelope. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups using a random number allocation system with permuted blocks. One group will receive the balanced crystalloid solution Plasmalyte (Baxter, Sydney, NSW) with anions as acetate, gluconate and chloride, the other group will receive Hartmanns solution (Baxter, Sydney, NSW), with anions as lactate. Study participants, cardiac surgeons, perfusionists, anaesthetists and all medical staff involved with the management of the patient throughout the study period will be blinded to treatment allocation. This is a blinded clinical trial. Blinding of both Hartmanns and Plasmalyte solution will be done by Baxter Healthcare Australia. Fluids will be prepared in 1 litre clear plastic fluid container flasks (the exact same packaging that the fluids are normally prepared in), however there will be no labelling/writing on the container that would allow identification of the crystalloid fluid solution. 

Each 1-litre flask containing will have the following labelling printed on the side: 
1. cardiac Prime Fluid Trial Solution
2. Plasmalyte Solution Hartmanns solution 
3. Expiry Date

Baxter Healthcare will compound the products in a strictly aseptic process. The shelf life of any of these solutions prepared under such aseptic conditions would be set at 360 days, when stored at &lt;25C.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation by using a randomization table created by a computer software (i.e., computerised sequence generation) will be preformed. For each patient, an opaque envelope containing the group assignment will be prepared, sealed and sequentially numbered. On the morning of surgery the anaesthetist will open the envelope and randomised the patients into one of the two groups described above.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Changes in acid-base balance, particularly metabolic acidosis are common in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The mechanisms for such metabolic acidosis however, remain controversial, but previous research strongly suggests that the metabolic acidosis is iatrogenic in nature and that its extent and duration varies according to the priming solution of the
cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. The priming solution has been implicated as one of the potential causes of the disturbances of pH associated with the development of metabolic acidosis on initiation of cardiac bypass. This acidosis is in part caused by hyperchloraemia and is more likely to occur with normal saline, which has a higher chloride load than the more balanced physiological solutions such as Plasmalyte or Hartmanns solutions. 

Attempts to prevent metabolic acidosis have entailed alterations to circuit prime fluids, including partial replacement of chloride by rapidly metabolised anions such as L-lactate, acetate and gluconate or else by bicarbonate.
Study rationale: There are no published studies comparing Hartmanns solution (contains anions lactate and chloride) and Plasmalyte (contains anions acetate, gluconate &amp; chloride) as prime solutions for cardiopulmonary bypass. 

Both these crystalloid fluids are commonly used priming solutions for the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. It is therefore not known if one solution has more beneficial effects on cardiopulmonary associated acidosis, strong-ion
difference and unmeasured ions.

Study design &amp; hypothesis: We will conduct a single centre randomised controlled blinded study to test the hypothesis that when used as cardiopulmonary pump prime solution during cardiopulmonary bypass Plasmalyte solution will have a more favourable effect on metabolic acidosis than Hartmanns solution.

Primary endpoint: Standard base deficit on rewarming, just prior to separation from cardiopulmonary bypass

Secondary endpoints: Strong-ion-difference; Total weak 
acids; Net-unmeasured-ions including lactate, acetate, gluconate; Serum creatinine; Renal biomarkers including: serum and urine NGAL, cystatin C; Pro-inflammatory effects using Interleukin-6; Cardiotoxic biomarkers using cardiac troponin.

Inclusion criteria: Adult patients (age &gt; 18years) undergoing elective Cardiac Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) or valve surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

No of participants: 50

Recruiting Hospital: Austin Hospital

Clinical significance: A finding that Plasmalyte solution has more favourable effects than Hartmanns solution on cardiac bypass associated acidosis, strong-ion difference, and
inflammation may influence the fluid chosen for prime solution in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.</summary>
