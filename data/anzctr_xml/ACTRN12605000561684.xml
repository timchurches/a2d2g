    <inclusivecriteria>Patients must have newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed endometrial carcinoma, and have undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without a dissection of pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes. It is also recommended that patients will have undergone an omentectomy and had peritoneal washings taken. In addition, patients must be either:A. Patients with documented involvement of pelvic and/or para-aortic nodes by histology (FIGO stage IIIc) or post-operative PET, CT or PET/CTORB. Patients who have not undergone a complete lymphadenectomy, who have negative sampled nodes or unknown nodal status and have high-risk disease as defined by:a) FIGO stage Ic or IIb with : aggressive non-endometroid histology (serous papillary or clear cell type comprising 10% of  the endometrial tumour) ORb) FIGO stage IIb with : grade 3 histologyc) Any FIGO stage III disease excluding those defined as stage III only by positive peritoneal cytologyPatients must not have received any prior chemotherapy for another malignancy. Patients who have been treated for other malignancies must not have received prior pelvic or abdominal radiotherapy, and any prior radiotherapy must have been to less than 15% of the bone marrow bearing areasECOG performance status less than 2Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:- absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500- platelets &gt; 100,000- total bilirubin &lt; 1.25 X upper limit of normal - AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3 X institutional upper limit of normal.- estimated GFR &gt; 50 ml/minPatient has given written informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>
