  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) Resection of oral squamous cancer - guided by Narrow Band Imaging.
Device: Narrow Band Imaging (Olympus). Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) uses 2 narrow bands of light, one at 400-430nm and the second at 525-555nm. 
Procedure: Margins around the tumour will be delineated with Narrow Band Imaging prior to tumour resection.
Resection of the oral cancer will proceed under General Anaesthesia as per usual practice. The peri-operative experience of the patient will not be altered by which group they are randomised to and will be no different to their experience had they undergone routine management outside of the trial.  

2) Punch biopsies of tumour, NBI margin, WL margin and normal oral mucosa  guided by White Light Panendoscopy and Narrow Band Imaging. 
Device: Narrow Band Imaging (Olympus), White Light Endoscope (full spectrum white light with wavelength inclusive of 400-700 nm).
Procedure: 5mm punch biopsies will be taken from the body of the tumour, the WL and NBI margins at 3, 6, 9 and 12 oclock and normal tissue from the contralateral side of the oral cavity.


Specifics applicable to both interventions
Who: Completed by Consultant Otolarynology Head and Neck Surgeons 
Timing: 
- The interventions will occur sequentially, intra-operatively, under General Anaesthesia. Punch biopsies will be performed following margin delineation and prior to tumour resection. 
- Those patients in the intervention arm will have a slightly increased time required for surgical margin delineation as they will undergo both WL and NBI nasendoscopy.
This said, the time taken for the procedures will not significantly alter the total time taken for the surgery. Total operative time depends on the clinical circumstance. 
Mode of delivery: Face-to-face, single patient at a time. 
Number of times: Intervention completed on a single occasion. 
Location: Operating Theatre, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia.

    <comparator>1) Resection of oral squamous cancer - guided by White Light Panendoscopy (standard care).
Procedure: Margins around the tumour will be delineated with White Light prior to tumour resection.
Resection of the oral cancer will proceed under General Anaesthesia as per usual practice. The peri-operative experience of the patient will not be altered by which group they are randomised to and will be no different to their experience had they undergone routine management outside of the trial.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations for the primary outcome are based on statistical power of 90% and two-sided 5% significance level using SAS Proc Power. The minimum required number per group was 55 patients to achieve difference of 20% between the intervention and control groups. Assuming also 20% loss to follow-up, a minimum of 66 patients per group will be required.
In our pilot study that has been published in Head &amp; Neck, we have shown that there have been no recurrences in the NBI group. This equates to a decrease of OSCC recurrence rates from 20% of all those patients who have resection with WL down to 0% for those who have resection under NBI. The power calculation has been undertaken for this 20% difference.
Data will be analysed by blinded statisticians with intention-to-treat principles based on original group assignment. Important baseline covariates will be collected and assessed. Logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to compare the treatment and control groups. Effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals will be reported.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare resection of oral cancer guided by Narrow Band Imaging with resection guided by white light panendoscopy. 

Who is it for?
Participants over eighteen years of age with oral squamous cell carcinoma planned for surgical management will be invited to participate in the study. 

Study details:
Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will have Narrow Band Imaging and white light panendoscopy prior to surgery. Participants in the other group will have examination with white light panendoscopy prior to surgery, which is routine practice.  

Participants will have a pre-treatment PET scan, blood sample, and MRI and a post-treatment PET scan and blood sample. All surgical specimens will be examined by a pathologist as is routine practice. The molecular profiles of resection margins will be analysed to confirm that NBI surgical resection margins are molecularly distinct from WL margins and the tumour. This information will be used to create a molecular biomarker panel for head and neck cancer.

Participants will be followed-up for up to 5 years post-treatment to determine local recurrence and disease free survival.

A prospective Health Economic Assessment to demonstrate the cost benefit of the use of NBI in oral cancer management will be undertaken.  

Known and possible side effect(s) for each arm of the trial; Applicable to both arms:
- Oral squamous cell carcinoma, as well as treatments for Oral squamous cell carcinoma, have the potential to significantly affect patients quality of life, in particular their speech and swallowing.
- There is a direct relationship between the size of the resection/complexity of reconstruction and subsequent risks (including speech/swallowing impairment). Participants in one group will not universally have larger margins resected than participants in the other group, therefore increased risk of these treatment side-effects will not be universally applicable to participants in either group.
