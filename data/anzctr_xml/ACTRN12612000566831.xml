  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy volunteers who have no hip pain will undergo one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to see the prevalence of asymptomatic hip acetabular labral tears. Each MRI scan will take approximately 20 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identifying incidence of hip acetabular labral tears using magnetic resonance imaging</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within one year of selecting volunteers. (volunteers will get their magnetic resonance imaging at various times throughout the year)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of hip pain in those volunteers where acetabular labral tear was identified. This will be done using a modified Harris Hip Score that is to be incooporated into a standardized questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants with labral tears will be contacted yearly. We anticipate we will produce a summary of the obtained results in a follow up study at 5 and 10 years after the magnetic resonance imaging was performed</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This is in regards to those participants who have labral tears, and develops symptoms from it. We will study if there are any associations between developing a symptomatic labral tear and any of the demographic details (obtained prior to the MRI scanning). The demographic details are weight, ethnicity, smoking habit, amount and duration of regular sports/recreational activities</outcome>
      <timepoint>This subset of participants will be followed up yearly as explained in 'secondary outcome 1'. When all data are available, we will be performing statistical calculations for our follow up studies to see if there are any significant associations. This will occur at 5 and 10 years after the MRI scan.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acetabular labrum is a ring of fibrous cartilage around the hip joint, which helps the stability of the hip joint and evenly distribute forces put upon the hip joint. Disease of this labrum may cause hip pain in the young population, and may lead to development of early osteoarthritis. Because this is a relatively new entity, not much is known about its prevalence and natural history. Few studies have shown that significant proportion of asymptomatic population may have an acetabular labral tears.

We intend to define the prevalence of acetabular labral tears in the asymptomatic population. Furthermore, where labral tear was identified, we plan to follow up those participants yearly, to monitor if the participants develop hip pain. We will then attempt to identify any predisposing factors (such as exercise levels, smoking habits) which may make some participants more prone to developing symptoms. These participants will be followed up every year, and summary of the findings will be produced at 5 and 10 years since the magnetic resonance imaging was performed.</summary>
