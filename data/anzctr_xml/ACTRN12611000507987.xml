  <interventions>
    <interventions>5mg dose of zoledronic acid in 100 mL solution administered intravenously at months 1 and 12 of the trial. All participants will then enter the open label extension at the 12 month visit (ie 12 months after the initial day 1 visit of the first year of the trial), where both groups will receive zoledronic acid 5mg iv at this month 12 visit only;
600 mg of elemental calcium twice daily and 1000 international units daily of vitamin D for the duration of the trial being 2 years, beginning at day 1 in oral capsule form;
Paracetamol 2x500 mg capsules every 6 hours for 3 days post each infusion.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess whether lumbar spine and/or total hip BMD as measured by DXA at 1 Year in patients treated with zoledronic acid is significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exploratory Objectives:
To compare peripheral quantitative computed tompgraphy (pQCT)  (non-dominant tibia) and quantitative heel ultrasound measures in the zoledronic acid group vs. the placebo group at 1 and 2 years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 and 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the differences between treatment and placebo groups with respect to relative changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover at 1 Year, measured via serum bone markers (CTX and P1NP)</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All participants will be screened to determine eligibility. At the second visit (‘day 1’) all eligible patients will be assigned to one of the treatment groups. Patients will be randomized to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified for therapy at baseline: Liver enzyme inducer/ valproate/ other liver enzyme non-inducer (in case of polytherapy, taking any inducer would put patient in inducer group; similarly, taking valproate would put patient in valproate group unless also on an inducer).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be stratified by investigator staff (based on AED/s taken) and patients will be assigned treatment using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A randomization list will be produced by an independent statistician using a system that ensures the random assignment of treatment groups in the specified ratio and balanced in each stratum. The computerised program used to generate the random sequence is STATA add-on, based on a seed number.</sequence>
