  <interventions>
    <interventions>we inserted Levonorgestrel Intrauterin System(Lng-IUS)     women aged between 23-48 with suspected symptomatic endometriosis. The procedure lasted about 2 minutes. Once it is inserted it stays in the uterus for 12 months untill the study is terminated. It is not inserted-reinserted, but inserted just once. The total intervention lasted for 12 months; the total duration of the study and continued after the study unless the patient desired otherwise.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure improvements in severity and frequency of pain. Each patient was asked to complete questioannaries of SF-36 and visual analogue scales (VAS) in the first visit and 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months of the study. These scales recorded the non-cyclic pain, dysmenorrhoea, severity of dyspareunia symptoms effects on life quality and degree of satisfaction after treatment. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The patients were assessed physically, sonographically and mentally at the beginning of the study and then periodically after the first visit at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th months of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum CA-125 levels were measured in the plasma samples of each participant by the laborotory. Changes in the Ca-125 levels were noted accordingly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>patients assessed every 3 months for a total of 12 months period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The menstrual symptoms such as noncyclic bleeding, menorrhagia, acnes, mood swings were each evaluated by patient questionnaires in each visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The participants were assessed every 3 months for a total of 12 months period.</timepoint>
