    <concealment>Signed consent forms were received. A list of consenting paramedics was compiled, with city and rural area staff listed separately. Staff were listed in the order in which consent forms were received and then randomly assigned to the treatment groups using the random number generator feature in Microsoft Excel. Staff with odd numbers were assigned to the controlled oxygen therapy treatment group and those with even numbers were assigned to the high flow oxygen therapy treatment group. Paramedics were instructed to follow the protocol for the oxygen therapy treatment group to which they were assigned during shifts where they were the designated treating officer. Randomization by officer no concealment.</concealment>
