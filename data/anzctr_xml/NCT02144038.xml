  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase Ib/II study with the primary purpose of the Phase Ib part being to estimate
      the MTD and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of LGH447 and BYL719 when
      administered orally to adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Once the
      MTD and/or RP2D is determined for the combination of LGH447 and BYL719, additional patients
      will be enrolled in the Phase II part to determine whether the combination of LGH447 and
      BYL719 exhibits improved anti-multiple myeloma activity compared to single agent LGH447.</summary>
