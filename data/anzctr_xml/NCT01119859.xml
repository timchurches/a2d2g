Experimental: Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg - Patients received 6 infusions of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks and 12 injections of placebo to adalimumab subcutaneously every 2 weeks.

Active Comparator: Adalimumab 40 mg - Patients received 12 injections of adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks and 6 infusions of placebo to tocilizumab intravenously every 4 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Tocilizumab
The maximum dose was 800 mg for patients weighing more than 100 kg. Tocilizumab was infused into an arm vein over a 1-hour period.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) - The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × v(TJC28)) + (0.28 × v(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(ESR)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints. GH = a patient's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]). When ESR equaled 0 mm/hr, it was set to 1 mm/hr. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement. The analysis was adjusted for stratification factors of duration of RA (= 2 years and &gt; 2 years) and region (US and non-US).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a Remission Response (Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28] &lt; 2.6) at Week 24 - The percentage of patients who achieved remission of their rheumatic arthritis at Week 24, as measured by a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6, is reported.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With Low Disease Activity (Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28] = 3.2) at Week 24 - The percentage of patients who had low rheumatic arthritis disease activity at Week 24, as measured by a DAS28 score of 3.2 or less, is reported.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With an Improvement of at Least 20%, 50%, or 70% in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Score (ACR20/50/70) From Baseline at Week 24 - Improvement must be seen in tender and swollen joint counts (28 assessed joints) and in at least 3 of the following 5 parameters: Separate patient and physician assessments of patient disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a visual analog scale (VAS, the extreme left end of the line "no disease activity" [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms] and the extreme right end "maximum disease activity"; patient assessment of pain in previous the 24 hours on a VAS (extreme left end of the line "no pain" and the extreme right end "unbearable pain"); Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good Response at Week 24 - Change of the Disease Activity Score 28 score from baseline was used to determine EULAR responses of good, moderate, or no response. For a post-baseline score = 3.2, a change from baseline of &lt; -1.2 was a good response, &lt; -0.6 to = -1.2 was a moderate response, and = -0.6 was no response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 3.2 to = 5.1, a change from baseline of &lt; -0.6 was a moderate response and = -0.6 was no response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 5.1, a change from baseline &lt; -1.2 was a moderate response and = -1.2 was no response. A good response could not be achieved for post-baseline scores &gt; 3.2.</outcome>

    <summary>This randomized, blinded, parallel arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab
      (RoActemra/Actemra) versus adalimumab as monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      who are intolerant of methotrexate or where continued treatment with methotrexate was
      considered inappropriate. Patients were randomized to receive either tocilizumab 8 mg/kg
      intravenously (iv) every 4 weeks plus placebo subcutaneously (sc) every 2 weeks, or
      adalimumab 40 mg sc every 2 weeks plus placebo iv every 4 weeks. Treatment was anticipated to
      last 24 weeks. With regard to the blind, the study nurse was unblinded due to the nature of
      the treatment administration, but the investigator and the patient remained blinded.</summary>
