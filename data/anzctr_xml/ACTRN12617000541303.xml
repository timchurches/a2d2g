    <interventions>Study outline

The EDGE study will be a randomised trial with wait-listed control group. It is a prospective, two-arm, parallel, superiority study planned to run from May 2017 to September 2018. We will compare two groups; standard medical care (wait-listed control) to standard medical care plus a diet change programme (intervention).

Summary of intervention

The intervention participants will undergo a 10-week dietary change programme at the local polytechnic. The diet is not personalised to the individuals.

Diet

The whole foods plant-based (WFPB) approach aims to get around 7  15% of total energy from fat. Participants will be advised to avoid animal products, including meat, dairy and eggs. Foods emphasised in the programme are whole plant foods such as vegetables, fruits, starches, grains, and legumes. Participants will be advised to eat as much as they like, and to eat until they are comfortably full. There are no restrictions on spices and herbs. A traffic light chart will be provided to participants outlining acceptable foods.

We will provide 50mcg daily vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) supplements oral drops. If a participant has a history of poor B12 absorption, higher dose tablets (1000mcg daily) will be available, or three monthly injection of 1000mcg Intramuscular will be provided.

Exercise

Participants will be asked to maintain their normal levels of exercise during the programme. There will be no minimum requirements for exercise or formal requirements.

Evening sessions

The evening sessions will be run two nights per week and two hours duration per session (40 hours over 10 weeks). Sessions will be run at a local polytechnic (Eastland Institute of Technology  EIT). Sessions will be divided into one hour of group discussion and one hour of chef-guided cooking classes. Cooking classes involves working with a partner and cooking the food item demonstrated by the chef. Face-to-face evening sessions will build skills such as label reading, cooking, knowledge of pathology of diabetes, how to sustain a lifestyle change, and will focus on enabling group discussion and problem-solving. Full write up of topics discussed in sessions will be included in resulting publication. Information will be presentations will be delivered by trained staff (Doctor and programme director). Through these activities we aim to develop cooking skills in the chef-guided cooking class.

Materials provided

The participants will be given a booklet of lesson summaries and recipes, a cookbook, and a list of restaurants that serve plant-based food. Staff delivering the programme have several years experience with previous dietary / lifestyle interventions and working with patients.

Adherence

Dietary adherence will measured by diet history / recall questionnaires.

Our programme will emphasise support for participants to maintain and improve adherence:

Teaching based on learning theory; spaced repetition, timed, tested.
Involve family members  family/whanau involvement
Potential for use of buddy system (participants buddy up with another person to support one another).
Working to lower barriers for patients  working with Turanga health to provide transport for those requesting it.
Using a SMS system (available within electronic medical system Medtech) to send encouraging messages. 
Support through a facebook group.
Recipe books.
Handouts in addition to presentations.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will continue with their normal care, as provided through their General Practice. 

At 4 months (unless with safety review at reveals the intervention is unsafe, ineffective, or of no benefit) the control group will be offered the intervention. The wait-list is also necessary because the facility where the intervention is held only has a physical capacity of 32 participants at a time.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size and Analysis

We aim to have two groups of 24 participants. This is based on previous research results of our study team and assumes an 80% chance of demonstrating an effect with HbA1c at a confidence level of 95% (P &lt; 0.05) with no type one or type two errors.

Results will be analsyed with using the pairwise deletion method. Within the intervention group we may allocate slightly different resources and analyse these subgroups (e.g. one subgroup of intervention received coloured vs uncoloured lecture materials). All t-tests will be two-tailed. Comparison of results between the two groups will be using an unpaired t-test, after performing an f-test to determine whether the groups of results have statistically significant variances. 

Intention to treat

Because Gisborne is a small town, there is the possibility of contamination, whereby the wait-list control learns of and begins the dietary intervention. This will be assessed through a question (Did you make any other changes to your diet or exercise in the last four months? If so, what were these changes?) but does not preclude participation in the intervention.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The purpose of the study is to observe the effects of a community based programme that uses a plant-based diet with people with type II diabetes; observing both BMI and other clinical outcomes; what happens with the blood markers for diabetes; how the cholesterol and inflammation levels in their blood might be affected; changes with related anthropometric measures (including weight, waist circumference), and if medication usage changes.</summary>
