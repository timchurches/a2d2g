  <interventions>
    <interventions>The main participants in this study are caregivers aged 65 or older working at the area of the Social Services and Healthcare Centre of Pori. The caregivers are providing care in their own home. Caregivers are randomized into two groups; intervention and control groups.


On the basis of the caregivers`and patients`3-day food diaries, Mini Nutritional Assessment, home visit and nutritional survey, the nutritionist gives a individual nutrition counseling to the caregiver about their (caregiver and patient) nutrition and food habits. The patient can participate to the counseling if it is possible or/and wanted. The duration of the individual nutrition counseling session is 60-90 minutes.  The objective is not to change their food habits completely, but to correct possible inadequacies in their diet and to motivate.

Intervention group will also have a group-based nutrition counseling 0-4 times during the half year period. The group counseling is tailored to each caregiver personally based on their needs and wishes. The patient will not attend to group counseling. The group counseling will be a small group counseling (three meetings and fourth if needed, duration two hours/session) or cooking courses (two meetings,duration 2,5 hours/session). Cooking courses will be arranged in Satakunta Martha organization. The third option is that the caregiver does not participate to the group meeting at all (if it is not possible or if they don`t want. A register of attendance at group sessions will be held. 

All the participants in the intervention group have an opportunity to join the facebook group where they can discuss about nutrition, health, coping an overall well-being.  

At the end of the study the intervention group is compared with the control group. </interventions>
    <comparator>Persons in the control group will receive standard care and a written nutrition booklet after randomization. 

At the end of the trial trained nutritionist gives 1 individual nutrition counseling to the caregiver about their (caregiver and patient) nutrition and food habits.
The personal nutrition guidance will be given on the basis of the caregivers`and patients`3-day food diaries, Mini Nutritional Assessment, home visit and nutritional survey.   The patient can participate to the counseling if it is possible or/and wanted. The duration of the individual nutrition counseling session is 60-90 minutes.  The objective is not to change their food habits completely, but to correct possible inadequacies in their diet and to motivate.

    <sequence>Patients will be randomized in order they have returned their 3 day food diaries after the baseline measurements. The randomization will be performed using computer-generated randomly allocated numbers  received from a randomization center.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome measure protein intake. To ensure 80 % power to detect a 0,2 grammes difference with standard deviation of 0,32 between the intervention and control groups at two-sided alfa 0,05, 42 participants are needed in each group. When drops outs are taken into account the target for intervention and control groups are 51 persons. (Caregivers) 

All caregivers assessed at baseline and at 6 months will be included in the data analyses of the changes in protein intake, health related quality of life and other factors. The data will be presented as means or percentages. Statitical somparison between the groups are given for the most important outcomes and they will be performed using t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test or Chi square-test when appropriate. Additional statistical analyses, like ANCOVA, logistic regression analyses and other will be performed as appropriate.</statisticalmethods>
