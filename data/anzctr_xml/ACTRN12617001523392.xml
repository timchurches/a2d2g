  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two versions of the early primary school version of the Exploring Together program were evaluated; one form had separate child and parent group sessions (Exploring Together-Adapted; ET-Adapted) and the other form included some parent-child group time in the intervention (Exploring Together; ET).

The Exploring Together program (Littlefield et al., 2010) is a multi-group treatment program in that it involves children, their parent, and teachers.  The original manualized version of the program consists of three group components, namely parent-child interactive groups, childrens group, and parents group.  Additionally, two teachers meetings and two partners meetings are held throughout the program.  The theoretical underpinning of the program is drawn from a number of psychological theories, including, cognitive-behavioral theory, attachment theory, and coercion theory.  The program focuses on supporting parents, enhancing parenting practices, strengthening family units, reducing childrens problematic behavior, and developing childrens social skills.   

 The ET-Adapted program consisted of separate concurrent groups for children (1.5 hours, 2 leaders) and parents (1.5 hours, 2 leaders).  The ET program consisted of a parent-child interactive group (40 minutes, 4 leaders), followed by separate concurrent group sessions for parents and children (each 1 hour duration with 2 group leaders).  Parents and children then came together for a final parent-child interactive group (20 minutes, 4 leaders). 

The programs were provided free to participants and consisted of nine (weekly) sessions, coinciding with school terms.  It was a requirement that one parent be able to attend the nine-week group program.  Intervention groups were conducted at the participating primary school during school hours.  Each version of the program consisted of all of the content covered in the original manualized version of the early primary school edition of the Exploring Together program (Littlefield et al., 2010), including the distribution of weekly Mystery Mission (homework) tasks.  

Both versions of the program included two meetings for partners or support persons and two meetings for teachers.  Additionally, both versions of the program incorporated teaching of Emotion Coaching principles (Gottman &amp; DeClaire, 1997) to parents throughout the program.  Parent participants from both intervention conditions were invited to attend a booster group to coincide with 6-month follow-up.

Two teachers meetings (each 1-1.5 hours in duration) were held throughout both versions of the program (ET and ET-Adapted) and were usually held at the end of a school day.  The teachers meetings aimed to provide information about the program and promote a consistent approach in how to discipline and nurture the children.

Two group-based, face-to-face parent evenings (each 1-1.5 hours in duration) were held throughout both versions of the program (ET and ET-Adapted).  The parent evenings aimed to elicit the partners expectations of the program and to involve the partners in the program and implementing strategies in the home.  

Parent participants from both versions of the program (ET and ET-Adapted) were invited to attend a group booster session (1-1.5 hours long) to coincide with completion of 6-month follow-up measures.  The aims were to complete the 6-month follow-up measures and reinforce parenting strategies learnt during the program, and provide an opportunity to troubleshoot any problems that may have arisen. 

Monash Health mental health clinicians who completed a 2-day training workshop with the Exploring Together program authors or who were trained through co-leading a group with a trained Monash Health clinician led the groups.  

The clinicians completed fidelity checklists throughout the intervention period for a subsample of groups (16%) in order to elicit information about therapist adherence to group set-up and process.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants were children in Preparatory year to Grade Three with externalising and/or internalising behaviour problems and their parent/carer, recruited from consenting government and catholic primary schools in the south east metropolitan suburbs of Melbourne and Mornington Peninsula region, Victoria. 

Identification of externalising and/or internalising problems occurred through a population wide screening of children in Preparatory year to Grade Three at each participating school using Parent and Teacher versions of the Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997).  

Children in Preparatory year to Grade Three were eligible for possible participation in the intervention group based on Parent and/or Teacher SDQ Total Difficulties Score in the borderline  abnormal range (greater than or equal to 14 or 12 respectively). Children were also eligible for the intervention group if they scored in the borderline  abnormal range on an Externalising score (combined Conduct Problems Score, Hyperactivity Score, &amp; Peer Problems Score) of the Parent and/or Teacher SDQ (greater than or equal to 12 or 13 respectively), or if they scored in the borderline  abnormal range on an Internalising score (Emotional Symptoms Score) of the Parent and/or Teacher SDQ (greater than or equal to 4 or 5 respectively).

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses were carried out on an intention to treat basis (i.e. all cases were analysed irrespective of number of sessions completed).  Because of the multi-stage sampling strategy (schools recruited, then children), multilevel model analyses were conducted to assess the impact of treatment condition (ET, ET-Adapted) from baseline to 12-month follow-up on child outcome variables, taking into account the random effect of school.  The main analysis was conducted using Mixed Linear Models (MLM) with SPSS 23.  For the main analysis, a MLM was fit with intercept and school as random effects and repeated effect of time for children nested in schools.  Key variables (i.e., intervention and time) were added to the model as fixed effects.   </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A cluster-randomised trial was conducted comparing two versions of delivery of the early primary school version of the Exploring Together program; one form had separate child and parent group sessions (Exploring Together-Adapted; ET-Adapted) and the other form included some parent-child group time in the intervention (Exploring Together; ET).  

The sample analysed consisted of 136 parents and their children (aged 5-10 years) with externalising and/or internalising problems, recruited from government (n = 20) and catholic (n = 4) primary schools from within the south east metropolitan suburbs of Melbourne and Mornington Peninsual region, Victoria.   

Child outcome measures included parent- and teacher-reported child externalising and internalising problems.  Parent outcome measures included parent self-report of positive and negative parenting behaviour, parenting stress, satisfaction and efficacy.  All outcomes were assessed post intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow ups. 

In regard to child outcomes, significant reductions in parent- and teacher-reported child externalising and internalising problems were evident across both treatment groups at post intervention.  At the 6- and 12-month follow-ups significant reductions were maintained on parent-reported child externalising and internalising problems only.  Change on all child outcome variables did not vary significantly between treatment conditions at any time point.

In regard to parent outcomes, significant changes averaged across both treatment groups over time were found for parent-reported negative parenting practices at post intervention (maintained up to 12 month follow-up) and parenting efficacy at post intervention (maintained up to 6-month follow-up).  Results showed non-significant changes averaged across both treatment groups over time for parenting stress, positive parenting practices and parenting satisfaction.    There was evidence of a significant group (intervention) by time interaction for parenting efficacy at post intervention, with greater improvement for participants in the ET program.  There was also evidence of a significant group (intervention) by time interaction for parenting satisfaction at 12-month follow-up, with greater improvements for participants in the ET-Adapted program.  

Overall, study results did not demonstrate that the inclusion of parent-child interactive groups (ET program) was associated with consistently greater improvements in child behaviour or parenting outcomes relative to the version (ET-Adapted program) that omitted the combined groups.
