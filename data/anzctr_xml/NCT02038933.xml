  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC) Assessment - ORR is defined as the number of subjects with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Remission (CR) or Partial Remission (PR), according to the 2007 revised International Working Group (IWG) Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, , based on IRRC assessment, divided by the number of treated subjects. CR= Disappearance of all evidence of disease, confirmed by PET scan; PR= Regression of measureable disease and no new sites; Stable Disease (SD)= Failure to attain CR/PR or PD; Progressive Disease (PD)= Any new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% of previously involved sites from nadir.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From first dose until date of documented disease progression or subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first (assessed up to April 2016, approximately 25 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DOR) - DOR is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to the date of initial objectively documented progression as determined using the 2007 revised IWG Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, based on IRRC assessment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. CR= Disappearance of all evidence of disease, confirmed by PET scan; PR= Regression of measureable disease and no new sites; SD= Failure to attain CR/PR or PD; PD= Any new lesion or increase by &gt;=50% of previously involved sites from nadir.</outcome>
