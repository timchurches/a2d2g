    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through radio, print and television advertising and database searches. The Nucleus Network database currently has a number of Japanese and Caucasian volunteers. If required, print advertising may be used after translation to Japanese. 

Through advertising, potential participants will contact the Nucleus Network volunteer recruitment office and a brief synopsis of the study and its requirements will be discussed over the telephone. Following this initial telephone conversation, potential participants will be invited to the Centre for Clinical Studies. 

The database searches will involve the volunteer recruitment officers identifying participants that are suitable for inclusion in the trial and contacting them by telephone. A brief synopsis of the study and its requirements will be discussed.  Following this initial telephone conversation, potential participants will be invited to the Centre for Clinical Studies. Volunteers registered on the databases have given consent to be contacted for future studies.

Participants will be provided with the information and consent form for this study by mail or email prior to attendance at the Centre for Clinical Studies where possible. Where this is not possible the information and consent form will be provided in the privacy of a consulting room. The participant will be given the opportunity to take the information home before deciding to take part in the study or not. The information will be discussed with the potential participant and any questions answered by the investigator and / or study staff.

When the participant is satisfied that they understand what their participation in the study involves, and they have had all their questions answered to their satisfaction, they will be asked to sign the consent form to participate in research, only if they are willing to participate. The consenting process will be documented in the volunteers’ source documents.

Once the participant is deemed eligible, study treatment would be allocated by central randomisation by phone/fax/computer. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>The treatment assigned will be decided by a code produced by a computer and will be decided at random (by chance, just like a roll of a dice).  Allocation of a participant to the study will be performed by central randomisation by phone/fax/computer.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Prior to statistical modeling, PK parameters will be loge-transformed. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the mean difference in logarithmic PK parameters will be estimated using an analysis of covariance model adjusted for treatment and ethnicity (Japanese and Non-Japanese) for comparisons of ABP 980 and FDA-licensed trastuzumab (Treatment A versus Treatment B), ABP 980 and EU-authorized trastuzumab (Treatment A versus Treatment C), and FDA-licensed trastuzumab and EU-authorized trastuzumab (Treatment B versus Treatment C). The point estimates and 90% CIs for geometric mean test-to-reference ratio will then be calculated by transforming back to original scale.
To establish bioequivalence, the 90% CI for the geometric mean test-to-reference ratio for Cmax and AUCinf should fall within the bioequivalence criteria of 0.80 and 1.25.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ABP 980 in healthy subjects compared with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed trastuzumab and European Union (EU)-authorized trastuzumab.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are healthy male, aged between 18 to 45 years of age (inclusive), and have a body mass index between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) for non-Japanese subjects. To be enrolled as a Japanese subject, subjects must be either first- or second-generation Japanese and have a body mass index between 18.0 and 25.0 kg/m2.

Trial details
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of three groups. Participants in one group will receive 6mg/kg of ABP 980 (440mg vial) intravenously once only. Participants in the second group will receive 6mg/kg2 of FDA-licensed trastuzumab (440mg vial) intravenously. Participants in the third group will receive 6mg/kg2 of EU-authorised trastuzumab (440mg vial) intravenously.
All participants will be followed-up at 64 days post allocation to one of the three drugs used in this trial.
