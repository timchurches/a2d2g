  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention for this trial is: melatonin (10mg)
-the dose administered, 10mg three times daily (tds)
- the duration of administration: from the time of recruitment to the trial until birth
- the mode of administration: oral tablet</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator for this trial is: a placebo tablet, the placebo will be have an identical presentation to the intervention (melatonin 10mg) tablet, thus the intervention and comparator will be indistinguishable from each other
-administered: three times daily (tds)
- the duration of administration: from the time of recruitment to the trial until birth
- the mode of administration: oral tablet</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare neurodevelopmental outcomes between groups using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (Bayley-III).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (Bayley-III)  will be undertaken when the child is 2 years corrected age.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of melatonin.

The safety and tolerability of melatonin will be assessed though: 

1) The participant completing a project specific, intervention administration and side effects diary, which has been prepared for use in the trial. The participant will record the date and time the intervention (tablet) was taken and then record how it subsequently made them feel, if anything. Any recorded side effects will be compared to those side effects named  in the product information leaflet for melatonin.  Such side effects would include: drowsiness, abdominal cramps, gastro intestinal disturbance, flushing and migraine.

2) The collection of participant venous blood samples and the measurement of: full blood count (FBE) (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). In addition to  monitoring kidney function though the measurement of urea and electrolytes (U&amp;Es), creatinine and urate, and also liver function, ascertained though liver function tests (LFTs) (ALT, bilirubin and albumin).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1) The participant will keep a project specific, intervention administration and side effects diary. The diary will be maintained, from the time of recruitment to the trial when administration of the trial intervention commences, until the time of birth, when the administration of the trial intervention ceases.

2) Participant venous blood samples will be collected at these time points: prior to the intervention being administered and thereafter (at least) fortnightly until birth, and then following birth (ideally, 20 minutes, or less) and finally, one week post birth.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure the in-utero effects of participant melatonin administration upon the growth trajectory of the fetus. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The growth trajectory of the fetus will be measured through the undertaking of participant abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound(s) will take place at these time points: from time of the participant's recruitment to the trial (prior to the administration of the trial intervention), and once administration of the trial intervention has begun, thereafter (at least), fortnightly until birth has taken place. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure the effects of participant melatonin administration upon amniotic fluid index (AFI) and fetal wellbeing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fetal surveillance will be assessed using doppler waveform analysis. The doppler waveform analysis will take place at these time points: from time of recruitment to the trial (prior to the administration of the trial intervention), and once administration of the trial intervention has begun, thereafter (at least) weekly until birth has taken place. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During pregnancy, fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a recognised causal pathway to neurodevelopmental injury, which manifests, following birth, as cognitive and behavioural impairment as well as cerebral palsy. Currently, antenatal care is focused on detecting FGR and assessment of fetal wellbeing to guide timing of delivery. This approach seeks to maximize gestational age at birth to minimise the risks of prematurity, while delivering the fetus in time to minimise the likelihood of stillbirth. However, no therapies exist that can maximize fetal wellbeing in the setting of FGR and minimise the frequency of antenatally acquired brain injury. This double-blind RCT seeks to recruit n=292 women with FGR pregnancies to determine if antenatal maternal Melatonin administration can PROTECT the fetal brain and lead to improved neurodevelopmental outcomes.
