  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our gut has hundreds of types of good and bad bacteria in it. Changes to the diet can affect our gut health, the balance of gut bacteria which can lead to downstream changes to bacterial by-products as a result. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a drink containing fruit fibre, a fruit compound or a combination of fruit compounds and fruit fibre have any beneficial effects on the gut. This will be determined by measuring the types of beneficial and commensal bacteria, investigating the frequency of bowel movements and determining by-products of the digestive process that can benefit the gut lining. We will also be carrying out a questionnaire on digestive well being to see how people feel after including these drinks in their normal diet. Further we aim to determine whether there is any difference in the effects of drinks containing these fruit ingredients and drinks without them. It is hypothesised that the product containing the combination of fruit compounds and fruit fibre will improve overall gut health as determined by the above measures.</summary>
