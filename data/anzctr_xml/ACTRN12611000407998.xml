      <outcome>The incidence of any adverse event such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. will be documented.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefrantine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Tak and Ranong provinces in Thailand 
Background: Current first-line treatment for P. falciparum in Thailand is a 3-day artesunate-mefloquine combination. The second-line treatment is 7-day quinine-doxycycline combination. Study conducted in 2008 in 5 sentinel sites revealed high efficacy of the 3-day artesunate-mefloquine combination (96.8-100%). In 2009, the efficacy of the artesunate-mefloquine combination declined to 87-92.7% in 4 sentinel sites. The monitoring the efficacy of the first line treatment to generate valuable information for updating the national treatment policy is critical. 
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Tak, and Ranong provinces of Thailand
Methods: Antimalarial drug efficacy trials will be conducted in 2 sites for uncomplicated falciparum infection. The participants will be febrile patients aged 6 months and above with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Falciparum malaria patients will be treated with Artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem 'Registered Trademark') combination. A total dose of artemether 2mg/kg and lumefantrine 12 mg/kg two times a day for three days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy for falciparum malaria. The study will be conducted from May 2011 - May 2012. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.</summary>
