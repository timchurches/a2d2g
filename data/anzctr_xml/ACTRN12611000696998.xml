  <interventions>
    <interventions>A chin strap will be applied. Chin straps are commercially available devices used to prevent oral route breathing and mouth leak during CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy. A chin strap consists of a piece of soft flexible material designed to support mouth closure. An appropriately fitted Seatec (brand name) chin strap will be fitted. Nasal decongestant will also be used as an intervention to prevent oral route breathing. The chin strap will be applied for the duration of the sleep study.  Nasal decongestant with oxymetazoline will be 2 sprays in each nostril prior to PSG (polysomnography i.e. sleep study) on the chin strap intervention night only.  The two sleep studies i.e with chinstrap&amp; decongestant spray and nil interventions will be seperated by no more than 1 week.  PSG will be conducted with the same instrumentation on both study nights including calibrated sound recording and breathing route detection with thermistors. Anthropometric data including age, sex, height, weight, BMI, neck circumference will be collected.  Questionnaires including sleep history, WSHQ, ESS, VAS for sleep quality, ease of nasal breathing will be conducted.  Nasal Resistance with and without decongestant via posterior rhinomanometry prior to each PSG study. Standard Polysomnography using Compumedics Profusion 3 software. Calibrated sound recording for snoring with Rion SL Meters. Route of breathing using semi-calibrated nasal and oral thermistors. Subject perception questionnaires for sleep quality, dryness of mouth and ease of nasal breathing will be conducted at the end of the overnight study i.e morning. Randomisation will occur via reference to a statistical reference table prior to the first study night and after informed consent. Randomisation will mean the subject will be placed in the group that has no intervention on the first study night or the group that will have the chin strap &amp; nasal spray intervention on the first night.  The second study night will follow as chin strap &amp; nasal spray if the first night was no intervention.  The second study night will follow as no intervention if the first study night had chin strap &amp; nasal spray.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will have two sleep studies (PSG). The test night will have chin strap and nasal decongestion spray the control night will have no chin strap and no nasal decongestion spray.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of preventing oral breathing (using a chin strap together with nasal decongestant to relieve nasal obstruction) on the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)  determined by Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) and Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) in patients with mild to moderate OSA. Data analysis will include: nasal resistance measured at a flow of 0.4L/s both pre &amp; post decongestant.  Sleep studies (Polysomnographs i.e. PSG) will be scored for sleep staging and respiratory events using standard laboratory guidelines (AASM) by one scientist blinded to the study intervention.  PSGs will be reported by physician blinded to the study intervention.  Calculation of standard PSG parameters i.e Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI), Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), Apnea Index (AI), RERAs (Respiratory Effort Related Arousals), Total Sleep Time (Total Sleep Time), Sleep efficiency, Wake and sleep onset (WASO, % sleep stage, snore index, snoring epochs, nasal and oro-nasal breathing epochs.  Assessment for correlation between change in nasal only breathing epochs and change in SDB parameters.</outcome>

    <concealment>The study is a prospective, randomised controlled design using a chin strap and nasal decongestant as the intervention to prevent oral route breathing. patients will be recruited prospectively from referrals from a University Hospital specifically Westmead Sleep Service for investigation of SDB.  A sufficient number of subjects will be screened in order to enrol and complete 10 subjects as a pilot study. After giving written consent the subject will be randomised to receive either the first treatment night(prevention of oralnasal breathing by use of chin strap &amp; nasal spray) or no treatment night then the alternate (either treatment or no treatment) on the second night.
Allocation is concealed central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation by using a randomisation table created by computer software.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mouth (oral) route breathing during sleep may be a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) leading to increased disease severity related to a more collapsible upper airway.  CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is the current gold standard treatment of choice for severe OSA for mild to moderate OSA CPAP is less convincing and often less well tolerated.  Hence a range of alternative treatment options have been utilised with varying degres of success. Because of the lack of effective and iniversally acceptable therapies for OSA there remains a need to develop alternative approaches.  One such approach maybe to prevent oral route breathing during sleep which maybe an important contributor to worsening uppder airway obstruction in subjects who breathing oronasally during sleep.</summary>
