  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a short term crossover study.  Each participant will receive a single dose of each of the following products, each in a different order.  Each product will be given orally at a standard dose of 80g protein in 800ml of water.  Participants will attend four study visits, each at least one week apart, over an eight week period.  The following products will be tested:
Control agent: soy protein (Code number 06/8040/1668)
Study agents: three skim milk products (Code numbers 01/7939/1274, 03/7939/1276, and 07/000/1275).</interventions>

    <concealment>The participants and the investigators will be blinded to the order of the test substances.  Each participant will be allocated the order of test substances off-site by the manufacturer.  Test substances will be provided by the manufacturer in coded sealed sachets. Test substances will be pre-weighed into sachets labelled with individual 3-digit codes. The test substance order for each subject will be chosen at random and provided in sealed envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each subject evaluates each test substance, but always in a different order. Orders were randomly allocated to subjects using a random number generator (Minitab Release 14.2).   The test substance sachets will be labelled with unique 3-digit codes, which were randomly chosen from all 3-digit codes between 111 and 999 and allocated to the sachets (Minitab Release 14.2).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent studies have identified ingestion of dairy products as protective for the development of gout.  This effect is likely to be due to the uric acid lowering effect of factors within milk.  The proposed study will analyse the effect of specific skim milk products on uric acid levels in healthy men, in an attempt to understand how dairy products influence uric acid levels. 
This is a cross-over pilot study of short term urate-lowering effects of skim milk powders.  We will study 16 healthy male participants.   Participants will attend four study visits, each lasting approximately four hours and on each visit will receive a milk product.  Blood and urine samples will be taken over the four hour period.  Participants will receive all four study products over an eight week period, but products will be administered in a random order.</summary>
