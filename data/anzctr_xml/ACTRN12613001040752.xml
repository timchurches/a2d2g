    <interventions>This is a single-centre, controlled, study using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) infection to characterize the effectiveness of ferroquine against early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection. The study will be conducted in 2 cohorts (n= 8 in each). Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~1,800 viable Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously. On the day designated for commencement of treatment, as determined by qPCR results, participants will begin treatment with ferroquine. The threshold for commencement of treatment will be when PCR quantification of all subjects is greater than or equal to 1,000 parasites/mL. If the PCR quantification of a subject is greater than or equal to 5,000 parasites/mL or if clinical or parasitological evidence of malaria occurs in a subject, before all subjects have reached the treatment threshold, of =1,000 parasites/mL then allocated treatment of that subject will begin at this time . It is expected that treatment will commence 7-8 days following inoculation. 
The first cohort will be dosed with a single oral dose of 800mg ferroquine. The subsequent dose in the second cohort will be determined following a review of observed ferroquine safety, and pharmacodynamic outcome (activity of the drug as defined by parasite clearance kinetics). It is anticipated that the subsequent dose will be between 300mg and 1200mg. Cohort 1 data will be reviewed by the by Safety Review Team,  to determine cohort 2 start date and dose.  All participants will be administered Riamet which is a standard treatment for Malaria at the end of study to ensure clearance of parasites.

    <comparator>The study involves 2 cohorts. The first cohort will receive an oral dose 800mg ferroquine. The second cohort will receive an oral dose of ferroquine at a dose to be determined following a review of observed ferroquine safety, and pharmacodynamic outcome (as defined by parasite clearance kinetics). It is anticipated that the subsequent dose will be between 300mg and 1200mg</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of ferroquine on clearance of Plasmodium falciparum parasites from the blood in healthy volunteers following infection with blood stage parasites.

      <timepoint>Blood testing Day 0 pre inoculums then 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 72 hours  then AM/PM or AM sampling until 2 consecutive negative PCR results. 
Blood sampling for PK: Pre ferroquine dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144 hours,  8, 11, 14 Days post ferroquine dose, then end of study day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ferroquine in the challenge model. This outcome will be measured by monitoring drug levels in the blood by PK sampling</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the tolerability of ferroquine in the challenge model.
This outcome will be measured by Physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory blood testing, ECG, Urine screening, Assessment of Adverse events such as fever, nausea, muscle and joint pain,  fatigue
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physical examination, vital signs: Screening, Day 0 4-28
Clinical laboratory blood testing: Screening, Day 0 4-28
ECG:  screening, Day 0 on admission prior to ferroquine administration final study day 28
Urine screening: screening, Day 0, on confinement, on commencement of rescue medication. 
Assessment of Adverse events: Day 0-28
