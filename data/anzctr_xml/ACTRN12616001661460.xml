    <interventions>The aim of study is to assess physiological, functional and psyhological changes after 10 weeks vibroswing system exercises in older adults.

 Intervention:
All participants (n=100) will be randomized and randomly assigned into two comparative groups (A, B). Group A will be the study group, where vibroswing exercises equipment will be used. Group B will be a control group where the participants will exercise with the same equipment but without vibration effect.
All participants will be instructed how to use the smovey vibroswing system (is a swinging-ring system and consists of a spiraled tube, four steels balls, and a grip with cushioning elements ) and will complete 30-minute group sessions of exercise twice a week for 10 weeks with attendance at all sessions. Participants will be assessed at pre and post intervention by the instruments: electromyograph, balance platform, body analyzer and Quality of life SF-36 questionnaire (the Polish version). All sessions for groups A &amp; B (study &amp; control) will be supervised by University staff or trained students (all with 1st aid certification).

The nature of the program for both groups will be the same:

Vibroswing system exercises (participants always hold in each hand the vibroswing equipment while performing the exercises) with 15 repetitions (the number of repetitions is decrease to 10 when Borg rating reaches 6 out of 10)  :
1. 5 min Warm Up
2. 15 min Aerobic Exercise with equipment in upright body position with knees slightly bent:
 (e.g. coordination and balance exercises):
- Swing forward and backward alternatively with the right and left arms. Slightly lift right or left leg off the ground for a few swings.
- Swing parallel and evenly forward and backwards from the shoulders.
- Swing the arms horizontally back as far as possible at shoulder height &amp; bring the arms together in front of the body. The more the arms are extended the more intensity.
- Crossover start position. Swing the arms so that they cross alternately in front of the body (without touching).
- Swing the arms alternately to the right or left side at the same time. Swing both arms to the left side as you step with the right leg at the same time  and reversed.
- Step one leg back and lower the buttocks so the rear knee is slightly off the ground and the front knee does not move forward past the tip of the toes  perform even parallel swings  and change legs. From the same leg stance swing with alternating arms.

3. 10 min Stretching: major muscle groups
4. 5 min Cool-down: relaxation and breathing

There will be breaks between exercises and the exercise program is progressive and tailored towards individual capabilities and preferences (Borg rating of perceived exertion scale measured during exercise 0-10).

    <comparator>Participants in the B group (control) will exercise with the same equipment than A group (study) but with no vibration effects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research hypothesis is that the vibroswing system exercise will show short term and/or long term effects in decreasing pain and disability in older adults with non specific low back pain. Low back pain is still a significant medical problem and challenge for the medicine specialist as well as physiotherapist. Recent interest has emerged on the use of Whole Body Vibration (WBV) and specially designed exercise equpiment as a potential therapy that may produce improvements in muscle strength, balance and decrease pain. There is a lot of exercise programs are used to treat low back pain with tool (pilates, yoga, manual therapy).
The Smovey is a new exercise tool, which can be used for regular activity and exercise. It is a spiraled tube, four steels balls inside and a grip. When the patient is performing a forward motion the four steel balls roll inside the tube and create a pulsating vibration. The weight of one ring (at rest) is approximately 500 grams, and through the centrifugal forces, created by the swinging motion, the perceivable weight can increase to almost 5 kilos with a frequency of 60 hertz. 
The main scientific aim of the project is an objective evaluation of the influence of vibroswing system exercise on older adults with chronic low back pain.
