  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial will study the effectiveness of intravireal AFLIBERCEPT in the treatment of exudative wet Macular degeneration which thus far has not responded to other anti VEGF agents (Bevacizumab and Ranibizumab). 

The dose of aflibercept administered is 2 mg. The drug will delivered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks of the study. Thereafter the drug will be administered by intravitreal injection every 8 weeks until the close of the trial at week 52. The duration of the study is 12 months.

For the dutration of the study, participants will attend for review every 4 weeks but they will only require treatment every second visit. During each visit the patients response to treatment will be assessed with OCT (to measure the macula thickness) and their visual acuity will be assessed. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients previous lack of response to their existing anti VEGF treatment will be used as the comparitor in this trial. 

This historical data will be derived from the fact that all participants in the trial will have had persiting subretinal fluid or cystic intraretinal oedema on OCT after treatment despite timely treatment with at least 4 anti-VEGF treatments delivered within minimum of 6 months. Thus all patients will have disease that has been non responsive to the conventional antiVEGF treatments for at least 6 months prior to entering the trial.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The proportion of those patients whose visual acuity improved after 12 months will be compared to Base line. A similar analysis will be conducted to assess the proportion of patients whose disease activity (as measured by improved sub retinal fluid intra retinal oedema and Pigment epithelial detachment) improved compared to baseline. 

Re sample size: 
From our local audit data we found that approximately 8-10% of patients with wet AMD did not respond to conventional antiVEGF agents. We look after a total cohort of 700 patients and thus judged that approximately 70 patients were therefore being inadequately treated with the existing treatments. We also know from anecodotal data; (data which has now been supported by published trial data from small cohort studies) that many of these patients do respond to Aflibercept. As this study is an investigator lead trial we took a proposal to the drug company who are supplying the drug to conduct a trial which would allow most of our patients access to this drug. This approach would ensure that we had as large a sample size as practically possible and at the same time allow as many patietns as possible to get access to the new treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intravitreal Aflibercept in the treatment of  previously treated choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration MD). 

This is an open label study in patients who have been previously treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF drug (ranibizumab or bevacizumab) for AMD and have persisting disease activity despite previous monthly intravitreal injections. All subjects will initially receive 3 monthly doses of 2.0mg of intravitreal Aflibercept injection and then have 2.0mg of intravitreal Aflibercept at two monthly intervals for the next 9 months. 
At the close of the trial the effectiveness of Aflibercept in the mangement of wet age related macular degeneration that has not responded to our existing therapies will be assessed.</summary>
