  <interventions>
    <interventions>Reduction in immunosuppression: Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin and Mycophenolate will be reduced on average by 25% based on drug exposure profiles. All these medications are dosed twice a day. The dose reduction will occur at a single time point and the drug exposure profile measured 2 weeks later to determine whether subsequent reduction is required. If required again drug exposure will be checked two weeks later.</interventions>
    <comparator>Continued regimen of immunosuppression: In most cases a drug regimen will  contain a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporin) and an anti-proliferative agent (mycophenolate or azathiorprine). These medications are taken mostly twice a day and azathioprine is taken daily. Prednisolone is also take daily at doses between 5 and 10mg. All medications are taken orally and for as long as the renal transplant is functioning</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Transplant patients with previous skin cancer could tolerate a 25% reduction in immunousppression and this should equate to a 30% reduction in time to next skin cancer. Subjects with &gt;19 Treg cells/ul blood have median time to next skin cancer 100 days and 86% chance that such skin cancer is aggressive histologically. With a power of 80%, 90 day lead in time, follow-up 365 days, significance of 0.05, 40 subjects are needed in each group. With a 5% drop in and 5% drop out; 98 subjects will need to be recruited. The study is concomitantly powered to detect reduction in the proportion of aggressive SCC that develop from 86% to 58%</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether reducing the doses of anti-rejection drugs is effective in preventing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in kidney transplant recipients. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or above, are a kidney transplant recipient with a previous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Study details Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will have monitored dose reduction in immunosuppression, whilst participants in the other group will remain on their current drug regimen. Participants will be follow-up for 60 months, in order to determine how many new squamous cell carcinomas develop and whether they are aggressive. There are several test of the immune system to make sure the risk of acute or chronic rejection is very low but your kidney function will be followed for up to 60 months to make sure the dose reduction is safe over the long term.</summary>
