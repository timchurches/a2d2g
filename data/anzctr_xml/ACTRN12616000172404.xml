    <interventions>Goal-directed Therapy/Experimental Group 

Patients undergoing Liver Resection in the Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) group (experimental group) will have a Flotrac/Vigileo device TradeMark connected after insertion of the arterial line. The arterial catheters will be connected to the cardiac output device transducer system and haemodynamic data from the Flotrac device will be collected throughout surgery. All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at the level of the right atrium.

Patients in the GDT group will be managed by a Stroke Ventricular Volume (SVV) guided protocol to maintain SVV &lt; 20%. This percentage of SVV is frequently used in our institution as a target for patients undergoing this procedure. For the GDT group, if SVV remains above 20% for at least 2 min, then a 250mL bolus of balanced crystalloid (Hartmanns solution or Plasmalyte) or colloid fluid (Albumen) will be given. The SVV will be assessed every 20 seconds via the FloTrac/Vigileo proprietary algorithm. Similar to other GDT studies, the preferred colloid will be albumin secondary to the known effects of improved intravascular repletion and intravascular half life and the theoretical benefit of prolonged stroke volume optimization. In both groups, the administration of blood products will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, as clinically indicated. There will be no standard protocol for fluid maintenance infusion for either group.

The GDT group will receive standard perioperative Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care and additional haemodynamic monitoring using the FloTrac/Vigileo TradeMark (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). 

The anaesthetist will have no influence over any aspect of postoperative care management. All clinicians and nursing staff in charge of postoperative care will be blinded to the allocation of patients. The Flotrac system will be connected to the patient prior to surgical incision and discontinued as soon as the surgery is complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group

Patients undergoing Major Liver Resection in the control group will have a Flotrac/Vigileo deviceTM connected after insertion of the arterial line. The arterial catheters will be connected to the cardiac output device transducer system and haemodynamic data from the Flotrac device will be collected throughout surgery. All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at the level of the right atrium.

Control patients will have fluid management and inotropic use guided by the routine cardiovascular monitoring in place i.e. arterial line, and central venous catheter, which will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, who will be blinded to Flotrac data. The Control group anaesthetist will be allowed to have the Flotrac haemodynamic data unblinded if needed for
clinical decision making but patients will be removed from analysis if this occurs.

In both groups, the administration of blood products will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, as clinically indicated. There will be no standard protocol for fluid maintenance infusion for either group.

The control group will receive standard perioperative Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care alone.

The anaesthetist will have no influence over any aspect of postoperative care management. All clinicians and nursing staff in charge of postoperative care will be blinded to the allocation of patients. The Flotrac system will be connected to the patient prior to surgical incision and discontinued as soon as the surgery is complete.</comparator>

    <concealment>All adult patients undergoing liver resection will be evaluated preoperatively at the anaesthesia pre-admsissions clinic at least 1-2 weeks prior to surgery. Patients will be identified for study entry by the investigators or an anaesthetist or research co-ordinator acting on behalf of the principal investigators by surveillance of patients in the pre-admissions clinic.

Patients will be identified from their preoperative medical records and surgical notes.

A thorough assessment of the participant’s competence and capacity to make a valid informed decision will be made by the study investigators prior to the patient being recruited. All patients will be deemed competent if they:
1. Able to comprehend and retain information relevant to making the decision 
2. Understand the information and implications of the decision
3. Able to weigh the information in the balance and arrive at a decision 

For each patient, an opaque envelope containing a participant number will be prepared, sealed and sequentially numbered. On the morning of surgery the anaesthetist will open the envelope and randomise the participant.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit 50 patients in total, 25 patients in the GDT group and 25 patients in the
standard group. This is in keeping with realistic power calculations used in other studies evaluating the use of GDT in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Canessons group in the US detect a 3-day mean length of stay difference between the two groups, with a standard deviation of 3 days in each group, a two tailed alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80, and calculated that a minimum of 17 subjects were required in each group. They assumed that a similar sample size would be needed to detect a similar difference in time to return of GI function. Also, since they expected similar results between arterial pressure waveform analysis technology used for their study and the oesophageal Doppler technology used for other referenced studies, it was felt that this estimation was appropriate.

Sample size for the study was calculated based on our pilot data evaluating patients
undergoing liver resection with an ERAS program at Austin hospital. With an median length of hospital stay of 6 days, and a SD of 1.5 days, if we were to demonstrate a mean
difference between the control group and the GDT group of 1 day, with a power value of
90%, we require a minimum of 24 patients to be recruited into each group.

We will therefore recruit 25 patients in each arm, a total of 50 patients.

Statistical analysis will be performed using computerized software (SPSS for windows 12.0).  For data that was non-normally distributed a Mann-Whitney U-test will be used and normally distributed data will be compared using Students t-test. Ordinal and nominal data will be compared using Chi-squared analysis. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate if patients undergoing major liver resection managed by intraoperative goal directed therapy with the Flotrac/Vigileo deviceTM will have a shorter length of hospital stay with fewer post-operative complications compared to patients managed by standard care. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and are scheduled to undergo major liver resection. 

Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will have their haemodynamic variables (fluid dynamic and blood flow) be managed by intraoperative goal directed therapy (GDT) using the Flotrac/Vigileo deviceTM (FloTrac/Vigileo Version 3.02, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). This minimally invasive device automatically calculates key flow parameters every 20 seconds and recognizes and allows for adjustments in haemodynamic variables in patients undergoing major surgery. Importantly, it enables the anaesthetist to make a differential diagnosis leading to either a volume or cardiovascular intervention (preload, afterload and contractility), by providing continuous information on the patients cardiac output, stroke volume, and systemic vascular resistance. Participants allocated to the control group will have fluid management and inotropic use guided by the routine cardiovascular monitoring in place i.e. arterial line, and central venous catheter, which will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, who will be blinded to Flotrac data. The Control group anaesthetist will be allowed to have the Flotrac haemodynamic data unblinded if needed for clinical decision making but patients will be removed from analysis if this occurs. There is now compelling evidence that fluid optimization and GDT in patients undergoing colorectal surgery leads to better outcomes, particularly in high risk patients.

This study will contribute to understanding if similar benefit of GDT is also observed in patients undergoing major liver resection.</summary>
