  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will take the form of a personalized and interactive web-site which will deliver 8 modules of psychological therapy, employing a cognitive behavioural approach, over an 8-week period.

Each module will be uploaded on a weekly basis. So on week 1 the participant will only have access to 1 module but by week 8 they will have all 8 modules on their page. This means they can review the content as much as they wish.  

The modules are as follows:

Week 1: Introduction / engagement and agenda setting
Week 2: Emotional recognition and distress tolerance
Week 3: Identification of automatic thinking 
Week 4: Behavioural activation: help-seeking
Week 5: Behavioural activation: activity scheduling (including relaxation techniques)
Week 6: Problem solving: specific focus on self harming or SI 
Week 7: Detecting &amp; challenging problematic thinking and cognitive restructuring 
Week 8: Wrap up and review

It is anticipated that each module will take between 15 and 20 minutes to complete.  

The website will be moderated by a member of the study team.
In addition participants will receive 2 SMS messages per week, the first will remind the young person to check the website and the second will reinforce the content of that week's module. These messages will be automatically generated by the system.</interventions>

    <concealment>Any students who present to the school welfare team for help and report a recent (in past month) history of suicide attempt or suicidal ideation will be asked by the school welfare counsellor if they would be happy to be contacted by a member of the research team. If the young person agrees, the research assistant will arrange a meeting with them at a time and venue of the young personâ€™s choice. The RA will provide written and verbal information about the study and if they agree to participate written consent will be obtained from the student and their parent / guardian.
Once consent is obtained the baseline assessment will take place. Following this, the participant's details will be passed to the separately located statistician who will randomly allocate them to either the treatment or control group using computer generated random numbers.</concealment>
    <sequence>Once the baseline assessment is complete the statistician will randomise participants to either the intervention or control group, using computer generated random numbers.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aim of this study is to examine whether or not a web-based intervention employing a cognitive-behavioural therapy approach, can reduce the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) in young people who have presented to the school counselor for help.  

Secondary aims are to examine whether or not the intervention can increase coping and problem solving skills and help-seeking (these are measured as a means of understanding the underlying mechanisms that may lead to a reduction in risk).  We will also assess the acceptability of the intervention, treatment adherence, how long people remain on the website and whether or not the intervention causes undue distress.

Hypotheses

The primary hypotheses are that the intervention will: 

1.	Reduce SI among participants 

Secondary hypotheses are that the intervention will:

2.	Reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and hopelessness
3.	Increase help-seeking 
4.	Improve coping and problem solving skills 
5.	Participants will find the receipt of this intervention acceptable, and
6.	The intervention will not cause undue distress.</summary>
