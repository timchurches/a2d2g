  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two active treatment groups will receive the dietary supplement Arthrem, an extract of the medicinal plant Artemisia annua. Subjects will receive one capsule (orally) twice daily in either 17 mg Arthrem group (total daily dose 34 mg) or the 34 mg Arthrem group (total daily dose 68 mg). 
Compliance will be assessed by patient medication diaries and also by the return of unused capsules at each visit. 
Duration: 12 weeks
There will be an optional, open-label, long term safety follow up study. Subjects choosing to take part will receive 1x 17 mg capsule twice daily (total daily dose 34 mg) for up to 6 months after the double-blind 12 week study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in the placebo group will receive two placebo capsules (orally) twice daily. The placebo capsules consist of an identical capsule to the active capsule but contain only vegetable oil.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) index assesses pain, stiffness and functionality in patients with osteoarthritis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 6, 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: adverse events, laboratory safety tests (full blood count, liver function tests, urea and electrolytes, C-reactive protein), vital signs, physical examination.
Adverse events will be collected and monitored throughout the study. Artemisia annua has not been previously tested in osteoarthritis, but from previous trials in other indications, it is anticipated that the most common adverse events will be gastrointestinal in nature (eg nausea).
Vital signs and laboratory safety tests will be measured at each study visit. Results will be classified by the principal investigator as normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. Parameters that are considered to be abnormal and clinically significant will be reported as adverse events. </outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 6, 12 weeks (and throughout the study for adverse events)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) assesses patients' abilities with sections on dressing, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the hospital records and also from newspaper and radio advertisements. 
Participants will be randomised to one of three treatment groups:  (1)  Arthrem 17 mg twice daily, (2) Arthrem 34 mg twice daily, or (3) placebo twice daily.

Potential participants will be invited to telephone  the clinical trial nurse who will assess their initial eligibility. Eligibility will be confirmed at a screening visit.  

Participants will be given sequential patient numbers, which will correspond to one of three treatments according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule. The study treatments will be pre-labelled with the participants' study numbers according to the randomisation schedule. Neither the patients nor the person dispensing the treatment will be able to see which treatment the participant will be allocated to. </concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated block randomisation schedule will be  created by an independent scientist not otherwise associated with the trial.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in overall WOMAC score at Week 12.
Summaries and change from baseline in overall WOMAC score at each time point will be presented using descriptive statistics by treatment group; these will include mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. The change from baseline to Week 12 will be analysed using a linear mixed model with dose as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. The change from baseline for each treatment group will be compared to zero and a 95% confidence interval for the change will be presented.
The secondary endpoints include the change from baseline in HAQ and VAS pain score at Week 12 and the change from baseline in WOMAC pain score at Week 12; these will be summarized using the same method employed for the primary endpoint.
There are currently no suitable data available that allow a persuasive sample size calculation for the effects of the effects of Arthrem in osteoarthritis. Due to this limitation the study is considered as a pilot, proof of concept study. The sample size is based on the between patient variation in WOMAC overall score previously observed in OA patients and assuming a mean of 38.0 and a standard deviation of 18.0.
A total of 42 participants will be treated with the investigational product. This study will have approximately 80% power to detect a 20% reduction in overall WOMAC score with a significance level of 5%. Thirteen participants per group are needed to provide an 80% power in this pilot study. To allow for a 5% drop-out (attrition rate) 14 participants will be enrolled in each of the three treatment groups (low dose, high dose and placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio (42 participants overall). The type I error (alpha level) has been set at 0.05 for subjects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of the herbal supplement Arthrem on arthritic pain, stiffness and functional limitation in participants with hip and knee osteoarthritis. 
Arthrem capsules have been on the market as a herbal supplement for arthritis since May 2011. Anecdotal evidence and feedback has been positive, however, no clinical safety or efficacy data exist. Broadening knowledge and obtaining evidence-based data from controlled clinical trials is increasingly accepted as necessary for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of complementary and alternative medicines.</summary>
