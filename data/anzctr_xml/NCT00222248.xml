  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine the effect of pelvic floor muscle training in women aged 70 years and over, who
      have proven stress urinary incontinence. The hypotheses to be tested are:

        1. That pelvic floor muscle training is effective in relief of symptoms of stress urinary
           incontinence as measured by a greater reduction in the number of episodes of
           incontinence, quantity of urine lost and improvement of quality of life.

        2. That women who undertake pelvic floor muscle training will show greater improvement of
           pelvic floor muscle function than women who have behavioural (bladder) training, as
           measured by real time transabdominal ultrasound.</summary>
