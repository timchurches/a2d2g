  <interventions>
    <interventions>A generic brand of skin moisturising cleanser will be used during regular bathing. The ingredients in the commercially available  moisturising cleanser are as follows: 
GLYCERIN 
AQUA
(WATER)
SODIUM LAUROYL
SARCOSINATE
LAURYL
BETAINE
DISODIUM
COCOAMPHODIACETATE
SODIUM COCOYL
ISETHIONATE
ACRYLATES / C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE
CROSSPOLYMER
STYRENE/ACRYLATES
COPOLYMER
AMINOMETHYL PROPANOL
The percentage of these ingredients in this product is commercial in confidence and as this is an over the counter cosmetic product rather than a drug with actives, it is considered not applicable. 

The moisturising cleanser will be used during regular bathing of consenting residents in the intervention facilities.  The product will be rinsed from the skin.  Residents will either be assisted by nurses or care staff with bathing and those who can bath independently will be instructed in the use of the cleanser. 

Residents preference for bathing frequency will be adhered to, and some residents prefer to be bathed daily and some second daily.  The cleanser will be used for 6 months.

The use of the product will be monitored by the care staff and project coordinator.  The cleanser will be provided at no cost. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Routine skin care practices as assessed from a pre intervention observational period of 6 months.
Routine skin care practices for residents bathing across all facilities will be recorded during the month prior to the intervention. Currently there is no standardised cleanser or soap used for bathing in the facilities. It is anticipated that a variety of soaps and cleansers will be found to be comprise routine skin care across all facilities prior to the intervention.  The residents preference for bathing frequency will be adhered to and this is anticipated to be daily, second daily or other. Residents in the control sites will continue to use their usual soap or cleanser.  Monitoring of the usual skin care practices (soap or cleanser) across the control sites will be ongoing. 
The consenting residents in the intervention group will be bathed or bath independently using the skin moisturising cleanser.  The residents in the control group will continue to adhere to their usual practice and products for bathing.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin tear incidence will be determined monthly and averaged over 6 months the monthly incidence will be: [total skin tears / (number days / months) by 1000]
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin tears will be identified and classified using the STAR Skin Tear Classification and the anatomical location and activities associated with the skin tear occurrence will be monitored. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin tear location and management. A pre defined list on the data collection tool covers all potential skin tear locations. A treatment options list is included.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effectiveness of the intervention

The cost analysis component of the economic evaluation will include identifying (i) the quantity and cost of the cleanser lotion used and (ii) staff time spent in performing the intervention bathing procedures and (iii) the costs associated with skin tear management (care time and medical consumables). Total costs for the cleanser intervention groups will be compared with total costs for the control groups, to determine the potential cost savings generated by a reduction in skin tear incidence rate. The outcome used to measure the clinical effectiveness of the intervention will be the number of skin-tear-free days of residents over the study period. This will be measured by prospectively monitoring the time to healing of skin tears and applying the number of days retrospectively to the skin tear incidence rate for each group. Average cost-effectiveness, measured as the cost per skin-tear-free day, will be calculated for all groups.

    <concealment>All participants at a randomised facility who meet inclusion criteria will be approached to consent to have the intervention used. Participants at a non intervention site will have no change to usual care. Staff applying the intervention work within the randomised site and don't crossover. Strictly speaking allocation concealment is not used.</concealment>
    <sequence>The twenty six facilities will be sorted into pairs matched in terms of high or low care and as closely as possible in terms of bed numbers.  One member of each of the thirteen matched pairs of facilities will then be randomised to the intervention.  

Simple cluster randomisation of facilities was conducted. Randomisation was performed by an independent person employed by the aged care organisation. The facilities were matched for bed numbers and acuity (either high or low care).  The names of a matched pair of facilities were written on a piece of paper and placed into a container, which was shaken.  The first name of a facility from each matched pair, drawn from the container was randomised to the intervention group. </sequence>
