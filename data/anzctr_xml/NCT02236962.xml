  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is epidemic in Australia, and current preventative strategies have had limited
      success in alleviating this health crisis. While numerous options are available for treatment
      of obesity, most do not result in sustained weight reduction. Obesity results from an
      imbalance between energy intake and expenditure, therefore new methods that correct this
      imbalance are essential for effective long-term treatment. Rodent studies show that brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) can burn more energy than any other tissue in the body, therefore
      targeting BAT to increase its activity (energy burning rate) and quantity in humans is
      potentially a powerful tool for the treatment of obesity and related diseases. BAT has only
      recently been irrefutably identified in adult humans therefore little is known about how it
      functions in humans.</summary>
