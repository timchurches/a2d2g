    <concealment>Women will be randomized to receive either 850 mg metformin twice daily or identical placebo. 

The investigators, study centre personnel and participants will remain blinded throughout the study.

In order to maintain allocation concealment, a piece of paper with the group allocation (metformin or placebo) assigned to each study number in the randomization list will be put into opaque envelopes numbered consecutively 1- 120. Randomization will occur when the envelope with the patientâ€™s study number on it is opened.</concealment>

    <summary>Brief summary*

Abdominal weight gain and insulin resistance (IR) significantly increase the risk of some age related conditions in midlife women, namely cardiovascular disease, dementia and breast cancer. The aim of early intervention in individuals with abdominal obesity and IR when they are still euglycaemic is to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus and the development of other co-morbidities. We hypothesise that treatment of obese midlife euglycemic women with metformin will result in improved insulin sensitivity (assessed by homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA-IR) and increase in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)), weight loss, improved lipid parameters and an increase in adiponectin levels.
