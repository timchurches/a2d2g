    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of administration of a
      cell-delivered ribozyme gene transfer product to participants with chronic (lasting a long
      time) Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection (a life-threatening infection
      which you can get from an infected person's blood or from having sex with an infected
