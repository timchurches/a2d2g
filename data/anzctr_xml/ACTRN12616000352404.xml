  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks plus Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). 
Nivolumab (240mg) will be administered as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. 
SABR (18-20 Gy) will be administered to a single lesion between days 8 - 14 of cycle 1 of Nivolumab. The specific day of SABR will be at clinical discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. Participants will receive 1 or 2 fractions of SABR, dependent on tumour location, determined by clinical discretion of the treating radiologist. Each SABR treatment will take approximately 1 hour.</interventions>

      <outcome>Tertiary studies aim to identify predictive biomarkers that will allow us to select patients most likely to respond to, and derive benefit from this treatment as well as the presence of other biomarkers whose presence may be indicative of better or worse longer term outcomes such as survival. These may include biomarkers which are often studied amongst patients with non-small cell lung cancer such as PD-L1 expression, EGFR and KRAS mutational status but also novel biomarkers relating to effects of radiation on the immune response.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for translational research, including the identification of biomarkers will be collected on D1, D15 and D29 of study treatment with an additional blood taken within 72 hours of SABR (if D15 bloods do not fall within this 72 hour period). Predictive and prognostic biomarkers will be determined based on patient outcomes such as objective response to treatment based on PD-L1 expression and overall survival. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the activity and safety of treating an asymptomatic, extrathoracic metastasis with a single fraction of SABR, during immunotherapy with nivolumab in advanced NSCLC progressing after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy.

Who is it for?
Adults with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progressing after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy and with an asymptomatic, extrathoracic metastasis suitable for SABR. Tumour blocks must be available to test for PD-L1 expression.

Study details
Participants will be randomly allocated in a ratio of 2:1 to either nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks plus SABR (experimental) or nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks alone (control). Nivolumab is continued until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity.

Participants will be assessed regularly for treatment response and side effects during the treatment and follow up phase. Clinical assessments will be performed before  each cycle of nivolumab  (2 weekly) and CT scans at baseline, week 6, 12, 18, 24 then 12 weekly until progression. Anticancer treatments and survival will be reviewed every 12 weeks after progression.  This will enable us to determine the activity and safety of each treatment option in patients with an asymptomatic, extrathoracic metastasis.   </summary>
