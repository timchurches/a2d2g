Laparoscopic weight reduction surgery (sleeve gastrectomy) 
Under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
 Patients (Patients who had upper airway pathologies (maxillo-facial fracture, tumours, etc), pathology causing limitation in head-neck movement (cervical spine fractures, rhomatoid artiritis, ankylozan spondilitis, etc), contraindication of general anaesthesia (history of malign hiperthermia, full stomach, etc)  or a history of difficult laryngoscopy or intubation were excluded from study. 
 Mallampati test, mouth opening, sternomental distance, thyromental distance, upper lip bite test, neck circumference were recorded. The distance from the skin to the anterior aspect of the trachea was measured at three different levels:   vocal cords (zone 1), thyroid isthmus (zone 2) and suprasternal notch (zone 3). An anaesthesiologist who were unaware of the clinical screening variables and ultrasonography results performed laryngoscopy. When second attempt for intubation was failed, to use of other difficult intubation equipments were planned. Each participant was followed up until the end of the operation</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>	OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to compare the ultrasound (USG) measurements of anterior neck soft tissue and other clinical screening tests for difficult laryngoscopy in morbidly obese patients.
	METHODS: One hundred thirthy morbidly obese patients were scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery in this retrospective trial. The USG examination was performed at vocal cords (zone 1), thyroid isthmus (zone 2), and suprasternal notch (zone3) levels. An anaesthesiologist who were unaware of the clinical screening variables and USG results performed laryngoscopy and trachea was intubated without styleted. When second attempt for intubation was failed, to use of other difficult intubation equipments were planned.
	RESULTS: Fifty six of 130 patients were excluded from study because of not meeting inclusion criteria. Laryngoscopic view was graded according to Cormack and Lehane's scale to decide difficult laryngoscopy. Seven patients were classified as having difficult laryngoscopy (9.5%). All of the patients were entubated succesfully within 3 attempts.
	CONCLUSION: We thought that USG measurement of anterior neck soft tissue has no influence on determination of difficult laryngoscopy in morbidly obese patients.
