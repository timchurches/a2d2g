  <interventions>
    <interventions>Permanent childhood hearing loss impacts negatively on the speech, language, communicative, educational, and social developmental outcomes of children. This population-based study compares outcomes of children whose hearing loss was identified soon after birth to those of children identified later in a prospective manner. Children in NSW, Victoria and Queensland who presented for hearing services below 3 years of age at the national hearing service provider, Australian Hearing, were invited to participate in this study. About half of them had access to newborn hearing screening and the remaining did not.  After enrollment, their speech, language and functional outcomes are being measured at fixed intervals over their first 10 years of life, and changes in their hearing status are monitored. These outcomes data will be related to a range of family, child and intervention characteristics. The effect of different factors, including age of intervention, on different outcomes will be quantified. The results will be used to guide best-practice intervention and monitoring of children following diagnosis.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This population-based study has two broad aims. The first is to derive speech, language, psycho-social and functional norms for children aided with hearing aids and/or cochlear implants. The second is to determine the effects of multiple factors, including age of intervention, on developmental outcomes of children with hearing loss.  It is hypothesized that:
1.	Compared to children who received later intervention, children who received early intervention will score better on measures of language, speech, functional performance and quality of life.
2.	Compared to children who received later intervention, children who received early intervention will develop at a rate closer to that of normal hearing children over the first 10 years of life.</summary>
