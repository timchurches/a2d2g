  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - saquinavir 500 formulation
Treatment: drugs - cross-over arm

Experimental: saquinavir at baseline - patients receiving NRTIs + saquinavir + ritonavir 1000/100 mg BID at entry switch from 200 mg SQV capsules to 500 mg SQV tablets following PK at day 0. After PK at day 8 NRTIs ceased and regimen changed to ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1500/100 QD using 500 mg SQV formulation and continued to week 48

Experimental: other boosted PI at baseline - Patients receiving NRTIs + PI/RTV randomised at baseline to receive ATV/SQVRTV 300/1500/100 QD using 500 mg SQV formulation or ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1600/100 QD using 200 mg formulation. Following PK at day 7, SQV formulation switched with second PK assessment at day 15. Patients then receive ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1500/100 QD to week 48.


Treatment: drugs: saquinavir 500 formulation
NRTIs + SQV/RTV 1000/100 mg BID using 200 mg SQV capsules switched at entry to ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1500/100 mg QD using 500 mg SQV tablet for 48 weeks with PK at days 0 and 8.

Treatment: drugs: cross-over arm
either ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1500/100 QD (500 mg SQV tabs) for 7 days then after PK SQV changed to 1600 mg QD (200 mg caps) with PK day 15, or ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1600/100 QD for 7 days with switch to SQV 1500 mg QD. After day 15 PK both groups switch to ATV/SQV/RTV 300/1500/100 QD to week 48

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Saquinavir and Atazanavir are drugs used in combination therapy to treat HIV disease.
      Saquinavir is currently available in a 200 milligram capsule. Most individuals currently on
      saquinavir require to take 5 tablets twice a day. In an attempt to reduce this number of
      pills, a new capsule has been developed containing 500 milligrams of saquinavir. This study
      will assess: i) blood drug levels in individuals taking both saquinavir formulations, ii)
      blood drug levels in individuals taking both saquinavir formulations when given with
      atazanavir, iii) 48 weeks of follow up for individuals receiving the new saquinavir
      formulation with atazanavir as HIV therapy.</summary>
