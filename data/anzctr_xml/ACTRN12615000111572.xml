  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project will aim to investigate the consumption patterns of clients in terms of Meals on Wheels meals and other meals, as well as physical activity levels to enable a better understanding of the current recipients of Meals on Wheels. It will also aim to investigate whether a short term intervention focused on assisting the clients with meal ordering and food provision improves the clients physical and mental health. This intervention/support will be provided via a graduate of a health sciences course (non-expert in nutrition) through visiting the client's home for no longer than 30mins. There are 3 intervention groups, Group 1 will not receive any additional visits outside of usual care and Meal deliveries; Group 2 will receive a visit every 2 weeks for 12 weeks; Group 3 will a visit every month for 6 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups with 30 participants per group.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>30 participants per group are required based on a more modest change in Nutritional intake compared to that employed by Charlton et al (2013), as this study utilised additional provision of food above and beyond that of the existing Meals on Wheels Service. To achieve a power of 90% and observe a 0.75 fold change between treatments, sample size required: n = ((2 x 0.812)/ 0.752) x 10.51 = 24.5 people with a 20% drop-out = 30 people, where: 0.81 is the standard deviation expected, and a is 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Meals on Wheels services provide a key avenue to access some of the most vulnerable and in need members of our community, and is a key strategy to enhance the quality of life for the individual, through supporting and maintaining independent living at home.
Ensuring adequate nutrition and preventing unintentional weight loss regardless of starting body weight, diets appropriate for individual medical conditions, and promoting physical activity within community dwelling older individuals, have the potential to be significant factors in maintaining independence, as well as reducing highcost health care services. However, despite all being strongly related to adequate nutritional intake, research regarding how Meals on Wheels services could be best utilised to decrease risk of a decline in physical and mental health, cognitive functioning, functional disability and health care utilisation is missing to date.
This project will aim to investigate the consumption patterns of clients in terms of Meals on Wheels meals and other meals, as well as physical activity levels to enable a better understanding of the current recipients of Meals on Wheels. It will also aim to investigate whether a short term intervention focused on assisting the clients with meal ordering and food provision improves the clients physical and mental health.</summary>
