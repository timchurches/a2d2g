  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will inhale 4mL technetium-99m DTPA radioaerosol in two positions in random order throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes for each of the positioning regimens on two separte days:   1. Upright sitting: or 2. Alternate Side Lying: (alternated between left and right at each minute)
The two study days will have a minimum of 48 hours washout between them and not greater than 7 days (to ensure clinical stability).
After each nebulisation a gamma camera will perform a 20 minute deposition scan incorporating a 2 minute transmission scan to outline the three-dimensional margin of the lung fields. This data will be reconstructed to determine the distribution of the deposited radioaerosol in the lungs. A 15% improvement in uniformity of deposition is the proposed minimum difference that would make the alternate side lying strategy worthwhile in CF patient populations.</interventions>

      <outcome>The concentration of the dose in the apical regions compared to the concentration for the whole lung. The 3-dimensional map of the lung fields will be divided into unit volumes (voxels). The amount of radioactivity in each voxel will be calculated. The ratio of apical:non-apical deposition of radioactivity will be determined by the mean number of counts per voxel in the apical one third of the lung field divided by the mean number of counts per voxel in the basal two thirds of the lung field.</outcome>

Eligibility will then be confirmed with reference to the willing participantâ€™s clinic records. Once enrolled in the trial, each participant will be invited to attend the Department of Nuclear Medicine on two days separated by a washout day. Participants will then be randomised, by flipping a coin, to one of two positions:
1. Upright sitting: to be maintained throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes, or
2. Alternate Side Lying: to be alternated between left and right at each minute during the nebulisation period of 20 minutes. 
Participants will be requested to adopt this position and maintain a normal tidal breathing pattern during the subsequent standard study inhalation. When participants return for their second study day, they will adopt the other positioning regimen.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research question: To determine whether alternate side lying improves uniformity of deposition of an inhaled aerosol compared to upright sitting in participants with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Methods: Inclusion criteria: greater than or equal to 18 years of age, confirmed CF, stable lung function.
Participants will inhale a 4mL radioaerosol in two positions in random order throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes:   1. Upright sitting: or
	                        2. Alternate Side Lying: (alternated between left and right at each minute) 
After each nebulisation a gamma camera will perform a 20 minute deposition scan incorporating a 2 minute transmission scan to outline the three-dimensional margin of the lung fields. This data will be reconstructed to determine the distribution of the deposited radioaerosol in the lungs. A 15% improvement in uniformity of deposition is the proposed minimum difference that would make the alternate side lying strategy worthwhile in CF patient populations.

Significance of project: In many patient populations (for example, cystic fibrosis, HIV, asthma and bronchiectasis), the pattern of deposition of inhaled medication is poor and non-uniform. Typically the upper lobes receive a reduced dose compared to the rest of the lung. The ability to deliver a drug more uniformly to the lung using the simple strategy of side lying may have a significant impact on treatment efficacy, acceptability and compliance for people with lung disease.</summary>
