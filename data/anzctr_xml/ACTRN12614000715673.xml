    <interventions>The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefit of 
- two sub cutaneous injections of GnRH agonists (tryptorelin 0.1 mg) administred on the 4th day and on the 6th day following the introduction of progesterone
- In addition to usual progesterone supplementation (3 pills of 200 mg per day administred vaginally, 1 in the morning, 2 in the evening) 

The oestradiol supplementation was starded on the first day of the cycle : 
- From the first day to the 5th day of the cycle, they took 2 pills containing 2 mg of estradiol a day
-From the 6th to the 10th day of the cycle, they took 3 pills containing 2 mg of estradiol a day. 
- They then took 4 pills containing 2 mg of estradiol a day
until the pregnancy test.
Oestrogen was first administered orally, then vaginally, following menstruation. 

Test were performed on the 13th day (blood test and ultrasonography).

The progesterone was introduced when all conditions are met : The endometrium over 6 mm in thickness, pulsatility indexes below 3, and oestrogen levels above 750 pg/ml. 
If these conditions werent met, a 2nd test and up to a 3rd test were conducted, where oestrogen doses could be increased (increasing the dose to 5 or 6 pills a day). 

A pregnancy test (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) assay) was conducted 16 days after the introduction of progesterone. Patients continued to take oestrogen and progesterone during the first three months of the pregnancy if this test was positive. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome was the ongoing pregnacy rate. This was the number of pregnancies that continue beyond the first trimester obstetrical ultrasound, out of 100 Frozen Thawed Embryo Transfers. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The first trimester obstetrical ultrasound (around the 12th week on pregnancy)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome was the implantation rate. It was defined by the number of gestational sacs that contain embryos with cardiac activity, divided by the number of transferred embryos.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample-size calculation was based on the observed differences in pregnancy rate from existing literature in FIV/ICSI treatment. For a difference of 5% on ongoing pregnancy rate, for a power of 90% and an alpha of 5%, 90 women needed to be recruited into each arm. We estimated dropout rates to range between 10 and 20 %, so 220 women were randomized.
The SPSS 17.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to conduct a statistical analysis of the results. The discrete variables were compared using a Chi square test. Continuous quantitative variables were expressed as their average and standard deviation. They were compared using a t-test, a paired t-test or an analysis of variance, when 2 factors were being considered. Multivariate analyses were done using logistic regressions or decision tree hierarchical classifications with the CHAID method. A test was considered to be significant when p was less than 0.05. </statisticalmethods>
