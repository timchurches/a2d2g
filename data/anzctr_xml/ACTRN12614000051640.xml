    <interventions>EXERCISE INTERVENTION
The physical exercise intervention program will include a combination of resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 2 times per week in an exercise clinic. The intensity of the exercise will be moderate to high (i.e. a perceived exertion of somewhat hard to hard) and will be relative to each patients capabilities. The exercise prescription will be progressive and modified according to individual response. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. The exercise program will be implemented when patients are receiving chemotherapy. The length of the program will vary from 2.5 to 4 months according to the duration of the chemotherapy regime each patient is prescribed.</interventions>
    <comparator>USUAL CARE
The control group will maintain usual care throughout chemotherapy and for 3 months after the completion of chemotherapy treatment. Usual care involves standard medical treatment of breast cancer. Participants will then be offered participation in the physical exercise intervention program.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will determine if exercise reduces or even prevents cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join if you are a female aged 18 years and over and are scheduled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer with fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide- docetaxel (FEC-T) or docetaxel-cyclophosphamide (TC) regimens. Trial details. Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups  exercise or usual care. Participants in the exercise group will attend a supervised exercise program for the duration of chemotherapy treatment. The exercise program involves resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 2 times per week in an exercise clinic. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. Participant in the usual care group will maintain usual care throughout their chemotherapy treatment. These participants will be offered participation in the supervised exercise program at 3 months after the completion of chemotherapy. Assessments will be conducted at baseline (7-10 days before chemotherapy), post-chemotherapy (7-10 days after final chemotherapy administration) and follow-up (3 months post-chemotherapy).</summary>
