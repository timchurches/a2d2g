  <interventions>
    <interventions>After fasting overnight 16 Participants will be given 75g glucose to take orally, at a seperate visit they will be given 75g glucose intravenously. As a control these participants will be given water. Following each 5 blood samples will be taken over a 2 hour period. There will be at least one week between each treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Plasma inflammatory markers will be compared after oral glucose and Intravenous glucose with those measured after water (control).</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Other interventions</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma level of IL-6 will be measured at 5 points after the glucose and water are given.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These levels will be measured in blood samples taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will expand available information on the acute anti-inflammatory effect of insulin which may be important in limiting the inflammatory effect of food by measuring changes in plasma IL-6 levels.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Incretins are hormones that are produced in the intestine in response to food. The major increton is GLP-1 which directly stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin. The incretin effect is responsible for the greater insulin secretion seen after oral glucose intake compared to intravenous glucose. we postulate that after meal insulin changes are responsible for the reduction in circulating inflamatory marker IL-6 concentrations after an oral glucose tolerance test. If this is correct we believe that when the same amount of glucose is adminitered intravenously, due to a reduced insulin response, the after food decrease in IL-6 will be lessened.</summary>
