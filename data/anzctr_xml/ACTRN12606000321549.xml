  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TENS is a therapeutic non-invasive modality mainly used for pain relief by electrically stimulating nerves via skin surface electrodes. TENS with electrodes over the lower back have also been used successfully to treat the overactive bladder to improve frequency and urgency of urination in patients.
The association of treatment for faecal incontinence and urinary incontinence is evident in Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS). Based on clinical observation of effect of stimulation on the function of the anus and rectum in urology patients, SNS has been applied in patients with faecal incontinence. The concept is to enhance the activity of the anal muscles via the electrical stimulation of their nerve supply. The usefulness of SNS in faecal incontinence has been confirmed in a number of studies. However, SNS is an invasive procedure. It requires surgery under general anaesthesia to implant a permanent impulse generator under the skin. TENS with electrodes stimulating the same sacral nerves may result in similar benefits.
Our hypothesis is that the use of TENS in patients with faecal incontinence may have a therapeutic effect. The advantage of this technique is that it is non-invasive, simple, and cost-effective and has minimal side effects.</summary>
