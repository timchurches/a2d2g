    <interventions>One twenty-minute session of training walking to improve step length whilst concurrently performing cognitive tasks will be undertaken. Subjects will be asked to walk 25m repeatedly whilst concurrently performing cognitive tasks such as counting or word generation. Subjects undergoing variable-priority training will be instructed to vary the degree of attention paid to step length and the cognitive tasks, between trials.</interventions>

Subjects will be asked to walk 25m repeatedly whilst concurrently performing cognitive tasks such as counting or word generation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Difficulty performing more than one task at a time (dual tasking) is a common and disabling problem experienced by people with Parkinson disease (PD). If asked to perform another task when walking, people with PD have repeatedly shown markedly altered gait, such as taking shorter steps or walking more slowly. Currently there is uncertainty about whether clinicians should teach people with PD to avoid dual task performance or whether they should encourage them to practice dual-tasking with the hope that practice will lead to enhanced performance. This study will begin to investigate how to best retrain dual tasking by comparing two different ways to attend to the tasks trained.</summary>
