Active Comparator: Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy - 


Treatment: surgery: Laparoscopic Silastic Ring Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass
An isolated lesser curve-based gastric pouch will be created, with an antecolic antegastric Roux limb fashioned measuring 100 cm in length. The biliopancreatic limb will measure 50cm for all patients. A 6.5cm silastic ring will be placed above the gastrojejunostomy to prevent long term stomal dilatation.

Treatment: surgery: Laparoscopic Sleeve gastrectomy
Resection of the greater curvature of the stomach from the distal antrum (2cm proximal to pylorus) to the angle of His, using a laparoscopic stapling device over a 36Fr bougie, will be performed to create a lesser curve gastric sleeve

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are becoming increasingly common in New Zealand (NZ) and
      worldwide. Both are associated with a risk of early mortality (death). Whilst weight loss
      surgery is known to be effective for weight loss, current research suggests that it may also
      be effective in resolving T2DM in around 60-80% of patients, with some no longer requiring
      their medication. The mechanism for this remains unclear.

      Two main types of weight loss surgery are performed in NZ public hospitals, which include
      gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. The gastric bypass is a more complex procedure
      compared to the sleeve gastrectomy. Whilst both appear to be effective for weight loss (with
      most patients losing more than 60% of their excess weight), it is still not known which one
      is better for treating T2DM.

      This study will therefore compare which of these two surgical procedures is most effective at
      treating T2DM in obese patients, as well as comparing whether there are any differences in
      the amount of weight lost, side effects and quality of life.</summary>
