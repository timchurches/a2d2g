    <interventions>Motivational Interviewing. Maternal and child health (MCH) nurses in this condition will receive training in motivational interviewing over two, 5-6 hour interactive small group sessions. Training will be provided by a psychologist experienced in motivational interviewing and will cover the "Spirit", principles and core skills of motivational interviewing. MCH nurses will then deliver a brief motivational interviewing intervention (approximately 10 minutes) during their routine appointments with new mothers at 4-weeks, 8-weeks and 4-months postpartum. The MCH nurses will follow a detailed manual and will receive a supervision session by telephone around two weeks after the training sessions (approximately 20 minutes). The motivational interviewing intervention provides guidance for MCH nurses about the way to talk with mothers about how they are managing.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Around 30,000 women annually suffer from postnatal depression (PND) and untreated depression has negative long-term consequences for mothers and infants. Figures from previous research indicate that only 30-50% of women who are distressed in the perinatal period seek treatment. Currently, no effective, evidence-based strategy to enhance access to services exists. There is an urgent need to redress this and determine whether we can improve uptake of treatment by women experiencing PND. The aim of this study is to examine whether a brief motivational interviewing intervention delivered in the context of a routine postnatal screening and emotional health assessment improves access to treatment when women experience PND. The key concept is to prepare and motivate women to take action for their own emotional health needs in the year following childbirth. Motivational interviewing has shown enormous success in other fields of healthcare.</summary>
