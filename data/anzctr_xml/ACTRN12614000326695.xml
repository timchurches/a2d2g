  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study aims to seek evidence that RANKL blockade using the drug Denosumab can modify disease activity in Charcot Neuropathic Osteoarthropathy. The dose of Denosumab that will be administered is the same as current TGA approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and androgen deprived men.  The dose is 60 mg administered subcutaneously in a single, one off injection. Follow up will last for 12 months. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time from the first injection at which the temperature differential at the site of maximum deformity and maximum temperature on the affected foot or ankle becomes &lt; 2 degrees Celsius compared to the similar site on the contra-lateral foot or ankle, measured using an infrared thermometer. 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary endpoint of temperature difference is measured at screening, zero time (injection), one week, two weeks, four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks, twelve weeks, fourteen weeks, sixteen weeks, twenty weeks, twenty two weeks, six months, nine months and twelve months. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease activity will be measured by the appropriate inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP TNF-alpha, IL-6), bone turn over markers (serum CTX, P1NP, urine: CTX: creatinine ratio and DPD: creatinine ratio) and evidence of stability of radiological findings on plain x-ray.  

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Inflammatory marker data for ESR and CRP will be captured at screening, week 2,3,5,7,9,11,14,15.

Bone turnover marker data will be captured at weeks 2,5,9.

Radiological examinations of bilateral feet (plain x-ray) will be taken at the screening visit, 6 months and 12 months.</timepoint>

NB: Patients with known PVD and who have undergone successful revascularization as determined by clinical history PLUS palpable pulses PLUS bi- or tri -phasic Doppler wave forms are NOT excluded.
4. Foot ulceration &gt; Texas classification 1A
NB: A foot ulcer with Texas classification grade 1A has met inclusion criteria in previous studies of acute CN.
5. Cellulitis and/or osteomyelitis of the affected foot (clinically and/or radiologically proven)
6. Previous midfoot or proximal to mid foot amputation 
7. Hypocalcaemia (Serum Calcium &lt;2.1 mmol/L)

*Within 3 months of a tooth extraction, dental implants or mandibular surgery 
*Within 6 months of planned tooth extraction, dental implants or mandibular surgery
*Presence of multiple (more than 3) dental caries 
NB:  Previous dental clearance and the use of a dental plate(s) are NOT contra-indication for enrollment
NB: This is because osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in patients treated with Denosumab.
11. Renal failure (serum creatinine &gt;200 mmol/L or eGFR&lt; 30 ml/min). 
12. Active or chronic liver disease 
*Chronic liver disease is defined as clinical history of decompensated chronic liver disease (ascites, encephalopathy or variceal bleeding)
*Acute Liver disease is defined as an INR of 1.5 (in the absence of the use of Warfarin) and AST and ALT 2xULN
13. History of decompensated congestive heart failure
14. History of inflammatory arthopathies (rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune arthopathy) 
15. History of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohns disease, Ulcerative Colits, other inflammatory colitis)
16. Any history of treatment with Denosumab within the last 12 months.

    <statisticalmethods>36 partcipants will be enrolled into this pilot study. The study is a necessary precursor to an adequately powered randomized placebo-controlled study of Denosumab in active CN, as it will establish the sample size and feasibility of such a study.

The changes in temperature and inflammatory markers will be collected.

Descriptive statistics will be calculated appropriate to the data.

Comparisons with results in the published literature will be made as appropriate.

All analyses will be done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to explore if the drug denosumab is effective at reducing bone loss in the feet/foot in participants with Diabetes Mellitus and Charcot Foot. Bone loss or Osteoponia as it is referred to medically is a recognised feature of Charcot foot. If the bone loss process can be prevented then this may stop the Charcot process in a much quicker time frame.</summary>
