  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive exercise trainings twice a week, lasting for 12 weeks in total. The exercise trainings will be delivered in a group of 6 to 8 participants by  a physiotherapist. Gyrokinesis classes are 60-90 minutes long. Each class begins on a chair with a gentle warm up sequence to awaken the senses, and stimulate the nervous system. This is followed by a series of fluid spinal motions which increase range of motion, and prepare the body to explore more complex movements with agility, and ease. Class continues on the floor with exercises that expand on the spinal motions, gradually adding more complex sequences, incorporating more movements of the hips, shoulders, hands and feet. The floor exercises are followed by a rhythmic standing sequence that incorporates balance, and cardiovascular exercises.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercises have been recommended as a major intervention for managing faulty posture. Gyrokinesis is an exercise system comprising circular, fluid movements that, like yoga, pair breath with movement. Benefits of this form of exercise are purported to improve flexibility, muscle strength, and posture. However, its effects have not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of the study will be to investigate the effects of GYROKINESIS 'Registered Trademark' on posture and spinal mobility in adults with thoracic kyphosis posture.</summary>
