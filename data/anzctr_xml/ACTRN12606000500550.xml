    <interventions>Intervention Group 
1) One-day interactive educational workshop consisting of lectures, small group work and discussion sessions. Content covered included an introduction to outcome measures, setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Activity based, Review, Time frame) goals, the outcome measurement process, strategies to successfully implement outcome measures, information on nine specific outcome measures relevant to people with cerebral palsy and autism and their carers, matching client limitations and outcome measures, and reporting outcome measure results and clinical decision making.  
2) Resource folder containing notes from lectures and small group and discussion activities. A summary and critique of the 9 outcome measures presented including information on developers, access to the measure, cost, copyright, a description of the measure, administration, scoring and interpretation, suitable populations, languages the measure has been published in, International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) level/s targetted by the measure, psychometric properties and references.  
3) 3 months of email and telephone follow-up support. All participants in the intervention group receceived 1 group email per week. The purpose of the email was to encourage clinicians to use outcome measures in their daily practise, provide additional information on outcome measures that may be of use to them. The researcher also responded to all individual emails and telephone calls received from participants in the intervention group.   </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group 
1) One-day interactive workshop on evidence based practice and critical appraisal. This consisted of lecture content, small group work, and discussion.
2) Printed handouts of lecture notes and critical appraisal guidelines and forms were given to participants.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Allied health professionals employed by The Spastic Centre of New South Wales who do not treat clients will be excluded from participating in this study. The reason for this being that participants must be in a position where they actively treat clients in order to be able to measure client progress and effectiveness of interventions using outcome measures.</exclusivecriteria>

    <designfeatures>1) The educator presenting the one-day workshop (primary researcher - JB) for the intervention group became aware of group allocation on the day of the workshop. The educator required access to the participants' contact details (work email and telephone numbers) for the follow up support program. 2) The participants were aware of their allocation a week prior to the one-day workshop. 3) Audit data collectors (two research assistants) were unaware of group allocation. 4) Audit forms (primary outcome measure) will be returned to the primary researcher (JB) in a sealed archive box to be given to the data entry person (blind to allocation). 5) The surveys (secondary outcome measure) were returned to the primary researcher (JB) identifiable only via allocation number in a sealed reply paid envelope. 6) Surveys (in the sealed envelopes) were then given to a person for data entry who was not aware of group allocation. 7) The primary researcher (JB) will be the data analyst. Participants will be identified on the database by allocation number only.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies have highlighted the need for better training of health professionals in outcome measurement, so that limited time and resources are spent on interventions that improve the health of the population.  Currently less than 30% of allied health professionals routinely use outcome measures in practice. Fewer still use reliable, published measures.  The primary aim of this study is to:
Determine the effectiveness of a one-day interactive educational workshop, with printed educational materials and 3 months email and telephone follow-up support on the use of outcome measures by allied health professionals. All allied health professionals (N=121) employed by The Spastic Centre of New South Wales were invited to participate in the study. The study assessed changes in outcome measurement behaviour, knowledge and skills at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.</summary>
