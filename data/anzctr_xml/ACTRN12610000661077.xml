    <studytitle>Measurement and evaluation of thiamine concentrations in the blood of Australians who have a history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition(DSM IV) alcohol dependence or abuse, after 20 years of supplementing flour with thiamine.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Among Australians who have Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition(DSM IV) alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse, has thiamine supplementation of  flour resulted in higher median serum thiamine concentrations than the normal population median reference range thus achieving the planned outcome of reducing the risk of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in Australians.</scientifictitle>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study is to determine the concentrations of thiamine in blood taken from a sample of Australians who have had alcohol related motor vehicle offences.  These measurements will allow an estimation of the prevalence of thiamine deficiency in this sample.  Given flour has been supplemented with thiamine in Australia for twenty years a secondary aim is to evaluate whether this public health intervention has prevented thiamine deficiency in the main target group (chronic alcohol misusing persons).</summary>
