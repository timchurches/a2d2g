  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will test a non-curricular intervention designed to increase the amount of physical activity that children amass during recess and lunch breaks, the social support children receive to be physically active, teacher confidence and commitment to delivering physically active lessons, and the related impact this has on students on-task behaviour in classes after breaks. 

The intervention will contain four components, and be run over a single term as part of the study (two schools will run the intervention in Terms 2, 3 and 4).; 
1) The addition of permanent multi-coloured playground markings at each school. Markings are designed to encourage play, and will be developed in consultation with school staff, and students.
2) Teacher training on how to use these markings to promote physical activity and reducing bullying in the playground. Teachers will receive a face-to-face training session (1.5-2 hours), as well as being provided with access to online resources including activity downloads, webinars and discussion forums via peacefulplayground.com.au. The face-to-face training will be conducted with all participating teachers from a school, and run by Janice Atkin, an Education Consultant and director of Peaceful Playgrounds Australia.
Teacher attendance at the face-to-face training will be recorded, and their use of the online website monitored. 
3) The introduction of a student leadership program to promote physical activity within peer groups. Groups of Stage 3 students will be given training on how to promote and encourage physical activity during lunch and recess for their peers. Students will be nominated by schools, and it is expected they will select house captains, or school captains (approx. 4-8 students at each school). Teachers will be provided a teacher Facilitator Guide with a step-by-step process for training the student leaders. Each student will receive a PAL Playbook, which is a learning journal for them to record their development and action plan for the program. This component of the intervention will be monitored by the teachers who are trained through the intervention. 
4) A suite of resources for teachers to use for setting up games during recess and lunch breaks. These will be provided as a printed resources for each school, as well as made available online via the Peaceful Playgrounds website. Resources include a folder of games that can be played with the schools chosen markings, guides for teachers to delivery physical activity lessons, information on teaching fundamental movement skills, and social skills such as conflict resolution, and DVDs for teachers who want refresher training, or new teachers on how to direct activities.

The observations of playgrounds during lunch and recess will also record teacher behaviours, and the use of equipment, so provide some indication of training adherence. The survey delivered to find sources of encouragement for students to by physically active should also show whether teachers are using the resources and strategies provided through the intervention if the levels of support increase after implementation.
As there will be relatively small numbers of teachers and students participating directly in the intervention, the research team will plan regular communications to reduce attrition and monitor adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>A stepped wedge CT design has been chosen for this study as the effects of the intervention can be queried in detail with analysis done to determine the overall effectiveness of the intervention by comparison of data sets in the control section of the wedge with those in the intervention section. The cohorts that receive the intervention in each period will be randomised.

The control group will be the schools who do not receive the intervention during the period, however by the end of the study, all schools will have received the intervention.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations were conducted to determine the sample size and number of observations required to detect changes in students physical activity levels, their on-task behaviour and where encouragement to be physically active came from. Calculations assumed baseline-post test expected effect size gains of d = 0.4/r = 0.19 and were based on 80% power, with alpha levels set at p &lt; 0.05. Using the standard deviation (SD) of change of SD = .5.

6 schools will be required fort he study, and all students at these schools observed for the physical activity levels (~.2500 students) All of the stage 3 students (years 5 and 6, ~ 800) will be given the physical activity survey about social support, and only 5 students from each school are needed for observations about behaviour during class using the BOSS software.

Using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, v21), descriptive statistics and measures of central tendency will be used to describe the effect of the intervention from baseline to follow-up data in the different groups. 

Analyses involving percentage of occurrence (i.e. frequency) data will be analysed using x2. To analyse sex and period differences in activity variables, a series of 2 x 2 (sex by period) mixed-model ANCOVAs in SPSS will be computed. Each mixed model will be fitted to the data using the restricted maximum likelihood method. For each mixed model, gender will be included as fixed effects, with the school included as a random effect to account for the effects of stepping by school.

For analyses involving school level characteristics of physical activity, the unit of analysis will be one scan of one area. For all other variables the unit of analysis will be a gender and period specific daily summary of each school, with the exception of summary school-level variables (e.g. total play space per school), where school will be the unit of analysis. To compute gender and period specific daily summaries for each school and physical activity levels based on the three observation days for each school will be analysed. Using these scores, outcome variables will be computed by aggregating counts across activity areas separately by sex and period for each school. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This HAPPY Study aims to examine the relationship between physical activity and on-task behaviour in primary school students, and to understand the environmental and societal factors that encourage physical activity in primary school students. 

To do this, an intervention will be developed and implemented, to increase physical activity, and enhance the social support provided to student, encouraging them to be physically active in schools. This study will aim to address physical activity levels in students, behavioural and psychological well-being in students, and how effective the intervention used is.

In order to demonstrate how increased physical activity during school time can lead to improved on-task behaviour in primary school students, a study is required that measures both physical activity levels in students, and their behaviour in classes following this physical activity. Physical activity data will be collected before, during, and after the intervention to measure the impact that environmental modifications, social support and teacher training has on physical activity levels. This data will be analysed in relation to behavioural and on-task behaviour, collected through a survey and direct observations in class time following breaks. Comparison of these data sets should allow for any trends between physical activity, and psychological well-being in students identified and explored.

 This study will provide unique insight in how schools might address the educative and public health nexus of physical activity is a cost effective and sustainable way. The study will measure the effectiveness of an intervention, it's efficacy and scalability.
