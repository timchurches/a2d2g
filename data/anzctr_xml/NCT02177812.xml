    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK2879552

Experimental: Dose Escalation Phase (Part 1) - The safety and PK/PD data will be reviewed prior to the dose decision, and the dose escalation will be guided by the Neuenschwander -continuous reassessment method (N-CRM).The dose escalation will complete when RP2D is determined. The RP2D will be the MTD or a lower dose that provides adequate PK exposure and biologic activity with superior tolerability.

Experimental: Expansion Phase (Part 2) - Once the MTD and/or RP2D has been determined in Part 1, an expansion cohort of up to 30 subjects will be enrolled in order to characterize the clinical activity and safety profile of the RP2D. Subjects may continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.


Treatment: drugs: GSK2879552
GSK2879552 capsules contain 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg of GSK2879552 as parent. The initial dosing regimen will be continuous oral daily dosing.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a phase I, open-label study to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and
      regimen for the orally administered lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor
      GSK2879552. The recommended dose and regimen will be selected based on the safety,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles observed after the treatment of
      subjects with relapsed/refractory AML. The study consists of two parts. Part 1 will identify
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D using a dose-escalation procedure. Dose
      escalations will be guided by the Neuenschwander-continual reassessment method (N-CRM). PK/PD
      expansion cohorts will also be included in Part 1 to characterize the range of biologically
      effective doses by assessing PD markers and obtain additional PK data. Part 2 will explore
      further the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of GSK2879552 at the RP2D in subjects
      with AML.</summary>
