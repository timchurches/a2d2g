      <outcome>Development of HIV-1 Drug Resistance Through Week 96, All Participants - Participants who experienced either suboptimal virologic response or virologic rebound were considered to have virologic failure and were analyzed for resistance. Suboptimal virologic response was assessed at Week 8 and was defined as having HIV-1 RNA = 50 copies/mL and &lt; 1-log10 reduction from baseline at the Week 8 visit, which was confirmed at the subsequent visit. Virologic rebound was defined as having 2 consecutive visits with HIV-1 RNA = 400 copies/mL after achieving HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL, or as having 2 consecutive visits with &gt; 1 log10 increase in HIV-1 RNA from their nadir. In addition, subjects who were on study drugs, had not been analyzed previously, and who had HIV-1 RNA = 400 copies/mL at Week 48, Week 96, or their last visit (at or after Week 8) were also analyzed for resistance at their last visit. Subsequent to the first resistance testing, subjects experiencing repeated confirmed virologic failure were assessed for resistance retesting on a case-by-case basis.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the emtricitabine
      (FTC)/rilpivirine (RPV)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) single-tablet regimen (STR)
      compared with the efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF STR in HIV-1 infected adults who had not previously
      received treatment with antiretroviral medications.

      Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the study treatments.
      Randomization was stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (= 100,000 copies/mL or &gt; 100,000 copies/mL)
      at screening. A treatment duration of 96 weeks was planned, with the option for subjects in
      FTC/RPV/TDF STR arm to receive treatment following the Week 96 visit until FTC/RPV/TDF STR is
      commercially available or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate development in that
      country.</summary>
