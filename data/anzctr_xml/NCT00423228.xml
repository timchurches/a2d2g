Experimental: ZT-1 - ZT-1 (investigational product)

Active Comparator: Donepezil - Donepezil


Treatment: drugs: ZT-1
Patients in the ZT-1 treatment group will receive ZT 1-1 mg capsules administered p.o. daily during the first month of treatment, followed by ZT-1 implants (9 mg) administered s.c. during the second month of treatment, followed by ZT-1 implants (12 mg) administered s.c. every 4 weeks during months 3 to 6 of treatment. Patients in the ZT-1 treatment group will receive dummy donepezil capsules during months 2 to 6 of the treatment period.

Treatment: drugs: Donepezil
Patients in the donepezil treatment group will receive donepezil 5 mg capsules administered p.o. during the first month of treatment, followed by donepezil 10 mg/day during months 2 to 6 of the treatment period. Patients in the donepezil treatment group will also receive s.c. injections of dummy ZT 1 implants every 4 weeks during months 2 to 6 of the treatment period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alzheimer's disease is characterised by memory loss and difficulties with thinking. These
      problems may be due to a deficiency in a brain chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
      helps transmit messages between nerve cells. Acetylcholine is degraded by an enzyme called
      "acetylcholinesterase". ZT-1 is a new drug derived from a plant extract already used in China
      for memory disorders, which blocks the action of the enzyme and restores adequate levels of
      acetylcholine.

      This study will test the safety and efficacy of ZT-1 in the treatment of patients with
      Alzheimer's disease.
