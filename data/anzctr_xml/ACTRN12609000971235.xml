  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention group will take part in an 8-week personalised physical activity program. The type (e.g. aerobic, resistance or flexibility), and intensity of the sessions will be tailored to the fitness level and preferences of the individual participant.
The physical activity sessions are for 1 hour / week for 8 weeks and also include a behavioural support session.
The behavioural support sessions include topics such as goal setting, plainng, motivation and time management.
The physical activity sessions are conducted face-to-face with an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist. They can be one-on-one or in a small group, depending on the preference of the participant.
The behavioural sessions can be either face-to-face or over the phone with a member of the research team.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group will receive standard of care treatment for their condition. They will be assessed at the same time points as the intervention group (i.e Baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the impact of physical activity on fatigue and quality of life in people with thoracic lung cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you have invasive thoracic cancer which is not suitable for surgical removal. 

Trial details: 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group (the control group) will receive standard care for 6 months. The other group will take part in a physical activity program, with behavioural support for 8 weeks in addition to standard care. Study aims: To compare self-reported fatigue levels and quality of life in the two groups to determine the effects of exercise.</summary>
