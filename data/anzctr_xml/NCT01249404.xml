  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the MAS Score in the Gastrocnemius-soleus Complex (GSC) (Knee Extended) - Muscle tone in the treated limb was assessed by MAS in the GSC (with the knee extended) at baseline, at Weeks 1, 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24, and at end of study. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM)), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. The mean change from baseline at Week 4 is reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Week 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physician's Global Assesment (PGA) of Treatment Response at Week 4 - An assessment of overall treatment response was conducted at Weeks 4 and 12, and discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study by an investigator who had not assessed the MAS. The investigator rated the response to treatment in the subject's lower limb after injection of Dysport® relative to the status at the baseline. Answers were made on a 9 point rating scale: -4=markedly worse, -3=much worse, -2=worse, -1=slightly worse, 0=no change, +1=slightly improved, +2=improved, +3=much improved, +4=markedly improved. The mean PGA score at Week 4 is reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Week 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Comfortable Barefoot Walking Speed - Comfortable walking speed was assessed as a measure of functional ability and gait over 10 metres. Evaluations were made barefoot, without walking aids, at baseline and Weeks 1, 4 and 12 and discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 and at end of study. The mean change from baseline at Week 4 is reported.</outcome>
