  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study has been divided into four parts as described below. Part A: Single blind, randomised, multi dose-level study to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of orally inhaled nicotine via the Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler pack at three doses of nicotine  low, medium and high. Two single different dose levels of nicotine will be inhaled using the device on a single study day, approximately 6 hrs apart. Part A High dose is 0.084% w/w Nicotine, Medium dose is 0.056% w/w Nicotine, Low dose is 0.028% w/w Nicotine. Part B:Open label/single blind, randomised, 3-way crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of two dose levels of the Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler pack in comparison to the Nicorette (Registered Trademark) Inhaler. Two single different dose levels of nicotine will be inhaled using the Oxette device and one single dose level of nicotine will be inhaled using the Nicorette device over 3 days. One dose will be inhaled per day. There will be approximately 18hr break before moving to the next dose. The 2 dose levels will be determined based on the data obtained from Part A. Part C: Open label study to evaluate the tolerability and venous pharmacokinetics of repeat doses of orally inhaled nicotine via the Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler system at one dose level of nicotine. One dose level of nicotine will be inhaled using the Oxette device twelve times a day for one day. The dose level will be determined based on the data obtained from Parts A and B. Subjects will only participate in one of the three parts. The Oxette Inhaler pack and the Nicorette Inhaler differ in appearance and formulation of the nicotine. The devices used to inhale the nicotine also differ in appearance and functionality. Part D: Open label, randomised, 2-way crossover study to determine the venous pharmacokinetics of orally inhaled nicotine at the medium dose level (0.056%w/w) delivered via the Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler device in comparison to the Nicorette (Registered Trademark) Inhaler (10mg).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how safe and tolerable the Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler Pack is. This includes the device and how the nicotine is absorbed into your body and the levels of nicotine in your blood. The study is also looking to compare the Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler Pack against the Nicorette (Registered Trademark) Inhaler (this product is approved and readily available as a stop smoking aid), to see how the levels of nicotine in your blood from each product compare. This study consists of 4 different parts. PART A: A total of 18 participants. Will receive 2 different doses of nicotine on one single day. PART B: A total of 24 participants. Will receive 2 different dose levels of nicotine over three separate days. PART C: A total of 18 participants. Will all receive the same single dose level of nicotine every hour for 12 hours. Part D: A total of 24 participants. Will attend the clinical trial unit on two consecutive days and will be randomised to receive one complete refill of Oxette (Registered Trademark) Nicotine Inhaler device at the medium dose level of nicotine (0.056%w/w) on one day, and one treatment of Nicorette (Registered Trademark) Inhaler (10mg) on another day in random order.</summary>
