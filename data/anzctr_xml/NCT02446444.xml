  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Men with localised prostate cancer at high risk for recurrence deemed suitable for external
        beam radiation therapy.

        

          1. Pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, judged to be at high risk
             for recurrence based on any of the following (in accordance with the International
             Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus 2005:

             Gleason score 8-10 OR Gleason score of 4+3 AND clinical T2b-4 AND PSA &gt;20ng/mL OR N1
             disease (involvement of lymph nodes at or below the bifurcation of the common iliac
             arteries) defined radiologically as greater than 10mm on short axis using standard CT
             or MRI, or biopsy proven

          2. Age =18 years

          3. Adequate bone marrow function Haemoglobin (Hb) =100g/L and White Cell Count (WCC) =
             4.0 x 109/L and platelets =100 x 109/L

          4. Adequate liver function: Alanine transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2 x ULN and bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x
             Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), (or if bilirubin is between 1.5 - 2 x ULN, they must have
             a normal conjugated bilirubin).

          5. Adequate renal function: calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 ml/min (Cockcroft-Gault)

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

          7. Study treatment both planned and able to start within 7 days of randomisation.

          8. Willing and able to comply with all study requirements, including treatment, and
             attending required assessments

          9. Has completed the baseline HRQOL questionnaires UNLESS is unable to complete because
             of literacy or limited vision

         10. Signed, written, informed consent</inclusivecriteria>

          2. Involvement of lymph nodes superior to the common iliac bifurcation, and/or outside
             the pelvis (distant lymph nodes). Lymph node involvement is defined by
             histopathological confirmation, or by a short axis measurement &gt;10mm on standard
             imaging (CT or MRI, but not PET).

          3. Any contraindication to external beam radiotherapy

          4. History of

               -  seizure or any condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior cortical
                  stroke or significant brain trauma).

               -  loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of

             / Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Whole Body Bone Scan (WBBS). If equivocal bone
             scan, follow-up plain films are required to show NO evidence of cancer if not covered
             by CT/MRI

          6. PSA &gt; 100 ng/mL

             except in the following setting:

               -  Use of LHRHA (with or without anti-androgens) for less than 30 days prior to
                  randomisation in the trial.

         12. Bilateral orchidectomy or radical prostatectomy

         13. Prior brachytherapy or other radiotherapy that would result in an overlap of
             radiotherapy fields

         14. Participation in other clinical trials of investigational agents for the treatment of
             prostate cancer or other diseases.
