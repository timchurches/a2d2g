  <interventions>
    <interventions>Baseline assessment - finger prick samples to measure blood profile markers. 12-lead ECG exercise stress test, to sub-maximal exhaustion (8mins) and images of the carotid artery via a pulsecor.

Exercise Intervention - 12 weeks, 40mins x 2 p/wk	

ARM 1
Aerobic - 40mins of aerobic exercise -Starting at 75% HRR with an increment of 10% every 4th week i.e. 75%, 85%. 95% HRR. Protocol = interval training  1min exercise; 15secs rest. Completed on treadmill or stationery ergometer.
 ARM 2	
Resistance - 40mins of circuit-resistance exercise  Starting at 75% HRR with an increment of 10% every 4th week i.e. 75%, 85%. 95% HRR. Protocol = interval training  1min exercise; 15secs rest of 8 exercises (upper and lower body) x 4 sets 
 ARM 3	
12-weeks of Nutritional education and group sessions, 2 x 45-60mins p/wk, will be undertaken at Wellington Hospital or other identified location for cooking demonstrations by dieticians. The nutritional guidance will be based on a whole foods plant based diet. Patients will be educated on the benefits of such a diet in regards to vascular risk factor control and reversal of atherosclerosis. Continued sessions will also concentrate on how to achieve this type of diet through group sessions and cooking demonstrations

Strategies to improve adherence:

Exercising in a group setting
Clinical Exercise Physiologists present at each exercise session to help monitor and ensure safety of participants </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group - usual care that is delivered by Wellington Hospital/DHB. This compromises of standard home -based rehabilitation if the stroke is severe, or an information pack containing different public resources available to the patient.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Two composite primary outcomes:

Aterial stiffness/compliance of carotid artery - 

Using ultrasonography and pulse wave analysis (thickness of interior walls, and carotid blood velocity) - improvement would be recorded as greater then baseline assessment.

Central blood pressure - Sysytolic blood pressure decrease of 5mmHg

      <outcome>Vascular risk factors as assessed by finger prick blood sample measures, significant if there is a decrease in blood profile markers: total cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoproteins [HDL], low density lipoproteins [LDL], triglycerides [TG], TC:HDL ratio, fasting blood glucose (FBG)</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be randomized on completion of the aforementioned baseline assessments. Participants will be randomly assigned using simple randomisation procedures (computerized random numbers; http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm) to either:

i)	a 12 week aerobic exercise programme 
ii)	a 12 week resistance exercise programme 
iii)	Usual care control (CON) group
iv)	Nutrition group 
	

Details of the allocated group will be given on a piece of paper contained within sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes. The randomisation procedures will be prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. Although participants and the health and exercise practitioners will be aware of the allocated treatment condition, outcome assessors and data analysts will be kept blinded to the allocation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of chronic disability in many developed countries, causing both physical and cognitive impairments. Research strongly suggests that exercise rehabilitation can help with these impairments. However, on closer inspection, it is evident that there is little clear consensus on what type of exercise (aerobic or resistance) results in attenuating vascular risk factors to the greatest degree. As such, there is limited evidence available to help guide best practice. In the acute and subacute phase of stroke care, getting the balance right between diagnosis,
the start of therapies, medical interventions and exercise rehabilitation can be challenging. Improving our understanding of the impact of exercise and nutrition interventions on vascular and functional restoration should be
a priority. 

The purpose of this research study is therefore to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, the combination and nutrition (following stroke diagnosis) on vascular risk factors and arterial stiffness in newly diagnosed non- disabling stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. 

It is hypothesized that participation in a 12 week aerobic exercise program will Lead to significantly greater changes then:

Resistance exercise alone
Combination of resistance and aerobic exercise
Usual care control group
Nutrition group
