  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatment as usual (TAU) is thought to contribute to the long-standing nature of borderline personality disorder. There is increasing evidence that structured programmes of care, organised around a consistent model of care such as Mentalization Based Treatment, and delivered over the longer-term, are beneficial in reducing self-harm and suicidality; and in reducing service demand and health costs. Additionally, there is evidence that intensive treatment packages produce additional improvements in the long-term. A new MBT service for clients with BPD is introduced in Christchurch. This study will attempt to establish the benefits of investing in a specific treatment approach over more general enhancements to case managment. This comparison will also contribute to the clinical knowledge concerning the efficacy of this treatment approach in real-world scenarios.</summary>
