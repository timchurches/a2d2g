  <interventions>
    <interventions>Isocaloric diet with 5 serves vegetables per day for 12 months.   Participants will be advised on a diet plan in terms of the amounts and types of food groups as outlined in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.  Energy requirements will not be specifically restricted but energy dense nutrient poor foods will be excluded (cakes, biscuits, soft drinks) and this will likely reduce energy intake, that is, the energy value of the trial dietary patterns is likey to be reduced with this dietary advice strategy. Initial dietary counselling sessions one on one with the dietitian will take one hour and follow up sessions at month 1,2,3, 6, 9, 12 will take 30 minutes.  Between visits, SMS messages and emails will be sent fortnightly to provde behavioural support.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control arm will receive the same level of intervention and background dietary advice as the intervention group, but vegetables will not be emphasised in reference to food groups and the portion sizes of the vegetable categories for the intervention group will be twice that indicated  in the educational material for the control group. Additional material will be provided to the intervention group on how to incorporate vegetables into meals and recipes.  It is anticipated the control group will eat half the amount of vegetables than the intervention group.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be drawn from the general public through media advertisements, emails and through flyers.  Volunteers will complete a screening questionnaire to confirm eligibility and will attend an initial assessment session.  Dietitians who collect dietary data will be different to those who give dietary advice.  It will not be possible to blind the dietitians but the participants iwll not be informed as to their diet group allocation.

Randomization will be performed by a single researcher who will be independent to the participant interface.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test whether a higher intake of vegetables is more beneficial for weight loss than a lower intake of vegetables.  We hypothesise that those in the intervention group will have a better anti-loxidant staus, will lose more weight, show greater improvements in risk factors associated with over weight, will demonstrate greater perceptions of satiety and will report a greater acceptability for vegetable consumption.</summary>
