  <interventions>
    <interventions>The pharmacist in pre-admission clinic will generate the inpatient medication chart to reflect the patient's regular medication, plan for medication peri-operatively and also prescribe venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in clinic according to agreed local and national guidelines.
The intervention will occur on a daily basis for a number of patients attending pre-admission clinic, and will run for approximately 6 months or until 360 patients are recruited.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control arm will be usual care, that is the surgical resident medical officers will be responsible for the generation of the inpatient medication chart and prescribing of VTE prophylaxis.
The intervention will run for 6 months, or until 360 patients are recruited</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The quality of medication charts generated within clinic, with regards to concordance of the medication chart with the medication history.
Charts will be audited by one pharmacist and one nurse as per standard protocol for Queensland Health inpatient chart audits, comparing medication histories taken by the pharmacist and validated on the ward against the medication chart written up at the time of clinic appointment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured for individual patients on ongoing basis throughout trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The quality of medication charts generated within clinic, with regards to concordance of the medication chart with the plan given to the patient for their medications prei-operatively
Scanned copies of medication charts and patient notes from an equal number of intervention and control patients will be assessed by an independent, multidisciplinary panel consisting of anaesthetists, surgeons, pharmacists and nurses. The panel will assess the appropriateness of care in a selection of Pre-Admission Clinic patients.
This includes all medications continued, withheld, substituted, dose adjusted and initiated
Accuracy of the medication chart to reflect the plan for medications will be assessed by a retrospective audit of medication charts written at the time of clinic by one nurse and one pharmacist as per standard protocol for inpatient medication chart audits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured for individual patients on ongoing basis throughout trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The quality of medication charts generated within clinic, with regards to the quality of the individual orders with regards to legality and safety for medication administration purposes
Charts will be audited by one pharmacist and one nurse as per standard protocol for Queensland Health inpatient chart audits, using the standard national inpatient medication chart audit tool</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured for individual patients on ongoing basis throughout trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The appropriateness of prescribing of medications and devices for VTE prophylaxis according to agreed local and national guidelines.
Appropriateness of VTE prophylaxis prescribing will be evaluated via a retrospective chart audit by the Clinical Nurse Consultant for VTE prevention at Princess Alexandra Hospital.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Retrospectively at end of trial</timepoint>
