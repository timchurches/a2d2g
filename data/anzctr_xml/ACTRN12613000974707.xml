  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study drug is a topical SM04554 solution. SM04554 is a small molecule that may activate the wnt pathway. The dosage amounts are: 0.05%; 0.15%; and 0.45%. Administration of the study drug will be once daily for 14 days at the study clinic; study drug is applied topically to the scalp. There are three cohorts of 10 participants. Cohort 1 will be administered the 0.05% solution, Cohort 2 will be administered the 0.15% solution and Cohort 3 will be administered the 0.45% solution. Participants will complete a series of tests prior to the start of the study. During the study the participants scalp will be assessed by the study doctor on a daily basis and prior to administration of the study drug. Hair growth assessments will also be completed by the study doctor and the participant 1 day following the completion of the treatment and 14 days following completion of the treatment.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> 
To characterize the safety and tolerability of topical SM04554 solution (0.05%, 0.15% and 0.45%) applied to the scalp of male subjects with Androgenetic Alopecia. This is assessed by the following:
1. Collection of adverse events following the first administration of the study drug and up until Day 28 (14 days post the final administration of the study drug);
2. Non fasting clinical laboratory analysis of Chemistry, Haematology and urinalysis during the screening visit and on the 14th  day of treatment and 14 days following the end of the treatment;
3. Collection of Vital Signs each day of treatment;
4. Daily assessment of the participants scalp each day prior to treatment.
5. ECG at screening, Day 1 and Day 14, prior to treatment and 4 hours after treatment.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to Day 14.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of topical SM04554 solution (0.05%, 0.15%, 0.45%) applied to the scalp of male subjects with AGA
</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK samples will be taken on Day 1 and 2 and on Day 14 and 15 at the following timepoints:
Pre dose; and at 1,2,4,6,9,12 and 24 hours post dose.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess hair growth and quality based upon questionnaires completed by the physician and subject.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Hair growth will be assessed by the PI using an 'Investigator assessment scale' at Day 15 and Day 28.
Hair growth will be assessed by the subject using a 'subject assessment of hair growth' questionnaire at Day 15 and Day 28. Scalp photography will be taken prior to study drug administration and then again at Day 15 and 28.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Subjects will attend a screening visit. If they meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria then they will be deemed by the investigator to be eligible to enter the study. The investigator and study staff with the exception of the pharmacist are blinded to the study treatment. A randomisation list computer generated and is provided by the sponsor to the pharmacist who is unblinded. Blinded study personnel will assign subject number sequentially.</concealment>
