  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the study is to evaluate an alternative model of care using a nurse practitioner for patients presenting to emergency departments with minor conditions. The hypothesis is that patients with minor conditions seen initially by nurse practitioners are more satisfied with their care compared to those seen initially by an emergency department doctor. The hypothesis will be tested using a randomised controlled trial study design.</summary>
