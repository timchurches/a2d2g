    <interventions>Pregnancies undergoing prenatal microdeletion screening - Pregnant women undergoing non-invasive prenatal screening for microdeletion and aneuploidy syndromes.
No drug will be administrated, this cohort will undergo a non invasive prenatal blood test and then follow up data and specimens will be collected for research analysis.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>22q11.2 Snp-based non-invasive prenatal screening test performance, including positive predictive value (PPV), specificity, and sensitivity - To determine in a prospective study the performance of SNP based NIPT for the 22q11.2 microdeletion (DiGeorge syndrome) in a large cohort of pregnant women clinically opting for this form of screening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Combined microdeletion syndrome screening test performance - Determine the test performance (PPV, specificity) of SNP based NIPT for detecting other microdeletion syndromes available in the Panorama microdeletion panel (e.g., 1p36 deletion, Cri-du-chat, Prader-Willi, and Angelman) individually and all combined (including 22q11.2). Given the incidences of &lt;1:5000, the confidence intervals are expected to be large.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>No call rate - Determine the failure ('no call') rate for the NATUS method for 22q11.2 detection, as well as for aneuploidy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Low fetal fraction aneuploidy risk refinement - Determine whether a more precise risk for aneuploidy can be generated in the setting of low fetal fraction by incorporating maternal BMI (adjusted fetal fraction percentile), or whether low fetal fraction is associated with specific ultrasound findings that may indicate aneuploidy (e.g. triploidy, trisomy 13 and 18).</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Placental mosaicism exploration - Perform detailed assessment of false positive aneuploidy samples to better understand sources of error, including placental studies to further refine issues surrounding mosaicism as NIPT represents circulating placental DNA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Placental complications exploration - Investigate any relationships between circulating placental DNA (fetal fraction) or other test parameters including potential genotypic markers, and outcomes related to abnormal placentation (including but not limited to preeclampsia, small for gestational age and morbidly adherent placenta).</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multi-center prospective observational study is designed to track birth outcomes and
      perinatal correlates to the Panorama prenatal screening test in the general population among
      ten thousand women who present clinically and elect Panorama microdeletion and aneuploidy
      screening as part of their routine care. The primary objective is to evaluate the performance
      of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-based Non Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) for
      22q11.2 microdeletion (DiGeorge syndrome) in this large cohort of pregnant women. This will
      be done by performing a review of perinatal medical records and obtaining biospecimens after
      birth to perform genetic diagnostic testing for 22q11.2 deletion. Results from the follow-up
      specimens will be compared to those obtained by the Panorama screening test to determine test
      performance. Specific test performance parameters will include: PPV, specificity, and
      sensitivity.</summary>
