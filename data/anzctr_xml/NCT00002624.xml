Experimental: Radiotherapy + surgery - Patients begin radiotherapy 2-8 weeks postoperatively. Patients with complete resection undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.6 weeks. Patients with incomplete resection undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6.6 weeks.
Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <summary>RATIONALE: Video-assisted surgery followed by radiation therapy may be an effective treatment
      in patients whose poor heart and lung function make them high risk for standard surgery.

      radiation therapy in treating patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer and poor heart
      and lung function.</summary>
