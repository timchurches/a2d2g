  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with quadriplegia will be supplied with a Mandibular Advancement Device (MAd or oral appliance) to wear every night during sleep for approximately 6 months. A MAd is modified mouth guard that gently pulls the lower jaw forward during sleep. This pulls the airway open and thus prevents the airway from collapsing and obstructing airflow.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a feasibility study and as such there is no comparator or control treatment</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Devices</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: That MAd is a feasible treatment for patients with quadriplegia and OSA, and will improve sleep-disordered breathing and its consequences, specifically neurobehavioural functioning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint:  at conclusion of treatment period (approximately 6 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: That MAd used in patients with quadriplegia and OSA will improve autonomic dysfunction as measured by a 4 day urinary output diary and 24 hour blood pressure monitoring.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: at conclusion of treatment period (approximately 6 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome 2: That MAd used in patients with quadriplegia and OSA will improve sleepiness and symptoms as measured by the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: at conclusion of treatment period (approximately 6 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 3: That MAd used in patients with quadriplegia and OSA will improve quality of life as measured by the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: at conclusion of treatment period 9approximately 6 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 4: That MAd used in patients with quadriplegia and OSA will improve depression and anxiety as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: at conclusion of treatment period (approximately 6 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
