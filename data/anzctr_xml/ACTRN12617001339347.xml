  <interventions>
    <interventions>Phase 1 - Pilot Study
Oral tablet lithium carbonate (750mg) or  fampridine (20mg) single dose, once daily for 7 days.
Results from Phase 1 will dictate whether participants will receive single or multiple dose regimens in Phase 2. The decision will be based on whether EEG changes are evident after single or multiple doses in Phase 1. The decision will be made by senior study personnel in consultation with the Principal Investigator.

Phase 2 - Single dose
Participants will receive 4 oral study treatments: placebo, lithium carbonate (750mg), fampridine (two of three possible doses of  10, 15 or 20mg; i.e.  10 and 15mg, 10 and 20mg, or 15 and 20mg). Each participant will receive only two of the three fampridine doses, with each combination received by 8 participants. Allocation to a fampridine dose regimen will be carried out by a computer generated random code. Single doses of one of the 4 treatments will be administered at start of each treatment week, with 6 days of no treatment in between doses.  

Phase 2 - Multiple Dose
Participants will receive 4 oral study treatments: placebo, lithium carbonate (750mg), fampridine (two of three possible doses of  10, 15 or 20mg; i.e.  10 and 15mg, 10 and 20mg, or 15 and 20mg). Each participant will receive only two of the three fampridine doses, with each combination received by 8 participants. Allocation to a fampridine dose regimen will be carried out by a computer generated random code. Daily doses of one of the 4 treatments will be administered for 7 days, with 7 days of no treatment in between doses. Dosing will occur days 1-7, 16-22, 30-36 and 43-47.   

Adherence will be monitored by checking participants' drug containers at the end of each dosing week, and also sending daily text messages to participants to remind them to take their study treatments. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lithium is the first line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), a disorder characterised by cyclic perturbations in mood, correlated with aberrant patterns of brain connectivity and rhythmicity in distributed brain networks. These patterns of activity, reflecting the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of constituent neurons, are dependent upon membrane ion channel function. BD is strongly associated with disturbances in genes responsible for ion channel expression, localisation and structure and can be treated with some antiepileptic drugs, acting directly on ion channels. Thus, ion channel dysfunction is strongly implicated in BD, however, lithium has had no known effect on ion channels.
Recently, we found that lithium selectively blocks a specific K+ current, the delay current (ID), found in several types of brain neuron. ID can influence action potential threshold and output timing, how inputs from different synaptic sources are integrated, and network synchrony and rhythmicity. Output timing (gating) and synchrony are important variables in brain network function, contributing to the formation and dissolution of functional brain networks over time. Modulation of ID, including by lithium, may influence patterns of connectivity and rhythmicity in the brain and could explain the effectiveness of lithium in BD.
We have found, additionally, that Fampridine (4AP), a prescription treatment for multiple sclerosis, blocks ID in cortical projection neurons in vitro. We therefore hypothesise, that Fampridine may act as an adjunctive or replacement therapy for lithium in BD. In order to assess this hypothesis, we aim to examine EEG recordings of infraslow (&lt;1Hz) network function of healthy volunteers in the presence of lithium, Fampridine and placebo control.

The specific objectives of the study are:
	To examine the early and late effects of dose (Fampridine) and dose timing of lithium and Fampridine on EEG changes in healthy volunteers.
	To evaluate the magnitude and duration of affective changes following administration of lithium, Fampridine or placebo in healthy volunteers. Blood testing will also show any associations of cognitive changes with levels of Li+ / Fampridine and its metabolites in the participants bloodstream.
