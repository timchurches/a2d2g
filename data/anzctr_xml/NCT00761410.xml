  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the P.F.C. Sigma RPF knee accommodates functional
      stability with a post-operative passive range of motion of greater than 125° of flexion and
      to demonstrate that the range of motion does not compromise the longevity of the implant.</summary>
