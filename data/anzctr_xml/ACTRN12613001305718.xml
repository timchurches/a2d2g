    <interventions>Patients having endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration are at risk of iatrogenic infections due to the procedure. Currently there are no firm guidelines as to whether antibiotics are required or if they are, what antibiotics should be used. There have been no studies focusing on Tazocin (tazobactam, piperacillin) at the time of endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA). We will include all cases of EUS FNA requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and follow up patients following discharge home to determine whether they develop acute or chronic infections. 

Observational study will be conducted determining the rates of sepsis following EUS FNA (single periprocedural dose IV tazocin or ciprofloxacin) on telephone follow up 1 year post-procedure</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endoscopic ultrasound can obtain fluid using a technique known as fine needle aspiration (FNA). This involves a needle entering a pancreatic cyst and sucking fluid out. However, this test risks introducing gut bacteria into a normally sterile space. As such antibiotics may be effective to prevent infections. We aim to test whether Tazocin or Ciprofloxacin if penicillin allergy is present, prevents infections or is associated with increased harm. </summary>

    <publicnotes>The use of IV tazocin/ ciprofloxacin is considered standard practice at Concord Hospital approved by the Endoscopy Unit. An audit was commenced with Ethics Approval to contact patients from 28 Sep 2012. Contacting patients was considered a low risk application and provided the necessary data of complications following the EUS FNA procedure. It is also part of an ongoing quality audit of EUS FNA by the department to ensure that even late complications are recorded. </publicnotes>
