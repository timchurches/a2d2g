  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is a multi-factorial disease, with a multi-disciplinary approach being advocated for diabetes treatment and the prevention of its complications. In Australia, diabetes is the most common cause of lower limb amputation after trauma. Diabetic foot ulcers are responsible for a substantial medical and financial burden on the Australian healthcare system with costs conservatively estimated to be as high as $45,000 per patient. Improved nutritional status and nutrition supplementation accelerate wound healing while inadequate nutrition prolongs wound healing. During wound healing non-essential amino acids, such as L-Arginine, becomes essential as it enhances a number of pathways involved in wound healing, protein metabolism, such as structural protein synthesis and collagen. Aim: To determine whether supplementation with L-Arginine will improve the healing of diabetic foot ulcers in a routine community based client education and management program conducted by medical and allied health professionals. Methods: This study is being designed as a double blinded RCT (treatment group: n=37+7, 4.5g L-arginine; control group n=19+7 placebo) for 12 weeks. Power calculations indicate 70 patients are required to provide adequate statistical power including anticipated attrition rate. The study will be conducted in a routine community based client education and management setting which includes health professionals (medical, podiatry, dietetic, diabetes educators) as part of a multi-disciplinary approach and holistic care for the client</summary>
