  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 month double blinded parallel randomised controlled trial with 2 arms: control (standard grain diet) and intervention (polyphenol-rich grain diet). All subjects are blinded to their control/intervention group status. Both control and intervention arms will attend the clinic at baseline, 1, 2, 3mo for a face-to-face session with an Accredited Practising Dietitian. Duration of sessions are upto 1.5h at baseline and 30-45 minutes for other visits. All subjects receive identical dietary advice, but the intervention group will receive polyphenol-rich cereal products (124.5mg gallic acid equivalents per 60g of cereal per day) and the control group will receive standard cereal products (75.6mg gallic acid equivalents per 60g of cereal). These polyphenols are the natural levels in the processed products. All diets are based on the core food groups outlined in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.  Prescribed energy intakes will be calculated to equate to individuals estimated energy requirements using the Schofield equation and applying a physical activity factor of 1.3. Cereals provided were modelled into the dietary prescription to achieve macronutrient intakes of approximately 50% energy from carbohydrates, 20% from protein and 30% from fat. Adherence to diets will be monitored using repeated 3-day food records at midpoint (6 weeks) and at 3 months, as well as through dietary interviews at 1mo, 2mo and 3 mo.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control cereal food products will be based on a wholegrain cereal different to the test products - equal in mass (60g) and with similar macronutrient profile and fibre content but with lower polyphenol levels (75.6mg gallic acid equivalents per 60g of cereal). Control participants will follow the same weight reduction diet as the intervention participants, but will receive standard cereal products as described.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Linear mixed model to allow partial datasets, incorporating all available data regardless of whether or not the subject completes the study. The planned contrasts are between the control and the intervention groups.
The sample size was chosen based on previous human intervention studies incorporating cereal/high fibre foods in hypo-caloric diets. Differences in weight loss were used as the primary outcome measure to establish power for the study. Based on a weight difference between groups of two kilograms at a power of 80%, 26 subjects per group (52 subjects in total) is required. However, assuming a drop-out rate of 15-20% commonly observed in these types of studies, the required sample target will be set at 30 subjects per group. Therefore, 60 subjects (men and women) will be randomised into a control and intervention group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate the effects of consuming whole grain foods, whilst following a weight reduction diet for 3 months, on body weight as well as indicators of disease including cholesterol levels, blood levels of insulin and glucose, blood pressure, inflammation markers and antioxidant measures. Therefore, this study is a very important step towards building evidence for specific whole grains as important foods in appetite control that may aid weight loss, as well as reduce the risk of disease.</summary>
