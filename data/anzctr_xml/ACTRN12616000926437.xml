  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the McKenzie based self-management approach group will attend 2 x 30 minute individual sessions with a trained physiotherapist. These sessions will be approximately 2 weeks apart. The participant will be trained in an individualised simple specific exercise program focusing on movements that balance/counteract the postures or positions used throughout the day. Since the intervention is individualised for each participant, the exercises to be completed at home will vary in frequency and duration based on the judgement of the assessing physiotherapist to suit each individual's case. The intended exercises are aimed at changing habits, therefore therapists will emphasise the importance of continuing these exercises indefinitely as a prevention strategy for back pain recurrence. For most people the exercise program will involve lumbar extension to counteract the large amount of flexion activity typical of most peoples lives either in sitting or manual tasks, following a McKenzie approach. Adherence will be monitored by 1) recording attendance to physiotherapy visits, 2) asking physiotherapists to rate their perception of participant compliance to the home exercise program between the participants initial and final visit (2 weeks period) and 3) asking participants to rate compliance with home program using the Brief Adherence Rating Scale at 3, 6, 9 and 12 month follow-ups. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to minimal intervention group will receive simple advice about how to prevent back pain over the phone by a physiotherapist (key points being to stay active and to use good postures, taking approximately 10-15 minutes) and will also be posted the Managing Back Pain  get back on track booklet. Participants will have the opportunity to contact the physiotherapist on one further occasion by email or phone if they require further clarification of the information. </comparator>

Non-specific LBP is defined as pain in the area between the 12th rib and buttock crease not attributed to a specific diagnosis such as (ankylosing spondylitis, vertebral fracture, etc). Recovery is described as occurring after 7 consecutive days with pain no greater than 1 on a 0-10 numeric pain scale; (ii) Participants at least 18 years old; (iii) currently not taking any medication for low back pain.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>After agreeing to participate and providing verbal consent, participants will undergo a baseline assessment over the phone. This will take approximately 10 minutes and collect data on demographics, history of LBP and risk factors for recurrence as per the baseline assessment booklet. 
Participants will be randomly allocated into either Mckenzie based self-management approach or minimal intervention control group immediately after doing the baseline assessment. The researcher will open the next consecutively numbered, sealed opaque randomisation envelope to ensure concealed allocation.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to treatment group. The randomisation schedule will be generated by an independent investigator, not involved in allocating or following up participants, using a computer program prior to the commencement of the trial. The randomisation schedule will be developed using randomly permutated blocks. Randomisation will be stratified by the number of previous episodes of low back pain (more than 2 episodes). </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated for the primary outcome using PASS software based upon the method of Lakatos (Lakatos, 1988). For a two-sided log rank test with an alpha value of 0.05 we calculated that a sample size of 198 participants per group will give 80% power to detect a 40% relative reduction in recurrence rates between the treatment group and the control group. These calculations are based upon 30% recurrence in 1 year in the control group. Higher rates of recurrence typically reported in the literature would increase power. Our sample size calculations are based on an 18 months accrual period and 12 month follow up period. We have conservatively allowed for 1% loss to follow-up, and 1% treatment non-compliance per month in both groups. (NB in the survival analysis module of PASS software loss to follow-up and treatment non-compliance are specified per unit of study time which in this case is months.)
Data will be analysed by a statistician who is blinded to group status. The primary analyses will be by intention-to-treat. For the primary outcome, a P value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. For the secondary outcomes a P value of &lt;0.01 will be considered significant. We will assess difference in survival curves (days to recurrence of episode of activity limitation due to back pain) using the log-rank statistic. Cox regression will be used to assess the effect of treatment group on hazard ratios.
Linear mixed models will be used to assess the outcome of Impact of Back Pain over the 12 month follow up period

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SAFE will be a pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing, a McKenzie based self-management method where participants in the intervention group will attend 2 x 30 minute individual sessions with a trained physiotherapist and the control group will receive advice delivered over the phone and an educational booklet on how to manage back pain. 396 participants, who have recently recovered from an episode of non-specific low back pain, will be recruited through community and website advertisement and primary care clinicians (GPs, physiotherapists and chiropractors). Participants will be followed up for a minimum of 12 months. The primary outcome will be days from randomisation to first self-reported recurrence of an episode of activity limiting LBP (somewhat or greater activity limitation measured using an adaptation of item PI9 of the PROMIS item bank to measure pain interference). The secondary outcomes will be days from randomisation to first self-reported recurrence of (i) an episode of non-specific LBP (intensity equal or greater than 3/10 on the numeric pain rating scale, lasting at least 24 hours), (ii) an episode of care seeking (with consultation to a health care provider) LBP and impact of back pain measured by the Impact of Back Pain Questionnaire using 9 items of the 29-item PROMIS form.</summary>
