  <interventions>
    <interventions>One arm propective evaluation with asrtesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Illigible subjects will be treated in a sequential manner by artesunate-amodiaquine or artemether-lumefantrine. This means that patients will be enrolled in the artesunate-amodiaquine group and after the target sample is reach, the subsequent patients will be enrolled in the artemether-lumefantrine. All patients will be followed up for 28 days.

Dose regimen: 

a. Artesunate 4 mg/kg + amodiaquine 10mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days.

b. Atemether-lumefantrine tablets (Tablet containing artemether 20 mg/lumefantrine 120 mg): 6-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrince twice a day for 3 days according to the following weight bands:5-14 kg body weight (bw): 1 tablet; 15-24 kg body weight (bw): 2 tablets; 25-34 kg bw: 3 tablets and greater than or equal to 35 kg body weight (bw): 4 tablets. All treatment will be orally taken tablets.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and a parent/guardian consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Senegal. 

Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Senegal to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine et artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The study will be conducted in  Keur Soce (region de Kaolack) and Guediawaye (region de Dakar) of Senegal.

The participants will be febrile people above 6 months except female aged 14-17, inclusive. Patients will be treated with artesunate-amodiaquine daily for 3 days or artemether-lumefantrine twice a day over 3 days  Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Senegal in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum.</summary>
