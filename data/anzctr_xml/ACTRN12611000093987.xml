  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involved 3 arms where those who met the inclusion criterias and who consented to participate will be exposed to either i) Qigong or ii) Aerobic  or iii)Usual care.

The QiGong group session of about 10-15 people will engage in a routine of 'once a week (1x60 minute) class over eight weeks' at the medical centre. It is supervised by trained QiGong Masters. Qi Gong consists of a series of physical exercises which are low-moderate intensity, with lots of breathing exercises.  Participants are required to practice (what they learn for that class during the week) for at least two other days in the week at home. A log-book is provided to help them monitor their practices. 

The Aerobic group session of about 10-15 people will engage in a routine of 'once a week (1x60 minute) class over eight weeks' at the medical centre. It is supervised by a line-dancing instructor who is also a cancer survivor. The line dance consist of a series of aerobic physical activity which is of low to moderate intensity. Participants are required to practice (what they learn for that class during the week) for at least two other days in the week at home. A log-book is provided to help them monitor their practices.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the trial is to study the effect of physical activity (Qi Gong and aerobic) versus usual care on the Quality of Life (QoL) in breast cancer survivors. 
Objectives: 
1. To examine whether Qi Gong is a better form of physical activity than the other activity (aerobic /control)). 
2. To examine the effect of physical activity on fatigue and distress level of breast cancer survivors. 
3. To examine the relationship between self efficacy and QoL.
Null hypothesis:
1. At the end of the 8 week intervention, there is no difference between the physical activity groups (Qi Gong and aerobic ) and control group on the QOL as measured by FACT-G.
2. There will be no difference in QOL between Qi Gong and aerobic group.
3. There will be no relationships of PA on fatigue and distress level of breast cancer survivors.
4. There will be no relationship between self efficacy and QoL 
Discussion: 
This study will provide evidence on whether participation in physical activity program, especially Qi Gong can enhance the health and QOL of women during their survivorship period. By understanding the outcome, it would help us to help survivors redesign their lifestyle.</summary>
