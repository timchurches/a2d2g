  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty healthy young (18-35 years) adults will be recruited and screened to ensure healthy eyes and vision. The main task is to observe patterns on a computer monitor and make judgments (by pressing a button) about the contrast of a pattern. There will be two test sessions, a treatment session and control session. The order of the sessions will be randomised and the participants blinded to the treatment.  Participants will be instructed not to consume caffeine for 12 hours prior to attending each test session. At the beginning of each test session, participants will undergo baseline visual testing. This will be followed by 1)  a controlled dose of caffeine in the form of an over-the-counter caffeine + vitamin pill (2 x No Doz Plus tablets = 200 mg caffeine + 20 mg thiamine or Vitamin B1 + 20 mg nicotinic acid or Vitamin B3) or 2) a placebo  pill. Visual testing will then occur 45 minutes after tablet ingestion. At the second visit at least one week later, participants will undergo the same protocol (caffeine washout, baseline testing, tablet ingestion, post-tablet testing) such that all participants will have consumed both the caffeine pill and placebo pill. The pills are both white, uncoated, round tablets with no engravings of approximately the same size, which will assist in masking the identity of the pill at each test session.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants will observe a small circular striped patch in the middle of a computer monitor and make judgments (by pressing a button) about the contrast of the pattern. A 'suppression index' will be calculated that compares the contrast judgment before and after treatment.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit 20 healthy, young (18-35 years) observers. The effect of caffeine is believed to result in a similar change in brain neurochemical levels as that seen after ingestion of donepezil. Our research hypothesis is based on a previous study (Kosovicheva et al Front Behav Neurosci 2012;6:61) that measured the effect of donepezil on visual performance in a group of healthy, young observers (mean age 26 years), compared to a placebo pill. In that study, a paired t-test (drug vs placebo) found a significant difference in performance following ingestion of donepezil (group mean difference = 1% contrast, standard deviation = 1.3% contrast) in a group of 19 individuals (alpha = 0.05, 2-tailed) with 90% power, rejecting the null hypothesis that the mean difference was 0% contrast. We have rounded this up to 20 participants in each group to find intra-individual differences in visual performance with and without caffeine ingestion.

Data will be analysed using appropriate statistical methods (ANOVA, paired t-tests) in a statistical package.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Caffeine is readily available and widely consumed by adults of all ages. We are interested in whether temporarily manipulating caffeine levels (from complete washout to a controlled dose of caffeine) has an effect on visual perception in healthy adults. Specifically, we are testing its effect on a contrast judgment task (is one stripey pattern higher in contrast than another?) that our laboratory frequently uses to indirectly measure changes in brain function that occur with normal ageing or in conditions such as migraine. If caffeine indeed influences our test results, then future studies may need to control caffeine consumption.</summary>
