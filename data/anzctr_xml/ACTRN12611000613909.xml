  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be investigating the association between antimullerian hormone levels (AMH) and chemotherapy induced menopause.  Antimullerian hormone levels will be assessed at baseline, at the second cycle of chemotherapy, third cycle of chemotherapy, final cycle of chemotherapy and then 12 months post completion of chemotherapy.  Menstruation will be recorded throughout this period as an indicator of menopausal status.  The total period of observation for each participant will be between 16-18 months depending on the duration of their chemotherapy course.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The association between AMH level pre-chemotherapy with chemotherapy induced amenorrhea at 1 year post chemotherapy.  AMH will be assessed using a serum assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>AMH will be measured at baseline and 12 months following completion of chemotherapy.  Menstrual function will be recorded prospectively throughout the trial in the patient menstrual diary.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of change of AMH as a predictor of chemotherapy induced amenorrhoea.  AMH level will be assessed using a serum assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In addition to the baseline measurement, AMH will also be measured at the second and third cycle of chemotherapy and the final cycle of chemotherapy to determine the rate of fall of AMH.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence and severity of menopausal symptoms, assessed using the Menopause Symptom Scale Score, a 7 item scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Menopause symptom score to be calculated at baseline, second, third and final cycle of chemotherapy and 12 months post completion of chemotherapy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life assessed using EORTC-QLQ-C30 Quality of life questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, second cycle of chemotherapy, third cycle of chemotherapy, final cycle of chemotherapy and at 12 months post completion of chemotherapy.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate whether antimullerian hormone levels can be used to predict which patients will develop menopause following chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy is known to induce menopause in some patients however at this point we do not have a test which allows us to give a patient their individual risk of developing menopause post chemotherapy.  The hypothesis for our study is that patients with lower antimullerian hormone levels prior to the start of chemotherapy will be more likely to develop chemotherapy induced menopause.</summary>
