  <interventions>
    <interventions>16 healthy older subjects (65+ years) will be included in the study. In a randomised intervention order, the subjects will be studied on 5 occasions after an overnight fast. The study visits will be seperated by at least 3 days. Drink ingestion at 0, 60, 120 and 180 min of either whey protein isolate drink P or iso-palatable control drink C (~0kcal): i) P/C/C/C, ii) C/P/C/C, iii) C/C/P/C, iv) C/C/C/P and v) C/C/C/C (control study day). The protein drink will contain 30 g food-grade whey protein isolate powder dissolved in 70 mL distilled water and 50 mL low-calorie lime cordial (Bickfords diet lime cordial). The control drink will contain 90 mL distilled water and 40 mL low calorie lime cordial. The drinks will be equivolaemic (130 mL), and matched for taste. A baseline venous blood sample will be taken and the subject will complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess appetite-related sensations. VAS questionnaires will be collected at t=-2 min (baseline) and t= 2, 27, 57, 62, 87, 117, 122, 147, 177, 182 and 212 min. Blood samples (11.4 mL each) will be collected at 7 time points t = -5 min (baseline) and t = 25, 55, 85, 115, 145, and 175 min). Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured prior to the drink (baseline) and at 3 minute intervals from t = 0 - 180 minutes and after the buffet meal t = 210 min. At t = 180 min, the intravenous cannula will be removed and subjects will be presented with a cold, buffet-style meal. Subjects will be allowed 30 min to freely consume food until they feel comfortably full. The weight of the foods will be recorded before and after it is offered to the subjects and energy intake and macronutrient composition calculated subsequently using commercially available software. </interventions>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a screening visit. A series of screening questionnaires are answered by the volunteer, and a blood sample is taken for determination of ferritin and HBA1C levels. Eligibility is determined based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A signed informed consent form is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit using a randomisation table. Randomisation involves contacting the holder of the randomisation table (study assistant) to inform them of the subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the preload on each study day. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ageing is associated with a physiological reduction of appetite and energy intake, which has been called the anorexia of ageing. Dietary supplementation with liquid protein preparations is now used frequently to increase energy and protein intake in older adults in both institutionalized and community-dwelling populations. Although the latter would appear a logical approach, evidence for success of increased energy intake in older individuals is limited. It is well established that the ingestion of nutrients induce a number of changes in gastrointestinal (GI) function, which are associated with the modulation of appetite and energy intake. These changes include the slowing of gastric emptying, which sustains gastric distension and is associated with proximal gastric relaxation. Urgent investigation is warranted to determine the optimal load of protein that can be incorporated into their diet to assist in sparing muscle mass without reducing their appetite.

The study aims to characterise in healthy older individuals, the effect of timing of protein preloads on energy intake, appetite, plasma concentrations of hormones (i.e. CCK, PYY, ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and insulin) and glucose, and studies the relationship between the suppression of appetite and energy intake by protein. </summary>
