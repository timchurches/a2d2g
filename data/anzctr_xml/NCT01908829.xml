  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment (EoT) in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours - The mean number of incontinence episodes (complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine) per day was derived from number of incontinence episodes recorded on valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period divided by the number of valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period. The analysis population consisted of the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which comprised of all the Randomized Analysis Set's (RAS) participants who met the following criteria: took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug after randomization, reported at least 1 micturition in the baseline diary &amp; at least 1 micturition postbaseline &amp; reported at least 1 incontinence episode in the baseline diary. For participants who withdrew before EoT (week 12) and have no measurement available for that diary period, the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) value during the double-blind study period was used as EoT value to derive the primary variable.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Weeks 4, 8 &amp; 12 in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes Per 24 Hours - The mean number of incontinence episodes (complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine) per day was derived from number of incontinence episodes recorded on valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period divided by the number of valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean Volume Voided (MVV) Per Micturition - MVV per micturition was defined as MVV (mL) per micturition during last 3 days of the 3-day micturition diary period. MVV per micturition was calculated as the sum of each volume voided for each record with volume voided &gt; 0 on valid diary days divided by the total number of records with a volume voided &gt; 0 on valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Urgency Incontinence (UI) Episodes Per 24 Hours - UI was defined as the complaint of involuntary urine leakage accompanied by or immediately preceded by urgency. UI was measured using the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale (PPIUS), a patient reported outcome validated 5-point categorical scale rating the degree of associated urinary urgency severity (0=No urgency, I felt no need to empty my bladder, but did so for other reasons. 1=Mild, I could postpone voiding as long as necessary, without fear of wetting myself. 2= Moderate, I could postpone voiding for a short while, without fear of wetting myself. 3=Severe, I could not postpone voiding, but had to rush to the toilet in order not to wet myself. 4=Urgency incontinence, I leaked before arriving to the toilet). One urgency incontinence episode was counted for each record of the diary in which the following occurred: incontinence episode or 'both' was recorded &amp; severity of urinary urgency recorded was 3 or 4.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of UI Episodes Reported During the 3-Day Diary - Number of UI episodes was calculated using the number of UI episodes recorded on valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Urgency Episodes (Grade 3 and/or 4) Per 24 Hours - An urgency episode was defined as the complaint of a sudden, compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer. The mean number of urgency episodes (severity of 3 or 4) per 24 hours was defined as the average number of times a participant recorded an urgency episode (severity of 3 or 4) with or without incontinence per day during the 3-day micturition diary period. Measured using the PPIUS scale. This was calculated using the sum of each record with an urgency episode (severity of 3 or 4) recorded on a valid diary day divided by the number of valid diary days during the 3-day micturition diary period.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean Number of Nocturia Episodes - Mean number of nocturia episodes was defined as the number of times a participant urinated (excluding incontinence only episodes) while sleeping during the 3-day diary period, divided by the number of valid diary days during the diary period. Night time episode of incontinence only was not considered a nocturia episode. Nocturia episodes were counted for each micturition record which occurred between the date/time of going to bed with intention to sleep and the date/time of getting up with intention to stay awake on a valid diary day &amp; which was accompanied by a sleep interruption. Nocturia only determined for those who were not night-shift workers.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study was to see if adding a new type of medication recently approved to
      treat overactive bladder (mirabegron) to an antimuscarinic treatment (solifenacin) would be
      more effective in controlling incontinence than when using the antimuscarinic treatment
      alone.</summary>
