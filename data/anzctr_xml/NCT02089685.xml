  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being done to analyze the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment for
      advanced melanoma (MEL) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using combination regimens of
      pembrolizumab + pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) and pembrolizumab + ipilimumab
      (IPI). The primary hypothesis is that these combinations will be sufficiently well-tolerated
      to permit continued clinical investigation.</summary>
