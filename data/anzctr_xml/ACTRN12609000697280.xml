  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves participation in a group strengthening exercise program, following an individual physiotherapy assessment. The exercise sessions will be conducted on 2 days of the week, during haemodialysis sessions, for 16 weeks. The exercise sessions are conducted by a trained exercise leader, under the supervision of a physiotherapist, in the presence of ward nursing staff. Sessions are of approximately 45 minutes duration, and include a warm-up, progressive resistance training exercises for the 8 major muscle groups, and stretches/ cool-down. The resistance used includes body weight, dumbbells and resistance bands. Exercises are tailored to meet the needs of the individual, and progressed on an individual basis. Individuals are progressed via resistance used, number of repetitions and sets, and level of difficulty of the exercise. All patients receive usual routine nursing care, and this exercise program is in addition to that routine care.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care only during their haemodialysis sessions for the 16 weeks of the study. Usual care includes access to informational brochures on physical activity and other health related topics. Patients are encouraged by nursing staff to have a healthy, active lifestyle. All patients receive usual routine nursing care.</comparator>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Informed consent will be sought from all patients of a haemodialysis unit who meet the inclusion criteria. Consenting patients who attend the haemodialysis unit on the three days Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays will be allocated to the experimental group. Consenting patients who attend haemodialysis on the three days Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday will act as the control group. A randomised trial was considered but was not possible due to the difficulty and costs involved in employing an exercise supervisor on five weekdays and one weekend day for 4 months and the pilot nature of this trial.</concealment>
