    <exclusivecriteria>1.	Participants who lack the requisite medico-legal capacity to provide consent to participate  for example, those with a significant acquired brain injury, dementia, congenital intellectual disability, cognitive impairment, psychosis/incapacitating psychiatric illness. This determination will be sought from treating medical staff. The selected self-report measures have not been validated for proxy reporting, precluding the inclusion of incapacitated participants. 
2.	Participants who are being treated in the burns unit for skin disorders or conditions that are not related to a burn/thermal injury.
3.	Burns patients who are admitted for subsequent treatment of a previously sustained injury.
4. Burns patients who are not domiciled in Australia for the 12-month period of follow-up.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Continuous data will be expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD) values. Categorical data will be expressed as frequencies and percentages.  The statistical methods used will be analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson correlation to explore the associated factors with QoL outcomes. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses (and possibly Structural Equation Modeling) will be used to test the predictability of injury, treatment, personal and environmental factors on QoL outcomes. All statistical analyses will be two-tailed and considered significant at p&lt;.05.
The target sample size for this study was estimated using Epi Info online software (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/epiinfo/7/index.htm) with Quality of Life as the primary outcome. Input values for the sample size calculation were based on a of 5%, a standard power of 90%, with a large effect size, and incidence or exposure estimates as follows. The expected incidence of poor Quality of Life in the burns population with good social resources is 20%, and for those with poor social resources is 50%, based on reported figures in the OECD Better Life Index and conventional calculations from injury and disease epidemiology literature, with a ratio of exposed to unexposed participants estimated at 2.5. These input values yield a sample size calculation of 138. Allowing for 40% attrition, which is reported in the burns literature, a final sample size of 230 is required.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is an observational prospective longitudinal cohort study with a correlational analysis to quantitatively explore the relationship between burns outcomes and domains such as injury, treatment, personal (individual) and social (environmental) factors. The objective is to identify factors that impede quality of life outcomes post-major burn in adults, in order to inform multidisciplinary clinical models of care that can target the most powerful determinants of outcome.

There has been a paucity of research specifically investigating the relationship between the social factors identified to increase risk of burns and the quality of life outcomes associated with these factors. It has been found that injury severity and burns treatment factors are less predictive of injury outcome than social factors such as level of education and income. However, the reliability of this evidence has been limited due to retrospective study designs and small sample sizes. The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate various factors that have been previously evidenced to influence aspects of recovery such as functional or mental health outcomes. It will endeavour to determine which of the variables are significantly associated with and have the greatest explanatory power to predict long term quality of life outcomes. These will be investigated in terms of individual outcomes as well as broader societal burden of injury outcomes.

In this study, patients admitted to the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital following a burn injury will be enrolled with consent. They will be invited to answer a researcher-led 15 minute questionnaire within the first two weeks of their burn injury or when they resume capacity to consent. For a proportion of participants there will be an initial period of incapacity due to sedation and intubation or delirium. This survey will be about life before their burn injury. They will then be phoned by the researcher at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-burn to answer further survey questions which are anticipated to take 45 minutes per time-point. Other injury and treatment related information will be sourced from the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital Burns Database and the medical record, with participant consent.
