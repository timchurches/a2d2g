  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment uptake - The number of individuals receiving at least one dose of HCV treatment among all HCV/HIV coinfection individuals in care (seen within the previous 12 months) at that health service.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sustained virological response after treatment (SVR12) - Determined using any licensed qualitative HCV RNA test among all those receiving at least one dose of HCV treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change in sustained viral response rates post-treatment (SVR12).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HCV prevalence - The proportion HCV RNA positive of all HIV infected individuals in care (seen within the previous 12 months) at that health service. Statewide HCV prevalence will be determined as a proportion of all HIV infected individuals in care (determined by at least one HIV RNA within the previous 12 months).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HCV incidence - The number of newly detected HCV RNA cases occurring among all HIV infected individuals during the time in care (determined by clinical visit or HIV RNA test within the previous 12 months).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in HCV testing among HIV-infected gay and bisexual men - Hypothesized that primary care and clinic-based nurses will increase the proportion of people in care receiving HCV testing annually and repeat testing at intervals recommended by national guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in number of HIV/HCV infected gay and bisexual men who have a complete management plan including HCV RNA status, FibroScan and liver function tests. - Number of HCV/HIV reinfections in gay and bisexual men management plan will be increased.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Medical adherence - Primar care and clinic based nurses will increase medical adherence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 24 weeks, documented at each study visit</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will offer proof of concept that scaling up treatment for Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      in individuals co-infected with HIV could lead to elimination of HCV/HIV co-infection in gay
      and bisexual men by treating prevalent infection, thereby reducing new primary infections and
      re-infection.</summary>
