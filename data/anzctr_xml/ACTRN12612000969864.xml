    <interventions>Intervention A:  Early surgical intervention using a Titanium volar locking plate.  The plate is applied during surgery to provide internal fixation to a distal radius fracture. The approximate duration of the surgical procedure is 2 hours.  Early active rehabilitation is commenced at 1-2 days following the surgery and the fracture is protected in a splint for up to 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention B:  Early surgical intervention using a Stainless Steel volar locking plate. The plate is applied during surgery to provide internal fixation to a distal radius fracture. The approximate duration of the surgical procedure is 2 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Distal radius fractures are among the most common fractures seen in the hospital emergency department.  In recent years with the  advent of low profile plating, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using volar plates has become the surgical treatment of choice in many hospitals. However, it is currently unknown which plating systems have better clinical
and radiological outcomes following surgery, and also the lowest complication rates. Few studies have compared
different types of plates, which may have different plate and screw designs, features or may be manufactured from
different materials (for example, stainless steel or titanium). This study will specifically investigate and compare the
clinical and radiological outcomes and complication rates of two commonly used volar plating systems for fixation of
distal radius fractures: one made from stainless steel (Trimed Volar Plate) and the other made from titanium (Medartis Volar Plate).



This study will use a two group (intervention) blinded (blinded outcome assessor, blinded data analysis, concealed randomisation, blinded participant) randomised trial in an
adult population.

A suite of outcome measures recommended for this patient group will be used. These measures include an assessment of range of movement, strength, function (quickDASH and Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation), pain(VAS) , complications (medical chart and self-report), quality of life (EQ5D),
radiological outcome (XRay) and patient
satisfaction (VAS). These outcomes will be administered by a blinded assessor at seven time points: baseline, 2
weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.</summary>
