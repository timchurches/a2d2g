    <interventions>Oral Vitamin D supplementation (Arm 1, 50,000 IU; or Arm 2, 100,000 IU cholecalciferol) or placebo taken once a month over 6 months starting in the winter. A duration of  6 months has been chosen as no difference has been seen in incremental increase in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between 6 and 12 months of supplementation with vitamin D. At the 3 and 6 months follow ups, adherence will be calculated by counting the not empty compartments. 
A placebo has been included in this study to determine the seasonal effect.</interventions>

    <concealment>Women will be invited to participate in the study by leaflets and invitations. Leaflets will be distributed in a number of venues around Auckland. A number of presentations will be given to social and community gathering on different occasions. The researcher then will contact respondents and interview them about exclusion and inclusion criteria.
Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will sign informed consent forms and will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 monthly vitamin doses or placebo. 
The researcher will dispense study medication to the participants. A third party (not involved with the research group will place the allocated treatments into a pill dispenser containing 6 compartments, one for each month and label them with letters A to C, the study number, the date dispensed and participant's identification number. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization scheme will be generated using the Web site Randomization.com (http://www.randomization.com). A  statistician off-site, will use sequence generation to allocate treatment A to C (50,000 IU, 100,000 IU or placebo) to each participant enrolled. A third party then will place the allocated treatments into pill dispensers with the study number, the date dispensed and participant's identification number on them. All of this will be done independently to the researchers, to ensure double-blind status is maintained. At the final stage, the researcher will dispense study medication to the participants.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We know that potential consequences of vitamin D deficiency extend beyond bone health. Vitamin D deficiency is implicated in some diseases such as CVD, type 2 diabetes and depression. We previously found a disturbingly high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency in Middle Eastern women living in Auckland, despite some women using prescribed vitamin D supplements (50,000 IU/month). In this survey, 100% of women had low vitamin D concentrations with 75% being deficient.The adequate dose for improving vitamin D status of this population to at least 50 nmol/L (the current minimum for adequacy) is unknown.
The aim of this study is to investigate the adequacy of supplementation with monthly 50,000 IU and 100,000 IU vitamin D3 for 6 months in increasing serum 25(OH)D concentrations greater than or equal to 50 nmol/L in Middle Eastern pre-menopausal women living in Auckland, and to investigate the effect of supplementation with these dosages for 6 months on Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) concentrations.
Sixty-six pre-menopausal women of Middle Eastern origin, living in Auckland, will be recruited. Participants will randomly receive monthly 50,000 IU, 100,000 IU or placebo for 6 months. Blood samples will be tested for serum 25(OH)D, calcium, and PTH concentrations at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months. The change in serum 25(OH)D and PTH concentrations in response to vitamin D supplementation will be assessed.</summary>
