  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial is a 20-week randomised control trial at a coeducational high school in the Macarthur Region of Sydney, NSW. The participants will be randomised into either the intervention or 'active' control group. The intervention program will consist of 3x15mins theory sessions, with two practical sessions (1x1.5 hours and 1 x 1.25 hours) each week. These sessions will focus on improving movement skills, perceived physical competence and enjoyment of physical activity as well as behaviour modification, motivation and goal setting activities.</interventions>
    <comparator>The 'active' control group will receive scheduled sporting and homeroom activities, as already taught in the regular school environment.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eighty students with the lowest cardio-respiratory results will be invited to participate in the trial. According to the NSW SPANS survey, in comparison to other girls of similar age, these girls' cardio-respiratory fitness results were lower than the 30th percentile (Booth et al., 2006).
