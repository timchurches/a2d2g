    <summary>Expedited review.
Data were retrospectively collected from stroke patients in neurology ward at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou since Jan. 1, 2010 to Dec. 31, 2011. Patients not been registered in SRICHS or not enrolled in the HPSAAT were excluded. Matched control group patients were randomly selected from whom did not receive acupuncture therapy among the SRICHS database by 1 : 4 age-sex-severity matching. Profiles including neurologic deficit, activities of daily living, complications, length of stay, and long-term outcome were recorded and evaluated, as well as timing of acupuncture. </summary>
