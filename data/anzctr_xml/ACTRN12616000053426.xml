  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomized into groups to receive either the active or control supplement from enrolment (&lt;2weeks from birth) to 2 years of age. 
The active supplement will be liquid fish oil containing 261 mg of omega-3 marine triglycerides (EPA  139.2mg, DHA 87mg). The control supplement will be composed of high-oleic safflower oil and will be isocaloric and visually identical. 
From enrolment to 6 months of age, formula-fed infants will be administered 0.5mL of the supplement, added to their formula. For breast-fed infants, maternal supplementation at 2mL per day will be required. 
From 6 months onward, the supplement will be solely dispensed as liquid fish oil added once daily into the infant's food or beverage. The supplement from 6 months onwards will be escalated, in line with the increasing body surface area in order to maintain circulating tissue levels of DHA and EPA with an omega-3 index of 8%. 
Compliance will be measured by assessing blood fatty acid status and empty supplement bottle return.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Given a sample size of 252 participants in each randomized group, and type I error probability of 0.05, this study will have: 88% power to detect a clinically relevant relative reduction in aortic IMT of 0.021 mm; 80% power to detect a population relevant 2.5 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure in the omega-3 intervention group; and greater than 95% power to detect a clinically relevant 3.8 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure. Based on our previous experience, we assume a 12.5% loss to follow-up at age 2 years. Thus, we need to randomize 288 participants per group (576 total).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low birth weight is an important risk factor for adult ischemic heart disease. Those born small-for-gestational-age  (&lt;10th percentile for gestational age and gender) are at the highest risk for adult cardiovascular disease. Children and adults born small for gestational age have increased arterial intima-media thickness  a noninvasive marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, the underlying disease process responsible for the majority of cardiovascular events. Birth weight is inversely associated with blood pressure  a major cardiovascular risk factor, in both children and adults.  
Published data from populations of children and young adults suggest that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation will have beneficial effects in reducing arterial intima-medial thickness and systolic blood pressure in children who were born small for gestational age. This hypothesis has not been tested in a randomized controlled trial. 
This study is designed  to test the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation from birth to age 2-years in reducing aortic intima-media thickness and systolic blood pressure in children born small-for-gestational-age. The study will be conducted as a double-blinded randomized controlled trial over a 2 year intervention where aortic intima media thickness and systolic blood pressure will be measured at recruitment, 1 and 2 years of age.
