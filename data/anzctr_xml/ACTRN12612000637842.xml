  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group received a dental care program including pain relief, extractions, periodontal treatment, restorations, topical fluoride, endodontics, prevention and oral higyene and a systematic professional follow up. Invasive dental treatment was considered as a priority and was carried out whenever possible as soon as the patient is considered eligible for the study, and before the beggining of the oncological therapy. Dental treatment was continued during and after oncological therapy at the institution. Depending on the needs assessed by the dentist and availability of services in the institution, each participant received a basic set of preventive and education measures, as well as a specific set of dental treatment. The frequency of dental care varied according to the needs of the subjects. The last appointment was offered up to six months after the end of the oncological treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group received basic oral health care (pain relief, preventive measures, and oral higyene instructions) prior the onclogical treatment and was referred to primary care services for dental care.</comparator>
