  <interventions>
    <interventions>This research will identify the factors that contribute to falling among adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA). The study will explore the relationship between falls in adults with knee OA and clinical characteristics of knee OA such as pain, instability, physical function, muscle strength and balance. Participants will attend a session of up to 45 minutes to assess the knee, answer questionnaires, and perform standard tests for balance, strength and physical function.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In this study, history of falls will be the outcome variable. A fall is defined as an event in which person unintentionally comes to rest on the ground or other lower level. Following the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and Health Quality and Safety Commission New Zealand (HQSC-NZ) recommendation on assessing falls in older people, participants will be asked the following questions:
(1) Have you slipped, tripped or fallen in the last year? If yes, how many fall/s?
(2) Can you get out of a chair without using your hands?
(3) Have you avoided some activities because you are afraid you might lose your balance?

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the participants in the study, distinguishing between those with and those without a history of falls. Mean and standard deviation will be calculated for continuous data such as knee pain, physical function, muscle strength and balance, while frequencies and proportions will be used for categorical data such as knee instability.  

The student t test and chi-square test will be used to test for differences between the variables of those who fell, and those who did not fall. A p-value of 0.05 or less in two-sided testing will be used as criteria for statistically significant difference.

Logistic regression, computing for odds ratios (OR) point estimates and 95% confidence limits, will be used to estimate the association between the binary dependent variable, history of falling, and the hypothesized risk factors, confounders and effect modifiers.  The hypothesized risk factors are knee pain, instability, physical function, muscle strength and balance.  Potential confounders include age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Simple logistic regression will be done to determine the association of each independent variable with the outcome. Multiple logistic regressions using backward elimination of variables starting with the full model, and subsequently assessing variable deletion beginning with the biggest p-values (p-value criterion) will be utilized.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine the relationship between falls in adults with knee OA and clinical characteristics of knee OA such as pain, instability (giving way), physical function, muscle strength and balance. Participants aged 18 years old and above with knee OA meeting the clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology will be recruited from the community. Participants will be included whether they have a history of falls or not. Exclusion criteria will include the presence of another concomitant lower extremity musculoskeletal condition, inflammatory arthritis, the presence of neurological diseases, previous history of lower limb joint replacement, the presence of cognitive deficits, and those with a vestibular problem. 

In this cross-sectional study, history of falls will be the outcome variable while pain, instability (giving way), physical function, muscle strength and balance. These variables will be measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Outcome Survey  Activities of Daily Living Scale, Sensory Organization Test (SOT) using NeuroCom SMART Equitest system, hand held dynamometer and Timed Up and Go Test (TUG).

The proposed study will be clinically relevant since identification and relationship of risk factors for falls among a knee OA population will help physiotherapists and other healthcare providers identify individuals at risk of falling. It will help in the creation of effective prevention strategies that focus on modifiable factors which may decrease future risk of falls. The results of the study will contribute evidence to clarify possible underlying mechanisms of the risk factors for falls in a knee OA population. </summary>
