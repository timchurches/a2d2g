  <interventions>
    <interventions>trans-vaginal 3D power Doppler Ultrasonographic examination was done by Voluson 730 Registered trademark , Expert ultrasound system (GE Healthcare, Zipf, Austria) with transvaginal 5-to 9-MHz volume transducer,).The ultrasound examination was preformed prior to hysterectomy.

The ultrasonographic examination provided data related to vascular index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascular-flow index (VFI). The region of interest included the entire region of the ovary.After evaluating the total color percentage and flow amplitude for the volume of interest, The virtual organ computer aided analysis (VOCAL) software for the analysis of 3D power Doppler histograms was used with computer algorithms to form indices of blood flow and vascularization. In the 730 system, there are four rotation angles to choose from, namely, 6 degrees, 9 degrees , 15 degrees , and 30 degrees, and because the entire data set is rotated about 180 degrees, these result in 30, 20, 12, and 6 planes, respectively, being available for measurements.We used rotation angle 30 degrees in this study .That means rotation in 6 planes manually.The approxiamate time of the test from 15-20 minutes.</interventions>
