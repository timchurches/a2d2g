  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With On-Treatment Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Discontinuations Due to AEs - An AE was any untoward medical occurrence without regard to causality in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of death); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Lack of efficacy was reported as an AE when it was associated with a SAE. An AE was considered treatment emergent if it started for the first time in a participant on or after the first day of active treatment, or the event started before the first day of active treatment but increased in severity during active treatment. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 48</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Developing Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) and Neutralizing Antibodies (NAbs) - Samples were analyzed using the semi-quantitative electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay method, a validated analytical method in compliance with sponsor's standard operating procedures. ADA positive is defined as ADA titer greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4.32. Any positive ADA sample was further tested for NAbs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Baseline and Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72 and 76.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects previously enrolled in study B0151003 and completed the blinded 84 day (12
             week) induction period.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          -  Women of childbearing potential, who have sexual intercourse with a non surgically
             sterilized male partner, must agree and commit to the use highly effective methods of
             birth control from signing of the ICD through 26 weeks after the Final Study
             Evaluation or for 62 weeks from the last dose of investigational product for any
             subject who terminates early from this study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects that have completed Day 84 (Week 12) of study B0151003, and experienced
             serious event(s) related to the investigational product, an unstable medical
             condition, or any other reason, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
             entry or inclusion in this study.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate entry into this study.

          -  Received any prohibited treatment during study B0151003 that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, compromised the safety or efficacy of this study.</exclusivecriteria>
