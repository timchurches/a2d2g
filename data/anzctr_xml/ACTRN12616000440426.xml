  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this pilot trial is to examine the efficacy of decitabine in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma which has been resistant to all previous treatments. Study details 
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive combination therapy with two chemotherapy agents, decitabine and carboplatin, according to the following treatment regime. On days 1-5, patients will receive a daily intravenous infusion of decitabine, followed by a single infusion of carboplatin on day 8. There will then be no treatment administered for the remainder of the cycle, until the regime is repeated starting on day 29. 
Researchers will perform tests on blood and tumour biopsy samples to examine the efficacy of the treatment in altering tumour cells so that they are more vulnerable to the immune system, and thus treating the cancer. It is hoped that information from this trial will provide preliminary information on the efficacy of decitabine in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and provide data to inform a larger clinical trial of this therapy.</summary>
