  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is conducted as a single centre nested cohort study within the SPLIT study (0.9 % Saline versus Plasma-Lyte (Registered Trademark) 148 for Intensive Care Fluid Therapy). 

Intervention = Plasma-Lyte (Registered Trademark) 148, this will be given at intravenously at the discretion of the treating clinician during the ICU stay. 

Fluid will be given in alternating seven week blocks. Any patient who remains in the ICU after a crossover period will continue to receive the study fluid to which they were originally assigned up to 90 days after enrolment.  As a result, no washout is required between cross-over periods.  The treatments will be administered blind to both investigators and patients.   

Patients enrolled into the SPLIT study, expected to be mechanically ventilated for longer than 48 hours, and receiving enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube will be eligible for this pilot study.

During the study period the intensive care unit will be randomly assigned to a 7 week period of administration of trial fluid. There is a double crossover approach so that the each strategy is given twice. </interventions>
    <comparator>During the study period patients will receive  0.9% saline (control arm) solution. These will be given intravenously at the discretion of the treating clinician.  </comparator>

    <concealment>The ICU at Wellington Regional Hospital will be randomly assigned, in alternating seven week blocks, to use blinded 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte "(Registered Trademark)148 as the default fluid.  

Any patient who remains in the ICU after a crossover period will continue to receive the study fluid to which they were originally assigned up to 90 days after enrolment.  As a result, no washout is required between cross-over periods.  The treatments will be administered ‘blind’ to both investigators and patients.  We will use a double crossover approach so each treatment strategy is used twice.  Any patients readmitted to the ICU within the index hospital admission will continue to receive the fluid they were originally assigned to even if the unit-wide crossover has occurred.  If patients are readmitted to the ICU beyond their index hospital admission, they will not be required to receive study fluid.

The allocation of study treatments in will be determined ahead of time by the study statistician. Masked study fluid appropriate for each study block which is labelled either 'fluid A' or 'fluid B' will be delivered to each study unit by Baxter Pty Ltd (who will prepare blinded study fluids for this study). Allocation concealment will be maintained until all analyses (including post hoc analyses) are complete.

    <designfeatures>This study utilises a novel design in order to assess the relative efficacy of two standard treatment approaches. Although this study is clearly an interventional study on the basis of the Guidelines, it has many features that are more akin to an observational study than an interventional one.  Specifically, the study involves no departure from standard care and does not involve the collection of any data that are not already being collected for clinical and / or quality assurance purposes.  In this study, whether or not ICU patients receive 0.9% saline or Plasma-Lyte "(Registered Trademark)148 as default therapy will be determined, on the basis of whether they are cared for in ICU.  

All patients in this study will receive standard treatment except that the default therapy they receive will be randomly allocated according to the 7 week block in which they are admitted to the study hospital. There will be a double crossover design, so each intervention is used twice. 

Attending ICU specialists will have full discretion to use whichever study fluid they choose if a specific indication for one fluid or the other arises.  As a result of these factors, this study involves negligible risk.
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Due to the current lack of established statistical methodologies for calculating sample size for cluster cross over trials with binary outcome variables we are not able to do a power calculation. The data obtained in this study will be used to facilitate modelling of sample size requirements for a larger scale study. 

There have been no studies done in this population to be able to predict an anticipated effect size of the IV fluid intervention. The development of GI complications in mechanically ventilated patients as defined by our criteria has been reported at 50  60% in literature.

A complete description of the statistical analyses will be specified in a statistical analyses plan, finalised prior to completion of the study. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.  

The primary analyses will be unadjusted analyses in which binary outcomes will be compared using relative risks with 95% confidence intervals and chi square tests and continuous outcomes will be compared with the use of mean differences and un-paired T-tests assuming that normality assumptions are meet. If normality assumptions are not met then we plan to attempt simple data transformation, such as a logarithm transformation, and if this fails to proceed to a Mann-Whitney rank based test. Adjusted analyses will be performed using Poisson regression for binary outcomes and linear regression for continuous outcomes.  Baseline covariates will include age, gender, and specialty of admission.  Survival times will be compared using log-rank tests and presented as Kaplan-Meier curves.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>0.9% saline has been used in clinical practice for fluid resuscitation and general fluid therapy since the 1880s.  While it is the most commonly used IV resuscitation fluid in the world, some data raise the possibility that using 0.9% saline for intravenous therapy may be related to altered gastrointestinal (GI) function .Current data are insufficient to recommend clinical practice change and further data from an interventional trial are urgently needed. However, the design of such a Trial requires sufficient pilot data to establish feasibility, safety, power calculations, and define an optimal study protocol.</summary>
