  <interventions>
    <interventions>Polypill - 2 versions containing: Version 1c - atenolol 50mg, aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, lisinopril 10mg Details: one tablet taken orally per day for an average of 12 months. Version 2c - hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg, aspirin 75mg, simvastatin 40mg, lisinopril 10mg Details: one tablet taken orally per day for an average of 12 months. Eligible patients will be randomised to treatment with the polypill or to continue usual care. Subjects randomised to the polypill will only take one version of the polypill. This will be determined by the participant's General Practitioner (GP). </interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: separate cardiovascular preventive medications (e.g. antiplatelet, blood pressure lowering and cholesterol lowering medicines) as prescribed by the General Practitioner (GP). Duration of the treatment will be for an average of 12 months. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Kanyini Guidelines Adherence with the Polypill study is a research study which looks to compare a combination heart medicine called the "polypill" with existing treatments. The polypill has 4 different types of medicine in the one tablet. It contains aspirin, a cholesterol lowering medicine and two blood pressure lowering medicines. All four medicines have been available in Australia for a long time and are known to be very safe; the only difference is that they have been put into one tablet rather than four separate tablets. We think that this will make it easier for clients to take their medicine every day. We also think that by making these medicines easier to take it will be better at lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels than taking many different tablets. This has not been proven and that is why we are conducting this important research to see if this is true.</summary>
