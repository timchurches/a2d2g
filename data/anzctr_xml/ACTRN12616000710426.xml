  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administration of exenatide extended realease ( Bydureon) 2mg subcutaneous injection once weekly on adults with Prader-Willi Syndrome for 12 weeks. Adherence will be monitored by return of empty or unused injection pens by the patients or carers of patients.

Gastric emptying assessment is performed using the gold standard gastric scintigraphy.
Participants will fast from 10:00pm the night before the study. On the day of the study, anthropometric measurements will be taken and fasting blood samples will be drawn. In St Vincent Hospitals nuclear medicine unit, a cannula will be placed in participants arms and they will be given a meal (scrambled eggs with potato, ricotta and cheese) labelled with 99mTc Calcium Phytate Colloid and asked to eat it within 10 minutes. Participants will then lie supine during four 10-minute scans: immediately after eating the meal and at 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours postprandial. Blood samples will be collected prior to meal ingestion and immediately before each scanning time point. Plasma and serum will be obtained from blood samples collected during the study by centrifugation and stored at -80Â°C until being analysed for levels of glucose, insulin, gut hormones and lipids. Appetite will be assessed using hunger and fullness visual analogue scales before and hourly after the meal. After completion of the scintigraphy study, participants will have a DXA scan to quantify lean mass and fat mass.

    <comparator>Lean and obese healthy control groups will be enrolled to compare baseline gastric emptying, anthropometric characteristics, appetite scores, cognitive function scores , and circulating levels of hormones, lipids and cytokines between groups to determine differences between the PWS group and the lean and obese control groups.  .

    <statisticalmethods>For baseline gastric emptying,  anthropometric characteristics, appetite scores, cognitive function scores , and circulating levels of hormones, lipids and cytokines, we will perform between-group comparisons to determine differences between the PWS group and the lean and obese control groups. 

Treatment effects on gastric emptying,  anthropometric characteristics, appetite scores, cognitive function scores , food-related behavioural assessment scores and circulating levels of hormones, lipids and cytokines will be assessed in the PWS group at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-treatment compared to baseline. Multiple linear regression will be used to determine factors that predict treatment effects on endpoints.

To detect a difference in 4-hour gastric retention between groups with statistical power 1- beta&gt;0.85, we will require 8 individuals in each group. Allowing for a drop-out rate of 20%, this requires 10 participants for each of the control groups. As we anticipate that some PWS participants may not be eligible to enter the treatment arm of the study, we aim to recruit 20 individuals in the PWS group initially.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that causes individuals with the
disease to have an insatiable appetite, which often leads to the development of morbid obesity. The only way that this appetite can be controlled is through constant vigilance, behavioural restraints and environmental modifications; there is currently no pharmacological treatment for excessive appetite in PWS.
A single injection of exenatide, a GLP-1 hormone agonist, has been shown to increase feelings of fullness after a meal in adults with PWS. The effects of the long term administration of a GLP-1 agonist on appetite and weight management in PWS, however, have not been studied. The proposed study aims to redress this by assessing changes in gastric emptying rate, fullness, hunger, food-related behaviours, appetite hormones, cognitive function and body weight in a cohort of 20 adults with PWS treated for 12 weeks with the GLP-1 agonist Bydureon.
Study participants will undergo a meal study prior to beginning Bydureon treatment to assess their response of hormones and appetite to food intake. As there have been some studies demonstrating that Bydureon slows gastric emptying, participants gastric emptying rate will be also be assessed by scintigraphy so that changes in gastric motility can be monitored for tolerance, with a normal gastric emptying range established from 10 lean control individuals and 10 obese control individuals. If PWS particpants gastric emptying rate falls within the normal range, they will begin a 12-week Bydureon treatment period with weekly injections of the drug.
After 4 weeks of Bydureon treatment, gastric emptying rate will be measured again. If it has slowed below the normal range, treatment will be discontinued. Otherwise, treatment will be continued up to 12 weeks, after which PWS participants will undergo a further meal/scintigraphy study to determine the effect that Bydureon treatment has had on appetite, weight, behaviour and cognitive function. Body weight will be measured again 12 weeks after completion of the treatment period.</summary>
