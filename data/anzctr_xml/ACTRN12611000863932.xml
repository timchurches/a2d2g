  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For antenatal screening for Group B Streptococcus (GBS), current guidelines from the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) recommend both a low vaginal swab (LVS) and an anorectal swab (ARS) to be taken.  The addition of an ARS to a LVS is reported to increase the GBS detection rate compared to performing a LVS alone.  Despite these recommendations, many clinicians perform a LVS alone for GBS screening, and patient and physician acceptability may be responsible. We aim to assess the pain and acceptability of the LVS and ARS, and the detection rate for GBS from each swab.</summary>
