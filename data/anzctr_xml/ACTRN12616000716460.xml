  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a dietary intervention study in which healthy young adults will consume test meals with differing proportions of carbohydrate (rice or pasta based meals) and non-starchy vegetables. Half of the participants will be randomised to receive pasta-based meals and the other half to receive rice-based meals. Within each intervention group participants will consume a meal with 30g and 60g of available carbohydrate at two separate testing sessions. The amount of rice and pasta corresponding to the 30 and 60g available carbohydrate will be 100 and 200g, respectively. The amount of non-starchy vegetables on the plate will be 250 and 150g, respectively (ie: a gram for gram replacement of rice or pasta with non-starchy vegetables). The amount of mince and sauce will be constant at 200g. The total weight of each meal  will be 550g. Participants blood glucose concentration will be measured prior to consuming the meal and then at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after this time point. The order of test meal consumption will be randomised. The meals will be served hot (&gt;65 deg C). Participants will consume the meals with instruction to finish all of the food on the plate in their own time while under supervision at the study site. The washout period between successive lunch meals will be one week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will consume a third test meal with 45g of available carbohydrate at a separate testing session. This will act as the control as it is the amount of available carbohydrate that Diabetes New Zealand recommends individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus to consume within a starchy food at a main meal. The meals with 30g and 60g of available carbohydrate represent a one serving (15g available carbohydrate) difference from this control meal.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either rice or pasta-based meals and to the order they will receive the meals. The person who will determine if a subject is eligible for inclusion in the trial will be unaware, when this decision is made, to which group the subject will be allocated. Randomisation will be performed by the department statistician, the researchers will remain unaware of allocations until the laboratory phase.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Males will be block randomised to ensure equal sex distribution between the two groups, controlling for any potential sex variability in glycaemic response. Simple randomisation will be used for order treatment and all randomisation will be done using Stata statistical analysis software.
</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Crossover refers to the different proportions of starchy carbohydrate and vegetables on the plate, each person consumes three meals in randomised order containing 30, 45 and 60g starchy carbohydrate. There is also a parallel component to the study in which participants will be randomised to the starchy carbohydrate of either rice or pasta-based meals.

</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 34 participants in both the pasta and rice arms of the study would have 90% power to detect a 30% difference in AUC at the alpha 0.05 level. It was decided to recruit more participants than this to allow for expected dropout. A 30% difference was chosen to be clinically relevant as this corresponds to the difference in AUC between a low and high GI food.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>A randomised controlled crossover trial in which participants blood glucose concentrations will be measured following the consumption of three test meals. Each meal will have different proportions of carbohydrate and non-starchy vegetables. The amount of starchy carbohydrate on the plate will be 30, 45 and 60g. The comparator will be the meal containing 45g starchy carbohydrate. 

There will also be a parallel design in which the the starchy carbohydrate will be rice or pasta. Participants will be randomised to either rice or pasta-based meals. </summary>
