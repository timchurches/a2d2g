    <studytitle>The effect of vitamin supplementation,  genotype and homocysteine on 
migraine frequency and severity in females diagnosed with migraine with aura.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A Phase II randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of vitamin supplementation in females diagnosed with migraine with aura, incorporating methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genotype analysis, to determine whether vitamin therapy is an effective complementary or alternative therapy for reducing migraine disability.</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>12 months treatment with either B vitamins (25mg pyridoxine hydrochloride (HCl), folic acid 2mg, and vitamin B12 400mcg) or a placebo. Intervention dose: One trial tablet (B vitamin or Placebo) taken once daily for 12 months. Mode of administration: Oral tablet.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To  assess  the  effect  of  vitamin  supplementation  in migraine  patients  we  will  measure  the  12-month  retrospective  migraine  disability  using  the Migraine Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS) - a measure of migraine impact on quality of life. This post-treatment score will be compared to the baseline MIDAS score to establish the primary outcome variable (i.e. change in MIDAS score).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At zero year and at one year after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in plasma homocysteine and vitamin levels will be assessed through a National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) accredited laboratory using B6 plasma assay and homocysteine, folic acid and B12 serum assays.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At zero year and at one year after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Female aged 18 to 65 years of age. 
Have a diagnosis of migraine with aura (MA) according to International Headache Society Criteria.  
Unrelated by first degree - we hypothesise that our outcome variable, response to vitamin therapy, is influenced by inherited factors, so genetic independence of participants is important.
Suffer at least 4 migraine episodes per year.
Of  Caucasian  ancestral  background.  
Participants with adequate venous access in their left and right arms to allow collection of a number of blood samples via venepuncture. 
Fluent in the English language. 
Have voluntarily given written informed consent to participate in this study.
Be able to attend the Genomics Research Centre (GRC) clinical trials facility on the Gold Coast.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participated in the migraine-vitamin trial pilot study.
Has a clinically recognised co-morbid disease e.g. vascular disease, depression, epilepsy.
Other  severe  illness  that  might  interfere  with  assessment  or  hamper  patients  ability  to complete the study e.g. compliance. 
Pregnancy or planned pregnancy in the study period.  
History of any psychiatric illness. 
Inability to comply with treatment regime or attend clinic assessments.
Participation in another clinical trial or received experimental therapy within last 30 days. 
Donated or lost a significant amount of blood (e.g. 550 mL) within the past 12 weeks. 
Persons already taking vitamin B and/or folic acid supplementation.
Persons who have ever been diagnosed with cancer.
Persons who have three or more first degree relatives who have been diagnosed with cancer.</exclusivecriteria>
