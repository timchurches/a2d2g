  <interventions>
    <interventions>This intervention is investigating the effect on blood lipids, lipo-proteins and glycaemic control of adding 30g /day nuts or 30g /day seeds or a combination of nuts and seeds supplying 15g nuts plus 15g seeds to the usual diets of postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. This is a randomized parallel study lasting 12 weeks. there are 3 intervention groups.The study will use hazelnuts and sunflower seeds. The nuts and seeds may be consumed at the time best suited to the participant i.e. they have complete choice of time  of day or eating occasion with no instructions to eat all at one sitting or as part of a meal. Free choice of time and amount mimics a usual situation and behaviour. The strategies to monitor adherence are supplying nuts and seeds in daily packets of 30g each, with the instruction to return the empty or partially empty packets at the end of each 4 week period when the next set of packaged nuts are collected.  The tick sheets are used daily for the participant to record the amount, time, and eating occasion -meal or snack.  We have used these strategies with success in previous studies and the recording of daily consumption data is useful for per protocol analysis and to assess preferred times and occasions of consumption and the amount consumed at any one time.</interventions>
    <comparator> All participants will be asked to continue with their usual diets in the two weeks leading up to the study start. During this time they will complete the first of the two 3 day weighed diet protocols. At week zero i.e. at the end of this two week period participants will be entered into the study by random allocation carried out by the off site statistician. They will be randomized into either one of the 3 groups nuts or seeds or nuts + seeds or the control group. Thus the control group will be drawn from the same population. They will receive no nuts or seeds and be asked to continue with their usual diets (which may of course include nuts if that is part of their usual eating pattern). At the conclusion of the study the control group participants will be offered a one off amount nuts or seeds or a combination -depending on their choice.</comparator>

We have used them in a number of previous studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately before and after consumption of the study nuts /seeds on the same three days that dietary intake are recorded-for those in the three intervention groups.  There are 2 periods when the participants are asked to keep a 3 day weighed diet record (on 2 weekdays &amp; 1 weekend day) these periods are between week 0-2 and weeks 5-7 during the intervention period.  The participants may choose which days specifically the 'use' during these time frames.  Which ever 3 days they choose are the days on which they are asked to answer the appetite rating questionnaire.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Power Calculations: In order to have 80% power to detect moderate differences (0.5 SD) in outcomes between any two arms of the study (which would be equivalent to approximately 0.15 mmol/l for HDL, 0.35 mmol/L for triglycerides, 0.7% or 8mmol/mol for HbA1c, 1.75mmol/l for fasting glucose, and 0.1 g/L for apo A1 and B100) using two-sided tests at the 0.05 level, assuming correlations of 0.5 or higher between baseline and follow-up values, 48 participants would be required for each arm of the study. In order to allow for 10% lost data due to loss to follow-up or unusable measurements, 220 participants should be enrolled at baseline (55/group). 
Statistical Analysis: Baseline characteristics will be presented using appropriate summary statistics. The effects of the three interventions will be examined using linear regression models, controlling for baseline values. The main analysis will be performed using modified intention to treat principles (using all available data) but per protocol analyses are also planned. Standard model diagnostics will be used to assess model fit. Stata 13.1 or a later version will be used for all analyses. All tests will be performed at the two-sided 0.05 level.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The question we are investigating is whether adding 30g/d nuts, 30g/d seeds or a combination of both, rich in healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, will result in beneficial changes in blood lipid and lipoprotein risk factors related to CVD and whether there will also be an improvement in glycaemic control. This is a study in the community- where women, in the post menopause, with type 2 diabetes will incorporate the nuts and seeds into their usual diets, as part of a meal or as a snack. The participants may also decide whether to consume the daily amount at one eating occasion or divide them during the day, as long as the daily portion is consumed within 24 hours. Consummation times will be at the participants discretion they can decide to consume the nuts and seeds with a meal, as a snack, or divided between between both. Participants will also record on tick sheets the time the nuts / seeds were consumed and if alone or with other foods. Tick sheets have been used with success in many previous study.  The sheets are supplied with a table for each day where the participants can record the time of day and how the snack was consumed, there will also be a space for comments.  The sheets will be returned with the nut or seeds bags when the next 4 weeks allocation is collected.  Thus we are also investigating the acceptance of eating nuts regularly and whether this intervention is effective regardless of the background diet, and time of consumption. There will be a control group who will continue with their usual diets. This is to ascertain whether the changes seen are as a result of the intervention and would not just have happened anyway, during the period of the study. </summary>
