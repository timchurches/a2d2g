  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve the incorporation/modification  of service delivery activities aligned with the chronic care model at the health centre level, specifically relating to care for clients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF) or rheumatic heart disease (RHD).   The research team will work with health centre staff, continuous quality improvement facilitators and the Northern Territory RHD program to review existing practices and data and develop activity plans to realign the health centre's approach with the Chronic Care Model.  This preparation has been allocated three months in the projects timeline.  After this three month period, the modified processes should be implemented and this signifies the commencement of the intervention period.  Possible activities include: the creation of an RHD working group at each health centre; the allocation and documentation of RHD service delivery responsibilities; streamlining triaging processes; strengthening self management initiatives and developing/strengthening links with community. During the first 15 months of the intervention health centres will receive intensive support from the project team; this will be followed by a maintenance phase with a reduced level of support.  For the first sites to be randomised the maintenance phase will be 15 months.    </interventions>
    <comparator>This is a stepped wedge design and as such all participating health centres will receive the intervention. The pre-intervention phase for each health centre will act as the control treatment. During the pre-intervention phase health centres will conduct their regular activities with respect to service delivery for ARF/RHD clients. The approach taken in each health centre may vary slightly; activities are often developed as part of continuous quality control processes, this is particularly true for health centres who undertake One21seventy systems assessment tools and clinical audits. Baseline data collection will take place during this phase. The pre intervention phase  commenced in September 2013. The first 2 health centres to commence the intervention will have a 3 month pre intervention phase; every three months another two health centres will commence the intervention phase so that the last two health centres to commence will have a preintervention phase of 15 months. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of clients receiving 80% or more of scheduled benzathine penicillin G (BPG) injections over a minimum 12 month period. Monthly adherence data are routinely reported by health centre staff and data are stored by the RHD register. The project will use the NT RHD register data for this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured on a monthly basis for the 15 months of the intervention.  Due to a potential delay in intervention effect, the average adherence for months 3 -15 will be used to compare with the baseline period. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>a. the acceptability of intervention package by health service staff, ARF/RHD clients, and other RHD stakeholders.
Acceptability will be measured using interview and focus groups with ARF/RHD clients and health centre staff.  Focus group and interview guides are currently in development. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Acceptability of the package will be measured half way through the intervention period and at the end of the intervention.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>b. the intervention's impact on other services for RHD clients.  The intervention's impact on other services for ARF/RHD clients will be measured using the One21seventy clinical audit and systems assessment tool wherever possible.  If a health centre has adopted a different system for continuous quality improvement (CQI) of RHD services, that  process will be used.  The research team will ensure that a comparable data set is collected from all health centres, which may involve asking additional questions at health centres not using One21seventy tool. If no RHD-specific CQI process is in place, the One21seventy tools will be used by the research team.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Impact on other services for ARF/RHD clients will be measured at half way and at the end of the intervention. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>c. the intervention's impact on other routine services.  The impact on other routine services will be measured using the Northern Territory (NT) Aboriginal Health Key Performance Indicators.  These data are routinely collected by the NT Department of Health.  Data for the comparison 12 months and for the intervention will be requested.   </outcome>
      <timepoint>Impact on other routine services will be measured at half way and at the end of the intervention. </timepoint>

    <concealment>Interested health centres will be asked to sign a participation agreement. Once 6 sites have signed participation agreements, they will be randomised in pairs to a start date. Pairs of health centres will commence at 3 months intervals. Once additional sites have signed participation agreements these will be randomised to a start date following the rollout of the first 6 sites. 
Since health centres, not individuals, will be randomised, there will be no allocation concealment.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The stepped-wedge community-randomised control design has been chosen for a range of reasons. The evidence to date suggests that there will be a benefit in aligning activities with the Chronic Care Model, and consequently it would be unethical to have a control group that does not receive the intervention. In addition, the limited resources available to the research team mean that simultaneous roll out of the intervention at all 10 health centres is not possible - and consequently the staggered roll out has been chosen. The stepped wedge design has been successfully used for many decades in practice based research. </designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RHD is a priority health issue for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and improving delivery of secondary prophylaxis is the major outstanding deficiency in our  current attempts to control this disease. Surprisingly this topic has never been researched to any substantial extent.
This project hypothesises that a package of interventions, primarily aimed at enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery for RHD at the primary health centre level, will increase the proportion of clients receiving 80% or more of their SP injections, which will translate to reduced recurrences of ARF, and reduced severity and, eventually, prevalence of RHD.</summary>
