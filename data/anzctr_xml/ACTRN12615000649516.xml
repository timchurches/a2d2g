    <interventions>LigaSure and Gyrus PK are all TGA approved laparoscopic blood vessel sealing devices used in standard hospital care. They have been widely used in laparoscopic surgery for more than 15 years. The safety of these two instruments has been well established in clinical practice.  We are evaluating their operative time and blood loss in laparoscopic gynaecological surgery. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation is based on the operative time. The mean operative time in the SWAPS unit (Sydney West Advanced Pelvic Surgery) is 120 minutes with SD 35. As a result, 32 patients are needed in each arm to have 80% of power to detect a 25 minutes difference in operative time at the two sided 5% significance level. Statistics computer program (SPSS statistics standard, Chicago, USA) will be used in carrying out the statistical analysis. The baseline characteristics will be compared by using analysis of variance. Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney or Fishers exact test will be used to estimate the significance of difference between discontinuous variables.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised controlled trial. All components used in this study are TGA approved. Women, who undergo a laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indications will be randomised to the use of LigaSure or Gyrus PK blood vessel sealing devices. The aim is to compare operative time and blood loss with the use of LigaSure (LF 1737 5mm laparoscopic 37cm sealer /divider) versus Gyrus PK (5mm LYONS 33cm dissecting forceps) blood vessel sealing device during laparoscopic hysterectomy. A minimum of 64 patients will be enrolled into the study.  Operating time (from initial skin incision until detachment of the uterus with secured haemostasis), total operating time (from initial skin incision until final skin closure), intra-operative blood loss, major complications, post-operative analgesia usage, conversion rate, ergonomics and costs will be evaluated.</summary>
