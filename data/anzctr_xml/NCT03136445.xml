    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test whether giving tranexamic acid to patients receiving
      treatment for blood cancers reduces the risk of bleeding or death, and the need for platelet
      transfusions. Patients will be randomised to receive tranexamic acid (given intravenously
      through a drip, or orally) or a placebo.</summary>
