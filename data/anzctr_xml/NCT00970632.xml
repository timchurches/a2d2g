  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 12 Weeks - The IPSS Total Score was obtained by combining the scores of the responses to Component Questions 1-7. Each question was scored from 0-5 for an IPSS range of 0-35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represented greater severity of symptoms. Least Squares (LS) Mean of change from baseline to endpoint (Week 12 or last post-baseline value carried forward) was from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction, and treatment-by-region interaction.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at 4 Weeks - The IPSS Total Score was obtained by combining the scores of the responses to Component Questions 1-7. Each question was scored from 0-5 for an IPSS range of 0-35 points; higher numerical scores from the IPSS questionnaire represented greater severity of symptoms. Least Squares (LS) Mean of change from baseline to endpoint (Week 4 or last post-baseline value carried forward) was from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction, and treatment-by-region interaction.</outcome>

Scores ranged from 0 (no irritative symptoms) to 5 (frequent irritative symptoms); therefore, the 3 questions of the irritative subscore ranged from 0 to 15. Least Squares (LS) Mean of change from baseline to endpoint (Week 12 or last post-baseline value carried forward) was from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and adjusted for treatment group, region, centered-baseline covariate, centered-baseline-by-treatment interaction, and treatment-by-region interaction.</outcome>
