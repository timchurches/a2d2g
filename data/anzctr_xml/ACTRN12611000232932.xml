  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be five intervention arms as follows:
Arm 1: 1g of calcium as citrate
Arm 2: 1g of calcium as carbonate
Arm 3: 1g of calcium as hydroxyapatite preparation A*
Arm 4: 1g of calcium as hydroxyapatite preparation B*
Arm 5: placebo containing no calcium (microcrystalline cellulose)
* Process manipulations will result in two preparation variants that will differ in their particle density and size distribution, food chemistry (moisture, fat, protein, ash) ratios and the extent of enzyme hydrolysis


The mode of administration is by oral capsule, with 8 capsules providing 1g of calcium. On day 1, each preparation will be taken in a single dose of eight capslues . For the remainder of the trial period, the trial medications will be taken in two divided doses daily, four capsules in the morning and four in the evening.  

The duration of administration is 12 weeks.</interventions>

    <concealment>Each enrolled patient will be provided with a sequential study registration number and, if they met the inclusion criterion and are not excluded, will be sequentially allocated to one of five treatment arms at random by sealed envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>A variable block size randomization schedule will be prepared by staff not involved in the management of the trial.  For each block of patients a random number will be generated.  Patient numbers in the lowest fifth by random number, will receive 1 g of calcium as hydroxyapatite preparation A, those numbers in the next fifth by random number 1 g of calcium as hydroxyapatite preparation  B etc.  Variable block size will ensure that the trial is less likely to be unbalanced in the event of early termination. The study pack allocation form will be filed in the CRF.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised, single-blind, controlled 3-month study. One hundred healthy postmenopausal women will be randomised to one of the following five supplement preparations: 1g calcium as one of 2 hydroxyapatite preparations, 1g of calcium as citrate, 1g calcium as carbonate or a placebo. Participants will be seen twice over 3 months for clinical evaluation and laboratory, blood pressure and bone density measurement. Measurements will include serum biochemistry, haematology, markers of bone turnover and vascular calcification, and blood coagulation indices. The co-primary endpoints will be changes in blood calcium following the first dose of calcium, and markers of bone turnover at 3 months.</summary>
