    <interventions>Anterior vaginal repair using the anterior Prolift(TM) system (Ethicon Womens Health and Urology, Somerville, NJ) and concminant procedures for the apical and posterior compartments and for stress urinary incontinence as required. The anterior Prolift system is a transvaginal surgical kit designed for the treatment of anterior vaginal wall prolapse. It consists of a synthetic mesh graft with four arms. The graft is placed between the bladder and the anterior vaginal wall without tension and the arms retrieved through the Obturator foramen using special trocars. This surgical procedure is a 'one off' procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Anterior vaginal repair using the Perigee(TM) system (American Medical Systems Inc. Minnetonka, MN) and concminant procedures for the apical and posterior compartments and for stress urinary incontinence as required. The Perigee system is a transvaginal surgical kit designed for the treatment of anterior vaginal wall prolapse. It consists of a synthetic mesh graft with four arms. The graft is placed between the bladder and the anterior vaginal wall without tension and the arms retrieved through the Obturator foramen using special trocars. This surgical procedure is a 'one off' procedure. The Perigee and the Prolift systems are manufectured by different companies and differ from each other in few parameters including mainly the measurements and shape of the mesh graft and arms and the shape of the retrieving trocars. These differences can potentially lead to differences in the safety and efficacy of the two procedures.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective success rate, defined as less than stage 2 prolapse at the anterior vaginal wall and at all compartments, according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system (POP-Q)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks postoperatively and six-monthly thereafter for 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective success rate, defind as no prolapse sensation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks postoperatively and six-monthly thereafter for 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient's satisfaction expressed on a 1 to 10 Visual Analogue Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks postoperatively and six-monthly thereafter for 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fubctional (bladder bowel and sexual) outcomes using a validated pelvic floor symptom and quality of life questionnaire (the Queensland Pelvic Floor Questionnaire)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks postoperatively and six-monthly thereafter for 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complication rates. Data on perioperative complications (Bladder / bowel injury, blood loss &gt; 400ml, blood transfusions) will be taken from the patients' charts, mesh related complications (erosion, contraction) will be assessed through pelvic examination and complications affecting functional outcomes (dyspareunia) will br assessed through interview and validated questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks postoperatively and six-monthly thereafter for 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Re-operation rates. This information will be retrieved from the clinic's records.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>Our team operates in three locations. At the Mater hospital the Prolift system is routinely used for all patients undergoing mesh repair for anterior vaginal prolapse, at the Wesley hospital the Perigee system is routinely used for all patients undergoing mesh repair for anterior vaginal prolapse and at the RBWH both systems are routinely used depending on availability at the time of surgery.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the outcomes of the surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse using two different mesh grafts, namely the anterior Prolift(TM) and the Perigee(TM) systems. Women with genital prolapse who underwent surgery using one of these mesh systems were recruited in the study and the anatomical outcomes as well as subjective success, patients' satisfaction and complication rates were prospectively evaluated.</summary>
