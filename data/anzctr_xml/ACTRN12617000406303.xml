  <interventions>
    <interventions>Rehabilitation protocol with knee strengthening exercises performed with the hip in neutral position (see attached protocol on the ANZCTR website). The intervention will be delivered on an individual basis, face to face  at a physical therapy clinic by licensed physical therapists. The treatment will last for 6 months, starting 2 weeks after surgery with sessions for 3 times per week for the first 2 postoperative months, reduced to twice per week for the next 2 months and reduced to once a week for the final two months. The attendance to the prescribed sessions will be documented by the clinic. Each session will last 30-60 minutes depending on the rehabilitation phase. As described in detail in the protocol, the treatment involves manual therapy techniques, range of motion exercises, strengthening exercises, proprioceptive exercises, and sports-specific activities, </interventions>
    <comparator>Rehabilitation protocol with knee strengthening exercises performed in the traditional seated position with the hip at 90 degrees of flexion (see attached protocol on the ANZCTR website).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have previously demonstrated that knee flexion deficits after ACL reconstruction remain when tested in a functional position with the hip in neutral even after several months and extensive rehabilitation. This may be due to the position of the hip (90 degrees of flexion) that is typically used for knee flexion strengthening exercises. We hypothesize that strengthening withe the hip in a more functional position (neutral) will result in lower strength deficits and better outcomes</summary>
