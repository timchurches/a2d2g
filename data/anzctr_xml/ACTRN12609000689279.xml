  <interventions>
    <interventions>After informed consent, patients will be assigned, by using a computer-generated block randomization, to either group 1 - ultrasound guided fascia iliaca block, or group 2 - fascia iliaca block with loss of resistance blind technique.
Patient will receive routine general anaesthetic for the operation as per the discretion of the anaesthetist.  Allowable analgesics include alfentanil/ fentanyl for induction.  
After the patient is asleep, Group 1 patient will then have a fascia iliaca block placed with ultrasound assistance.  The fascia iliaca and the iliacus muscle are identified.  An 18 gauge Touhy needle will be inserted under the fascia iliaca with ultrasound guidance.  Group 2 patient will have the fascia iliaca block performed by anatomical landmark technique alone.  The line from the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle is drawn.  The insertion point is at the lateral 1/3 and medial 2/3 and 1cm caudad to the line drawn.  Again an 18 gauge Tuohy needle will be inserted using 2-pop loss of resistance technique.  All blocks will be performed by anaesthetists who are proficient at blocks without ultrasound, and who have been trained in the use of ultrasound for vascular access or other nerve blocks.  The investigator will be present if required to provide guidance.
For both groups, a total of 0.5ml/kg 0.5% ropivacaine (maximum of 40ml) will be injected through the Tuohy needle in 5ml aliquots after negative aspiration.
Morphine can be administered during the operation as per the discretion of the anaesthetist.  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and tramadol will not be allowed intra-operatively or post-operatively for 48hours.  Paracetamol will be given strictly 6-hourly (QID).
A morphine patient controlled analgesia pump will be commenced post-operatively.  A blinded research nurse or investigator would then collect the data required from this study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to determine if using ultrasound when performing a nerve block improves the control of pain after surgery.  The nerve block is called the fascia iliaca block, which is commonly performed for patients having total knee replacement to improve pain relief.  Traditionally, the block is performed using a blind technique called the fascial click or loss of resistance technique.  The anaesthetist inserts the needle usually near the groin area and feels for the clicks or the loss of resistance before injecting the local anaesthetic drug for pain relief.  
Recently, the use of ultrasound has become very popular when performing nerve block.  Ultrasound allows the anaesthetist to visualize the structures underneath the skin before and during the insertion of the needle and injection of local anaesthetic.  However, there is no information on whether using ultrasound to perform fascia iliaca block for total knee replacement improves the success of pain relief.  This study is therefore designed to investigate if ultrasound improves block success and therefore reduces pain.</summary>
