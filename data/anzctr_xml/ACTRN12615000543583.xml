  <interventions>
    <interventions>An observation of concussion for 28 days. Neuropsychological tests, biomarker levels and will be conducted on the day of presentation to the emergency department; MRI imaging will be conducted within the first week after injury where feasible. Neuropsychological tests and biomarker assays will be repeated at day 28; MRI will be repeated at day 28 if the first MRI was abnormal. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biomarkers in plasma will be assessed using commercially available kits. Biomarkers to be assessed include markers of structural damage, oxidative stress and altered metabolism (e.g. glial acidic fibrillary protein, a II-spectrin N-terminal fragment (SNTF), myelin basic protein, S100b, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, carboxymethyl lysine, pan and/ or phosphorylated tau).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 48 hours of injury</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neuropsychological tests. The neuropsychological test battery is a composite outcome that will include measures assessing post-concussion symptoms, attention, learning, memory, executive functioning and effort. Specific tests will include the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Trail Making Test (TMT), Rey 15 Item memory test and the Rivermead Postconcussion Questionnaire. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) will also be administered.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>As an exploratory study to determine the feasibility of our approach, only basic univariate analysis with exact logistic regression is appropriate, due to the sample size. This will assist with determining an indication of effect, ie whether there is an association between the initial biomarkers and the diagnosis of post-concussion syndrome. The biomarker results will be compared to the MRI results and the neurocognitive test results. Comparisons to the healthy controls at baseline will use non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon rank sum or Mann-Whitney U test). Random effects regression will be used to investigate change over time in outcomes measured at baseline and 28 days. Statistical analysis will be performed with Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with concussion. Clinical data, imaging, neuropsychological testing and blood samples of patients with concussion will be correlated with outcomes. This may lead to the development of improved tools for diagnosis and prognosis, which could be used in future trials of treatment for concussion.</summary>
