  <interventions>
    <interventions>The active intervention is a web-based self-help program for suicidal thoughts. This program is based on cognitive behaviour therapy and consists of six modules that focus on 1) the repetitive character of suicidal thoughts, 2) regulating intense emotions, 3) identifying automatic thoughts, 4) recognising thinking patterns, 5) thought challenging, and 6) relapse prevention. Participants will be encouraged to complete one module per week, which will take up to a maximum of 15 minutes per day. Adherence to the program will be monitored by looking at number of modules and exercises completed. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is matched for attention by providing a web-based 6-week program that presents lifestyle information on nutrition; maintaining a healthy environment; preventing heart disease; maintaining a healthy weight; common skin problems; and oral hygiene. There is no specific mental health or suicide-related content in this program. The control condition is matched for attention by providing interactive activities of the same duration as the intervention group, i.e. 15 minutes per day.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrollment occurs online. Respondents follow an online screening procedure to determine eligiblity. If deemed eligible, they are provided with the participant information statement and subsequently the online informed consent form. After giving consent, they are asked to login and fill in the baseline questionnaires, after which they are randomised to the active or the control condition by the system. Random allocation is concealed by using automated computer-based randomisation procedures.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation occurs in blocks (4 per block), and stratified by gender and severity of suicidal thoughts. The latter is defined as endorsing ‘yes’ on item 5 of the ‘suicidal ideation’ section of the C-SSRS. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Power to detect change in suicidal thoughts is based on the expected effect of the intervention on the primary outcome measure. Based on the findings from the Dutch trial on which this trial is based, the expected effect size is 0.30 (Cohens d). To be able to detect this effect size, assuming a correlation between pre- and post-test measures of .5, including an expected drop-out rate of 30%, and allowing a width of about +/-.20 for the Confidence Intervals of the effect size, 285 starters (200 completers) would be needed in each condition (with alpha=0.05 and power of 0.80). The aim is therefore to include 570 participants in the trial.

Analyses of continuous measures will be undertaken on an intent-to-treat basis, including all participants randomized regardless of treatment actually received or withdrawal from the study. Mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analyses will be used as this approach provides an intent-to-treat analysis including all available data from participants under the missing at random assumption rather than excluding those with missing data or using biased techniques such as last observation carried forward. Potential moderators of outcome such as gender and age will be explored and controlled for in the analyses.</statisticalmethods>
