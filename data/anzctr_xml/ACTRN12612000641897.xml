    <scientifictitle>Evaluation of the ability of sports-medicine clinicians to accurately interpret a young athlete electrocardiogram with the assistance of a criteria tool versus their ability to evaluate the electrocardiogram using normal practise, in order to decide which electrocardiograms require further evaluation</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The provision to clinicians of an electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation criteria tool. This is a tool created by a team of clinician / researchers based on guidelines created by the European Society of Cardiology. It is used to provide clinicians with clarifications of ECG 'abnormalities' that may in fact be normal variants for an athlete. Assessment using the tool should take 2 to 2.5 hours (for assessment of 40 ECGs). This assessment is undertaken only once, with the other group performing the assessment without the tool (i.e. following usual practice).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be number of correctly interpreted ECGs compared with a gold standard interpretation in each group. The gold standard is determined by a world leader in sports cardiology who has assessed the ECGs (using his clinical expertise and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines) to determine which ECGs would see the athlete require further investigation.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Clinicians are asked to complete the intepretation of the an inital batch of ECGs and are then randmonised to treatment or control by a clinician not aware of the results of the first batch of ECGs. 

Allocation concealment is performed in that once a subject is deemed eligible for inclusion by one investigator, that information is passed to another investigator who assigns the subject a study ID. This latter individual holds an allocation schedule which then determines which Study IDs should receive the intervention and which should be the controls. The initial investigator is therefore not aware at the time that a subject is deemed eligible for inclusion as to which group they will be assigned to.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to document sensitivity and specificity when the ECGs of young athletes are interpreted by clinicians (excluding sports cardiologists) compared with interpretation by expert sports cardiologists. It also aims to assess the effectiveness of the ECG criteria tool in improving this sensitivity and specificity.</summary>
