  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To compare patient outcome, the primary endpoint being the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), associated with the use of either neostigmine and glycopyrrolate or sugammadex for the routine reversal of neuromuscular block following laparoscopic gynaecological surgery.
	
Secondary outcomes to be assessed include readiness to discharge, return of normal bowel function, patient recovery and well-being.</summary>
