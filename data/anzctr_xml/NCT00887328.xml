  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patients presenting with acute ischaemic stroke

          2. Patient, family member or legally responsible person depending on local ethics
             requirements has given informed consent

          3. Patient's age is =18 years

          4. Treatment onset can commence within = 3 - 9 hours after stroke onset according to
             registered product information, or within 4.5 - 9 hours according to locally accepted
             guidelines*.

             (*Guidelines are currently under international review - advisory statement issued by
             the Stroke Council, American Heart Association and American Stroke Association)

          5. Patients who wake with stroke may be included if neurological and other exclusion
             criteria are satisfied. These 'wake up' strokes are defined as having no symptoms at
             sleep onset, but stroke symptoms on waking. The time of stroke onset is to be taken as
             the mid-point between sleep onset (or last known to be normal) and time of waking. The
             maximum time window for randomisation is then 9 hours from the mid-point as described.

          6. NIHSS score of = 4 - 26 with clinical signs of hemispheric infarction.

          7. Penumbral imaging** -Using a Tmax &gt; 6 second delay, a perfusion (PWI)lesion volume to
             diffusion (DWI) lesion volume ratio &gt;1.2, a DWI volume =70mL and a PWI-DWI difference
             &gt;10 ml.

               -  Patients may be consented before or after penumbral screening depending upon
                  local practice. The entire cohort of patients consented onto the study will be
                  followed up with clinical assessments and biomarker studies regardless of
                  eligibility for randomisation to treatment based on penumbral mismatch criteria</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) identified by CT or MRI

          2. Rapidly improving symptoms, particularly if in the judgment of the managing clinician
             that the improvement is likely to result in the patient having an NIHSS score of &lt; 4
             at randomization

          3. Pre-stroke MRS score of = 2 (indicating previous disability)

          4. Contra indication to imaging with MR with contrast agents

             year

          8. Any condition that could impose hazards to the patient if study therapy is initiated
             or affect the participation of the patient in the study (this applies to patients with
             severe microangiopathy such as haemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic
             thrombocytopenic purpura). The judgment is left to the discretion of the Investigator.

          9. Pregnant women (clinically evident)

         10. Previous stroke within last three months

         11. Recent past history or clinical presentation of ICH, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH),
             arterio-venous (AV) malformation, aneurysm, or cerebral neoplasm. At the discretion of
             each Investigator.

             local laboratory normal range.

         14. Use of glycoprotein IIb - IIIa inhibitors within the past 72 hours. Use of single or
             dual agent oral platelet inhibitors (clopidogrel and/or low-dose aspirin) prior to
             study entry is permitted.

         15. Clinically significant hypoglycaemia.

         16. Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a blood pressure &gt; 185 mmHg systolic or &gt;110 mmHg
             diastolic on at least 2 separate occasions at least 10 minutes apart, or requiring
             aggressive treatment to reduce the blood pressure to within these limits. The
             definition of "aggressive treatment" is left to the discretion of the responsible
             Investigator.

         17. Hereditary or acquired haemorrhagic diathesis

         18. Gastrointestinal or urinary bleeding within the preceding 21 days

         19. Major surgery within the preceding 14 days which poses risk in the opinion of the
             investigator.

         20. Exposure to a thrombolytic agent within the previous 72 hours</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary hypothesis being tested in this trial is that ischaemic stroke patients selected
      with significant penumbral mismatch (measured by MRI criteria) at 3 - 9 hours post onset of
      stroke will have improved clinical outcomes when given intravenous tissue plasminogen
      activator (tPA) compared to placebo.</summary>
