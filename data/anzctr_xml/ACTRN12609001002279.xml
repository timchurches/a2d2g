  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants receive four types of instant coffee beverages with varying levels of caffeine over four study visits separated by at least a one week washout period. One coffee beverage is administered per study visit, in a within-subject, crossover study design. Each beverage contains 6g coffee dissolved in 300ml boiling water with milk if desired.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being conducted to see the effects of various coffee beverages on cognitive function, brain activity and mood in healthy older adults. The study will compare the effect of different types of instant coffee beverages. We will measure brain activity and performance on different cognitive and computer tasks before and after four different coffee beverages.</summary>
