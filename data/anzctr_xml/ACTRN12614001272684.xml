  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment program involves 12 sessions (delivered over 14 weeks) of individual and family-based CBT based on a program entitled "Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Childhood OCD" (Piacentini, Langley, &amp; Roblek, 2007). Individual sessions (with the child) are conducted weekly and family sessions (the child and at least one parent) are conducted every second session, in addition to the individual session. Each session lasts 60 minutes (family and individual). Child-focused sessions focus on psychoeducation about OCD, exposure and response prevention, and cognitive therapy to target unhelpful beliefs. Child-focused sessions also include a brief 10 to 15 minute check in with parents towards the end of the session to outline skills learnt in the session and home-practice activities. Homework assignments will involve exposure exercises (imaginal or in vivo) and behavioural experiments for the children and limits on accommodation for parent(s).
 
In addition to accompanying their child to weekly child-focused sessions, parents are asked to attend six 60-minute family sessions with their child on a fortnightly basis. These sessions are in addition to the usual 60-minute session. On weeks where there is a family session scheduled, parents may not need to join the child-focused session. Family sessions conducted fortnightly involve both the parents and the child.  Family sessions include education about OCD in order to reduce negative feelings of guilt and blame and to normalise family functioning in an OCD context. They are also designed to support families in better managing challenges associated with OCD. This includes assistance with managing emotions, improving communication and skills related to working well together as a family.

The results pertaining to this manual show that 12 sessions over 14 weeks are adequate to achieve significant improvement in OCD symptoms and family functioning. The treatment program demonstrates comparable outcomes when compared to other well-regarded treatment manuals for pediatric OCD (e.g., Barrett, Healy-Farrell, &amp; March, 2004; Pediatric OCD Treatment Study Team, 2004; Storch et al., 2007). This program was also selected due to suitability for both child and adolescent populations. In addition, the program includes a substantial family component relevant to research aims and in line with published literature highlighting the importance of targeting family factors to improve treatment outcomes.
 
We are implementing an updated version of this manual (Peris &amp; Piacentini, 2013). This updated CBT treatment manual has recently been trialled with improved outcomes compared to the original version (Peris &amp; Piacentini, 2014; Piacentini, Langley, &amp; Roblek, 2007). Written permission has been received from the authors of the manual to implement the updated program as part of the treatment tracking series.

Treatment for the OCD treatment tracking series will be conducted by Sharlene Mantz (Registered Psychologist/USYD PhD candidate) and Chloe McGrath (Registered Clinical Psychologist/USYD MSc candidate). These clinicians are experienced in the assessment and treatment of OCD in children and adolescents, and have current working with children checks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study uses a multiple baseline design with participants serving as their own controls. This is achieved by monitoring participants for 2-3 weeks prior to commencing treatment.

Monitoring of participants will involve asking them to complete questionnaires at home weekly for 2 to 3 weeks before commencing the treatment program. Questionnaires will include both pre-treatment and tracking measures.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We have carefully considered the number of variables (based on weekly tracking measures for OCD symptoms, family accommodation, and cognitive appraisal variables) and tracking time points. The number of participants needed to achieve study objectives was then determined with a power analysis. Based on a single group within-subjects design with 15 tracking time points, power at .8 and a medium effect size (.25), 11 participants are required for statistical significance. Based on a small effect size (.20) 17 participants are needed. Although we expect a moderate to large effect over time, based on treatment studies implementing a similar treatment program with children with OCD (e.g., Peris &amp; Piacentini, 2013; Piacentini et al., 2011) we have accounted for a small effect size in our power analyses in the unlikely event that this occurs.

In taking a conservative approach, we are aiming to recruit a sample of approximately 20 participants. This will enable us to compare the trajectories for specific variables across treatment, thus allowing us to achieve our research aims. In addition, we may divide participants into those who responded early to the program and those who achieved gains later and assess whether these patterns are related to final post treatment outcome. Power analysis for this comparison requires 18 participants.

We have also done a review of the literature, with published studies encompassing similar sample sizes that sufficiently accommodate for the relevant statistical analyses. For example, Ginsburg, Burstein, Becker, and Drake (2011) applied a multiple baseline design and assessed weekly parental ratings of OCD behaviours and family accommodation across seven families (3-8 year old children) during a 12-week intervention designed to reduce compulsive behaviour (via ERP) and improve parenting practices. Sukhodolsky, Gorman, Scahill, Findley, and McGuire (2013) applied a multiple-baseline design to investigate the effects of ERP in six children (age range 9-14 years) with OCD and disruptive behavior. Weekly ratings of OCD symptoms and severity were obtained. Wilson (2003) used a multiple baseline design to examine the efficacy of cognitive therapy for OCD and explore mechanisms of change. Six people with OCD received 10-18 sessions of weekly cognitive therapy and completed structured clinical interviews, validated self-report measures, and idiographic diary ratings along the way. 

The study has a within-subjects repeated measures design with approximately 20 children with OCD. Repeated measures ANCOVAs and multiple regressions will be used to assess change trajectories for key variables and to assess rate of change across treatment programme both in terms of any sudden patient gains and comparison of change rate for key appraisals and family variables.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study seeks to further understand the role of thinking styles and family factors in children and adolescents suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The study will achieve this by providing Cognitive Behavioural Treatment to a small number of children with OCD while adopting a session by session tracking method. An approved treatment protocol will be applied by an experienced clinician(s), and a variety of measures will be used each session to allow for a thorough investigation into the relationship between thinking styles and family factors and the nature of OCD symptom change.</summary>
