    <healthcondition>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of regular morning cleaning of lenses with a multipurpose disinfection solution as a means of reducing microbial keratitis and other contact lens related ocular inflammatory adverse events.</healthcondition>

    <interventions>Prospective, open label, bilateral, clinical trial to investigate daily, morning cleaning of silicone hydrogel contact lenses worn during  three months extended wear as a strategy for reducing adverse events associated with contact lens wear in neophyte and experienced lens wearers. Lenses will be worn for one month extended wear (i.e. during the day and night). Each morning, following waking, the lenses will be removed, several drops of COMPLETE multipurpose solution easy-rub formula (PHMB/polyhexamethylene biguanide 0.0001%; Abbott Medical Optics, USA) applied to the lens. The lenses are then cleaned by rubbing and then rinsing with the same solution and then reinserting on eye.</interventions>
    <comparator>The proposed study will be compared to a historical control conducted in 2008-09 at L V Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), Hyderabad.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction of contact lens related ocular adverse events compared to adverse event rates in a historical control trial and previously conducted similar trials conducted at the LV Prasad Eye Institute. Examples of contact lens related ocular adverse events include infiltrative keratitis, peripheral and non-infectious corneal ulcer, acute red-eye responses and microbial keratitis. The primary tool used to assess these adverse events is the slit-lamp biomicroscopy.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>-Able to read, comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent;
-Be at least 18 years old;
-Be willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the investigator;
-Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses;
-Have vision that is correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses;
-Be experienced or may be inexperienced at wearing contact lenses;</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-Have previously experienced a severe or significant contact lens related ocular adverse event including  microbial keratitis (MK), infiltrative keratitis (IK), contact lens acute red eye (CLARE) and/or contact lens peripherial ulcer (CLPU).
-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
-Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
-An active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect wearing of contact lenses;
-Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication up to 12 weeks prior to and during the trial;
-Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or risk providing a false positive. 
N.B. Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial;  
-Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Any rigid gas permeable (RGP) or orthokeratology lens wear within the previous 2 weeks;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Currently enrolled in a clinical trial
-Participated in another clinical trial that may have affected vision or ocular physiology within the previous 2 weeks;
-Be pregnant</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis for this study is that regular lens cleaning (using a rub and rinse technique) with a multipurpose disinfection solution during extended wear exposes the eye to a clean lens surface thereby reducing bacterial build-up on the lens surface resulting in less bacterially driven ocular adverse events.</summary>
