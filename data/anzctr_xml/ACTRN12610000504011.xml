  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anterior lumbar plexus nerve block (regional nerve block) known as a fascia iliaca compartment block. 
This procedure involves a single insertion of needle in a specified anatomical location in the groin, distal to recognised neurovascular areas. A single bolus of local anaesthetic agent (Lignocaine 2% with Adrenaline 1:200 000) is injected slowly over 3 minutes into the potential space under the fascia iliaca and spread to anaesthetise the sensory nerves innervating the thigh. Dose weight dependant : &lt;70 Kg 300mg and &gt;70 Kg 400mg.

All patients consenting to partcipate in the study will receive a loading dose of 0.1 mg/Kg of morphine intravenously (I.V) in 2.5 mg aliquots.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised into the controlled group will only receive (after the initial loading dose of morphine) further increments of morphine (2.5 mg every 2 minutes) until pain free at rest or to a maximum dose of 0.5mg/kg.
Patients randomised to the intervention group will not receive further morphine (after initial loading dose) until assessment of the outcome 15 minutes post completion of the fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB).</comparator>

      <outcome>Functional sensory deficit  will be conduct 15 and 120 minutes and post FICB intervention. 

Patients who receive the FICB will also be asked to determine or assess the level sensory cold perception in three areas of the effected thigh (medial. anterior and lateral aspects). Paramedics will use an ice pack and using other body areas as a base line ask the patients to determine their level of cold perception following FICB intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time point: This will be assessed at interval of 15 mins post FICB and at 120 mins.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>Time point: Patient will be asked to rate their satisfaction level of either analgesic method using a Likert Scale after 120 mins.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Significance of the study: Femoral fracture is an important clinical problem and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially in the elderly. Whilst opioids are the most commonly used analgesic by emergency medical services (EMS) there is some evidence that these may be inferior to alternate analgesic methods such as femoral nerve blocks. Studies to date have not evaluated the feasibility or effectiveness of paramedics performing this analgesic alternative. Alternatives like femoral nerve blocks could prevent complications of opioids although these agents are well tolerated and have a low complication rate when administered in this setting.
 The aim of this research is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of paramedics performing fascia iliaca compartment blocks (FICB) in the prehospital setting with adult patients with suspected or confirmed femoral fractures. The effectiveness of FICB will be compared to intravenous morphine.</summary>
