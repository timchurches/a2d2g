  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)
Treatment: surgery - Surgery

Experimental: NT-501 Implant - The investigational product is the NT-501 encapsulated cell system which consists of cells encapsulated within a semi-permeable polymer membrane and supportive matrices. NT-501 contains NTC-201 cells that were derived from the NTC-200 cell line by genetic modification so as to secrete recombinant human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).

Sham Comparator: Sham procedure - Non-penetrating sham procedure to mimic implant procedure


Other interventions: Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)


Treatment: surgery: Surgery
Surgery to implant device for NT-501 arm and sham surgery for Sham arm
