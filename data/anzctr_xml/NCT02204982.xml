  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - IPI-145 (duvelisib)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Rituximab

Experimental: IPI-145 + Rituximab - IPI-145 is administered orally and supplied as 5 mg and 25 mg formulated capsules.
Rituximab is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion and is supplied in single-use vials at two strengths, 100 mg and 500 mg.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo + Rituximab - Placebo is administered orally and supplied as formulated capsules to match the active 5 mg and 25 mg capsules.
Rituximab is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion and is supplied in single-use vials at two strengths, 100 mg and 500 mg.


Treatment: drugs: IPI-145 (duvelisib)
IPI-145 (25 mg BID) administered orally in 28-day continuous treatment cycles

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Matching Placebo (25 mg BID) administered orally in 28-day continuous treatment cycles.

Treatment: drugs: Rituximab
IV infusion of rituximab (375 mg/m2) once weekly for 4 weeks during Cycle 1, then once on Day 1 of Cycles 4, 6, 8, and 10.
