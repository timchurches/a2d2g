    <interventions>Dual chamber pacemaker device - MVP+APP+aATP algorithm group
Intervention period: 12 months

1.	Managed ventricular pacing 
MVP is an atrial-based pacing mode that is designed to switch to a dual-chamber pacing mode in the presence of AV block. Specifically, MVP provides the following functions:
*AAI(R) mode pacing when AV conduction is intact
*The ability to switch to DDD(R) pacing during AV block
*Periodic conduction checks while operating in DDD(R) mode, with the ability to switch back to AAI(R) mode when AV conduction resumes
*Back-up ventricular support for transient loss of AV conduction

2.	Atrial Preference Pacing (APP)
The device includes three atrial preventive pacing algorithms designed to eliminate some of the onset mechanisms of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to reduce the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias. These atrial pacing features comprise the atrial pacing preference algorithm, for maintenance of a pacing rate just above the intrinsic rate, the atrial rate stabilization algorithm, designed to avoid short-long intervals following a premature atrial contraction, and the post-mode switching overdrive pacing algorithm designed to inhibit early re-initiation of atrial tachyarrhythmia following a mode switching episode.

3.	Reactive atrial Anti-tachycardia pacing 
If the device detects an atrial tachyarrhythmia episode, aATP therapy will be delivered. Treatments for such episodes are intended to interrupt the atrial tachycardia and restore patients normal sinus rhythm. 
The device can deliver up to 3 aATP therapies to treat an AT/AF or a Fast AT/AF episode. aATP therapies become available when the duration of sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias exceeds the programmed value of episode duration before aATP delivery -  which in this study will be set at 0 minute.
When an AT/AF or Fast AT/AF episode is detected, the device delivers the first sequence of the ATP therapy. After the first ATP sequence, it continues to monitor for the presence of the atrial tachycardia episode. If it redetects the atrial tachycardia episode, the device and repeats this cycle until the episode is terminated or all sequences in the therapy are exhausted.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated based on the study that showed a recurrence rate of 48.6% after AF ablation in patients with paroxysmal AF and prolonged sinus pauses and a 49% relative reduction in the DDDR with all algorithm ON (MVP+APP+aATP) versus DDDR+MVP group, with a power of 80%, a confidence interval of 95%, and an assumed rate of loss to follow-up of 10%. Based on the calculation, it is planned to recruit 68 patients in each arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The scientific literature shows that there is an increased risk of developing AF in patients implanted with a pacemaker due to sinus node dysfunction. To overcome this, advance algorithms were developed to reduce the  AF burden. 

The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the specific pacemaker algorithms in question contribute to the suppression of AF. It is expected that the finding of this research will aid in the development of best practice guidelines for patients with pacemaker devices.
