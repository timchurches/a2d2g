Experimental: Amyloid Negative Subjects - Approximately 10 cognitively normal young subjects will receive a single i.v. bolus injection of approximately 370 megabecquerel (MBq) (10 millicurie [mCi]) florbetapir (18F) and a single i.v. bolus injection of approximately 555 MBq (15 mCi) 11C-PiB.

Experimental: Amyloid Positive Subjects - Approximately 25 subjects with a range of amyloid density comprised of subjects clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and subjects at risk for elevated amyloid density will receive a single i.v. bolus injection of approximately 370 MBq (10 mCi) florbetapir (18F) and a single i.v. bolus injection of approximately 555 MBq (15 mCi) 11C-PiB.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Florbetapir SUVr Conversion to Centiloid Units - Conversion of florbetapir (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) to Centiloid units. The Centiloid is anchored at values of 0 and 100 corresponding to the median Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB) SUVr value for a representative group of young (&lt;45) cognitively and medically healthy control subjects (YHC) and the median SUVr value for a representative group of 11C-PiB positive patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, respectively. A cortical average to cerebellum SUVr was used for this outcome measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 70 minutes post injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of Florbetapir (18F) Centiloid and 11C-PiB Centiloid - Correlation coefficient between 11C-PiB and florbetapir (18F) SUVr as converted to centiloid units. The Centiloid is anchored at values of 0 and 100 corresponding to the median Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB) SUVr value for a representative group of young (&lt;45) cognitively and medically healthy control subjects (YHC) and the median SUVr value for a representative group of 11C-PiB positive patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, respectively. A cortical average to cerebellum SUVr was used for this outcome measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 70 minutes post injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Variability of PET Images in Young Healthy Control Subjects. - Coefficient of variation for 11C-PiB and florbetapir (18F) SUVr. A cortical average to cerebellum SUVr was used for this outcome measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 70 minutes post injection</timepoint>
