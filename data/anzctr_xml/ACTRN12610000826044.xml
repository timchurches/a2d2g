Participants of ALL ethnicities were recruited from four specific locations-  Auckland, Hawkes Bay, Nelson, and Christchurch where participants could receive either face-to-face or telephone interventions by the participating practitioners. 

Each practitioner was a currently practicing clinician within a Ministry funded problem gambling service, with the relevant training and years of experiences in working with individuals affected by problem gambling and their significant others.  In other words, they were competent practitioners that provided support and treatment for the clients that presented to this trial. 

The study was described as XGAMBLE to all participants, who were aware that different groups would have different intervention modalities made available to them. 

Participants commenced interventions from one of the two treatment arms: face-to-face and telephone. The primary intervention model or intervention procedures adopted in this trial were informed by the Intervention Manual (citation: Manual Writing Group. (2006). Manual of procedures: Problem gambling intervention studies. Auckland: Centre for Gambling Studies, University of Auckland, please contact Tse for details, samsont@hku.hk).  All of the services provided were free, strictly confidential and delivered in a professional manner.

The writing of the manual was contributed to jointly, by a group of senior practitioners working in the field of problem gambling interventions. They were invited to join the group on the basis of: 1) practitioners experiences in the sector, 2) experiences in writing intervention manuals or protocols within their own organisation or professional groups; and, 3) expertise and insights in working with specific population groups. A two-day workshop was held at the School of Population Health at Tamaki Campus, University of Auckland on 17th and 18th July 2006. 

The Manual includes helpful hints for problem gambling counselling and a list of common interventions used by most gambling practitioners (see below). Not every practitioner would use the same interventions for each client.

Face-to-face and Telephone services
Intervention services were provided according to the Interventions Manual which outlined the assessments, major intervention approaches and activities/tasks to be performed by practitioners.  These were identical for both face-to-face and telephone interventions.
 
There was no restriction on the frequency or duration of counselling sessions - that is, this trial evaluated the delivery of intervention services in a naturalistic setting. Similarly, if they were deemed to be appropriate, the services could offer any culturally-specific interventions. 

The intensive part of the intervention lasted up to six sessions; intervention period could spread up to 3 months. Practitioners were asked to complete a form documenting the major elements and/or activities of the services provided for each client involved in this study. 'End of the intervention' was operationally defined as when clients completed their planned treatment, OR failed to attend 2 or more consecutive sessions, OR when clients advised that they no longer wish to continue.

The evaluation of intervention integrity was performed by a multi-disciplinary team comprising of experts on the two problem gambling treatment modalities and experienced researchers, including those from relevant ethnic backgrounds. The monitoring and evaluation process took place in the following steps:
* Definition: The major treatment models that are utilised in intervention services were defined (i.e. written in the Intervention Manual).
* Formative evaluations: These were also conducted on the experiences of participants (in terms of both clients and practitioners). 
* Evaluation: Evaluative stages also included documentation and feedback from the participating practitioners upon the termination of intervention. Examples of information collected from the practitioners included: 
1. Any reasons for termination (e.g. as planned, failure to attend, or I am OK now).
2. A brief summary of what was covered over the course of the intervention.
3. Outcomes achieved.
4. Evaluation of efficacy of interventions:
a. In respect to the goals set, which have been achieved?
b. What was most helpful about the intervention?  
c. What did not work?</interventions>

Intervention services were provided according to the Interventions Manual which outlined the assessments, major intervention approaches and activities/tasks to be performed by practitioners.  The general contents were identical for both face-to-face and telephone interventions. We did not direct the number, frequency or duration of sessions; the counsellors would determine as what they would normally do in their real, pragmatic practice.</comparator>

    <concealment>Randomisation: 
1. Randomisation was achieved through a Central Telephone Service (research call centre) via a web-based computer system.
2. The telephone service was staffed by research staff/associates, not practitioners.
3. Consenting participants were randomly assigned to one of the two intervention arms, stratified by practitioners.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method used to generate the random allocation sequence was computer-based and called ‘stratified minimisation'. Randomisation was stratified by practitioners to ensure that roughly equal numbers of participants allocated to each practitioner were randomised to each of the two intervention arms. The distribution between groups was similar.

Schedule of intervention and measures 
1. Informed consent was requested following an introduction to the research and ascertaining that the potential participant had met ‘participant eligibility’.
2. Demographic and baseline data were collected.
3. Random allocation of the participant to one of the two groups (face-to-face or telephone modality). All the participating practitioners, in both modalities, are qualified practitioners recruited from the Ministry funded problem gambling services. They have undergone training in the use of Intervention Manual for the present trial to make sure the practitioners are competent to provide the interventions in either face-to-face or telephone modality. 
4. Allocation of the participant to the appropriate service and notification of the practitioner.
5. The practitioner contacted the participant and commenced the intervention. The intervention was considered completed for the purpose of the present trial after six sessions (as suggested by the participating practitioners). For those clients who required more than six sessions, they continued to receive intervention services, and the post-evaluation form was filled in by the responsible practitioner. 
6. Following termination of the intervention, the Project Team were notified by the practitioner.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The specific aims of this research were:
1. To investigate the effectiveness of these interventions in controlling gambling behaviours and reducing harm caused by problem gambling
2. To investigate the effectiveness of these interventions, with regard to the magnitude of effect
3. To provide preliminary information on the relative effectiveness of the interventions for ethnic groups (NZ European, Maori, Pacific and Asian)
4. To develop and recommend processes for future studies to extend research in the field of problem gambling.

The trial was completed in early 2008, the summary is as follow:
Aims:  To compare the effectiveness of integrated interventions delivered by telephone and face-to-face counselling in controlling gambling behaviours and reducing harm caused by problem gambling. 
Design: Pragmatic randomised clinical trial. 
Setting: New Zealand. 
Participants: Ninety-two participants affected by problem gambling were provided with psychological interventions delivered either by telephone counselling or conventional face-to-face counselling over a period of 3 months. 
Measurement:  Gambling behaviours (total hours and total money spent gambling over the last four weeks, and proportion of total money spent gambling to total income over the last four weeks) and psychological functioning (gambling attitudes and beliefs) were measured at baseline, post-intervention and six-week follow-up. 
Findings: A significant overall PERIOD effect between pre- and post-intervention assessments was found for total money spent over the last four weeks (p &lt; .05); total hours spent over the last four weeks (p &lt; .05); proportion of total money over income over the last four weeks (p &lt; .01); and the score on gambling attitudes and beliefs (p &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in effect size between the two groups.
Conclusion: The clinical outcomes of psychological intervention for problem gambling delivered by telephone was equivalent to the counselling delivered face-to- face and similar levels of self-rated satisfaction and effectiveness were reported.</summary>
