  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ventilation with intermittent positive pressure noninvasive (NIPPV) was conducted by non-invasive ventilator synchrony spontaneous-timed (ST) Bilevel pressure (BiPAP), marca registrada, (Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA), in spontaneous-timed mode (ST), with positive inspiratory pressure (IPAP) adjusted 12 cm water, expiratory positive pressure (EPAP ) on 8 cm water, inspiratory time of 0.8 seconds, the respiratory rate of 08 breaths per minute, the rise time of 1 second, the slope of 0.5 cm water and oxygen flow to 4 L / min. Used as patient-ventilator interface nasal mask with headgear.
NIPPV was performed in the first four hours of post-operative period immediately after extubation in recovery room</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group received support oxygen at 4 L / minute via nasal cannula type glasses, after extubation, according to the protocol of the service.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Statistical difference in relation to loss of vital capacity (CV) in the first postoperative day, compared to preoperative values between the groups.
The CV was measured using the analog Ohmeda  spirometer, model RM 121, Japan, with the patient seated with supported
feet, nostrils occluded with nose clip, starting from total lung capacity (CPT) to residual volume (VR ) and performed three measures, with 1 minute between them and adopting as a result most of them.</outcome>
      <timepoint>It was considered preoperatively the day before surgery, and postoperative day 1 (twenty four hour after surgery). All measurements were performed by the same examiner.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Statistical difference in relation to loss of Maximal inspiratory mouth pressures (PIMAX) in the first postoperative day, compared to preoperative values between the groups.
The PIMAX was obtained with the use of a manometer Support  brand, class B, Brazilian industry, with scale ranging from 0 to 150 cm water, connected to the patient through the mouthpiece of hard plastic. We measured the Pimax from the VR, always with the patient seated and with the nostrils occluded with a nose clip. A small hole was made in the nozzle to prevent glottic closure during the maneuver, the cheeks were contained by a hand of the patient. Every effort should be sustained for at least 1 second. The maneuver was repeated three to five times, until three values were obtained with a variation less than 10% between them, with 1 minute between efforts. Adopted as a result of greater extent, except that arising from the last manobra. The reference equations for maximal respiratory pressures proposed by Pereirawere used.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Statistical difference in relation to loss partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and oxygen saturation in arterial blood (SaO2) in the first postoperative day, compared to preoperative values between the groups.
The arterial blood was collected in the radial artery with the patient breathing room air, supine, using a 1 ml syringe, lubricate it with heparin, needle size 4.5 x 13 mm, preoperative and postoperative day 1. The processing of the examination was conducted in the gas tank brand Radiometer ABL 700 Series.</outcome>
      <timepoint>It was considered preoperatively the day before surgery, and postoperative day 1 (twenty four hour after surgery). All measurements were performed by the same examiner</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of the incidence of abdominal distention and / or leakage of anastomosis between the groups.
The integrity of the gastro-jejunal anastomosis was evaluated by the surgeon in charge, before the start of feeding in the second PO, test using methylene blue procedure, the dilution of 5 ml of methylene blue in 100 ml saline, administered orally, 20 in 20 ml every twenty minutes until the end of the solution. The result was evaluated by the drain of the abdominal cavity, positioned near the gastro-anastomosis jejunal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Was considered second post-operative, the period of forty-eight hours after surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of the incidence of atelectasia and / or pneumoperitoneum between the groups.
Chest radiography was performed on the third postoperative day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Was considered third post-operative, the period of seventy-two hours after surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All patients had normal chest X-ray preoperatively, with low risk for developing pulmonary complications in the postoperative period according to the Torrington &amp; Henderson.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The moment of the evaluation were preoperative . It was considered preoperatively the day before surgery</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This study has evaluated the effect of noninvasive ventilation with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) on the lung function, incidence of post-operatory lung complications and development of post-operatory anastomotic disruption in morbid obese patients that underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure (RYGB). The BiPAP on the postoperatory of the gastroplasty was useful for the improving the oxygenation, do not increase the incidence of postoperative anastomotic disruption .</summary>
