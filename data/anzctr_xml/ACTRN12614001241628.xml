  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women who experience the pregnancy disease pre-eclampsia, and in particular those who develop the disease before 38 weeks of a pregnancy, are more likely to have high blood levels of the chemical homocysteine. They are also at higher risk of pre-eclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy. High levels of homocysteine have been shown to make blood vessels more prone to clog up, one of the underlying processes of pre-eclampsia. High blood levels of homocysteine can usually be reduced by taking the vitamin folic acid. It is not known, however, whether this can effect the chances of pre-eclampsia happening again. This study will help to determine whether taking a folic acid supplement can prevent recurrent pre-eclampsia in women with high homocysteine levels.
Women in the trial will receive either folic acid or a placebo tablet.  Neither the women nor their carers will know which treatment they are receiving.</summary>
