  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants were randomised to receive each of the following interventions in a random order: control intervention, where participants performed squats in the platform, without vibration; squats with whole body vibration frequency of 25 Hz  and squats with whole body vibration frequency of 50 Hz. The participants were invited to visit the facilities for 3 times and the cross-over trial had a wash out period of one week. The intervention was squatting with whole body vibration for 60 seconds, followed by 60 seconds of rest, with five repetitions. The exercises were supervised by physiotherapists trained in the method.</interventions>
    <comparator>No secondary control group. The subjects will be their own control. The control intervention was squatting without whole body vibration for 60 seconds, followed by 60 seconds of rest, with five repetitions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: Whole body vibration exercises consist in performing exercise on a platform which transmits mechanical stimuli (vibration) to the anatomic area in contact with the platform and that propagate throughout the body. Objective: The aim of the present study is to analyze the electromyographic response of the thigh muscles exposed to different vibrational frequencies, when compared to a non vibration condition. Methods: Eight male participants (mean age 24,13+/-1,55) were randomly exposed to two synchronous vibration frequencies (25Hz and 50Hz) and a non-vibration control procedure during squatting, while monitored with surface EMG.</summary>
