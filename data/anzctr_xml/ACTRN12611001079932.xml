    <interventions>Group A: FES Cycling Group
Participants assigned to this group will undertake up to 60 minutes (excluding preparation time) of leg cycling 4 days/week for 12 weeks using a Hasomed RehaStim FES Unit attached to a MOTOmed cycle at a pedal cadence between 25-50 rev/min. This can be undertaken as a single session or split into two sessions per day, depending on the participants performance and the availability of staff. Surface electrodes will be applied to gluteal, quadriceps, and hamstrings muscles (not calves). Stimulation intensity will be gradually increased to a maximum of 140 mA, pulse width of 0.3  0.5ms and frequency of 35Hz and this will be sufficient to induce vigorous muscle contractions (Fornusek &amp; Davis, 2008). Participants will exercise at the maximal power output possible at their level of recovery. Therapists will evaluate the degree of muscle contraction, power output and fatigue, and adjust parameters appropriately to maximise time, intensity, and power of training with a principle of overloading the muscle. When fatigue occurs, cycling can be stopped and then re-commenced after a 5 min break if muscle contraction can be elicited again. For participants with some degree of volitional muscle activity, the settings will be adjusted to ensure that resistance is maintained.
While patients are confined to bed, the MOTOmed Letto cycle will be attached to the end of the bed and patients will cycle whilst supine. The use of a similar cycle to exercise critically ill patients in ICU has resulted in no adverse events (Burtin et al. 2009). Once mobilised, patients may use an upright RT300 or MOTOmed Viva cycle attached to their wheelchair.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group B: Passive Cycling Group
Participants allocated to this group will undertake up to 60 minutes (excluding preparation time) passive cycling 4 days/week at identical pedal cadence to Group A. This can be undertaken as a single session or split into two sessions per day, depending on the participants performance and the availability of staff. Cycling while the participant is confined to bed will be with the MOTOmed Letto device and, once mobilised into a wheelchair, may use the RT300 or MOTOmed Viva cycle but without FES-evoked contractions.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will participate in pre-screening, then screening and baseline visits prior to randomisation. Eligible participants will be randomised to one of two groups: 1. Group A - FES-Cycling or 2. Group B - Passive-Cycling. Randomisation will be stratified by injury status (ASIA A, B or C) and co-ordinated by a central randomisation unit. Upon completion of all screening and baseline assessments and suitability checks, a participant eligibility checklist will be completed by the Site Coordinator and signed by the Principal Investigator. This checklist will be sent to the central randomisation unit who will notify the Site Coordinator of treatment assignment. This will not be disclosed to the Blinded Assessors.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a multi-centre, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled Phase I trial in people with spinal cord injury. This study is funded by a grant from the Victorian Neurotrauma Initiative. A total of 50 participants with complete or incomplete spinal cord injury will be randomised into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The control group will undertake a passive cycling program using a bed bike while in the acute ward and an upright bike once they progress to rehabilitation. The experimental group will undertake a FES-assisted cycling program using a bed bike while in the acute ward and an upright bike once they progress to rehabilitation. Both programs will consist of 60 minutes of training 4 times per week for 12 weeks. Training will commence once the participant is considered medically stable (a minimum 5 days post-injury, maximum 4 weeks post-injury).
The main objective of the study is to determine the relative effectiveness of FES-assisted cycling compared to passive cycling on muscle cross-sectional area of thigh and calf. 
The total study duration is 2 years, including an 18month recruitment period, a 12 week treatment period and post-intervention  assessments (within a week of last treatment).</summary>
