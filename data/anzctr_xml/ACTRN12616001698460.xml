    <interventions>This study is an observational study to test Interdevice agreement", Interoperator agreement" and "time point agreement" using the TEG6S (Registered) device. No results  results will be used by any clinician to influence patient care.

Skilled operators of the TEG6S (Registered) device will  collect 3.5mL whole blood in citrated tubes from 25 adult patients in a tertiary level intensive care unit. Measurements will be performed by one operator on two TEG6S (Registered) devices i.e. (Interdevice agreement). 

Then, 5 different skilled operators will perform sample analyses from 5 healthy volunteers, perform measurements using 5 TEG6S (Registered) devices i.e. (Interoperator agreement). 

Finally, a single operator will perform 15 measurements on 4 TEG6S (Registered) devices, with samples from 5 healthy volunteers, 5 surgical, and 5 ICU patients. Agreement across pre-set time points (0, 15, 60, 120 and 180 minutes) (Timepoint agreement) will be examined. 

Duration of follow up will be until each test has been completed. This takes approximately 60 minutes. There is no patient follow up as this study is device validation study.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis was performed using commercial statistical software STATA/IC v.13 with a p value of 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. Interdevice agreement was estimated using Lins condordance coefficient and further validated using intraclass correlation coefficients and reduced major axis regression. Lins concordance assesses the degree of agreement between two continuous variables and calculates the value of Lins concordance correlation coefficient. Values of 1 denote perfect concordance; a value of zero denotes its complete absence. Interoperator and Timepoint agreement was assessed using the Intraclass correlation coefficient estimated by a random effect regression model. Intraclass correlation is the assessment of consistency or reproducibility of quantitative measurements, made by different operators or across different time points using the same device. Due to the pragmatic and exploratory nature of the study, power calculations were not performed. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TEG6S (Haemonetics Corp, USA) is a novel haemostasis analyser that measures viscoelasticity properties of blood using resonance technology. We assessed agreement of the TEG6S analyser between devices, operators, and across multiple time points. 

We collected 3.5mL whole blood in citrated tubes from 25 adult patients in a tertiary level intensive care unit (ICU). Measurements were performed by one operator on two TEG6S devices (Interdevice agreement). Then, 5 different operators performed sample analysis from 5 healthy volunteers, using 5 TEG6S devices (Interoperator agreement). Finally, a single operator performed 15 measurements on 4 TEG6S devices, with samples from 5 healthy volunteers, 5 surgical, and 5 ICU patients. Agreement across pre-set time points (0, 15, 60, 120 and 180 minutes) (Timepoint agreement) was examined. Interdevice agreement was estimated using Lins condordance coefficient and further validated using intraclass correlation coefficients and reduced major axis regression. Interoperator and Timepoint agreement was assessed using the Intraclass correlation coefficient estimated by a random effect regression model.</summary>
