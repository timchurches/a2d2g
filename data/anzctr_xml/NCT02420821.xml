  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PDL1 antibody
Treatment: drugs - Bevacizumab
Treatment: drugs - Sunitinib

Experimental: Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab - Participants assigned to a dual regimen of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab will receive both agents until pre-defined study end, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever occurs first.

Active Comparator: Sunitinib - Participants assigned to receive sunitinib single-agent chemotherapy will receive treatment until pre-defined study end, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever occurs first.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), an engineered anti-PDL1 antibody
Atezolizumab at a fixed dose of 1200 milligrams (mg) via intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 22 of each 42-day cycle until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, or death.

Treatment: drugs: Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab as 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) via IV infusion on Days 1 and 22 of each 42-day cycle until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, or death.

Treatment: drugs: Sunitinib
Sunitinib as 50 mg orally, once daily on Days 1 through 28 of each 42-day cycle until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, or death.
