  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this Phase 2a study is to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose of
      ANAVEX2-73 in patients with AD in a repeated-dose administration scheme, with the secondary
      objectives being to explore the relationship between dosing regimen and pharmacodynamics
      efficacy outcomes and to evaluate the bioavailability of the oral form used and to explore
      the relationship of ANAVEX2-73 as add-on therapy to AD standard of care.</summary>
