  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 8 - ADSI was used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) based on five subscale scores of erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity. Improvement from Baseline was calculated as Baseline score minus follow-up score.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Vital Signs - Vital signs (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) were obtained with participant in the seated position, after having sat calmly for at least 5 minutes.

Number of participants with mild, moderate and severe treatment-emergent AEs were reported in this outcome measure.</outcome>

The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity.
