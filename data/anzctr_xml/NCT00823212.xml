    <interventions>Treatment: devices - PROMUS Coronary Stent System
Treatment: devices - PROMUS Element Coronary Stent System
Treatment: drugs - Aspirin
Treatment: drugs - Thienopyridine

Active Comparator: PROMUS - Patients who received the PROMUS (XIENCE V) Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent

Experimental: PROMUS Element - Patients who received the PROMUS Element Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent


Treatment: devices: PROMUS Coronary Stent System
PROMUS is a device/drug combination product composed of two components, a device (coronary stent system including a cobalt chromium stent platform) and a drug product (a formulation of everolimus contained in a polymer coating).

Treatment: devices: PROMUS Element Coronary Stent System
PROMUS Element is a device/drug combination product composed of two components, a device (coronary stent system including a platinum chromium stent platform) and a drug product (a formulation of everolimus contained in a polymer coating that is the same as on the PROMUS [XIENCE V] stent).

Treatment: drugs: Aspirin
Patients are required to take aspirin indefinitely after stent implant. It is recommended that aspirin 162-325 mg daily be given for at least 6 months after stent placement and that aspirin 75-162 mg daily be given indefinitely thereafter.

Treatment: drugs: Thienopyridine
Patients must be treated with one of the following thienopyridines for at least 6 months following the index procedure: clopidogrel 75 mg daily; or ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily; or prasugrel (outside the United States and if approved at the time of the procedure). If used, the prescribed dose should be in accordance with approved country-specific labeling. In patients not at high risk of bleeding, thienopyridine treatment should continue for at least 12 months after stent implant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PROMUS Element
      Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of patients with up to 2 de novo
      atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions.

      This clinical trial compares outcomes in patients treated with PROMUS Element to those in
      patients treated with a different everolimus-eluting coronary stent. The lesions are of
      average length in average-sized vessels ("workhorse"). A companion sub-trial evaluates
      outcomes in smaller vessels (SV) and another sub-trial evaluates outcomes in longer lesions
      (LL).</summary>
