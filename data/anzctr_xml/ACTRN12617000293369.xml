  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the feasibility of the proposed study
design. The study is designed to investigate the potential effects of MitoQ on the
endothelial vascular system. A technique that is commonly used in research will be
employed in this study. The technique is called Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD).
The primary objective for the project will be measured using the FMD technique.
Secondary objectives include: looking at the effect on heart rate, blood sugar levels
via the HbA1c test, checking the levels of certain biomarkers of inflammation and
comparing the number of treatment interruptions in both arms of the study.</summary>
