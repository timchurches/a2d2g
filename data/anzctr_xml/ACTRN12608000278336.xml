  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will examine the effects of a single 60 minute exercise session (aerobic or power exercises) on plasma uncarboxylated osteocalcin (unc-OC), adionectine (AN). Blood samples will be taken before exercise, immediately after and at 0.5, 1, 2, 24 and 48 hours post exercise.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Uncarboxylated osteocalcin (unc-OC) will be analysed based on a sandwich type electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) utilizing anti-OCG3 mouse monoclonal antibody labelled with Ruthenium (Ru) which luminates with electric stimuli. Magnetic beads bound to anti GluOC 4-5 mouse monoclonal antibody is used as a solid phase. After binding the unc-OC in the sample with the GluOC4-5 bound beads and Ru labelled OCG3, an electric impulse is applied via an electrode. The level of luminescence for the Ru complexes bound to solid phase antibody reflects the amount of unc-OC in the sample. The concentration of the unc-OC in the sample is measured by comparing the sample's luminescence to that of a calibrated solution of known unc-OC standards</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited mainly from VU students and young staff members and individuals from the western suburbs of Melbourne. All volunteers will receive an explanation about the nature of the study and those who will choose to participate will sign an informed consent document. In addition, participants will complete a health assessment questionnaire. Participants will then be randomly allocated (sealed opaque envelops) into power or aerobic exercise groups . Two different sets of sealed envelopes will be used for men and women to ensure a similar number of men and women in each group.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method of randomisation for this study is Stratified allocation. Randomization will be stratified according to sex.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine the connection between bone metabolism and glucose homeostasis in healthy young individuals. In addition this project will provide experimental evidence on the effects of power and aerobic exercises on the secretion of osteocalcin, a hormone produced by bones that may also have a role in glucose metabolism. No previous research has examined the role tat bone might play in glucose regulation. This study will add important new information regarding the effects of exercise on bone metabolism and its connection to glucose control. 

Specific aim
To examine the acute effects of power and aerobic exercise on bone metabolism in healthy young individuals.

Studies hypotheses

Acute effects of exercise on bone and metabolism
i.	An increase in unc-OC will occur as part of the acute response to exercise
ii.	Power exercise will result in greater increases in unc-OC, compared to the acute effects of aerobic exercise.</summary>
