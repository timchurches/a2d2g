  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Mellow Parenting (MP) programme was developed specifically for families with a pre-school child where there were relationship problems or where there were other significant problems such as maternal depression or child protection issues. There is a strong emphasis on parental engagement and empowerment, individual analysis of video tape of a family interaction (e.g. at a mealtime), activities to practice new skills, structured parenting workshop, homework to reinforce new skills etc. The programme is designed to improve mother-child interaction, child behaviour problems, mothers wellbeing, mothers effectiveness and confidence in parenting, and well as child behaviour and development.  

Mellow Parenting is a 14 week programme (1 day, 5 hours a week).</interventions>
    <comparator>stepped wedge design within subject wait list compared with intervention.Stepped wedge randomised trial designs involve sequential roll-out of an intervention to participants over different time periods. In this case people will apply to take part in the trial and the time to the start of the intervention can be considered random.  The demand for the intervention exceeds places in the groups and there has been a waiting list for the intervention since the first pilot group was run in 2008.  After recruitment and consent processes are completed, data will be collected monthly while participants are waiting and the change in outcomes over the waiting time will be compared with the change after receiving the intervention in each participant. This design is relevant for this situation as we predict (from our pilot) that the intervention will do more good than harm and lack of intervention is likely to result in poorer outcome for the parents and their pre-schoolers.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the mental health of the study parents after completion of the programme compared with their mental health while on the waiting list for the programme, as measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-30).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measures assess child development and behaviour, and parental stress at completion of the programme compared with assessments on the waiting list. The scales evaluating these outcomes include:
Parenting Daily Hassles (PDH),
Interaction between the parent and child (using videoed interactions), Ages and Stages Questionnaire (Socio-Emotional Screener), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), participant's satisfaction with the parenting programme and appropriateness for Maori participant will be tested using Hua Oranga (Maori  measure of satisfaction with health services).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a follow-on from pilot evaluation (NTX/07/12/135) of an intensive parenting programme (Hoki ki te Rito/Mellow Parenting) delivered to a group of Maori and Pacific parents/whanau residing in the Counties Manukau DHB. In this study we will evaluate the programme further as it is rolled out to 6 groups of approximately 12 participants (each) through two organisations  Ohomairangi Trust (which administered the pilot study) and the Anglican Trust for Women and Children. Hoki ki te Rito/Mellow Parenting is a 14 week programme (1 day, 5 hours a week) designed to support families with relationship problems with their infants and young children. It combines personal support for parents with a video and direct work with parents and children on their own parenting problems and aims to improve maternal well being, parent-child interaction, child behaviour and child development. The programme is based on The Mellow Parenting programme developed in Glasgow and has been adapted for use with Maori and Pacific peoples in New Zealand. The outcome measures are mainly questionnaires which the study participants complete, and a video of their interactions with their child/ren.
A stepped wedge design will be used because there is no treatement as usual and randomising young children to a no-intervention control group is potentially harmful. This has been discussed in depth with the Ethics Committee.</summary>
