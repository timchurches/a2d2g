  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be asked to take a course of oral iron supplements after each whole blood donation (on up to a maximum of three occasions) during the 13 month study period.
To access iron supplements donors select one of the following:
1. Delivery of a packet of Ferro-tab from a participating pharmacy at no cost to the participant. Dose one tablet (65.7 mg elemental iron) per day for 20 days. 
2. Collection of a packet of Ferro-tab from a participating pharmacy at no cost to the participant. Dose one tablet (65.7 mg of elemental iron) per day for 20 days. 
3. Purchase one of the following iron supplements from a pharmacy at their own cost:
Ferro-tab: dose - one tablet daily for 20 days (65.7 mg elemental iron per day)
Ferro Gradumet: dose - one tablet a day for 14 days (105 mg elemental iron per day)
Ferro-Grad C: dose - one tablet a day for 14 days (105 mg elemental iron per day) 
Adherence will be determined from surveys distributed to donors 4 weeks after their recruitment visit and their 8-13 month visit (if applicable).
Donors are not required to record the number of tablets taken or return unused tablets.</interventions>

      <outcome>Operational feasiblity measured by time and motion studies and staff surveys.
The time and motion will record the time taken for the donor reception and interview process. A timer will start immediately after the donor has been asked by reception staff to complete their paperwork. The time is then noted when the donor is taken into the interview room and then noted again at completion of the interview.
The staff survey has been specifically designed for this study.</outcome>

Adverse events will be assessed based on donor responses to survey questions including how concerned they were, whether treatment was required and whether medical advice was sought. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 220-250 mg of iron is lost with each 470 mL whole blood donation. This may result in progressive iron deficiency, ultimately leading to iron deficiency anaemia and deferral at a subsequent attendance. This study will investigate the use of oral iron supplments after whole blood donation in women aged 18-45 years who make two or more whole blood donations in a year. Participants will be followed for a period of 13 months and asked to take iron supplements after each whole blood donation during that time (up to a maximum of three occasions during the study period). Donors will be provided with the following options to assist with access to a suitable iron supplement:
-  having the iron supplied by a pharmacy (at no cost to the donor) or 
-if preferred by the donor purchasing a supplement at their own cost from any pharmacy from a list of suitable supplements provided by the Blood Service.
Participants are not required to donate at certain timepoints.
Participants will have ferritin samples collected at baseline and again 8-13 months (if applicable) after their recruitment visit. Participants will be asked to complete up to two surveys.
 The study will  evaluate donor acceptance, efficacy and operational feasiblity. </summary>
