  <interventions>
    <interventions>needle puncture (acupuncture) of one myofascial trigger point located within the supraspinatus muscle bilaterally.  One needle will be inserted into each trigger point (total of 2 needles).  They will remain within the trigger point for 20 minutes.  Only one session will be required of each subject.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham needle procedure.  The sham needle procedure involves intramuscular needling of the normal supraspinatus muscle adjacent to the trigger point locus.  The needle will remain within the trigger point for 20 minutes.  Only one session will be required of each subject.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of needle puncture (acupuncture) of myofascial trigger points in the supraspinatus muscle in the modulation of quiet standing balance.  Our thesis states that central sensitization is an important underlying mechanism in the clinical manifestation of dyequilibrium.  The current literature suggests that needle puncture of myofascial trigger points modulates central sensitization and thereby has the potential to restore normal balance outcomes.</summary>
