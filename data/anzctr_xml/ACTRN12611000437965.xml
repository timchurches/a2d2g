  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Curcumin, the main bioactive ingredient of the common food spice turmeric has been reported to have many beneficial effects on decreasing Alzheimers Disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, its low absorption in the body has limited its clinical impact and not translated into clinical benefits. Methods to increase its oral bioavailability are a subject of intense current research. BCM-95(R)CG (BiocurcumaxTM), a novel bio-enhanced preparation of curcumin and has been reported to be more absorbed in the body compared to curcumin.  This proposal will evaluate the potential efficacy of BCM-95(R)CG (BiocurcumaxTM) in preserving memory and cognitive functioning in older individuals with subjective memory complaints over a 12 month period.

Research hypotheses
1.	BCM-95(R)CG (BiocurcumaxTM) will slow cognitive decline over 12 months compared to placebo.
2.	BCM-95(R)CG (BiocurcumaxTM) will alter AD related biomarkers over 12 months compared to placebo.</summary>
