  <interventions>
    <interventions>This retrospective study aims to evaluate long term outcome of patients who underwent hip arthroscopy prior to peri-acetabular osteotomy (PAO) surgery.

The study involves reviewing patient files and operating notes with a subsequent phone call or a follow up visit (as per normal scheduled patient follow-up post surgery), if possible, to evaluate current patient status.

Participants for this study are located/recruited from clinic patient files from the date range 2001 to 2008.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We aim to evaluate the importance of arthroscopy prior to the osteotomy procedure. This is to supply the surgeon with additional valuable pre-operative data which will establish a better treatment strategy.  
the validated scoring clinical tools of the WOMAC hip score, Mahorn Hip Outcome Tool (MHOT) and the Non-arthritic hip score will provide functional quantitative data. Total assessment of clinical signs and symptoms will also be analysed. This will allow for a greater proportion of qualitative analysis, combined with the quantitative data collected via the validated questionnaires.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to evaluate the importance of arthroscopy prior to the osteotomy procedure. This is to supply the surgeon with additional valuable pre-operative data which will establish a better treatment strategy.  We will then evaluate patient outcomes following these two procedures.

This kind of osteotomy surgery aims to address an uncommon entity - mild hip dysplasia. Evaluation of this unique operation and its outcomes in this type of patient population will be invaluable in further improving patient care.


Key research questions: 
1.	Does PAO carry good long-term outcomes.
2.	Is hip arthroscopy considered as a adjunctive procedure prior to PAO</summary>
