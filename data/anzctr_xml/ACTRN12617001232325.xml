  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study of sleep in traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. The study will seek to study sleep fragmentation and its recovery over time in TBI. The study will also examine the effect of sleep fragmentation and self-reported sleep quality on cognition, behaviour, mood, disability and life satisfaction. 

Polysomonography (PSG) with electroencephalography (EEG) assessments with clinical assessments will be repeated fortnightly for up to 6 weeks following post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) resolution. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the brain signalling in sleep after TBI. We want to know if sleep problems improve as time passes after the brain injury, and whether the recovery of sleep, sleep quality, and cognition are related. It is also possible that some patients after a severe TBI have breathing problems in sleep. It is possible that breathing problems in sleep could affect their recovery. The sleep study will include monitoring for breathing disorders during sleep.</summary>
