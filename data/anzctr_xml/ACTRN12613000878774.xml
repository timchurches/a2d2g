  <interventions>
    <interventions>The self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme called Living Life to the Full, developed by Dr. Chris Williams of Glasgow University, is used for this study. The workbooks teach key life skills to combat distress, low mood and worry. These skills include stopping vicious thought cycles, problem solving, and goal setting. All participants will go through the individual face-to-face sessions with a paraprofessional, as is the design for low intensity cognitive behavioural programmes. The guided programme will be 1-2 hour sessions per week over 8 weeks.  Participants will be assigned homework to put into practice the skills that has been taught, and also the subsequent workbook to read through before the next session. Apart from weekly reminders to complete the homework and meet with the paraprofessional, there are no other strategies used to monitor adherence to the intervention. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most psychological theories and interventions were developed in Euro-American countries, in which the values of
individualism, autonomy and independence underline its practice. However, these values are not shared by all
cultures, yet it is assumed that what works for one group of people will work for another. With increasing demand for
cost-effective interventions, Dr. Chris Williams, of Glasgow University, developed a low intensity CBT programme for
use in the community, rather than in clinical settings. The rationale for low intensity CBT is to provide rapid, cost
effective, accessible and evidence-based treatment to people with less severe problems. A low intensity intervention, such as a guided self-help approach to CBT, uses simple approaches that are less complex to undertake than formal psychotherapy; contact with people is generally briefer and the low intensity interventions can be delivered by psychological well-being practitioners (under clinical supervision). It is yet to be examined whether this programme will be effective when used with East-Asian students as it has been with other population groups.

The study attempts to fill the gap, as research have previously been based on Asian Americans and none have
examined the effectiveness of low intensity programmes. This study will test the effectiveness of the Living Life to
the Full programme, developed by Dr. Chris Williams, in reducing perceived stress and improving life skills in
coping with university study and adapting to different culture for East Asian students. Also, feedback regarding the
relevance of the programme will be sought and modifications will be considered.</summary>
