  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be provided free of charge to each club in the intervention group. Strategies focus on harm-reduction strategies such as: an appropriate liquor license; training in the responsible service of alcohol; provision of low and non-alcoholic beverage alternatives; provision of food and safe transport strategies; modification of fundraising, end-of-season events and functions; and the implementation and monitoring of alcohol and business management policies. It is expected that the intervention will affect player and non-player club membership. To facilitate adoption of the above strategies into routine business practice, each club will receive responsible service and club management training, independent program performance audits and feedback, financial incentives to support the uptake of the program each season, resources and social marketing support. Clubs will also receive an accreditation manual and resources. In addition, participating clubs will have access to project officer support each season. The project officer will operate in a capacity building manner, assisting clubs progress through the accreditation levels, provide advice, conduct/facilitate training for bar staff and officials, prepare materials, promote the program in the local area, and provide feedback regarding club practices and progress through the accreditation criteria. The intervention will be delivered over two and a half successive sports seasons. As the targeted sports (rugby league, rugby union, soccer and AFL football) are winter sports, many of the clubs are relatively dormant during the summer months. As a consequence, delivery of the intervention will be limited to the approximate 6 month winter sport season in each of the two years and a 3 month period in the third year. Across the first two years of intervention clubs will be supported to implement practice changes and environmental modification and in the third year of intervention they will be support to maintain these changes and to implement policies.</interventions>
    <comparator>Clubs allocated to the control group will receive generic printed health behaviour information.  This will comprise of a printed material describing healthy lifestyle behaviours.  It will be sent to the club at the start of the intervention only, and clubs will be asked to offer the material to club members. Control clubs will not receive generic health behaviour information for the rest of the intervention period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in risky alcohol consumption at the club. Baseline measurements are taken the season before the intervention begins (winter 2009), and follow-up data is collected after two years of intervention (end of 2011) and following two and a half years of intervention delivery (mid 2012). All data will be collected via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI). Risky drinking will be assessed by the Graduated Frequency Index, a standard Australian instrument used to assess the amount and frequency of consumption in the last 3 months and a 7-day alcohol consumption diary.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The data collection and intervention will follow the following timeline: baseline data collection will occur in Season 1 (2009), the first part of the intervention will occur in the winter sports seasons in 2010 and 2011; follow-up data collection will occur with the cohort that participated in the 2009 baseline survey at the end of 2011; the second part of the intervention will occur in the first 3 months of the 2012 season; and follow-up data collection will occur in mid 2012 with a second cross section of club members.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is hypothesised that clubs participating in the accrediation program will have a signficant reduction in harmful alcohol-related behaviour over the intervention period.  In contrast, it is expected that clubs not participating in the intervention will not have a significant reduction in harmful alcohol-related behaviour over the same period of time.</summary>
