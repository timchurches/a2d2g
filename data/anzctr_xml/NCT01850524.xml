Patients will receive single oral dose of IXAZOMIB (4.0mg) on days 1,8,15 and single oral dose of Lenalidomide (25mg) on days 1-21 and single oral dose of Dexamethasone (40mg) on days 1,8, 15 and 22 every 28 days for the first 18 cycles or until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first.
After cycle 18 IXAZOMIB and Lenalidomide will be reduced and Dexamethasone will be discontinued.
