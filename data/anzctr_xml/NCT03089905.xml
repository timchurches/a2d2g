  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is considerable evidence that most general anaesthetics modulate brain development in
      animal studies. The impact is greater with longer durations of exposure and in younger
      animals. There is great controversy over whether or not these animal data are relevant to
      human clinical scenarios.

      The changes seen in preclinical studies are greatest with GABA agonists and NMDA antagonists
      such as volatile anaesthetics (eg sevoflurane), propofol, midazolam, ketamine, and nitrous
      oxide. There is less evidence for an effect with opioid (such as remifentanil) or with alpha
      2 agonists (such as dexmedetomidine).

      Some, but not all, human cohort studies show an association between exposure to anaesthesia
      in infancy or early childhood and later changes in cognitive tests, school performance or
      risk of developing neurodevelopmental disorders. The evidence is weak due to possible
      confounding.

      A recent well designed cohort study (the PANDA study) comparing young children that had
      hernia repair to their siblings found no evidence for a difference in a range of detailed
      neuropsychological tests. In that study most children were exposed to up to two hours of
      anaesthesia. The only trial (the GAS trial) has compared children having hernia repair under
      regional or general anesthesia and has found no evidence for a difference in neurodevelopment
      when tested at two years of age. The GAS and PANDA studies confirm the animal data that short
      exposure is unlikely to cause any neurodevelopmental impact.

      The impact of longer exposures is still unknown. In humans the strongest evidence for an
      association between surgery and poor neurodevelopmental outcome is in infants having major
      surgery. However, this is also the group where confounding is most likely.

      The aim of our study is to see if a new combination of anaesthetic drugs results in a better
      long-term developmental outcome than the current standard of care for children having surgery
      lasting at least 2..5 hours.

      Children will be randomised to receive either a low dose
      sevoflurane/remifentanil/dexmedetomidine or standard dose sevoflurane anaesthetic.

      They will receive a neurodevelopmental assessment at 3 years of age to assess global
      cognitive function.</summary>
