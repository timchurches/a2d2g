  <interventions>
    <interventions>Forty patients between the ages of 18-65 yr, ASA physical status I and II, scheduled for acute or elective hand or forearm surgery under lateral infraclavicular block, will  studied.Routine monitoring (consisting of a pulse oximeter, 3-lead ECG and a non-invasive blood pressure cuff ) will applied. In addition to this monitoring two near infrared spectroscopy sensors which will monitor tissue saturation (SomaSensors, Somanetics, Troy, MI) will be placed on each patient: One on the side of the peripheral nerve block and another at a similar site on the contralateral side.Each sensor will be placed on a different arm.The sensor will be placed on the the ventral aspect of the mid-forearm. The sensors will connected to a two channel monitor (Invos 5100B monitor, Somanetics), which automatically recorded digital data approximately every 7 s for a maximum of 30 min.Sensors record every 7 seconds for 30 minutes starting immediately prior to the administration of the block.</interventions>
