    <interventions>SALVAGE: Carfilzomib will be given by IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 of each 4-week cycle for 4 cycles. Carfilzomib 20 mg/m2 will be delivered on Cycle 1 Day 1 and 2 and then escalated to 56 mg/m2 from Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards. Thalidomide will be given continuously at a starting dose of 100mg oral daily starting on Day 1, Cycle 1 for the duration of the cycle. Dexamethasone will be given at a dose of 20mg orally on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of each 4 week cycle prior to carfilzomib dosing.

After 4 cycles of Car-TD Patients will undergo full disease re-evaluation and patients with less than stringent CR will receive an additional 2 cycles of car-TD and then proceed to a G-CSF stimulated PBSC collection.  If &lt;2million/kg CD34+ cells are available for ASCT the patient will be withdrawn from the study. Patients with sCR after 4 cycles of Car-TD will proceed directly to a G-CSF mobilised PBSC collection for ASCT, there is no time period intended prior to ASCT.
 
Patients will go to ASCT if eligible to do so with no time period prior to ASCT intended.

Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT): All patients with &gt;=2 million/kg CD34 cells available will then receive a melphalan 200mg/m2 conditioned ASCT as per standard institutional practice.

CONSOLIDATION: Commencing at 3 months post-ASCT patients without evidence of disease progression will receive a further 2 cycles of carfilzomib as described above. Thalidomide will be given continuously at a starting dose of 100mg daily starting on day 1 of the first cycle of carfilzomib consolidation and continued for a maximum of 12 months. Dexamethasone will be given at a dose of 20mg on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16 of each 4-week cycle of carfilzomib consolidation prior to carfilzomib dosing and then revert to a dose of 40mg weekly in combination with ongoing thalidomide to a maximum of 12 months.

All dosing is recorded by hospital staff.  Drug accountability logs will be used by the hospital staff.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to treatment with Car-TD salvage therapy in TE NDMM patients who have had a sub-optimal response to a bortezomib-based induction therapy.  The ORR will be calculated as the number of patients who have experienced at least a partial response prior to ASCT, divided by the number of patients registered on the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted after all patients,  have completed pre-ASCT salvage therapy (4 or 6 cycles of Car-TD). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the composite primary outcome of tolerability and safety profile of Car-TD salvage therapy when administered to TE NDMM patients who have had a sub-optimal response to a bortezomib-based induction therapy.
The co-primary outcome of the trial is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Car-TD salvage therapy.
The co-primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the tolerability and safety of Car-TD salvage therapy. These evaluations will be conducted on the Safety Set. Treatment emergent adverse events will be defined as per the CTCAE v4.03  and will be summarised by system organ class and/or preferred term as counts and percentages of participants with further subdivision based on severity and relationship to Car-TD therapy. Particular attention will be given to (i) rates of peripheral neuropathy (either sensory and/or painful) and cardiac toxicities &gt;=Grade 2, (ii) cessation of carfilzomib and/or thalidomide and/or dexamethasone due to unacceptable toxicity, and (iii) subject withdrawal due to unacceptable toxicity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary safety analyses will be conducted after all patients, who are still receiving study treatment, have completed pre-ASCT salvage therapy (4 or 6 cycles of Car-TD). Adverse event data will be collected in relation to the salvage (Car-TD 4 or 6 cycles plus 30 days) and consolidation (Car-TD 2 cycles followed by ongoing TD plus 30 days) portions of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the maximal depth of response achieved with sequential treatment with Car-TD salvage therapy, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and post-ASCT consolidation with Car-TD/TD.For all patients in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), responses, as defined by the IMWG criteria and as assessed at the 4 major re-staging points after each phase of treatment will be tabulated and presented as shift tables to enable comparison of response status at the beginning and end of each phase.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For all patients in the full analysis set, responses, as defined by the IMWG criteria and as assessed at the 4 major re-staging points after each phase of treatment will be tabulated and presented as shift tables to enable comparison of response status at the beginning and end of each phase (Baseline, and Treatment is comprised of 3 phases  Car-TD salvage; ASCT; and, post-ASCT Car-TD/TD consolidation).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) achieved with Car-TD salvage therapy, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and post-ASCT consolidation with Car-TD/TD.  This is a composite outcome.  PFS will be measured from the date of commencing Car-TD salvage therapy until the earlier of the dates of progression or death from any cause.  OS will be measured from the date of registration until the date of death from any cause.  This information will be collected on case report forms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>PFS will be measured from the date of commencing Car-TD salvage therapy until the earlier of the dates of progression or death from any cause. Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis (i.e. on or before the study censor date for PFS) will have their PFS censored at the study censor date for PFS.  The study censor date for PFS is the earliest of the last dates of disease response assessment of those patients who remain on study (i.e. those patients who have not withdrawn or have not been deemed to be lost-to-follow-up).  Patients who have withdrawn or have been lost to follow-up before the censor date will have their PFS censored at the date of their last disease response assessment on study.
OS will be measured from the date of registration until the date of death from any cause. Patients who have not died at the time of analysis (i.e. on or before the study censor date for OS) will have their OS censored at the study censor date for OS.  The study censor date for OS is the earliest of the last dates of vital status assessment of those patients who remain on study (i.e. those patients who have not withdrawn or have not been deemed to be lost-to-follow-up).  Patients who have withdrawn or have been lost to follow-up before the censor date will have their OS censored at the date of their last contact on study.  Follow up in the study will continue for 3 years following the completion of treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (CarTD) therapy for newly diagnosed transplant-eligible multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients who did not respond adequately to initial bortezomib-based therapy. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, have been diagnosed with symptomatic NDMM as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, are eligible for high-dose melphalan conditioned autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and failed to achieve a minimum response or partial response on 2 or 4 cycles of prior bortezomib-based induction therapy respectively. 

Study details 
Enrolled participants will first undergo 4 x 4-week cycles of salvage CarTD therapy, followed by an additional 2 cycles if they do not achieve a stringent complete response. 

Participants will then receive melphalan-conditioned ASCT, followed by 2 cycles of consolidation CarTD therapy. Patients will be monitored for myeloma response and safety and tolerability of CarTD therapy using blood samples, and the assessment of toxicities (adverse event review) as well as for disease progression and survival information for up to 3 years following the completion of treatment. 

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of CarTD salvage and consolidation therapy in multiple myeloma patients who do not respond to the standard care bortezomib-based therapy.</summary>
