  <interventions>
    <interventions>Train of four count ratio (TOFR) and count (TOFC) measured on patients who arrive in Recovery Unit after general anaesthesia requiring muscle relaxant.
TOFR and TOFC will be measured using the GE Neuromuscular monitor (NMT).
TOFR will be performed in patients on arrival in Recovery by a scholarly selective medical student face to face with the patient.  The initial TOFR will be measured.  If it is less than 90% (0.9) then the TOFR will be measured at 1 minute intervals until the TOFR reaches 90%.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to determine the incidence of post-operative residual curarisation (PORC) in Peri-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) after general anaesthesia requiring a muscle relaxant.  We will also measure the incidence of adverse airway events in PACU and determine if there is an association with PORC.
As this was deemed to be a low risk study, patient consent was not required prior to recruitment.  Patients were followed up in PACU after transfer from the operating theatre.  Once in PACU, a neuromuscular monitor was placed and the train-of-four ratio (TOFR) was measured.  This measurement was performed at 1 minute intervals until TOFR reached 0.9.  The time then for TOFR to reach 0.9 was measured.</summary>
