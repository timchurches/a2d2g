  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 months daily home electronic measurements by patients of their physiological parameters - 1. Pulse rate &amp; Electrocardiograph (ECG) by placing their hands on an "external monitoring plate" 2. Temperature &amp; Oxygen Saturation by digital pulse oximetry 3. Blood pressure by automated cuff measurements 4. Weight by external scales. The above modules are attached to the remote monitoring system and measurements are transmitted via the patients telephone line to a central monitoring database and accessed by the study Doctor and Research Nurse to facilitate early medical intervention. 5. Daily Patient Health Diary entries will be recorded manually and entered electronically at a later time by trial staff. 6. Quality of Life Questionnaires will be recorded by trial staff addressing each question over the telephone with the patient. 7. Health Record review by trial staff on site will be manual and electronic. 8. General Practitioner visits and communication will be recorded manually by the patient in the daily Patient Health Diary. Actions/treatments initiated during patient General Practitioner visits will be clarified by trial staff with the relevant General Practitioner as necessary.</interventions>

    <concealment>After a subject is deemed eligible for inclusion in the trial they will be invited to consider their participation in the study. All study personnel will be unaware to which group the subject will be allocated until after randomisation. The subject will attend an Informed Consent Visit and, if agreeable, they will be randomised to either the conservative or the technology based arm of the study. A password protected computer with a computer program designed to sequentially allocate the computer generated numbers will be used for randomisation. The computer generated numbers will be electronically allocated on request.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiological monitoring of community patients with at-risk chronic heart failure randomised into one of 2-groups. Group 1 -Current management by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Heart Failure Clinic including written Patient Education + Phone Support compared with Group 2 - Home computer recording of physiological measurements by the patient and centrally evaluated by the Trial Nurse / Doctor. We hypothesise that daily review of physiological parameters will facilitate early medical intervention and thereby reduce emergency department presentations and unplanned hospital admissions for chronic heart failure.</summary>
