  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this survey is to determine factors that may encourage medical specialists participation in research in Australian private hospitals. The objectives are to determine, in private and public hospital settings:
*	Current and intended levels of participation in research activities
*	Factors which encourage and discourage research participation, and whether these factors differ between practice settings.

In this analytical cross-sectional observational study, all salaried medical specialists and those who treated 50 or more patients at Epworth HealthCare in 2015 (estimate of 1000 medical specialists) were invited to complete an electronic survey in April 2016. Epworth HealthCare is a non-profit healthcare group based in Melbourne, Australia. 

Participants answered questions regarding their practice setting (private, public or both), current and intended levels of participation in research activities, and level of agreement (on a 5-point ordinal scale) with a list of potential barriers and incentives to research participation.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size required for this study will be based on the all barriers and facilitators for doctors' research participation in either private or public sectors. There is scarce literature on which to base the sample size estimates. Hence assuming that at least 50% of doctors will identify each of the barriers or facilitators as present, 384 patients would be needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval with width of 10%.  Accounting for a participation rate of 40%, invitation to participate in the survey will be sent to 960 doctors. This is achievable given the estimate of 1000 doctors who meet eligibility criteria of regular attendance at Epworth HealthCare. 
All data to be collected through this survey will be categorical-scale data and hence will be reported as frequencies with percentages. Differences in reporting, of barriers and facilitators, between subgroups of the sample (for example by practice setting or clinical specialty) will be conducted using logistic regression for binary outcomes, nominal regression for nominal categorical data and ordinal regression for ordered outcomes. The regression models will further be adjusted for doctors' characteristics such as years of practice, gender and area of specialty. Statistical significance level will be determined at 5% and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Stata Statistical package version 12 and upwards or SPSS version 17 and upwards will be used for analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is an ongoing need for clinician participation and collaboration in biomedical and health research worldwide. In Australia, clinical research activities have traditionally been based in major tertiary public hospitals with affiliated academic departments and research institutes. Australias growing private healthcare sector accounts for a third of hospital beds and two-thirds of elective surgical admissions. Despite potential research opportunities, there is anecdotal evidence that many medical specialists are reluctant to participate in research in private hospitals. The majority of published studies regarding incentives and barriers to Australian clinicians research participation focus on trainees, general practice, allied health practitioners and public hospitals. Other countries with substantial private healthcare systems such as the United States have significantly different funding and organisational models. The aim of this study is to determine factors that may encourage clinicians participation in research in Australian private practice, by surveying medical specialists who are frequent attenders at Epworth HealthCare. The results of the study will provide information on doctors current and intended levels of, and perceived barriers and incentives to, participation in research activities, and whether these differ between private and public settings.</summary>
