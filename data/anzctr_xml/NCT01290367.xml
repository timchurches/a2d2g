  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two doses of immunoselected, culture-expanded,
      nucleated, allogeneic adult MPCs when combined with hyaluronic acid to two control
      intradiscal injections in subjects with chronic low back pain due to moderate Degenerative
      Disc Disease (DDD) at one lumbar level from L1 to S1.

      All investigational subjects in this study will undergo injection of either 6 million (M) or
      18M cells in a hyaluronic acid carrier into the degenerated lumbar disc's nucleus pulposus.
      All control subjects will undergo an intradiscal control injection with either saline or
      hyaluronic acid only</summary>
