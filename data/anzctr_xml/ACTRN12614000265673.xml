  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following double blind oral food challenges (DPBPFC) to boiled and roasted peanut and placebo, peanut allergic children aged 5-16 years will undergo randomisation to 3 arms of 12 months of treatment with 1. Increasing doses of boiled peanut daily commencing at 0.5 grams. 2. Increasing doses of roasted peanut daily commencing at 0.5 gram. 
For arms 1 and 2- Induction phase with updosing over 6 months and further 6 months maintenance (8g) daily. Updosing under supervision. Peanut preparations suppled to parents for daily home administration between updosing and during maintenance. Compliance by daily diary.
Arm 3. No treatment (delayed start) to cross over at 12 months to boiled peanut OIT as per arm 1 following further DBPCFC. 
Children roasted allergic/boiled tolerant will proceed directly to daily boiled peanut maintenance at 8g over 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Boiled peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) will be compared with standard roasted peanut OIT and no treatment. Those children randomised to no treatment will cross over and receive boiled peanut immunotherapy at 12 months. Roasted OIT is considered current standard OIT.</comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Study is powered to detect a 50 fold change in thershold to roasted peanut at 12 months of immunotherapy compared with control (no intervention).  We calculated to have 95% power to detect a 50-fold difference in threshold between the two active arms of the challenge at the 5% significance level we will require 20 peanut  peanut allergic children with completed challenges. Allowing for a 30% attrition rate we will recruit 30 peanut allergic children. Primary analysis will be by non parametric t tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peanut allergy is increasingly common, especially in countries such as Australia and to date no safe and effective therapy exists to cure peanut allergy. Recently studies have looked at desensitising people with peanut allergy by giving them small daily doses of roasted or raw peanut. Although this therapy works for some people, its effects are not generally long lasting and it is associated with many side effects.
It is possible that boiled peanut is less immunogenic than roasted peanut and it may provide a safer way to desensitise patients who are allergic to roasted peanut by desensitising them first to boiled peanut.
