  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of RO4917838 in participants with persistent, predominant
      negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Participants, on stable treatment with antipsychotics,
      will be randomized to receive daily oral doses of RO4917838 or matching placebo for 56 weeks
      (treatment period 1 of 24 weeks and treatment period 2 of 32 weeks), followed by an optional
      treatment extension for up to 3 years. After 52 weeks, participants who were originally
      randomized to an active treatment will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo or
      continue on the originally assigned study treatment for 4 weeks washout period (Week 52 to
      Week 56) for the assessment of potential withdrawal effects in a blinded manner using
      participants staying on active treatment as a control. Participants initially randomized to
      placebo will remain on placebo. After 56 weeks, participants who were switched to placebo in
      the washout period will return to their blinded, active treatment arm.</summary>
