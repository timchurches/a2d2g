    <interventions>The universal WISE Teens program is an 8 lesson program adapted from the 30 lesson DBT STEPS-A Program (Mazza et al., 2016). It emphasises a social and emotional learning approach to help improve psychological well-being and to facilitate effective coping using a prevention approach. The program will be run in NSW high schools. 
The program will span four phases:
1) Initially, participants will complete baseline outcome measures prior to completion of the program
2) Participants will then be assigned to complete the program as part of their PDHPE curriculum learning or complete PDHPE classes as per usual in line with content set by the individual schools. The program will involve 8 weekly lessons. which will run for the duration of the entire PDHPE class.  Students will be provided with a workbook containing worksheets used with permission from the Guilford Press published from the DBT Skills in Schools Manual (Mazza et al., 2016). Each class will start with a review of the previous week of material, a mindfulness practice and then discuss the content emphasised in the lesson that week in conjunction with the student worksheets. PDHPE teachers will be present to support students, however, they will not take an active role in delivering the intervention. The intervention will be delivered by provisionally registered and registered psychologists with a minimum of 12 months clinical experience. Training will involve direct facilitator instruction through introductory workshops applying DBT to school populations and ongoing weekly supervision by senior clinical psychologists. The provisionally registered and registered psychologists will be asked to follow the manualised treatment exclusively. 20% of group sessions will be recorded and listened to by the research team to ensure treatment fidelity. Further additional individualised facilitator training will be available from senior clinical psychologists experienced in delivering DBT programs to improve fidelity if necessary. 

The content of the program as outlined in the student workbooks is described in Mazza et al., (2016) manual where activities have been selected from. The content will be as follows: 
Week 1: Mindfulness training of 'What' skills (Observe, Describe, Participate) through in class experiential activities using direct face-to-face instruction and audio recordings. 
Week 2: Mindfulness training of 'How' skills (One-mindfully, Non-judgement, Effectiveness) through interactive in class experiential activities using direct face-to-face instruction and audio recordings in line with those described in Mazza et al's (2016) manual.
Week 3: Emotion Regulation - Psychoeducation on the role that emotions serve; how to prevent emotional vulnerability through the PLEASE skills. 
Week 4: Emotion Regulation - Mindfulness of Emotions activity, Introduction to Dialectical Thinking, Checking the Facts and Opposite Action to Emotion skills. 
Week 5: Distress Tolerance - Introduction to Radical Acceptance
Week 6: Distress Tolerance - Crisis Survival Skills (Wise Mind ACCEPTS, Self-Soothe, IMPROVE the moment)
Week 7: Interpersonal Effectiveness - Understanding your communication style and how to get your needs met more effectively using DEAR MAN skills. 
Week 8: Interpersonal Effectiveness - GIVE FAST and THINK skills followed by Revision of the Program - creation of "My Skills Toolkit."
Students will additionally be asked to complete an out of class skills practice log (Diary Card) throughout the duration of the 8 week program. This will be recorded online. 

3) One week post completion of the program, students will be asked to complete post-test follow up outcome measures.
4) Finally, students will be asked to complete the same post-test follow up outcome measures 6 months after the program has finished completion.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Psychological Well-being/Emotional Outcomes

The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnnaire Youth Self Report measure (11-17 yrs) (Goodman, 2001) will be used to assess psychological well-being. This is a well validated measure which looks at psychological well-being generally across a number of domains (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity and peer problems) and assesses more specifically the impact of difficulties on the young person. </outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) Social Outcomes
Students will be asked to complete the Clinical Assessment of Interpersonal Relationships (Bracken, 2011). This measure looks to assess the quality of the student's relationships with their parents, their male and female peers and their teachers on a 4-point likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) Academic Outcomes
Students will be asked to complete the Academic Resilience Scale (Martin &amp; Marsh, 2006) where they will be asked the extent to which sentences such as 'I'm good at bouncing back from a poor mark in my school work' on a 5 point likert scale (never to always). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following variables will be investigated as secondary outcomes: 

1. Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (Gratz and Roemer, 2004) will be used to assess emotion dysregulation more specifically. The scale is comprised of 5 aspects of emotion regulation investigating impulse control difficulties, nonacceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal directed behaviour under heightened emotion, lack of emotional awareness, access to emotion regulation strategies and lack of emotional clarity. Students are asked to indicate the extent to which such aspects apply to them on a 5-point likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree). </outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Beliefs about Emotions Scale (Rimes &amp; Chadler, 2010). Here, participants are asked the extent to which they endorse common beliefs about experiencing emotions on a 7 point scale (totally agree to totally disagree). </outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Emotion Awareness Questionnaire (Rieffe et al., 2008)
A measure will be taken of participants' self-reported levels of emotional awareness on a three point scale (not at all true to often true). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4..	Students will also be asked to indicate via self-report questionnaires developed for the current study the extent to which they practiced the skills discussed in each of the program sessions outside of the session.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures of completing practice outside of class sessions will be completed weekly throughout the program.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale (Chorpita et al., 2000) will be used to assess internalising symptoms more specifically of psychological well-being. This is a 47 item measure where students are asked to indicate the frequency to which they 
experience symptoms of anxiety and depression on a 4 point scale (never - always). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life 
Students will be asked to complete the Youth Quality of Life Scale - Short Form (Edwards, Huebner, Connell &amp; Patrick, 2002). Here, students are asked to complete 15 items rating how they feel about their life in general on a 10 point scale (not at all to very much). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be collected over three primary timepoints (pre-test, 1 week post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention).</timepoint>

    <concealment>High school students in Year 8 and 9 of participating high schools will be invited to participate in the universal prevention trial. Depending on scheduling commitments, schools will volunteer either their Year 8 or Year 9 year groups to participate in the program. This will be matched across schools so that equivalent numbers of Year 8 and Year 9 groups are allocated to the intervention vs. control condition. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Previous research using a similar  matched non-randomised design has used a sample size involving approximately four schools (1 school providing a Yr 8 group  and another providing a Yr 10 group to partake in the intervention and 2 schools providing a Yr 9 group to partake in the intervention) in order to find an effect. 
The plan of analysis will involve a number of steps:
1. Baseline analyses looking at retention over time and outcomes at baseline
2. Repeated measures analyses looking at changes in outcomes over time (pre to post) as a function of whether students received the program or not.
3, Mediation analyses investigating whether primary outcomes of the program were mediated by the secondary outcomes. 
4. Moderation analyses to see if there are differences in efficacy of the program across different levels of clinical severity as ascertained by baseline levels of functioning in addition to gender and SES and level of external practice of the skills for homework. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Using a non-randomised design, this project will investigate the effectiveness of a universal, primary prevention program (WISE Teens) based on principles of the existing DBT STEPS-A Framework to promote greater social and emotional well-being amongst young people. Between four to six high schools from NSW will participate in the trial with each school providing a year group to complete the intervention, with another year group serving as the control condition (class as per usual). 

The primary aims of the current study are as follows: 
a)	To examine the effectiveness of applying DBT principles within a universal, primary prevention approach to promote academic, social and emotional resilience in addition to greater quality of life and psychological well-being in Australian high school students. 

The study will also investigate the following secondary aims:
a)	Does level of program compliance (via completion of homework tasks and practice) affect social and emotional outcomes?
b) Are the effects of the program mediated via increased levels of emotional awareness, more positive beliefs about emotions and reduced emotion dysregulation?
c) Are the results of the program moderated by initial levels of clinical severity as determined at baseline? 

The following outcomes are hypothesised:
a) The WISE Teens program will be effective in promoting more positive social and emotiona outcomes in addition to greater academic resilience compared with participation in PDHPE class as per usual. 
b) This effect is expected to be mediated by increased emotional awareness, more positive beliefs about the role of emotion and reduced emotion dysregulation.
c) This effect is additionally expected to be moderated by clinical severity status, with those showing greater clinical severity of symptoms showing more marked improvements on social and emotional outcomes relative to those showing reduced clinical severity of symptoms.  </summary>
