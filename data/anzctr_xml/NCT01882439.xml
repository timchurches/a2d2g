      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score: Month 3 - The HAQ-DI assesses the difficulty a patient has had in the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question, level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The score for each domain is the maximum (worst) score from the items/questions within the domain. Higher score indicates greater disability. Overall score was computed as the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains answered. The total possible score ranged from 0 to 3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Higher overall score indicates greater disability.</outcome>

Average erythema, induration, and scaling are rated separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale, scored as 0=none; 1, 2, 3, or 4=most severe. The severity rating scores are summed and the average taken; the total average is rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA-PsO score on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=clear, 1=almost clear, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe). n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) Response: Months 1, 3, and 6 - PASI determines psoriasis severity based on lesion severity and percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected. Lesion severity is assessed for erythema, induration, and scaling evaluated separately for the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs and then rated for each body area according to a 5 point scale: 0=no involvement; 1=slight; 2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=very marked. BSA involvement is the extent (%) of body area affected by psoriasis and is assigned a numerical score: 0=no involvement; 1=0% to 9%; 2=10% to 29%; 3=30% to 49%; 4=50% to 69%; 5=70% to 89%; 6=90% to 100%. In each area, the sum of the severity rating scores is multiplied by the score representing the percentage of this area involved by psoriasis, multiplied by a weighting factor (head 0.1; upper limbs 0.2; trunk 0.3; lower limbs 0.4). The sum of the numbers obtained for each of the 4 body areas is the PASI. PASI75 is defined as a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI. n=number of responders.</outcome>

The health domains are aggregated into two summary scores known as the physical component summary (PCS) score and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Normalized domain scores, PCS and MCS scores are used in the analyses. The component and domain scores were scored using the United States (US) 1998 general population norms. The resulting norm-based T-scores for both the SF36 version 2 and SF36 health domain scales and component summary measures have means of 50 and standard deviations of 10. A higher PCS score represents better physical health status. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores: Total Score: Months 1, 3, 6 - FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire, with each item score ranging from 0 to 4. Three endpoints are derived: change in FACIT-F total score, change in FACIT-F experience domain score, and change in FACIT-F impact domain score. FACIT-F total score (range 0-52) is calculated by summing the 13 items. FACIT-F experience domain score (range 0-20) is calculated by summing 5 items : I feel fatigued, I feel weak all over, I feel listless ("washed out"), I feel tired, and I have energy, while FACIT-F impact domain score (range 0-32) is calculated by summing the remaining 8 items. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Higher scores represent better fatigue status. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Score Evaluating Spondylitis Using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI): Months 1, 3, 6 - BASDAI is a validated self-assessment tool used to determine disease activity in participants with ankylosing spondylitis. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10 (0=none and 10=very severe) participants answered 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain, and fatigue. The final BASDAI score averaged the individual assessments for a final score ranging 0-10cm, with higher scores representing more severe ankylosing spondylitis disease activity. n=number of participants evaluable at each visit.</outcome>
