    <interventions>This study aims to examine the efficacy of a novel, tolerable, and practical adjunctive intervention by examining a combination of agents acting on mitochondrial targets. 

The trial will assess the efficacy and tolerability of twice daily dosing for 20-weeks of purpose-designed combination capsules taken orally providing a daily amount of: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 2000 mg; Acetyl L-carnitine (ALC) 1000mg; ubiquinone (Co Q10) 200 mg; magnesium (as orotate 500mg) 64mg; calcium ascorbate dehydrate (equiv ascorbic acid 200mg) 242mg; cholecalciferol (equiv vitamin D3 250IU) 12.5micrograms; a-tocopherol (equiv natural vitamin E 50IU) 60IU; alpha lipoic acid 150mg; Retinyl palmitate (equiv vitamin A 3000IU) 900ugREIU; and vitamin B co-factors: biotin (vitamin H) (600micrograms), thiamin hydrochloride (100mg), riboflavin (100mg), nicotinamide (200mg), calcium pantothenate (100mg), pyridoxine hydrocholoride (100mg), folic acid (800micrograms), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) (800micrograms) in people diagnosed with CFS. 

A capsule count will be done to determine compliance. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis, including descriptive statistics, t-tests, multiple regression, logistic regression, chi-square test, and ANOVA will be conducted using SPSS. Analysis of all outcome measures will be performed at each time point. Repeated measures linear mixed models analysis will be used to test the effect on rate of change on primary and secondary outcome measures over time. Tests of significance will use a level of a = 0.05. 

No formal sample size calculation was performed as the study is a pilot,  open-label and exploratory in nature. As with most pilot studies, the sample size will be a sample of convenience as the study is unfunded and limited by resourcing. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a prolonged multisystem illness, characterised by very poor stamina, delayed post-exertional fatigue, which adversely affects ones functioning across numerous physical and mental domains. Current treatments for CFS include pharmacological (e.g. fluoxetine, rintatolimod, galantamine), psychological (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), adaptive pacing therapy), and lifestyle interventions. For many who remain in treatment, they continue to experience significant social, occupational, and functional impairment. Thus new treatment approaches are urgently needed. 
While significant fatigue remains a common complaint across numerous disorders, it is posited that CFS is related to metabolic dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired biogenesis, in turn related to oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Mitochondria are structures within cells primarily responsible for energy generation, and are particularly active in oxygen-rich and highly energy dependent tissues, such as the brain. Recent research suggests that patients suffering from CFS may improve with the supplementation of mitochondrial nutrients and antioxidants. This supplementation may be associated with the reduction to mitochondrial membranes, restoring mitochondrial energy production, protecting cellular structures and enzymes from oxidative damage, and decreasing fatigue. Given that CFS is largely a heterogeneous illness associated with a complex and multifactorial aetiology, combined with the present state of available treatments, it is plausible that the introduction of a combination of metabolic therapies may have positive effects on mitochondrial dysfunction and lead to symptom improvement for CFS sufferers.</summary>
