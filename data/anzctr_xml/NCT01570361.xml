        patient develops subsequent recurrent atrial fibrillation.

        NOTE: For patients randomized to the PVI group (Test Group), a Transesophageal
        Echocardiography (TEE) should be performed (as per standard of care), within 48 hours
        pre-procedure, to exclude atrial thrombus or other structural contraindications for an
        ablation procedure.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether early radiofrequency (RF) ablation
      treatment, using the CARTO® 3 or CARTO® XP System, and THERMOCOOL® Catheter Family (including
      THERMOCOOL® SF or THERMOCOOL® SMARTTOUCH) in subjects with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
      (PAF), delays progression of atrial fibrillation (AF) compared with drug therapy (either rate
      or rhythm control) using current AF management guidelines.</summary>
