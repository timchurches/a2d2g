  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A nationally representative sample of New Zealanders, was drawn from the New Zealand electoral rolls and screened via a postal survey. Respondents were eligible for group assignment if they had low fruit and vegetable consumption (ie. they were not in the maintenance stage of change for both the fruit goal and the vegetable goal, or were not eating 9 or more servings of fruit and vegetables per day) and had no self-reported medical conditions preventing them from eating at least 2 fruit and 3 vegetable servings each day. Eligible respondents gave their informed consent to participate in a one-year trial, lived in New Zealand, and were not living in supervised care.</inclusivecriteria>
