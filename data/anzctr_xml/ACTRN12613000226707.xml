  <interventions>
    <interventions>A self-directed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) booklet based on CBT techniques/exercises/information derived from basic CBT methods that have been utilised in the past and have been proven in their reliability and validity (Beck 1963; Greenberger and Padesky 1995; von Wietersheim, Scheib et al. 2001; Leahy 2003). The booklet itself for managing anxiety during treatment for alcohol dependence was developed as part of an Honours project at the University of South Australia.

The booklet consists of 4 CBT exercises to be completed over 4 weeks (1 exercise per week). The first weeks exercise is title "Understand your thinking" and introduces the basic concepts of CBT and turnging unhelpful thoughts in to helpful thoughts. Pariticpants are asked to record information about situations that make them feel stressed and to think about the events that lead up to the stress, whether or not their thougths are unhelpful and if thie anxiety could have been avoided if theie thoughts were helpful.

The second weeks exercise is titled "Confronting fearful situations" and helps the individual to divide their fearful situation in to smaller more manageable stepping stones. The indiviudal then works through their stepping stones until they have worked through them all to confront their fearful situation.

Week three is titled "Coping strategies" and helps the individual to practice helpful coping skills instead of unhelpful coping strategies.

The final week, week 4 is titled "Learn to be assertive" and helps individuals to be assertive through acknowledging, declining, explaining and suggesting alternative options.

    <concealment>Patients were consecutively randomised at each of the three above mentioned sites into two arms: 
1) Standard care for AUD treatment (including information handout for referral to ongoing anxiety services)

2)Self directed four week CBT booklet

Questionnaires to assess outcome measures were administered prior to participant randomisation, the CBT booklet or standard care were then undertaken over a four week period and then questionnaires to assess outcome measures were repeated at the end of the four week follow up period. Participants were contacted on a weekly basis by the research assistant to assess their compliance with the tool. Participants were asked what percentage of the booklet they had completed.

Allocation was not concealed. The principal investigator generated the randomisation and emailed it to the research assistant.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was undertaken using the computer program PEPI (RANDOM Version 4). Randomisation was undertaken with a 2:1 ratio, CBT booklet:control.

    <statisticalmethods>Denial, substance use, behavioural disengagement and self-blame subscales of the Brief COPE were coded as maladaptive coping. Distraction, active coping, emotional support, instrumental support, venting, positive reframing, planning, humour, acceptance, religion were coded as adaptive coping. Normality was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnoffs test. Descriptive statistics including means, SD, medians, inter-quartile ranges, counts and proportions were used to describe the study population in the two treatment arms at baseline. Univariate comparisons were conducted with the t-test and the paired t-test on the STAI, the Brief COPE, and the Brief WHOQOL main scales as they were normally distributed. Brief COPEs individual subscales were not normally distributed and univariate comparisons were done with the Mann-Whiteney and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests. The analysis of co-variance was conducted to compare the two treatment groups in anxiety, coping and quality of life post intervention and adjusted for baseline. The level of significance for all the comparisons was set as &lt;.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) are a growing burden on Australias health care system due to associated cardiovascular and gastrointestinal disease, cognitive deficits, insomnia, suicide and other drug abuse, and have illustrated significant co-morbidity with anxiety. Additionally, anxiety is a strong motive for self-medication with further alcohol use, especially during initial detoxification. A major obstacle in AUD treatment is the significant delay in access to treatment, and motivating patients to continue treatment throughout alcohol detoxification and its associated anxiety. The effectiveness of a self directed cognitive behavioural therapy booklet allowing immediate access to treatment to manage anxiety during AUD treatment will be tested in the current study.</summary>
