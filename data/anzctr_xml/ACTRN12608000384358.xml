  <interventions>
    <interventions>After informed consent is sought and the baseline interview completed, participants will be randomized by computer-generated random number list into the intervention or control groups stratified by area of residence (south east corner of QLD versus rest of QLD) aiming to achieve equal numbers in these groups. 

Men assigned to the intervention group will receive one video, which runs for approximately 12 minutes, recommending that participants conduct a whole-body skin self-examination (SSE) at least once a month. Together with the video, participants will receive a body pictogram that they can use to mark lesions while they are conducting a SSE and to record the dates of their SSEs. Participants within both the intervention and control condition will receive standard written educational materials available to the public from the Cancer Council Queensland entitled Take the time to spot the difference. This brochure displays photographs of benign and malignant lesions on the front and explains the particulars of every lesion on the reverse side. It recommends sun protection and regular skin self-examination without giving details on how to do so. 
Men are asked to watch the video as soon as possible after receiving it at their own leisure. Men in the intervention group will receive two post-card reminders, two and four weeks after receiving the intervention video. The first postcard will remind them to watch the DVD, the second will remind them to conduct a whole-body skin self-examination and present to a doctor for a whole-body clinical exam with any lesion of concern.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects assigned to the control group will also receive the standard written educational materials (Take the time to spot the difference) available to the public from the Queensland Cancer Fund at the same time as the video-based material is mailed to intervention group participants - about two weeks after baseline interviews are completed.  No further contact will be made with the control group participants apart from the telephone interviews, at 7 and 13 months, to collect the outcomes to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Control group participants can receive the video materials at the end of the study period if they wish.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of whole-body skin self-examinations (SSE). This will be assessed by independent telephone survey staff blind to the participants group assignment. The main questions of this telephone interview have been used within our previous research and have good reliability and validity. Participants will be asked whether they have checked their own skin over the past 6 months, if yes, how many times. To facilitate accurate assessment of the degree of SSE performed (none, checks of particular spots or moles only, part-body SSE, whole-body SSE), participants will be asked to nominate the body area(s) that they included in their last SSE. In addition, we will assess whether SSE was performed using a full-size mirror and hand-held mirror and/or if another person was available. Further questions will assess relevant medical details including restrictions in mobility or vision that could impede thorough SSE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, and at 7 and 13 months after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part or whole-body clinical skin examinations by a doctor (CSE). This will be assessed via participant self-report during the telephone interview, using previously validated questions. Participants who report a clinical skin examination (CSE) will be asked where they received their last examination, if there was any delay in getting an appointment and reasons for delay, who initiated the CSE, what the reason for this examination was and what management was chosen by the doctor for any lesion detected during this examination (excision/biopsy, non-surgical treatment, monitoring, no treatment).

For the cost-effectiveness analysis, the project manager will collect all resources relating to the preparation and development of the intervention, participant recruitment, delivery or operational costs, data collection costs and any other expenses required. Costs of follow-up diagnostic and management resources used by GPs or histopathology specialists subsequent to any CSEs participants will also be estimated. The data on costs will be derived from doctors? reports to obtain type and quantity of health resources used and valued using the Medicare Benefits Schedule. Although these resources are not directly considered inputs of the intervention service, the rationale for their inclusion is to investigate the use of health care resources attributable to the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 7 and 13 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Management by doctors of any suspicious skin lesions. This will be assessed by following all visits to a doctor for any skin lesions men found during their skin self-examinations. Doctors will be asked about their management of the lesions. For skin examinations resulting in a surgical intervention (punch or shave biopsy, excision or curettage), histopathological data will be requested including the site, morphology, laterality, presence or absence of pigmentation and histological diagnosis. Histopathology reports will the entered into a database using the ICD-O coding system by trained coders.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares levels of skin self-examination behaviour for the early detection of melanoma in men 50 years or older who receive a video-delivered intervention compared to those who receive standard brochures only.

You can join this study if you are male, aged 50 years and older and live in Queensland, Australia.

Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. Participants in one group (the intervention group) will receive one video, which runs for approximately 12 minutes, recommending that participants conduct a whole-body skin self-examination (SSE) at least once a month. They will also receive a body pictogram that they can use to mark lesions while they are conducting a SSE. 

All participants will receive standard written educational materials from the Cancer Council Queensland entitled Take the time to spot the difference. This brochure displays photographs of benign and malignant lesions and explains the particulars. It recommends sun protection, and regular skin self-examination without giving details of how to do so. 

The number of whole-body skin self-examinations (SSE) in both groups will be assessed by independent telephone survey staff blind to the participants group assignment. This trial aims to measure the impact and cost-effectiveness of a video-delivered intervention.</summary>
