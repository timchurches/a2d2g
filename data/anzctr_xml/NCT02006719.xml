    <exclusivecriteria>-  Has received treatment for adhesive capsulitis or is planning to receive treatment for
             adhesive capsulitis at any time during the study including but not limited to:

               -  physical therapy or acupuncture within 2 weeks before the first injection of
                  study drug

               -  intra-articular or intrabursal injection(s) of lidocaine; suprascapular nerve
                  blocks; corticosteroids, electroanalgesic and/or thermoanalgesic modalities
                  within 1 month before the screening visit

             confounding to the evaluation of safety and efficacy:

                  shoulder such as fracture of the humerus or clavicle immediately preceding the
                  onset of this episode of adhesive capsulitis). Traumatic events in the past that
                  are not temporally related to the onset of this episode of adhesive capsulitis
                  would not necessarily exclude a subject from participating in the study.

               -  Active subacromial impingement in the affected shoulder

               -  Calcified tendonitis in the affected shoulder

               -  Subscapularis tendon rupture of the affected shoulder

               -  Other rotator cuff injuries of the affected shoulder

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension

               -  Uncontrolled diabetes

               -  Uncontrolled thyroid disease

               -  History of thrombosis or post-thrombosis syndrome

               -  Bleeding disorder

               -  Chronic use of anticoagulation medications and the subject cannot be cleared
                  medically to stop taking medication for 7 days prior to each injection. Less than
                  or equal to 150 mg aspirin is allowed during the study.

               -  Known active hepatitis A, B, or C

               -  Other significant medical condition (eg, morbid obesity, cervical disc disease),
                  which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for
                  enrollment in the study

          -  Has received oral or intravenous steroids for any reason within 3 weeks before the
             screening visit

          -  Has received an investigational drug or treatment within 30 days before the first dose
             of study drug.

          -  Has a known allergy to collagenase or any other excipient of AA4500 or any other
             procedural medication.

          -  Has, at any time, received collagenase for the treatment of adhesive capsulitis.

          -  Is unable to undergo an x-ray or MRI (contraindication) evaluation of the affected
             shoulder.

          -  Is planning to be treated with commercial XIAFLEX at any time during the study.</exclusivecriteria>
