  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Overall survival was calculated as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at the last contact date or the primary analysis cutoff date, whichever was first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until the data cut-off date of 29 July 2016; median time on study was 9.64 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of Tumor Tissue RANK Expression With Overall Survival - To assess whether the treatment effect on overall survival was correlated with receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-?B (RANK) protein expression in tumor cells, RANK expression in archival tumor samples was measured using immunohistochemistry. The intensity of stain in the cytoplasm, membrane, and total was categorized as 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) or 3+ (strong); All intensity is the sum of levels +1, +2 and +3. In addition, an H-score was calculated using the following formula: H-score=(percentage of cells of weak×1)+(percentage of cells of moderate×2)+(percentage of cells of strong×3). The maximum H-score was 300, corresponding to 100% of cells with strong intensity.
The correlation between RANK expression level and OS was evaluated using a Cox proportional hazard models that included RANK expression level stratified by the randomization stratification factors in the corresponding treatment group.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of Tumor Tissue RANK Ligand Expression With Overall Survival - To assess whether the treatment effect on overall survival was correlated with RANK ligand (RANKL) protein expression in tumor cells, RANKL expression in archival tumor samples was measured using immunohistochemistry. The intensity of stain in the cytoplasm was categorized as 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) or 3+ (strong); All intensity is the sum of levels +1, +2 and +3.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate - Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on modified RECIST 1.1 achieved over the study duration.
CR: Disappearance of all target and non target lesions, normalization of tumor marker levels and no new lesions.
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions with no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions, or, disappearance of target lesions with persistence of one or more non-target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker levels above normal limits and no new lesions.
Participants who underwent surgical resection while on study were not evaluated for response after the surgery. Participants who did not meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis cutoff date were considered non-responders.</outcome>

      <outcome>Correlation of Tumor Tissue RANK Expression With Objective Response Rate - To assess whether the treatment effect on objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST 1.1 was correlated with RANK protein expression in tumor cells, RANK expression in archival tumor samples was measured using immunohistochemistry. The intensity of stain in the cytoplasm, membrane, and total was categorized as 0 (negative), 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate) or 3+ (strong); All intensity is the sum of levels +1, +2 and +3. In addition, an H-score was calculated using the following formula: H-score=(percentage of cells of weak×1)+(percentage of cells of moderate×2)+(percentage of cells of strong×3). The maximum H-score was 300, corresponding to 100% of cells with strong intensity.
The correlation between RANK expression level and ORR was evaluated within each treatment group using a logistical regression model that included RANK expression value as an independent variable and stratified by the randomization stratification factors. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval are reported.</outcome>

      <outcome>Clinical Benefit Rate - Clinical benefit rate was defined as the percentage of participants with an objective response (CR or PR) or stable disease (SD) or better for at least 16 weeks achieved over the study duration. If a participant underwent surgical resection while on study, the participant was not evaluated for response after the surgery. Participants who did not meet the criteria for clinical benefit by the analysis cutoff date were considered as non-responders.</outcome>

      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the first observed disease progression per modified RECIST 1.1 criteria or death from any cause. Participants last known to be alive who did not experience disease progression were censored at their last imaging assessment date, last contact date if they were in the survival follow up phase, end of the study date, or the primary analysis cut-off date, whichever was first. If a participant underwent surgical resection while on study, the participant was censored at the last evaluable imaging assessment prior to the surgery.</outcome>
