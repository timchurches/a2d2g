  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Versajet Hydrosurgery System is a tool that provides a high-pressure water jet capable of cutting tissue. It uses a high velocity sterile saline jet to cut/ debride the tissues and then draws tissue and fluid into a chamber via the Venturi effect created by the saline jet. This focused water jet passes parallel to the wound and is captured by an evacuator port which is located 8mm or 14mm from the nozzle. This jet of pressurised saline functions like a knife and the handpiece allows debridement and aspiration of debris to occur simultaneously. The Versajet system is currently utilised across many burns centres and at the Childrens Hospital at Westmead by the majority of burns surgeons and is considered a standard practice in selected cases. However, current literature regarding its clinical effectiveness (compared to the conventional tangential method of debridement using sharp excision) is scarce. The duration of debridement is dependent on the size (and depth) of the burn - approximately 10mins in burns of less than 5% TBSA. Some surgeons report that Versajet debridement is faster than conventional tangential excision in areas that are difficult to debride such as the hands, feet or perineum.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional surgical debridement of a burn wound relies on tangential excision of non viable tissue using either sharp dissection or dermabrasion. This form of debridement relies upon progressive tangential excision of the burn wound until a level of viable tissue is reached. This depth is determined by the presence of punctate bleeding. Duration of debridement again depends on the surface area to be debrided - it may vary from 15-20 mins in burns of less than 5% TBSA to 20-25 mins in burns of greater than 5% TBSA.</comparator>

    <concealment>After consent has been obtained, participants will be stratified into two categories (less than 10% total burns surface area and greater than 10% TBSA) and randomised into two groups. Group 1 is a control group that will undergo the gold standard form of debridement (tangential blade excision) prior to grafting. Group two will undergo Versajet hydrosurgery debridement. Computer generated envelopes will be chosen in theatre just prior to debridement.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the trial is to conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial of Versajet hydrosurgery debridement (removal of necrotic/ non-viable tissue) of burns versus conventional tangential excisional debridement in paediatric patients. To date no trial has compared excisional debridement with Versajet hydrosurgery in paediatric burns patients. Our hypotheses is that 
1.Versajet debridement leads to increased dermal preservation and accuracy of debridement
2.Versajet debridement is faster than conventional tangential excision in areas that are difficult to debride such as the hands, feet or perineum.
3.Graft healing time is equivalent following Versajet or classical blade debridement
4.Versajet debridement leads to improved outcomes post skin grafting such as hypertrophic scarring and contracture
5.Bacterial load is lower in the Versajet group following debridement</summary>
