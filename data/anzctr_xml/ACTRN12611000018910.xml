  <interventions>
    <interventions>In intervention the nutritional care will be provided tailored and comprehensively to the couple (age 65 + both), a person with Alzheimer disease living together with an aged spouse.
The nutritionist meets the intervention couples at least 3 times in their homes during one year and when needed additional telephone contact or home visit.  Nutritionist will discuss with them about nutritional matters and give individual nutrition counselling. Based on the meeting and food diaries the intervention couple will receive a nutritional plan in which individual nutritonal advice is given.
Particularly in connection with acute diseases and in situations requiring hospital treatment, attention should be paid to intensified nutritional care. Nutritional supplements are given when necessary. Spouses have possibilities to meet each others and the nutritionist in group meetings three times during the intervention and discuss about nutritional matters and challenges at home.</interventions>

    <summary>Effect of tailored nutritional treatment of aged individuals with Alzheimer disease living at home with their spouses  randomized controlled intervention trial

Impaired nutritional status is associated with many diseases, such as Alzheimer disease, depression, stroke, falling, hip fractures and pressure sores. In aged people, weight loss and malnutrition are health risks that should be addressed immediately. One of the first symptoms of memory disorder is often weight loss accelerating sarcopenia and loss of functional ability. Elderly individuals with Alzheimer disease living at home with their spouses are important target groups for nutritional care, because it may support their nutritional status and well-being and make it possible to live at home longer. Individual assessment of nutritional status and food intake, as well as planning of tailored nutritional care, are important in order to maintain a good nutritional status in an aged person. Only few studies have been carried out on this issue but they have suggested that nutritional care has been proved effective on health, quality of life, functional ability and use of health services among elderly with Alzheimer disease living at home with their elderly spouses. This is the first study in the Finnish setting. 

The aim of the trial is to find out whether tailored nutritional treatment of aged persons (1) with Alzheimer disease living with their (2) aged spouses at home could be used to affect their
-	nutritional status 
-	energy, protein and nutrient intake retrieved from food diaries
-	body mass index (BMI)
-	functional ability
-	mental functioning 
-	social isolation and psychosocial wellbeing 
-	health-related quality of life, and 
-	the use of health services (cost-effectiveness)
The hypothesis is that tailored nutritional treatment has a positive impact on nutritional parameters, health, wellbeing, caregiver burden and the use of health services among home-dwelling elderly people with (1) Alzheimer disease and their (2) spouses.

The study will be a randomized intervention trial. 200 couples in which the spouse takes care of his/her Alzheimer patient companion at home will be recruited. The present research creates new and detailed knowledge of tailored nutritional intervention possibilities among home-dwelling aged people with Alzheimer-disease and other diseases. Results from the trial will be highly relevant for the development of nutritional care of elderly living at home. This helps nutritionists and health/social care professionals to focus nutritional intervention methods and increase their knowledge in preventing malnutrition and its adverse affects. The study provides detailed information on how the tailored nutritional intervention can be performed in home setting.</summary>
