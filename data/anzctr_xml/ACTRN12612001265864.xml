  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 weeks of twice-weekly group-based yoga focusing on standing postures that are likely to challenge balance such as one-legged standing and side lunges. Each class with last for 1 hour and will be supervised by a qualified yoga instructor experienced with running classes for older people. Participants will also be instructed to complete a set of the yoga poses at home twice weekly.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The standing balance component of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) with the addition of one-legged stance time.  The three standing balance positions of the SPPB include standing for 10 seconds each with feet side by side, feet in semi-tandem and in tandem positions. The sum of time able to stand in the four positions (with addition of one-legged stance), up to a maximum of 40 seconds is the primary outcome measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and after completion of the 12 week intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Timed sit to stand test with five repetitions- time it takes, measured in seconds, for the participant to stand up and sit down fives times from a standard height chair with their arms folded across their chest</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and after completion of the 12 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Timed four metre walk at fast pace- time taken to complete the task measured in seconds</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and after completion of the 12 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One-legged stance with eyes closed (time able to stand up to a maximum of 10 seconds)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the benefits of a yoga-based exercise program aimed at preventing falls in older people by improving their balance and mobility. The trial will evaluate the effect of a 12-week yoga program on balance and mobility in 54 older people, randomly split between two groups. The intervention group will participate in a twice weekly group-based program of yoga focusing on balance- challenging standing postures. An experienced yoga instructor will deliver the classes. The control group will receive information about falls risk factors and prevention, but will not participate in the classes. We expect that the yoga group participants will show significant improvements in measures of balance and mobility compared to the control group after the 12 week intervention period.</summary>
