  <interventions>
    <interventions>The device is a functional applicance made from a stainless steel casing and acrylic which houses a small magnet. The device is cemented onto the occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth and with the use of magnetic forces moves the lower jaw forward. The amount of movment of the jaw is determined by another magnetic plate which is designed so that the magnet is placed at 3mm intervals which will act to move the lower jaw forward in 3mm incremental steps. The device is worn in the mouth for 9 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment control group and twin block control group as assessed by two other studies.

No other functional appliance is used in the study, only information from other studies previously done is used.

The source of the historical data is several published journal articles and they range in time from 1980 to 2010</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess a new orthodontic appliance which moves the lower jaw forward in a stepwise fashion.  It is intended that the orthodontic appliance will be more comfortable than other appliances as it is less bulky and will result in a better physiological response because of the stepwise advancement of the lower jaw.</summary>
