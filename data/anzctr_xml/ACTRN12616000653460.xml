  <interventions>
    <interventions>The LEAP-CP intervention is a multidisciplinary family-centred intervention comprising of 2 parts; (1) delivered peer to peer in the home during 15 fortnightly 2-hour visits (over a 7-10 month period, allowing for missed visits due to illness and family/ religious events); (2) delivered by the caregiver to the infant daily (based on the games/ strategies delivered in the fortnightly peer to peer visit. 

During the fortnightly visit, the Community Disability Worker (peer trainer) will (i) gather feedback and troubleshoots the previous fortnights activities, (ii) deliver the therapeutic modules, (iii) deliver the educational module. The caregiver will be provided with written and pictographic information of the three modules each fortnight to facilitate their use of the strategies each day during the upcoming fortnight. 

Therapeutic Modules:
The therapeutic modules are first modeled with the infant by the CDW, and then the caregiver encouraged to engage with their infant, with CDW coaching. The therapeutic modules consist of:
1.	Multidimensional activity based curriculum for infants aged 3-18 months, based on the Creative Curriculum Learning Games (Sparling &amp; Lewis 2008) as a framework for structure and approach. Culturally modified activity cards are translated into Bengali, and include pictographic prompts for how to make this game easier and how to encourage practice in other situations. The CDW will present four activity cards to the caregiver each fortnight from which the caregiver selects two to learn and deliver with their infant during the fortnight (total of 30 games for the program duration). The four options will be selected based on the infants age and developmental stage, with guidance from the Community Coordinator. The literature highlights the importance of collaborative selection of therapeutic activities. When delivering a game, the CDW ensures that the infant can complete at least part of the task actively, to ensure optimal motor learning. 
2.	Individualised goal-directed module: Specific goal-based strategies will be introduced using strategy sheets developed for the study by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians specialised in cerebral palsy (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, psychology and physician).  Caregivers will be supported to choose a self-generated intervention goal in visit number 2, individualised to their infant. Each goal area includes red flags for referral for complex and high risk presentations. As a goal is achieved, caregivers will be encouraged to choose a new goal. If the infant remains on a goal without progress for greater than 4 visits (2 months), caregivers will be encouraged to choose a new goal.

Dose: The overall dose delivered directly to the infant will be 104.2 hours for the 15 fortnight intervention. The overall dose delivered to the caregiver will be 30 hours (2 hours per fortnight). The infant intervention dose is a combination of:
(1) the intervention delivered to the infant during the CDW visit with the caregiver and infant (1 hour per fortnight, to a total program dose of 15 hours. While the CDW visit is for 2 hours in duration, 1 hour will be parent education which is not included in the direct infant intervention dose);
(2) the intervention delivered daily by the caregiver (which is graded with infant age as follows). The caregiver delivered intervention will commence at 3-6 months C.A. at a dose of 20 minutes per day for 5 days per week (1.6 hours) up to 6 months C.A. (total dose 19.2 hours); then graduate to 30 minutes per day for 5 days per week (2.5 hours per week) from 6-9 months C.A. (total 30 hours); then 40 minutes per day for 5 days per week (3.3 hours per week) from 9-12 months C.A. (total 40 hours).  

Service Delivery with Community Disability Workers (CDW)
A caregiver enrolled in the intervention will be trained as a Community Disability Worker (CDW) to deliver the intervention (peer to peer). One caregiver will be employed as a CDW for each community cluster (approximately six infants). They will receive a five day training package at the onset of the program (with the Chief Investigator, an Australian Post-doctoral fellow and speech pathologist). This will include topics such as:
-	Building rapport and a positive therapeutic relationship with caregivers
-	Exploring customs, beliefs and family culture
-	Using everyday opportunities and routines to encourage infant development
-	Observation skills and coaching
-	Motor training and therapeutic principles
-	Understanding typical development and development in cerebral palsy.
-	Ethics and research practices

CDWs will also receive training for 3 hours each fortnight with the Community Coordinator (Bangladesh trained therapist or allied health professional) to support them in the specific content of the program (therapeutic and educational modules). During this fortnightly session, they will also have opportunity for supervision, debriefing, and troubleshooting.

Concurrent therapies: Any concurrent therapies provided to the infants in either arm of the study will be recorded by the CDW on the HRU form during their fortnightly visit.

Adverse events: Any adverse events associated with the program will be screened at 6 and 12 months using open-ended questions by non-treating personnel.

Fidelity: Intervention dose will be measured by (1) token counting; (2) videoed activities; (3) CDW feedback. Two fortnights per caregiver will be randomly selected to estimate the frequency the caregiver applies the intervention strategies. Caregivers are asked to put a token in the jar for every 10 minute interaction with their infant, to estimate the total fortnightly interaction time. Caregivers with literacy will complete a paper version. In addition, 10 minutes of interaction will be videoed by the CDW to quantify the use of the previous fortnights strategies by the caregiver. The CDW will also record feedback from the caregiver, including successes and challenges to implementation. Frequency and duration of access to local therapy services will be recorded fortnightly on the Health Resource Use Form, and included in the analysis.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive 15 fortnightly visits from a different CDW, delivering standard care based on the World Health Organisation Integrated Management of Childhood Illness: Key Family Practices'. This includes counselling on breastfeeding and introduction of complementary nutrition, hygiene practices, immunisation counselling, and management of the sick child. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size:
The primary hypothesis is that the community-based intervention will improve childrens normative standard scores on the PEDI-CAT at 12 months by 0.5SD compared to standard care. A sample size of 64 children per group will be required to detect this change (alpha=0.05, beta=0.8). Assuming 10% attrition during the year, this would equate to 71 children per group (total recruitment n=142). 
Analysis:
Descriptive statistics (frequencies, means and 95% confidence intervals) will be used to describe each of the samples (at baseline and post-intervention). Intention to treat analysis will be used to compare outcomes post-intervention, using the PEDI-CAT as the primary outcome measure. Between-group differences on the PEDI-CAT normative standard score (continuous data) will be compared using multivariate linear regression, adjusting for differences between sample characteristics (eg. age, gender, epilepsy, GMFCS, motor type, preterm status, socioeconomic status). Secondary analyses will consider gains on motor or cognitive outcomes (PDMS-2, BSID-III), caregiver outcomes and health economics. All analyses will be conducted using STATA 13, with significance set at p&lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One in seven people globally has a disability, forming the worlds largest and most disadvantaged minority. Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability, with 80% of the estimated global burden in low and middle income countries (LMIC). The current state of evidence allows reliable prediction of infants at risk of CP from 13 weeks, however children in LMIC typically do not receive their diagnosis until 5 years. This means we are missing a significant window of opportunity for treatment when infants neuroplasticity is optimal. 

This study aims to determine the effectiveness of an early detection and intervention program for infants at high risk of CP in a low income country. This is a cluster-randomised double blind controlled trial of 142 high risk infants living in South Asia (inclusion criteria: absent fidgety General Movements at 12-17 weeks, or abnormal score on the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Evaluation at 18-26 weeks). Infants are randomised into a community-based parent-delivered 'best practice' intervention (15 fortnights of enriched environment (based on the Learning Games curriculum, demonstrated effective in over 16 RCTs); goal-directed motor training; and parent education, including nutrition, parenting and health) versus standard care (based on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness). The intervention will be conducted through a train the trainer model, based on the highly effective lay health worker model, to ensure long-term sustainability. Primary functional outcomes will be measured at 18 months using the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory-Computer Adaptive Test. It is hypothesised that children receiving the intervention will have improved motor and cognitive outcomes, and caregivers to have improved mental health. This program presents a feasible, transposable and scalable model which, if shown to be effective, has the potential to reduce the burden of disability in LMICs.</summary>
