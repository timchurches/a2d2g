This involves open surgical repair of the fracture ends using either wires or a plate to hold the bones in place. The procedure takes approximately one hour. It is performed by an orthopaedic surgeon or orthopaedic surgeon in training.</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-operative treatment.
This involves symptomatic relief by placing the broken elbow in a sling, or using a plaster splint if necessary. This is only used for up to two weeks, as participants will be encouraged to use the arm normally as the pain improves.</comparator>

Sample size calculation.
Based on having 95% power to detect the minimum clinically important difference (15 points) at a significance level of 0.05, 26 patients are required in each group (SD = 15). Allowing for 20% loss to follow up, we aim to recruit 65 patients.
The minimum clinically important difference of 15 points (in a 100 point scale) is suggested by the developers of the DASH score (http://www.dash.iwh.on.ca/). Such a difference is needed to be achieved by surgery in order to justify the additional costs and risks of surgery compared to non-operative treatment.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>BACKGROUND
Operative treatment (surgery) is currently the standard way of treating displaced fractures of the olecranon. There is some evidence that good results can be achieved by treating these injuries non-operatively (without surgery). A direct comparison of these treatment methods is needed.
AIM
This study aims to determine if operative fixation (surgery) is superior to non-operative treatment for isolated displaced fractures of the olecranon (elbow tip) in patients presenting with recent fractures who are aged 75 years or older.
HYPOTHESIS
It is our hypothesis that operative treatment yields superior elbow pain and function after one year, compared to non-operative treatment.
PARTICIPANTS
Participants will be selected from patients who present to participating hospitals with olecranon fractures that have occurred within the last 2 weeks, who are eligible for the study. They will be randomised to one of the two treatment arms of the study (operative or non-operative treatment).
OUTCOMES
Participants will be followed for one year, and the function and pain in the elbow, as well as any complications and their X-rays will be compared.</summary>
