  <interventions>
    <interventions>An intervention of Group Triple P will be delivered as group training and telephone consultations, which teaches parents parenting strategies to develop desirable relationship with child, to promote child positive behaviors and to manage child difficult behaviors. Participating parents will be assigned randomly to two groups, intervention group and waitlist control group. The intervention group will immediately receive the Group Triple P training, which will last for 8 weeks, while the waitlist group will receive the same training afterwards. The Group Triple P intervention includes 8 sessions, with 4 x 2 hours group training which will be provided in the first four weeks, and then 4 X 15-30 minutes telephone consultations for the later 4 weeks. Session attendance will be recorded to monitor parents' adherence. The program will be provided by a trained practitioner in Chinese.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Parents will voluntarily participate in the study. Their eligibility will be assessed by the research team over the telephone. After parents receive a brief explanation of the study and indicate verbal consent to participate, a package of questionnaires (pre-intervention assessment) will be sent to them via internet or mail. After they complete the questionnaires, parents will be randomly assigned to intervention group or waitlist control group. 

The procedure for the treatment allocation: A person who is not involved in the trial will generate the treatment allocation sequence with a lists of computer-generated random numbers. The person then will record this in a folded piece of paper and place it in sequentially numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes. Once parents have completed the pre-intervention assessment, the researcher will open the sealed envelope and informed parents their allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence> A computer-generated list of random numbers will be used to assign the participants to 2 groups. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Triple P - Positive Parenting Program,as the first evidence-based public health model, has been disseminated to a number of countries across various cultures. However, the effectiveness with Chinese parents in Mainland China has never been tested, yet there's no evidence-based parenting program in Mainland China. Moreover, it is also unknown if Triple P can have any effects on children's academic lives. This research project aims to test the effectiveness of a Triple P variant - Group Triple P with Chinese parents and on children's academic outcomes in Shanghai, Mainland China. A randomized control research design will be employed. It is expected that in comparison to parents in a waitlist control group, parents who receive Group Triple P training (intervention group) will report a significant increase in parenting efficacy, parental teamwork and parent involvement, and a significant decrease in dysfunctional parenting practices, parental stress, and child emotional and behavioral problems.  Also the children of these parents will report significant improvement of parenting of their parents, significant increase in academic self-regulation, and significant decrease in learning stress. These changes are predicted to be maintained at 6-month follow-up assessment.</summary>
