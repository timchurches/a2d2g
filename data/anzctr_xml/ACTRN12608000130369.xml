  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will investigate: 1) whether exercise therapy will be more effective than no exercise therapy, whether manual therapy will be more effective than no manual therapy, and whether exercise therapy with manual therapy will have an additive or interaction effect over just one mode of therapy; 2) whether, overall, physiotherapy interventions in addition to usual medical care will be more effective than usual care alone for reducing pain and disability in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee; 3) whether the proportion of participants undergoing joint replacement surgery is lower in the groups receiving trial physiotherapy interventions compared to the group receiving usual care alone; and 4) the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing physiotherapy interventions for patients with OA of the hip or knee.</summary>
