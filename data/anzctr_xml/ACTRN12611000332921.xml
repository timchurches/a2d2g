  <interventions>
    <interventions>Completion of a nine-item falls risk assessment and delivery of one or more of the following six interventions to high risk falls patients: 
1. Placement of a "falls alert" sign above the patient's bed. 2. Supervision of patients while in bathroom. 
3. Use of a low-low bed. Where a low-low bed is a standard hospital bed that has the additional feature of being able to be lowered to 250mm from the floor level or lower. These beds are designed to reduce the risk of bed fall-related injuries. 
4. Ensuring that the patient's walking aid is within reach at all times. 
5. Establishment of a toileting regime. 
6. Use of bed/chair alarm when the patient is positioned in the bed/chair. 

The 6-PACK interventions will be applied to high falls risk patients at the discretion of the patients treating nurse. The frequency and duration of the interventions used will not be prescribed by the research project but will be measured as part of the cluster RCT. 

Site clinical leaders will be trained in the 6-PACK program and implementation by the research team. The site clinical leaders will then deliver small interactive group training sessions to intervention ward nursing staff. Intervention ward staff will also be provided with access to an online training package. This will ensure intervention ward staff delivering the 6-PACK interventions will be trained to take part in the study and deliver the 6-PACK interventions. 

The overall duration of this trial will be: 
1. Baseline data collection - 6 months 
2. Cluster RCT - 12 months 
3. Sustainability of the 6-PACK program - 24 months (including the 12 months of data obtained from the cluster RCT) 
In summary data collection will span a total of 30 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual patient care.

Usual care practice will be defined as any standard hospital practice provided by wards as part of existing hospital policy relating to falls prevention. Commonly used usual care falls prevention practice involves the promotion of a targeted and multifactorial falls prevention model, which is supported by best practice guidelines. These models promote a risk assessment on admission and more than 20 interventions.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The hypotheses will be explored using a multicentre single blinded cluster RCT. Hospitals will be asked to identify wards where fall-related injuries are a problem as potential wards to participate in the study. For wards to be eligible to participate in the project the following criteria must be met: 
Acute medical and surgical wards (primarily adult wards); Average patient length of stay &lt;10 days; 
Wards to have one or less low-low bed to six standard beds on medical wards and one or less low-low bed to 29 standard beds on surgical wards; and 
No falls risk assessment and/or intervention checklist on the DAILY patient care plan documentation. 

Wards that have a policy to complete a falls risk assessment tool on admission and / or as status changes will not be excluded from the study. All patients admitted to participating wards during the study observation period will be included in the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Hospitals will be identified via: 1. State based falls prevention networks, 2. Hospitals where members of the investigator team hold conjoint appointments, and 3. Expressions of interests logged with the project team. Following informal discussions and interest in participating in the study have been established, hospitals will be invited to participate in the study. We expect to formally recruit six to eight hospitals from which a total of 24 wards will be randomised. Hospitals that agree to participate in this project will be required to provide extract reports from hospital administrative databases and ensure access to 6-PACK equipment and staffing. 

Pairs of wards from each hospital will be matched by type and fall-related injury rates using six months baseline observation data. A blinded statistician using computer generated randomisation methods will then allocate pairs of matched wards to either intervention or control group, to ensure allocation concealment.

All patients admitted to the 24 study wards during the cluster RCT study period will be included in the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Wards within each pair will be randomly allocated to control or intervention arm using a web-based allocation generated by the program nQuery Advisor (http://www.statistical-solutions-software.com) to generate random numbers and allocations.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>It will not be feasible to blind ward nurses or patients to the intervention. In order to reduce observer bias, randomisation and analysis of the primary outcome will be assessed by a statistician who will be blind to group allocation. In addition an assessor, blinded to group allocation, will classify all fall-related injuries (none, mild, moderate, major) according to the predefined criteria. A mixed methods study will be conducted to examine the barriers and enablers to successful implementation and sustainability of the 6-PACK falls prevention program. This will involve both qualitative and quantitative methods. An incremental cost-effectiveness study will be conducted to determine the cost or savings per fall or fall-related injury prevented.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to provide evidence of the efficacy and sustainability of the 6-PACK program for preventing fall-related injuries in acute hospitals. Twenty-four acute medical and surgical wards from six to eight hospitals throughout Australia will be recruited. Wards will be matched by type and baseline fall-related injury rates then randomly allocated to either the 6-PACK intervention (12 wards) or the usual care control group (12 wards).The 6-PACK program includes completion of a nine-item falls risk assessment and six nursing interventions: falls alert sign above the patients bed; supervision of patients while in the bathroom; ensuring that the patients walking aid is within reach; establishment of a toileting regime; use of a low-low bed and use of bed/chair alarm. Intervention wards will receive 6-PACK equipment (falls alert signs, low-low beds and bed/chair alarms) and there will be a supported implementation (small group training and assignment of clinical leaders) and review strategy (audit, feedback and reminders). A cost effectiveness study of the 6-PACK program will also be conducted. The effectiveness of the 6-PACK implementation will also be examined using a structured mixed methods evaluation. Sustainability will be assessed in the year after the RCT when there will be a staged withdrawal of the research staff from the sites. The primary outcome measures are fall and fall-related injury rates in the 12 months after the 6-PACK is implemented. The cost-effectiveness outcome is cost or saving per fall prevented and cost or saving per fall-related injury prevented calculated from differences in mean costs and effects in the intervention and control groups to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Outcome analyses will be undertaken on an intention to treat basis. Differences in fall and fall-related injury rates will be compared between groups using negative binomial regression where data are adjusted for clustering and pairing of wards. Primary analysis will be unadjusted. Secondary analyisis that adjusts for age and cognitive impairment will also be conducted. This study is planned to be the largest hospital falls prevention RCT to be undertaken and is the first to be powered to the important primary outcome of falls injuries.</summary>
