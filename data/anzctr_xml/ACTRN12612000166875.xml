  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to assess the effectiveness of progesterone as luteal phase support in unexplained subfertile women with a previously diagnosed luteal phase hormonal deficiency. 

All women will be instructed in a fertility awareness-based charting method (the Sympto-Thermal method). 

It is hypothesised that progesterone given as luteal phase support increases the likelihood of pregnancy in unexplained subfertile women with a recognised luteal phase hormonal defect.</summary>
