  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute ureteric colic is the pain caused by the passage of kidney stones.  Standard treatment is the administration of pain-relieving medications.  Intravenous (IV) fluids may also help relieve pain, may cause further pain or have no effect on pain at all.  There is a lack of evidence regarding the impact of IV fluids on pain relief in acute ureteric colic.  This study hopes to delineate this role by randomising participants with acute ureteric colic into two groups, both of which reflect current practice.  The first group will receive IV fluids at a preset rate; the second group will receive IV fluids only with medications.  Pain scores via a visual-analogue scale will be taken hourly for up to four hours; these will then be compared to see if there is any clinically significant difference in the pain scores between the two groups.</summary>
