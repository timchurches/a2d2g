    <concealment>Potential participants were screened for all major inclusion and exclusion criteria via email or phone followed by a physical screening by 2 physiotherapists to confirm a diagnosis of anterior knee pain.
On giving informed consent, participants were allocated to the treatment or intervention group based on computerised randomisation program. An automated data file set up by a third party off-site was used to preserve allocation concealment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The first purpose of this study is to examine if comfortable in shoe foot orthoses improve the symptoms of anterior knee pain over a short-term period more than a control group who does not receive orthoses. The second purpose is to determine what physiological effect is causing any improvement. We hypothesise orthoses will improve symptoms more than a control and that these improvements are occuring via adaptations in the activity of the lower limb muscles.</summary>
