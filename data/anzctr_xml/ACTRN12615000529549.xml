  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Group A will receive Artificial light therapy: provided through Re-Timer goggles, which provide a blue-green 500 nm dominant wavelength, UV free-light at a setting of 506 Lux lm/m2. Participants will wear the goggles and receive the light therapy between the hours of 6am and 8am for 30 minutes for two consecutive weeks, Monday to Friday. Researchers will remain with participants to monitor adherence. 

Arm 2: Group B will receive Natural light therapy: provided through natural sunlight. Participants will sit outside in the early morning light for 30 minutes between the hours of 6am and 8am, for two consecutive weeks, Monday to Friday. Researchers will remain with participants to monitor adherence.


Group A and B will be randomly assigned to A1 or A2 and B1 or B2. A1 (artificial light) and B1 (natural light) will receive therapy for two consecutive weeks, Monday to Friday. While Group A2 and B2 will be allocated to the control group and receive care as usual. Following these two weeks, Group A2 (artificial light) and B2 (natural light) will receive two consecutive weeks of light therapy and A1 and B2 will receive care as usual.  Following this four week period, all participants will be allocated to a "wash out" period of two consecutive weeks. The total study time is 6 weeks. Participants will either receive artificial light therapy or natural light therapy. Outcome measures will be administered at baseline, 2 weeks following treatment commencement, 4 weeks following treatment commencement and 6 weeks following treatment commencement. </interventions>
    <comparator>When participants from Arm 1 and Arm 2 are not receiving light therapy they will be receiving no treatment wait-list group and be receiving care as usual for two consecutive weeks.  Care as usual includes day to day care received at the residential aged-care facility, including physiotherapy, podiatry and dietician. All participants may receive different day to day care within the facility. This is not expected to significantly alter the study outcomes. Control participants will receive treatment when those first assigned to the intervention group have completed their treatment i.e. after 2 weeks.</comparator>

      <outcome>sleep characteristics as measured by a sleep diary and actiwatch 2. The sleep diary gathers information on time participant went to bed, estimated time of sleep onset, amount of awakenings during the night, time of wake onset and amount of naps taken each day. The actiwatch 2 is a monitoring system that measures participants sleep/wake pattern and activity in response to therapy.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics suitable for a small-n design. The statistics will illustrate means and standard deviations and will be presented using bar graphs. G*Power was originally used to determine the necessary sample size. However, the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria will likely lead to a small number of suitable participants receiving artificial light therapy. The study will act as a pilot study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The older population often presented with changes in mood, such as depression. Biological changes in the body can contribute to depression. These changes can be altered by strategic management of light exposure. It is believed that exposing older people to light in the early morning will lead to biological shifts, which will reduce depressive symptoms. The purpose of the study is to see whether exposing older people to artificial light and natural sunlight can improve their symptoms of depression, with the aim of improving treatment opportunities for the older population.</summary>
