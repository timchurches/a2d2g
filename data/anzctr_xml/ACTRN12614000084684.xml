  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing two formulations of drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, drospirenone and ethinyloestradiol is a combined oral contraceptive contained synthetic progestogen (drospirenone) and the synthetic oestrogen (ethinyloestradiol).</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover over study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol (1 x 3 mg/0.03 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol (1 x 3 mg/0.03 mg)  on one occasion with each dose seperated by a two week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol.

Each dose (1 x 3/0.3 mg) will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 

Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance can be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the healthy of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the two formulations. All plasma samples will be assayed for drospirenone/ethinyloestradiol using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines. </outcome>
      <timepoint>0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0, 24.0, 32.0, 48.0, 56.0 and 72.0 hours </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) and the elimination half life (t1/2). Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. T1/2 = 0.693/Kel where kel is the terminal elimination rate constant. </outcome>
