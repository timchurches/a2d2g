  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive two pairs of standard commerically available shoes (from Clarks Australia); one pair for school and one pair for ordinary wear. The shoes will be custom fitted during a single one-on-one appointment (approximate duration of 1 hour) with a podiatrist trained in fitting shoes. The school shoes will be Clarks Laura (females) or Lochie (males) model shoes. Participants that have feet that are too large for the Laura/Lochie styles or prefer lace-up shoes will be provided with Daytona model shoes.  Ordinary wear shoes will be Clarks Ventura model (males and females) shoes. Participants that prefer lace-up shoes will be provided with Vancouver model shoes. 

The duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks. Participants will be expected to use the school shoes when they go to school and use the ordinary wear shoes at other times (i.e. when they are not at school but are wearing shoes). 

Adherence will be monitored by specially designed questionnaire that the parents will complete at 6 and 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group (wait list control) will continue wearing their existing shoes and will then receive two pairs of customised fit shoes at the end of the study (12 weeks).</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be completed using SPSS (IBM Corp, NY, USA). Demographic characteristics and baseline data will be summarized by descriptive statistics. 

Data on outcome measures will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Multiple imputation will be used to replace any missing data using five iterations, with age, baseline scores, and group allocation as predictors.

Groups will be compared on primary and secondary outcomes at week 6 and 12. Continuously-scored outcome measures will be analysed using analysis of covariance with the intervention group and baseline scores entered as independent variables.  Effect sizes and associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each outcome. A sample size calculation for a fully powered randomised controlled trial will also be completed. 

Acceptability data from semi-structured interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis by two independent assessors and final themes will be agreed by consensus.

Statistical significance for hypothesis tests will be set at the conventional level of a = 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is:
To conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial to evaluate if wearing customised fit shoes increases physical activity among children and adolescents with Down syndrome.

The research questions are:
In children with Down syndrome:
* Does improving shoe fit increase physical activity?
* Does improving shoe fit improve foot specific disability, and walking patterns? 
* Are customised fit shoes acceptable? 

The study methods are:
We will conduct a pilot randomised trial to compare customised fit shoes (intervention) to a waitlist (control) group for children with Down syndrome. Thirty participants with Down syndrome aged 5 to 17 years will be recruited, and randomly allocated to one of two groups. The intervention group (15 children) will receive two pairs of customised fit shoes (from Clarks Australia): one pair for school and one pair for ordinary wear. The control group (15 children) will continue wearing their existing shoes for 12 weeks (and will then receive two pairs of customised fit shoes). Participants will be assessed at the start of the study (baseline/week 0), then at 6, and 12 weeks. Four outcomes will be measured: (1) physical activity (using an activity monitor collected over 7 days) (main outcome), (2) computerised gait analysis, (3) foot-specific disability using a questionnaire called the Oxford Ankle Foot Questionnaire for Children, and (4) acceptability of the intervention (using an interview approach).</summary>
