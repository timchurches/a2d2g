    <interventions>To evaluate the efficacy of direct corneal neurotization using supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves in patients with anaesthetic cornea.
Through a bicoronal incision, the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves will be identified and carefully dissected under high magnification. 
The nerve branches will then be tunnelled over the nasal bridge to a small incision along the lid crease of the upper lid of the contralateral anaesthetic eye. 
Under the operating microscope, the distal nerve branches will be retrieved with a fine hemostat inserted through a tiny incision under the upper lid.
The eye will then be directed downward using a superior rectus tendon traction suture. 
An incision through the superior bulbar conjunctiva 7mm behind the superonasal position of the corneal limbus will be made.
In the potential space between where the sclera and Tenons capsule are juxtaposed to the anatomical corneal limbus, a tunnel will be created by blunt dissection using curved scissors around the circumference of the corneal limbus both temporally and nasally to the points of planned insertion of the prepared nerves. 
The distal nerve branches will be passed into the prepared perilimbal space, fanned and sutured into place in the conjunctival sac next to the corneal limbus with 10-0 monofilament nylon sutures under direct high magnification.
The overall surgery time will be approximately 45 minutes.</interventions>

Patients with condition that may affect healing or not amendable to neurotization e.g. focal anaesthetic cornea, band keratopathy, conjunctival disease, previous corneal surgery, significant subepithelial stromal scar
Patients that intervention may preclude future sight preserving operation to the eye e.g. glaucoma which may require filtration surgery

    <concealment>Patients with anaesthetic corneas will undergo clinical and ophthalmological examination. We plan to recruit patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria over 12 months. Baseline severity of neurotrophic keratopathy is recorded and staged. Baseline degree of cornea anaesthesia will be recorded on a 5 zone map.  Only patients with global anaesthetic corneas confirmed by clinical examination and testing (esthesiometry) and deemed suitable for corneal neurotization will be included in the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is been carried out to investigate if transplanting the nerve from the opposite side to replace the damaged one will help restore sensation to your numb cornea. If procedure is successful, it will restore sensation to your cornea and help prevent the cornea from developing ulcers. This procedure has previously been shown to be successful in restoring sensation to numb corneas.</summary>
