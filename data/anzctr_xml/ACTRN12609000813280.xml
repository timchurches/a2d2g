  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CBPE programme consists of shoulder anatomy, shoulder exercises, adherence enhancing strategies, advise on functional activities and quizzes. Participants will be directed by their physiotherapists to the relevant content for their disorder.  The programme will be available to the participants for 4 weeks, during which time they can access it at any time.  Participants will be expected to exercise daily.   There will also be access to a chat room for social support which will require the participants to have a user name and login.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CBPE will improve rehabilitation outcomes, adherence, self-efficacy and knowledge for participants.  CBPE can be developed using sound educational principles to foster patient understanding (see Mayer, 2001) and can incorporate behaviour changing strategies to enhance adherence (see Conner &amp; Norman, 2005).  Moreover, the facility for interactivity using computer programmes can increase patient involvement and allow programmes to be tailored to individual patients.  This may include a directory of specific exercises for individuals, itemising personal action and coping plans, and providing feedback from quiz participation.  Inherent to CBPE programmes, information is consistent and repeatable with access being limited only by computer availability.  Patients can also offer multiple pathways to progress through programmes thereby accommodating individual learning styles.  Although CBPE has been successfully developed in other sectors of healthcare (Keulers, Welters, Spauwen, &amp; Houpt, 2007; Stinson et al., 2008; Stromberg, Ahlen, Fridlund, &amp; Dahlstrom, 2002; Wetstone, Sheehan, Votow, Peterson, &amp; Rothfield, 1985), there are no known programmes of this type for physiotherapy rehabilitation.  Given the extent that patient education is used in physiotherapy, the poor adherence to it and recent advances in technology, investigation into CBPE is warranted.</summary>
