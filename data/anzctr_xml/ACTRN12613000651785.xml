  <interventions>
    <interventions>RPH-203 is the active solution stored in 10ml glass vials which contains 40mg RPH-203 in 4ml.

There will be 6 cohorts in this study and will follow the dosing regimen below:

Single dose of 10mg RPH203 administered subcutaneously
Single dose of 30mg RPH203 administered subcutaneously
Single dose of 60mg RPH203 administered subcutaneously
Single dose of 60mg RPH203 administered intravenously 
Single dose of 120mg RPH203 administered intravenously
Single dose of 180mg RPH203 administered intravenously  

Up to 48 healthy male participants (8 participants per cohort) will be enrolled and assigned to 6 sequential dose cohorts of RPH-203 (10.0mg, 30.0mg, 60.0mg administered subcutaneously and 60.0mg, 120.0mg, 180.0mg administered intravenously) or matching placebo (dummy drug with no active substance). Each participant will have 3 out of 4 chance of receiving the active RPH-203 drug and 1 out 4 chance of receiving the placebo. The assignment will be random, similar to the toss of a coin. As this is a dose escalation study, the first group will receive the lowest dose and when it is determined safe, the second group will receive a higher dose. The same procedure will be performed for each dosing group aside from the route of administration which can be either subcutaneous or intravenous. Participants will be told which group they will take part in and what the dose level will be. As this is the first time this drug is being given in humans, 2 participants from the first dosing group will be given the drug first. 1 will be receiving the active drug and the other will receive the placebo. The assignment will be done at random. The remaining 6 participants will be given the drug at least 48 hours later when the drug is deemed safe. Participants will be advised if they are intended to be the first 2 participants before they come to the unit for dosing. All 8 participants will be dosed together for all other dosing groups. Participants will be admitted and be required to stay in the study unit for 3 days and be required to attend outpatient visits on 5 occasions. This study is being conducted at the Centre for Clinical Studies.

This study will only involve a single dose of the investigational product RPH203 or placebo however the entire duration of the study including screening period is up to 55 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo (sodium chloride) will also be used in each of the treatment cohort and will be administered subcutaneously or intravenously depending on the treatment cohort.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint for this study is the safety and tolerability of RPH-203 which will be assessed using the following:
1. Incidence, nature, relatedness, and severity of adverse events.
2. Change in vital signs and physical examination from baseline.
3. Change in clinical laboratory results and 12-lead ECG results.

As this is the first in human study for RPH-203, there were no previously recorded adverse reactions observed in human. However, based on animal studies in monkeys that were administered with much higher dose levels (more than 10 fold higher) of RPH-203, the following are the most common side effects that have been observed: *Increase in liver enzymes *Increase in creatinine kinase, which is an enzyme that releases energy in your cells *Skin reactions (reddening, bruising)</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. The monitoring of adverse events will be performed throughout the study and when reported by the participants.

2. Vital signs will be monitored at screening, the day before dosing (Day -1), Day 1,2,3,7,12,20 and 27. Physical examination will be performed at screening and on the Day 27.

3. ECGs will be monitored at screening, Day 1,2,3,7,12,20 and 27. Clinical  laboratory results will be monitored at screening, the day before dosing (Day -1), Day 2,3,7,12,20 and 27.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the secondary enpoint is PK parameters which will be derived from the serum concentration-time profile of RPH-203 following administration:
*Total exposure (AUC)
*Maximum serum concentration (Cmax)
*Clearance (CL)
*Volume of distribution (Vd)
Other parameters, such as accumulation ratio, elimination half-life, and dose proportionality will also be assessed.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK samples will be collected for analysis at the following timepoints: Predose, 30mins, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 24, 48hrs post dose and on Day 7, 12, 20 and 27.</timepoint>

    <summary>This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of RPH-203 following a single dose in health male volunteers as a potential treatment for secondary cancer of the bone. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 45 years old, have a body mass index between 19kg/m2 and 30kg/m2, have a negative Quantiferon (Registered Trademark) test, male and healthy.
