  <interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first episode of major haemorrhage or clinically relevant non-major haemorrhage.  
Major haemorrhage will be defined according to the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and (ISTH) definition of: 
a. Fatal bleeding and/or 
b. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome and/or 
c. Bleeding causing a fall in haemoglobin level of 20g/L or more or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood or red cells. 

Clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be defined according to the ISTH definition of any sign or symptom of clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major bleed but requires medical attention, including at least one of the following:
a. Medical intervention by a healthcare professional,
b. Hospitalisation or increased level of care,
c. Face to face evaluation by a clinician
Examples of clinically relevant non-major bleeding include macroscopic haematuria requiring intervention, epistaxis that requires tamponade or medical intervention, haemoptysis, hematemesis or rectal bleeding which requires endoscopy or other medical intervention.

Diagnostic codes for haemorrhage will be used to identify cases in accord with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10AM from hospital medical records, follow-up phone calls to patients and/or their GP meeting the above pre-defined criteria.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first hospitalisation for stroke or VTE.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The median duration of persistence with oral anticoagulants will be determined by frailty status accounting for death. This will be determined from medical record, pharmacy records, interview with patients and/or their GP
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be followed for 36 months from initiation of an oral anticoagulant or will be censored at primary outcome, cessation of oral anticoagulant or death.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Ability to perform daily tasks assessed using The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale. 
IADL will be determined using data from a patient questionnaire on IADL.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stroke risk assessed using CHADS2 score.
Stroke risk will be determined using data from medical records and medications.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be assessed for CHADS2 at baseline (commencement of oral anticaogulant)</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A recent systematic review of 31 observational studies reported the incidence of bleeding with warfarin use in patients with AF (mean age range 64-83 years), ranged from 0.2-7.6 bleeds per 100 patient-years. Data on the incidence of bleeding in frail patients is scarce. A previous study reported a six-month 30% incidence of major or severe haemorrhage in frail older people aged =70 years who were users of warfarin19 and another more recent study found a six month incidence of 5.8%. We intend to recruit a total of 1,000 patients initiated on an oral anticoagulant, a two-sided log rank test with such a sample size assuming that 40% of the patients will be frail, and 60% non-frail, achieves 80% power at 5% significance level to detect a difference between 5% of the frail group having a major haemorrhage compare to 1% of the non-frail group, allowing for 20% drop out.

Competing risks multivariate survival analysis will be used to examine time to event.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether frailty increases the risk of major haemorrhage / clinically significant non-major bleed in older patients initiating an oral anticoagulant. The secondary objectives are to investigate whether frailty is a risk factor for cessation of oral anticoagulants, stroke / VTE and the association between pharmacological risk factors ability to predict the primary and secondary outcomes will be investigated in frail and non-frail participants.</summary>
