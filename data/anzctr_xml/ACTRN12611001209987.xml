  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Intervention is a cooking skills class called Jamies Ministry of Food (JMoF) program, which is currently being implemented in Ipswich, Queensland, Australia.
JMoF program Ipswich offers participants a 10 week cooking course made up of ten ninety minute classes, held over ten weeks. Participants are taught recipes from 50 Jamie Oliver recipes. 
Each week, students are taught by JMoF food trainers how to prepare and cook a variety of dishes whilst learning specific cooking techniques. Each participant pays $10 per class (or $5 concession) to attend, and during each class, participants prepare a meal that they are able to take home. Messages about good nutrition, meal planning and budgeting are embedded in the program and are discussed in an informal manner during the skills sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list controls will be used. The control group will not be involved in the intervention during the time of measurement. Controls will be drawn from the program wait-list and will be required to wait 10 weeks before they receive the program. 

The control group will be recruited in a non-randomized manner. The wait-list is sufficiently large and the wait times sufficiently long to enable recruitment of controls in the period prior to their commencement of the program.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The JMoF program aims to improve individuals confidence to cook, cooking skills, and potentially improve their healthy eating behaviours. This evaluation will help to understand if the JMoF program makes a difference for people who participate. What we learn from this evaluation will help to support the extension of Jamies Ministry of Food Program and guide any future improvements in Australia and internationally. The evaluation will add to the promising but limited evidence base regarding the effectiveness of cooking skills programs  

The study aims to answer two research questions about the JMoF Program: 
1. Does the program increase participants knowledge, skills, attitudes and confidence to cook healthy meals? 
2. Does the program result in broader positive outcomes for participants in terms of a healthier diet, more affordable healthy meals, improved self-esteem and social connectedness?</summary>
