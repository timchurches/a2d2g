    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Valsartan 160 mg + nateglinide 60 mg
Treatment: drugs - Valsartan 160 mg + nateglinide placebo
Treatment: drugs - Nateglinide 60 mg + valsartan placebo
Treatment: drugs - Valsartan placebo + nateglinide placebo

Experimental: Valsartan 160 mg + nateglinide 60 mg - For the first 2 weeks of treatment, patients took the combination of nateglinide 30 mg (3 times daily, ante cibum [ac] before meals) and valsartan 80 mg (once daily [od] in the morning). After 2 weeks, patients were up-titrated to nateglinide 60 mg ac and valsartan 160 mg od.

Experimental: Valsartan 160 mg + nateglinide placebo - For the first 2 weeks of treatment, patients took valsartan 80 mg capsules (once daily [od] in the morning). After 2 weeks, patients were up-titrated to 160 mg valsartan od. Patients also received nateglinide placebo tablets (3 times daily, ante cibum [ac] before meals).

Experimental: Nateglinide 60 mg + valsartan placebo - For the first 2 weeks of treatment, patients took nateglinide 30 mg tablets (3 times daily, ante cibum [ac] before meals). After 2 weeks, patients were uptitrated to 60 mg nateglinide ac. Patients also received valsartan placebo capsules (once daily [od] in the morning).

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Patients took 3 nateglinide placebo tablets (3 times daily, ante cibum [ac] before meals) and 1 valsartan placebo capsule (once daily [od] in the morning).


Treatment: drugs: Valsartan 160 mg + nateglinide 60 mg
The double-blinding of the randomized study medication was maintained by the use of identical placebo and active tablets and capsules for nateglinide and valsartan, respectively. Patients were instructed not to take the morning dose of either medication nor to eat breakfast on the day of a scheduled study visit, but to wait until after the visit was completed. Patients not tolerating the higher dose (Level 2) were down-titrated to receive Level 1. Patients not tolerating the lower dose (Level 1) had a treatment interruption. Starting at Week 2 and throughout the study, attempts were to be made to reach the highest dose level (Level 2), if medically acceptable. Following each change in dose level or re-initiation of treatment, tolerability was assessed after 2 weeks of exposure.

    <summary>This study is a test of the safety and effectiveness of two drugs, one for diabetes and one
      for hypertension, in keeping patients with high lab values of glucose from progressing to
      frank diabetes and developing cardiovascular complications. People in this study cannot have
      frank diabetes but are considered "borderline" based on blood tests. People in the study take
      none, one or both of the drugs and do not know which one(s) they are taking.</summary>
