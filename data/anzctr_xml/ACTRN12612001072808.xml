  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with previous burns injuries are subject to abnormal pain processing responses compared to people who have never been affected by severe burns. We propose to run a pilot study which will demonstrate whether patients have ongoing abnormal pain responses. This would be determined by using a form of quantitative sensory testing which evaluates the integrity of pain pathways.</summary>
