  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a common surgical procedure performed in people with hip
      osteoarthritis and appears to be effective in relieving pain and improving function. However
      significant wasting and weakness of the hip and knee muscles persists post-operatively.
      Although relief of pain and improvement of function are important outcomes following THR,
      weakness of the hip and knee muscles reduces a person's ability to manage stairs, slopes,
      public transport and results in persistent gait abnormalities. Since lower limb weakness is
      one of the risk factors for falls, it is important that patients undergo a strengthening
      program post-operatively. The hypothesis is that lower limb strength and function will be
      better in patients who undergo a strengthening program post-operatively than in those who
      have usual care.</summary>
