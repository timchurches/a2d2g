Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants will receive placebo once daily from Week 0 to Week 8. Participants in clinical response at Week 8 will continue to receive placebo through Week 32. Participants not in clinical response at Week 8 will receive treatment with 150 mg JNJ-54781532 orally once daily from Week 8 to Week 16. Participants who achieve a partial Mayo score response (ie, a change from baseline of =3 in the partial Mayo score) at Week 16 can continue receiving 150 mg JNJ-54781532 orally once daily through Week 32

Experimental: JNJ-54781532 25 mg once daily - Participants will receive 25 mg of JNJ-54781532 once daily from Week 0 to Week 8. Participants in clinical response at Week 8 will continue to receive the same dosage through Week 32 and participants not in clinical response at Week 8 will continue to receive the same dosage through Week 16. At Week 16, participants who do not achieve a partial Mayo score response (ie, a change from baseline of =3 in the partial Mayo score) will be discontinued from study medication, and participants who achieve a partial Mayo score response at Week 16 can continue receiving JNJ 54781532 25 mg once daily through Week 32

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in the Mayo score at Week 8 - The Mayo score is the primary tool for assessing ulcerative colitis activity. The Mayo score consists of 4 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of endoscopy, and physician's global assessment) which range from 0 to 3. The Mayo score is calculated as the sum of these 4 subscores and can range between 0 and 12. A score of 3 to 5 points indicates mildly active disease; a score of 6 to 10 indicates moderately active disease; and a score of 11 to 12 indicates severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of participants with clinical response at Week 8 - Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by =30% and =3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore of =1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of participants with clinical remission at Week 8 - Clinical remission is defined as a Mayo score =2 points, with no individual subscore &gt;1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of participants with mucosal healing at Week 8 - Mucosal healing is an improvement in the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa. An endoscopy subscore of the Mayo score of 0 or 1.</outcome>
