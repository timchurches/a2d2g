  <interventions>
    <interventions>Voice and Choral Singing Group Therapy. Group sessions will be led by an experienced clinician Speech Language Therapist and musician. Activities will consist of respiratory, phonatory, oro-motor and relaxation exercise and singing a selection of songs. The group sessions will take place once a week for one and a half hours weekly over 9 continuous weeks. Adherence will be monitored using a register of attendance at each session. </interventions>
    <comparator>Music Appreciation Activity. Group sessions will be led by an experienced clinician Speech Language Therapist and musician. A weekly social interaction group will listen to the same music as the intervention and discuss music without singing. The group sessions will take place once a week for one and a half hours weekly over 9 continuous weeks.  Adherence will be monitored using a register of attendance at each session.

      <outcome>Voice amplitude
Voice/speech levels will be measured using a sound level meter (SLM) (CEL-244 Digital Integrating Sound Level Meter Class 2, Casella). 
Three acoustic values: 
1.  Slow, C-weighted sound level (LCS)
2.  Average, C-weighted sound level (Lceq)

Voice samples captured for MPT will be edited and analysed using the Multi Dimensional Voice Programme.
The recordings (44.1 kHz sampling rate, 16 bit) will be captured using an AKG C410 (Harman International, Austria) head mounted condenser microphone connected to a 24-bit/96kHz audio interface with preamp (M-Audio Mobile Pre USB) and recorded digitally. Acoustic analysis of all the speech samples will be completed using Sona-Speech II 'Trademark' Software (KayPENTAX).

      <outcome>Voice quality (jitter, Shim)
Voice samples captured for voice quality will be edited and analysed using the Multi Dimensional Voice Programme.
Programme (MDVP). Spectral analysis will include:
1.  Average Fundamental Frequency (Ave F0) 
2.  Relative Average Perturbation (RAP)
3.  Shimmer %-Shim (Shim)
4.  Fundamental Frequency Variation (vF0)

As well as these data, further data analysis of prosody will include:    
1.  Mean Fundamental Frequency (MeanF0) in Hertz (Hz)
2.  Standard Deviation (SD) 
3.  Variance in Fundamental Frequency (vF0)
4.  Semi-tones (STR)
5.  Standard Deviation Semitone (SDS)

The researchers will liaise with an off site colleague from the University of Auckland who is not involved in this trial, who will use a computer generated randomisation schedule. 
Methods used to generate the sequence in which subjects will be randomised (sequence generation): a computer generated randomisation schedule to allocate participants to one of two groups using stratified randomisation to uphold balance of: sex, age, cognitive screen scores and secondary outcomes between groups. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is an abundance of research on group singing and the benefit in relation to participants physical/psychological well-being and QoL in the non-Parkinson's disease (PD) population. There are very few studies researching a relationship between factors of anxiety, depression, wellbeing, voice and group singing with people with PD described.
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether singing activities improve or maintain voice and well being in people with PD. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to participate in one of the following two activities for an hour and a half over 9 continuous weeks: 
1) Voice and choral singing Therapy 
2) music appreciation (control).
We hypothesize that group singing and respiratory exercise will improve voice and and facilitate social interaction, boost psychological wellbeing and enhance therapeutic outcomes among people with PD more so than those in the music appreciation (control group). If group voice and choral singing therapy activities are effective and successful they could provide the possibility of an easily implemented, relatively inexpensive, enjoyable therapy.</summary>
