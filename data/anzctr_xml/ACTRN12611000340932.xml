      <outcome>Pleth variability index (PVI) is measured with a device called Masimo Rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximetry. Hemodynamic variables before and after volume expansion are compared using a paired t-test. Patients are allocated to 2 groups according to the percentage change in stroke volume index (SVI) measured by oesophageal Doppler monitor after volume expansion: responders are defined as change in SVI of greater or equal to 10% and non-responders as change in SVI of less than 10%. The differences between responders and non-responders were evaluated using the Students t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test, as appropriate. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for PVI was generated and the optimal cut-off value was determined by the highest Youden index (calculated as: sensitivity + specificity  1). The Spearman rank method was used to test correlation. P-values of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: The aim of this project is to investigate whether pleth variability index (PVI), derived from the Masimo Rainbow (Registered Trademark) SET Pulse CO-Oximetry, can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients during general anaesthesia for non-cardiac surgery.
Significance: The significance of assessing PVI is that it is completely non-invasive (it only requires a probe on the finger), it provides a dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness, and the PVI is displayed as a continuously monitored number, which makes it simple and user-friendly.
Hypothesis: The main hypothesis is that PVI can accurately and consistently predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients during general anaesthesia following a standard fluid challenge. 
Objective: The main objective is to assess the accuracy and consistency of PVI as an indicator of assessing fluid responsiveness, when measured against the more well-established oesophageal Doppler/fluid challenge method. This will determine whether PVI can be used reliably as an indicator of fluid responsiveness. 
Methods: In this observational study, a total of 30 participants will be assessed as being fluid responsive or fluid non-responsive according to stroke volume changes (measured via the minimally invasive oesophageal Doppler monitor) following the administration of a standard fluid challenge. The two main measurements including PVI and stroke volume index will be recorded along with other variables. Using appropriate statistical analysis, we will determine the consistency and accuracy of PVI in detecting fluid responsiveness. 
Likely benefit of the research: The significance of assessing PVI in the current study is that it may provide a non-invasive and continuous way of determining which patients are likely to respond and thus benefit from fluid therapy, a measurement that previously requires much more invasive techniques.</summary>
