    <interventions>Observational research. Outcome measures for incontinence, lumbo-pelvic pain, pelvic floor dysfunction, body image and measurement of the abdominal muscle seperation. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of lumbo-pelvic pain and incontinence and body image in post-natal women, six weeks post birth , (clinically significant DRAM) and then six months after child birth.  The incidence of any dysfunction as mentioned will be compared between women with either a) no DRAM (healthy age-matched nulligravida women); b) a clinically insignificant DRAM and c) a clinically significant DRAM.  The study will also aim to determine the factors associated with lumbo-pelvic pain and incontinence and body image in post-natal women.  The findings of this study will inform the development of a randomized, controlled trial of physiotherapy intervention in women at risk of morbidity following DRAM.
Will aim to recruit all participants and analyse data over a 6 month period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diastasis recti (also known as abdominal separation or DRAM) is a disorder defined as a separation of the rectus abdominis muscle into right and left halves. In pregnant or post-natal women, the defect is caused by the stretching of the rectus abdominis by the growing uterus and the increased hormones associated with pregnancy that cause flexibility in the bodys tissues. A clinically significant (larger) DRAM is defined as being greater than or equal to three fingers wide. Although these larger DRAMs are treated by physiotherapists at Southern Health, there is limited evidence into the physical/psychological problems suffered by women in association with a larger DRAM.
The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of back and pelvic pain, incontinence and body image in post-natal women, immediately post birth (incontinence only), six weeks (whether there is a clinically significant DRAM or other problems) and then six months after child birth.  The incidence of any dysfunction as mentioned will be compared between women with either a) no DRAM (healthy age-matched women who have never been pregnant); b) a clinically insignificant DRAM (less than three fingers width) and c) a clinically significant DRAM (three fingers or greater wide).  The study will also aim to determine the factors associated with back or pelvic pain, incontinence and body image in post-natal women.  The findings of this study will inform the development of a randomized, controlled trial of physiotherapy intervention in women at risk of morbidity following DRAM.</summary>
