  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of clinical and microbiologic cure with the use of vaginal cream tetracycline and amphotericin B for treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or isolated or mixed vaginal candidiasis. Bacterial vaginosis will be evaluated by Amsel and Nugent criteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation will be measured in visit 1 (selection and iniciation of the treatmen), visit 2 (week 2 - after treatment), visit 3 (week 4 - follow-up). The patients will be evaluated through the clinical cure evidence.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of both treatments safety and tolerability by assessment of patient adverse events reports (serious and non serious events) that occurred during the study period. Vaginal drugs rarely presents alergic reactions or other adverse event, however every single adverse event presented during the study (28 days - Visit 1, treatment period and follow up period) will be followed. The adverse events will be assessed by patient reports during each study visit and/or patient contact at any time. Non serious adverse events will be recorded at the Case Report Form (CRF) and serious adverse events will be recorded at a special serious adverse event report form (e.g. Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse event will be evaluated during all study (28 days): after visit 1 (day 1), visit 2 (day 14) and visit 3 (day 28).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify and assess adherence to treatment and preferences.
The adherence will be assessed asking to patients keep all supplies and bring back to visit when site staff will verify if the medication was used correctly. The patients will receive a box with 3 ovules + applicator (for 3 days of treatment) or a box with a tube + applicator (for 7 days of treatment) and has to bring it empty.
To assess the preference, the patient will be asked how she felt using that medication (unconfortable, ease to applicate, etc.). The patients will use only one medication in the study and the preference will be measured comparing the answers between them.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The adherence and preference of treatment will be asked in visit 2.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis and occurs in 50% of cases; candida vaginitis is the second most frequent corresponding 20 to 40% of cases; and with minor frequence the trichomoniasis occurs in 10 to 30% of cases.
Mixed vaginal infections are rather frequent: in a review 100 patients with vaginal infections, more than one pathogen was observed in 23% pacients with bacterial vaginosis and in 18% pacients with candida vaginitis.
When the normal flora is altered, with decrease of DÃ¶derlein lactobacillus and altered vaginal pH, candida species can proliferate and vulvovaginitis appears.
Vaginal discharge is the most commom cause of medical clinics in gynecology.
The correct diagnosis is difficult to make. Aproximately 1/3 pacientes do not have correct diagnosis even when a lab test is performed.
Tests could not be available and many associations of drugs are available in the market for the treatment of vulvovaginitis but most of them are not available in topic form. An option of concomitant or associated therapy is ketoconazole with clindamycin or tetracyclin and amphotericin B.
Oral ketoconazole is widely and traditionally used for treating vaginal candidiasis, but in our country the topic use is not yet available for this statement, but only for fungal skin infections. The intravaginal administration of ketoconazole became possible because of the development of bioadhesive vehicles.
Clindamycin is active against most anaerobic microorganisms. Vaginally adminstered clindamycin is effective for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis by Gardnerella vaginalis and the combination of tetracycline and amphotericin B is commercially available and is indicated for the treatment of vaginal infections caused by fungus and bacteria.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and micobiologic cure, which will be analised by Amsel and Nuget criteria. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated during the study period. The adherence and preferences of the patientes will be identified and evaluated.</summary>
