  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise Group:
The 9-12 week, home based exercise intervention will involve the prescription of a combination of aerobic (e.g. walking, cycling etc.), resistance (e.g. upper and lower body resistance based exercises) and flexibility exercises (e.g. stretching). The duration of exercise sessions and number of exercise sessions per week will be individually determined with the goal of achieving 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise and 2-3 resistance exercise sessions per week. The exercise program will be relative to the level of fitness and fatigue each patient presents with and individualised to their age, personal preferences and any pre-existing conditions. This will be determined during a consultation with an exercise physiologist before the start of the intervention. Participants will continue their usual medical care for breast cancer for the duration of the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Care Group:
Participants will continue their usual medical care for breast cancer for the duration of the intervention.  Usual medical care will be determined on a case by case basis by the individual participants oncologists.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cancer Related Fatigue:
Cancer related fatigue will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire. The FACIT-F is a 13 item scale commonly used to assess fatigue in cancer patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) Post-Radiotherapy (mid-intervention); 3) Post-Exercise (post-intervention); 4) Follow-up (6 months post-radiotherapy).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life:
Health related quality of life will be assessed using three questionnaires, the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36), the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 57 survey (PROMIS 57) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with breast cancer (FACT-B).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) Post-Radiotherapy (mid-intervention); 3) Post-Exercise (post-intervention); 4) Follow-up (6 months post-radiotherapy).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiotherapy Completion Rates &amp; Adverse Side Effects:
Adherence to prescribed radiotherapy treatments will be recorded using standard clinical measures. Completion rate will be reported as the percentage of the planned dose and planned fractions that are completed during the treatment course. The presence and severity of any adverse side effects will be assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Common Toxicity Criteria protocols</outcome>
      <timepoint>1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) Post-Radiotherapy (mid-intervention); 3) Post-Exercise (post-intervention); 4) Follow-up (6 months post-radiotherapy).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to &amp; Adverse Side Effects from the Exercise Program:
Adherence to the exercise program will be recorded using details log books. The frequency, duration and intensity of exercise will be examined across all exercise modalities (i.e. aerobic, resistance and flexibility). The occurrence and severity of any adverse events including exacerbation of breast cancer treatment related symptoms and/or musculoskeletal complications (muscle strains, fractures etc.) will be recorded throughout the intervention and follow-up period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1) Baseline (pre-intervention); 2) Post-Radiotherapy (mid-intervention); 3) Post-Exercise (post-intervention); 4) Follow-up (6 months post-radiotherapy).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the impact of a home based exercise program on cancer related fatigue in patients receiving radical radiotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman with breast cancer who has been prescribed radical radiotherapy treatment for 3-6 weeks.

Trial details.
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will receive a home based exercise program which involves resistance (e.g. movements performed against resistance), aerobic (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) and flexibility (e.g. stretching) exercises performed for a 9-12 week period during and after radiotherapy. The other group will be assigned to usual care (e.g. no treatment) for a 9-12 week period during and after radiotherapy. 

Participants will complete questionnaires assessing fatigue, quality of life, physical activity levels and physical activity motivation on 4 occasions (before starting radiotherapy, after finishing radiotherapy, 6 weeks after finishing radiotherapy and 6 months after finishing radiotherapy).</summary>
