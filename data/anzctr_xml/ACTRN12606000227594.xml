  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There has been limited uptake of population screening for colorectal cancer in Australia and other western countries, using faecal occult blood testing. We have previously determined that the InSure faecal immunochemical test (FIT) used in single sample format has similar sensitivity for significant colorectal neoplasia (cancer and significant adenomas) relative to the standard two stool sample test. Our hypothesis is that single stool sampling will result in improved population participation in screening compared to the standard InSure test. This study will compare population participation in screening in two groups, one offered the screening test in single stool sample format, compared to the control (standard InSure test, 2 stool sample format).</summary>
