    <summary>Background: Anesthesia practices is among practices that change heat regulation system and thus make patients lead to hypothermia. The aim of this study is to investigate the oral carbohydrate solution administered preoperatively on heat regulation system.  
Methods: The study included 40 female patients that were implemented general anesthesia. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: Group C (patients that stopped oral implementation 8 hours before the operation) and Group CH (800 ml oral carbohydrate fluid 8 hours before the operation and 400 ml oral carbohydrate fluid 2 hours before the operation). Patients were monitored as standard and temperature probes were placed. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and central and peripheral temperatures were recorded immediately before anesthetics induction, 5 minute intervals after the anesthetics induction, and in PACU every 10 minutes. Mean skin temperature, mean body temperature, and vasoconstriction threshold were estimated with the help of recorded temperatures.
Results: A statistically significant difference was not observed between demographic data of patients. In general, a decrease in tympanic and mean body temperature following anesthetic administration in groups, and increase in mean skin temperature, and an increase were observed in all these three levels in recovery unit. Tympanic temperature was found to be significantly high at 25th, 55th, 65th, and 95th minutes before and after induction in Group C compared to Group CH. (p&lt;0.05). Although mean skin temperature was found to be lower in Group C compared to Group CH in almost all periods, it was established that it did not have any significant difference in mean body temperature. In PACU, it was found that the tympanic temperature was higher in Group C compared to Group CH at the 60th minute (p&lt;0.05). Postoperative shivering score was found to be significantly higher in Group C compared to Group CH (p&lt;0.01). Vasoconstriction occurred at the 50th minute in Group C and 75th minute in Group CH. Vasoconstriction threshold was established to be 35.45 plus/minus 0.72 C degrees in Group C and 34.77 plus/minus 0.53 C degrees in Group CH. 
Conclusions: Oral carbohydrate solution administered in preoperative period was established to have effects (as decrease in tympanic temperature and vasoconstriction threshold) thought to be negative on tympanic temperature, vasoconstriction, and vasoconstriction threshold and to significantly decrease however the postoperative tremor.</summary>
