  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive a pair of flip flop footwear with a moulded foot bed to wear as often as they feel comfortable for 12 weeks. The foot bed is not individually moulded and consists of an arch support to redistribute plantar pressures.
A podiatrist will also deliver (during the baseline session) a single 20 minute session of general advice on footwear detailing the general features of a good shoe.
Participants will be required to record adherence to the intervention via a daily footwear diary recording the number of hours the flip flop is worn.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The a priori sample size calculations were based on a minimal important difference of 14 points for the domain of foot pain from the FHSQ. Assuming a standard deviation of 20 points, a power of 95% and an alpha 0.05 and allowing for 20% attrition rate, 54 participants per group will be required making a total of 108 participants to be recruited. 
Change in pain, function and foot health status will be
analysed adjusted for baseline scores will be calculated with analysis of covariance. Treatment effect sizes will be calculated (Cohen's d).Level of comfort of the footwear will be reported as a mean score.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the ability for flip-flop style footwear with a moulded foot-bed to reduce foot pain. We will also assess the effect of the flip-flop style footwear on perception of general foot health and assess the comfort of the flip-flop style footwear.</summary>
