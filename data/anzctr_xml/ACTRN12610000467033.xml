    <inclusivecriteria>Diagnosis of Psychosis.
Individuals are recruited from the 'Early Episode Psychosis' program of Peel, Rockingham and Kwinana Mental health Service. The program treats individuals between the ages of 18-40 years experiencing their first known psychotic episode and aims to improve quality of life, reduce relapse rates and duration of illness by early sustained treatment.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Currently Acute Individuals - defined in the study as individuals who received treatment for psychosis in an inpatient setting within 28 days of the group intervention begining.
NB: However, if a participants treating psychiatrist feels that an individual is in the recovery or maintenance phase of psychosis and would benefit from the group intervention, then they may be included in the study even if they were in an inpatient setting 28 days prior to the group beginning</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To the authors knowledge, this is the first intervention within Australia with any psychotic population which combines metacognitive and mindfulness interventions. It is also to the authors knowledge, the first intervention which has used metacognitive or mindfulness interventions for individuals with First Episode Psychosis. All previous evaluations of metacognitive (see Moritz and Woodward, 2010; Moritz et al, 2007) or mindfulness interventions have focused on individuals with chronic psychosis (see Chadwick et al 2009; Taylor and Chadwick et al 2009; Clarke, 2001). However, delivering psychological interventions at an earlier stage of psychosis (such as in Early Episode Psychosis program) has been demonstrated to have a better prognosis, decrease longer-term negative impact of psychosis on the individuals functioning, and to offer potential in decreasing relapse and hospitalization rates (McGorry, 2009; Birchwood, 2008; Boonstra et al 2009).  The intervention, being implemented by Peel and Rockingham Kwinana Mental Health Service (PaRK), therefore offers the potential to decrease distress and dysfunction associated with psychosis in the short and longer-term by combining the two previously evidenced based psychological interventions.</summary>
