  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experiment group: Hope Fostering intervention

Patients attend 2 x 1.5 hour education sessions per week for 2 weeks plus a 1 hour booster session after 3 months.

Sessions are delivered to maximum 10 people by nurse at the hospital. 

The education sessions will contain the education element, supporting group element, and coping skills through knowledge delivery for reinforcing self-esteem, perceived self-efficacy, self-care behaviour, spiritual and religious belief, social support as well as Tai Chi exercise.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two types of control groups. One is attention-control group and the other is control group. 

Attention-control group: Tai Chi program
Patients attend 1 x 1.5 hour Tai Chi program for only one session plus a 1 hour booster session at 3 months. 
Sessions are delivered to maximum 10 people by Tai Chi trained nurse at the hospital.

Control group: Usual care
Patients do not need to receive any interventions but just receive routine medical follow-up.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of hope (Herth Hope Index score &gt; 30)
The Herth Hope Index (Herth, 1992) comprises 12 items designed as individual measure multidimensional of hope. Participants are asked to rate each item on a 4-point Likert scale, and are scored from 1 to 4 (1 = strong disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = strong agree); total possible scores thus range from 12 to 48, with higher scores indicating greater hopefulness.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, the last day of intervention, 3 month after booster intervention and 6 month after discharge from hospital.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-esteem (The Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES))
The Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) (Rosenberg, 1965) was designed to measure self-esteem as a global disposition. The RSES consists of 10 items, an example being "I am able to do things as well as most other people. Responses are rated using a 4-poing Likert scale ranging from 1 (strong disagree) to 4 (strongly agree), with total possible scores ranging 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, the last day of intervention, 3 month after booster intervention and 6 month after discharge from hospital.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life (Short-Form 36 (SF-36))
The Chinese (Hong Kong) version of the Short-Form SF-36 developed by Lam et al (2002) is a 36 item scale widely used to measure the quality of life. It measures 8 area of perceived health: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health, with scale-range 0-100 (100 = highest perceived health). It is appropriate to use on different age, diseases or treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, the last day of intervention, 3 month after booster intervention and 6 month after discharge from hospital.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depressive symptoms (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).
The CES-D consists of 20 items, which was originally designed to measure depressive symptoms in general population surveys (Radloff, 1997) and has been used widely with adolescents (Roberts, Andrews, Lewinson, &amp; Hopes, 1990). The CES-D consists of 20 items; an example ofthe items on the scale is 'I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing'. Subjects were asked to rate the frequency of each symptoms during the past week on a four-point Likert scale representing 'rately (less than 1 day)', some (1-2 days)', occasionally (3-4 days)' and 'most (5-7 days)', which were scored from 0 to 3, with total possible scores ranging from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate a greater an individual demonstrating some depressive symptoms.</outcome>

    <concealment>Three sealed opaque envelopes will be put in a box. One envelope will be labelled an experiment group, one  envelope will be labelled an attention-control group and the envelope will be labelled a control group.  A nurse who is blindly about this research and will be asked to draw one envelope from the box to determine group assignment. Another two sealed opaque envelopes with the same group assignment being drawn were then put back in the box again before the next assignment. All participants are eligible for inclusion in the trial were unaware, when this decision is made, to which group the participants will be allocated.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The researcher will choose an experimental design in which the eligible participants will be randomly allocated to three different groups after the pretest baseline measurements are taken as follows:
The experiment group will be exposed to hope-fostering intervention to increase their level of hope.
The attention-control group will participate in the Tai Chi exercise program only and be served as an attention-control purpose.
The last group will be the control group, whose members will be not exposed to any form of intervention apart from the usual care.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of the hope-fostering nursing intervention in promoting the quality of life of Chinese heart failure patients in Hong Kong.

The null hypotheses are as follows:
1) There are no statistically significant differences in the level of hope scores, depressive symptom scores, quality of life scores, the level of self-esteem scores in Hong Kong Chinese heart failure patients who receive routine medical follow-up, and participate in the hope-fostering intervention  in comparison to those who just receive Tai Chi program and to those who recieve routine medical follow-up with informative pamphlets, and continuing monitoring after discharge from hospital.</summary>
