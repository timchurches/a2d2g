  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will consist of a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and a Follow-up Period. Escalating dose cohorts will receive active (12 patients per cohort) or placebo given intradermally in a 2:1 ratio. Patients will receive the same dose for the whole Treatment period. During the Screening period medical history, physical examination, vital sign measurements, ECG, and laboratory assessment will be performed as safety assessments. These assessments will also be performed during the study. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be assessed from the Screening visit until the end of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo: Sodium chloride 0.9% USP (same as vehicle/diluent), dosed at same time as active treatment.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number and percentage of Adverse Events collected during the Treatment Period. At each visit, patients will be asked standard questions: Have you had any health problems since the previous visit or when you were last asked? and Have you had any new symptoms? to elicit any medically related changes in their well-being. Responses and details will be recorded in the database. Any clinically significant results from any safety assessments may be recorded as an Adverse Event, based on the investigator's medical opinion. Expected Adverse Events are headache and abdominal pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse Events will be monitored from the time of signing the Informed consent Form until the end of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Results of safety and tolerability assessments collected during the Treatment Period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability assessments performed at each visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The PK endpoints are plasma drug concentrations and PK parameters in patients who received active drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be drawn at different timepoints during the study.</timepoint>
