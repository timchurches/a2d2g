  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To trial the administration of a new drug rimonabant, a selective cannabinoid receptor type I antagonist, to young people between the ages of 16- 30 who have a history of psychosis and have undergone a period of cannabis detoxification, to assess whether relapse to dependant cannabis use is reduced 

It is hypothesised that:
1.Rimonabant will reduce the effects of cannabis intoxication after cannabis detoxification.
2.In turn, this would reduce psychosis and depression, and hence reduce utilization of health services including hospitalization.
3.Rimonabant will reduce other substance use disorders including tobacco use</summary>
