  <interventions>
    <interventions>Open label oral vasodilator treatment with dose adjusted according to blood pressure and patient tolerance.  Perendopril (2 to 8mg daily) candesartan (4 to 32 mg daily)and/or amlodipine (2.5 to 10mg daily).  Either one or a combination of these treatments will be administered to achieve a reduction in blood pressure and adjusted according to tolerance and blood pressure, and continued for one year</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether vasodilators, a type of blood pressure treatment, will improve heart function in persons with leaking of the aortic valve.  Our hypothesis is that lowering blood pressure will reduce the work of the heart, and  over time the volume and thickness of the muscle of the heart's main pumping chamber will improve.</summary>
