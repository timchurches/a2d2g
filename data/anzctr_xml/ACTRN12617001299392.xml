    <interventions>To investigate outcomes of treatment over an 11-year period (2006 to 2017 inclusive), in  patients with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH)  the medical records of 10 patients with DISH treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), will be retrospectively audited and will be compared with  13 DISH patients that are not treated with TNFi,  and also compared with patients with 42 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who will be identified from a  national rheumatology database (Australian Rheumatology Association Database - ARAD)</interventions>
    <comparator>13 DISH patients that were not treated with TNFi  will be compared as controls. They also met radiologic criteria for diagnosis and were identified using the same method as the treated DISH patients- that is physician recall and a word search of hospital clinic letters. The TNFi and control patients will also be compared with 42 AS patients identified from Australian Rheumatology Association Database (ARAD).</comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Radiological criteria for DISH were applied. Patients were classified on the basis described by Fornasier, Littlejohn and Urowitz (Fornasier V, Littlejohn G, Urowitz M, Keystone E, Smythe H. Spinal entheseal new bone formation: the early changes of spinal diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. J Rheum 1983;10:939-47).  They were also evaluated for characteristic changes of an inflammatory sacro-iliitis. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH),  is a skeletal disorder for which, apart from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics, there is no effective pharmacological treatment. The aim of this retrospective/prospective data audit is to determine the effect of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in clinically active  DISH patients. This will be achieved by the comparison of changes in pain and function in people with DISH that are treated with tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) to similar people with DISH that are not treated with TNFi, with people with ankylosing spondylitis, over time.

    <publicnotes>This retrospective audit has identified people with DISH and will examine their results from 8/05/2007 until present day with the anticipation that these people will be followed until 1/12/2026.

Ethics approval was not required according to the WA Health Research Governance Policy and Procedures: 
3.2.3 Exemption from Ethical and Scientific Review In accordance with the National Statement (Chapter 5.1), WA Health provides the discretion to exempt from ethical review research that:  is negligible risk research; and  involves the use of existing collections of data or records that contain only nonidentifiable data about human beings. 

In our case:
	The manuscript does not report on primary research. Participants were not recruited for study, but rather were evaluated and in some cases treated empirically in the context of clinical service provision. All data analysed were collected as part of routine diagnosis and patient care.
	Patients were diagnosed and treated in accordance with national guidelines. The tests and procedures performed (as well as recording all other variables included in our analysis) were routine and essential for confirming diagnosis and classifying patients. The imaging and other investigations had been performed as part of routine care. They were not done as an add-on for purposes of research.
	The paper does not report on the use of experimental or new protocols. The outcomes of observation and in some cases empirical off label therapies was a variation of an accepted treatment protocol.
	The audit was not set up as a study or research project, but as a review of treatment practices and outcomes. Hence we did not seek/obtain ethical approval for a study. 
	Our analysis looked retrospectively at outcomes for a cohort of patients treated or observed over an extensive period of time. This was done internally as part of an audit/evaluation, with a view to improving quality of care.
