  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this international, phase 2, open-label, 2-arm, response rate study of
      talazoparib is to assess the efficacy and safety of talazoparib in men with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who previously received taxane-based chemotherapy
      and progressed on at least 1 novel hormonal agent (enzalutamide and/or abiraterone
      acetate/prednisone).</summary>
