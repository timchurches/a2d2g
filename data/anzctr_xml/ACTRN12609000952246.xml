    <interventions>The intervention package consists of the following elements delivered by Maori mental health workers, cultural workers and kaumatua which have some variation between cases depending on the clinical context:
i) patient support - usually in the two weeks post discharge two phone calls or face to face contacts to check the discharge paln from hospital is actually happening.
ii) problem solving therapy - four to six sessions of 30 to 60 minutes over four weeks
iii) a cultural assessment - focusing on sense of belonging and cultural identity
iv) a risk management programme for the clinicians
v) postcards in the year after the attempt posted monthly after the first month
vi) improved access to general practice</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual differs on a case by case basis and is decided by the clinician who usually sees the patient. This may consist of admission to hospital, referral to a mental health crisis service, a community mental health service, their general practitioner or nothing plus a variety of less common interventions.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thye study is designed to answer the question "in Maori who present to hospital with self harm is a complex package of interventions delivered in a culturally acceptable way plus treatment as usual better than treatment as usual alone". The treatment package consists of several elements including patient support designed to stop patients slipping through the cracks in between hospital and community care; problem solving therapy; improved access to general practitioners; risk management for the self harm team; cultural assessment; regular postcards for a year. This is delivered in a culturally appropriate way using Maori clinicians and cultural workers with their unique networks to supplement problem solving.</summary>
