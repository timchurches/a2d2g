  <interventions>
    <interventions>Presence of tension type headache, and migraine were investigated in 120 patients diagnosed as metabolic syndrome.The diagnoses of tension type headache, and migraine defined based on International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria. All patients were checked for their serum fasting glucose, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The patients blood pressures and waist circumferences were measured. The age of onset, frequency, severity, unilateral or bilateral localization, presence of aura, associated symptoms, and response to analgesic use were interrogated. Severity of headache was evaluated to be least severe 1 to most severe 10 according to visual analogue scale (VAS). Distribution of metabolic syndrome criteria between groups with and without pain demonstrated that frequency of hypertriglyceridemia was significantly higher in migraine with aura cases when compared with patients diagnosed as episodic tension type headache, and those without pain. A statistically significant negative correlation was observed between response to analgesics, and HDL cholesterol levels in the episodic tension type headache group. In the migraine group a statistically significant negative correlation was found between HDL cholesterol concentrations, and duration of pain in years.Duration of headache prolonged with gradually decreasing levels of HDL cholesterol. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between levels of diastolic pressure, and analgesic requirements of episodic tension type headache group.
Observation time for this trial was seven months. </interventions>

    <summary>Background: Our aim was to investigate the association between migraine, tension type headache, and metabolic syndrome.   
Methods: Presence of tension type headache, and migraine were investigated in 120 patients diagnosed as metabolic syndrome. All patients were checked for serum fasting glucose, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride values. The beginning age, frequency, severity, localization, presence of aura, concomitant symptoms, characteristics of the headache and its responses to the analgesics were interrogated. The severity of the headache was recorded according to the visual analog scale.
Results: Mean age of the patients (female, n= 89; 74.8 %; male, n= 31; 25.8 %) was 54.41 plus/minus 11.60 years (range, 29-84 yrs). Diagnoses of tension type headache and migraine without aura were made for 39 (32.5 %), and 18 (15 %) patients respectively. Mean age of migraine patients was significantly lower relative to the patients with tension type headache and no headache. Incidence of hypertriglyceridemia was significantly higher in migraine patients when compared with cases tension type headache, and without headache. In the tension type headache group, requirement for analgesics decreased as HDL cholesterol levels increased, while need for analgesic drugs increased in line with higher diastolic blood pressures.  In the migraine group duration of headache was found as prolonged with decreasing HDL cholesterol levels. 
Conclusion: In patients presenting with headache, its association with metabolic syndrome should be considered, and the patients should be especially observed with respect to response to analgesic, and the presence of hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
