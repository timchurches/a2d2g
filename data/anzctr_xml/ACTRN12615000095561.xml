  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants are randomised to one of 3 groups. One group will receive a personalised eye consultation followed by 5 follow up support telephone consultations, a second group will receive  a personalised eye consulatation (without the follow up support over the phone) and a third (control) group will receive continued access to usual care from their ophthalmologist.

In an in-person consultation, the participants own retinal image will be used to explain the status of their diabetic retinopathy and its likely progression in reference to other images of diabetic retinopathy stages. The link between diabetic retinopathy progression, blood glucose control and health behaviours will be explained. The interventionist (an orthoptist, whose major role is to support the ophthalmologist in clinical settings), will then facilitate the participant to set individually tailored goals specifically related to improving blood glucose control (e.g. changes to diet, physical activity). This personalised eye consultation (PEC) is based on HealthChange (trademark) Methodology, developed by Janette Gale with whom we have worked closely in developing our model. This model is a client-centred clinical practice framework grounded in evidence-based psychological theories and principles including Social Cognition Theory, Motivational Interviewing, Solution-focused Counselling, Theory of Planned Behaviour, and the Transtheoretical Model. Our PEC manual outlines a 10-step  approach including sample scripts which are tailored to the patients existing level of knowledge, motivation and confidence. Based on our pilot work and experience of using the HealthChange (trademark) Methodology, we estimate that the consultation should take 60 - 90 mins.

Participants randomised to receive telephone support will receive 5 telephone behaviour change support sessions (in addition ot the personalised eye consultation). These will be delivered at approximately 2, 4, 8, 14 and 20 weeks following the personalised consultation. All behaviour change support sessions will be guided by scripts and are designed to be approximately 15 - 30 minutes in duration. The aim of these sessions is to support the behaviour change processes  by prompting additional goal setting, discussing ways to overcome obstacles to health behaviour change and strengthening skills in decision-making, problem-solving and goal planning</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive usual care (eye checks once a year and the use of insulin/medication/diet to manage diabetes)  from their ophthalmologist and GP. Participants will also be advised to seek support from their diabetes care team to improve their diabetes management. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria will be: (a) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We have chosen to focus only on type 2 diabetes given the epidemic of type 2 diabetes, and also as most of our public DR patients have this form. Additionally, we wish to keep our sample as homogenous as possible given the natural history and management of type 2 is very different from type 1 diabetes; (b) a score of 20-51 on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading scale suggesting mild to moderate non proliferative diabetic retinopathy; (c) suboptimal HbA1c (greater than or equal to 8%)) at baseline assessment. We chose a conservative 8% cut-off point for our study to reach those in greatest need and to avoid adverse consequences (hypoglycaemia) of tight control; (d) no previous treatment for diabetic retinopathy (e.g., laser or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) or indication of imminent treatment; (e) at least 18 years old; (f) no cognitive deficit, as assessed by the 6-item cognitive impairment test; (g) ability to communicate in English.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be invited to attend an appointment at which all eligibility criteria, including HbA1c will be assessed, and a retinal image will be taken for each eye. Those meeting the eligibility criteria will be invited to take part in the trial and, if they consent, a baseline appointment will be scheduled. All assessment appointments will take place at the Centre for Eye Research Australia (CERA). Following baseline assessment, participants will be allocated randomly to one of the three arms based on a computer generated random number sequence, organised by a CERA clinical trials expert (with no participant contact). </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline data: Descriptive statistics and bivariate comparisons of participants by treatment group will be conducted to characterise the sample and assess the success of randomisation. Continuous variables will be summarised as either mean (SD) or median (interquartile range). Independent-samples t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to detect statistical significance for normally distributed data, and non-parametric tests will be used for skewed data. Categorical variables will be summarised by frequencies and proportions, and Pearson Chi-square tests or Fishers exact tests will be selected to compare the difference between three groups. Any imbalances of characteristics between the groups will be adjusted for in subsequent analysis. Missing data: The differences between the three groups in the proportion and reason of patients withdrawals will be compared using the Chi-squared test. The multiple imputations method will be used to handle missing data if necessary. Analysis population: The patient population under study will be defined as intention-to-treat (ITT), which includes all participants who were randomised. Validation of measurement tools: We will use Item Response Theory (IRT) to maximize the validity and accuracy of our measurement tools. Rasch analysis, a special case of IRT, is based on a probabilistic measurement model that identifies a unidimensional construct, measures its validity, and provides estimates of item and person measures on an interval scale. Rasch analysis improves scoring accuracy and precision. 

We will conduct descriptive exploratory analyses of changes in the primary outcome (HbA1c) over time before fitting statistical models to identify important features of changes. We expect the change in HbA1c to be normally distributed and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare differences between the three groups, adjusting for baseline values. Effect sizes will be calculated using Cohen's d coefficient. To examine secondary outcomes, a multivariable General Linear Model method will be used with 3-, 6- and 12-month differences from baseline. Path analysis will be used to examine mediators of intervention outcomes. Briefly, these include statistical tests of: (a) the interventions effect on the primary outcome; (b) the interventions effect on the potential mediator; (c) the effect of the potential mediator on the outcome variable, after controlling for the effect of the intervention; and (d) the mediated effect, or the indirect path from the intervention to the potential mediator to the outcome.

Our sample size  is 186. This was calculated based on numbers required to detect a minimum of 0.6% change in HBA1c. This is a clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c given that previous research has indicated that a 1% reduction corresponds to a 25% reduction in microvascular complications (Fenwick et al 2013). The total sample required to detect this change with 80% power (p greater than 0.05) is 120. Taking into account an estimated non-response (10%) and loss to follow-up (20%), the total sample size required is 171 (i.e. 57 in each of the three trial arms). We also computed sample size requirements for our secondary outcomes. For example, based on our pilot study values on the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities specific diet subscale (mean equals 4.66 plus or minus 1.6), an improvement of 15% requires a sample size of 129 (80% power, p greater than 0.05). Taking into account 30% attrition, this is a total sample size of 184. Therefore to assess all outcomes with sufficient power, a total sample of 186 is required (i.e. 62 in each of the three trial arms).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The next few decades will see a substantial increase in the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, a common and debilitating microvascular complication of diabetes that progresses largely as a result of poor blood sugar control. Our study responds to the urgent need to assist patients with type 2 diabetes and early diabetic retinopathy to achieve optimal blood sugar control to reduce the risk of irreversible vision loss. We expect our novel personalised routine eye consultation, which is based on evidence-based approaches for behaviour change, to educate and promote long-term behaviour change and lead to clinically significant reductions in blood glucose in a cost effective manner. 

In this project, we will conduct a randomised controlled trial to investigate the clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcomes of our novel personalised eye consultation model, using the individuals own retinal images and evidence-based strategies for behavioural change, to motivate and support patients with diabetic retinopathy and poor blood glucose control.</summary>
