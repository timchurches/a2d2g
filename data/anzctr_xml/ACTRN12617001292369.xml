  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a multifaceted web-based resource for individuals with low back pain - MyBackPain, which integrates evidence-based LBP information and explicitly considers the needs and preferences of people with LBP. Participants will be given access to the website for a period of 3 months, Access to the information will be in multiple ways: self-directed browsing and searching of the content; guided content tailored to the features of their presentation and identified information priorities; and the opportunity to opt-in to receive regular e-mails (at a frequency selected by the participant - i.e. weekly, fortnightly or monthly) that highlight key messages about LBP. Regular email "opt-in" and "opt-out" will be available at any time during the 3-month intervention period to all participants. Intervention adherence will be assessed by website access statistics as participants will be given login details enabling their usage of the site to be recorded.

The MyBackPain website was designed by researchers from the University of Queensland, University of Sydney and in partnership with Arthritis Australia. Its design was based on the amalgamation of international clinical practice guidelines, an international Â expert committee and extensive consultation with consumers.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group will be instructed that we would like them to search the internet for information about LBP and that they should record the websites they have visited over the three-month period. They will not have access to MyBackPain website until it is launched to the public.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome will be the spinal health literacy evaluation measured with the Health Literacy Questionnaire. The HLQ includes 44 items and nine dimensions. Dimensions 2 and 3 will be included as co-primary outcome measures: having sufficient information to manage my health and actively managing my health. The two dimensions will be assessed using a 4-point Likert scale (1 completely disagree; 4 completely agree) and a 0-100 score will be presented for each dimension. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, with 3 months being the primary endpoint for the trial. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of treatment preference (observed)
Patient decision-making will be measured by evaluation of observed treatment choices. Treatments used by the participant during the follow-up period will be scored against the recommendations provided in the MyBackPain website, and based on a 5-point rating: strong evidence, some evidence, unclear evidence/untested, evidence of no effect and harmful. The average score will be used.

      <timepoint>1, 3, 6 and 12 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Spinal health literacy will be evaluated with items 1, 4-9 of the Health Literacy Questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3, 6 and 12 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of treatment preference (stated)
Patient decision-making will be measured by evaluation of stated likelihood of treatment choices. Patients will be asked to present on a 5-point scale (very reasonable, reasonable, neither reasonable nor unreasonable, unreasonable, very unreasonable) how reasonable it would be for someone to consider a subset of treatments discussed in the MyBackPain website. Treatment choices will be scored against the recommendations provided in the MyBackPain website, and based on a 5-point rating: good evidence, may work, not enough evidence, unlikely to work and may be harmful.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation is based on an effect size of 0.30, for having sufficient information to manage my health and actively managing my health dimensions of the HLQ.  A sample size of 440 participants (220 per group) will achieve 80% power to detect the desired effect size, allowing for a conservative loss to follow-up rate of 20% at three months. 
Analyses will be by intention-to-treat analysis of all randomised patients. The primary outcome and other continuous outcomes will be analysed using longitudinal linear regression models, with outcomes measured at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months as outcomes in the model, adjusting for baseline values of outcomes and an interaction between month and randomised group included as fixed effects, with random effects for participants. Similar longitudinal logistic regression models will be used for binary outcomes. These models will be interrogated to yield differences between groups at each time point. Standard diagnostic plots will be used to assess regression assumptions. Descriptive statistics on demographics and clinical characteristics will be presented for each group as the mean change (standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals) or counts and percentages for categorical variables. Multiple imputation methodology will be employed to account for missing data. No statistical adjustment will be made for multiple testing. All tests will be carried out at the 5% level of significance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have developed a comprehensive LBP website in collaboration with Arthritis Australia, the peak national consumer organisation for individuals with musculoskeletal pain. The website integrates evidence-based LBP information, tailored guidance and explicitly considers the needs and preferences of people with LBP. We currently seek to evaluate the website in a randomised controlled trial to measure its effect on health literacy, treatment choices and clinical outcomes. This step is vital before dissemination of the website can occur.
