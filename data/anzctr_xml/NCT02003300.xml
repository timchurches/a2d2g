  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim is to confirm the efficacy of a new non-invasive method for measuring the
      oxygen uptake during general anesthesia of patients undergoing surgery under cardiopulmonary
      bypass. The method has already been successfully tested in the laboratory under controlled
      conditions. In the patient group chosen, oxygen uptake is simultaneously calculated, for
      comparison purposes, from monitoring measurements made routinely as part of normal patient
      care in these cases, using a pulmonary artery catheter - an invasive technique from which
      severe complications occasionally arise, including death.

      A secondary aim is to elucidate the time course of uptake of the anaesthetic vapor,
      isoflurane, during this kind of surgery.</summary>
