  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recruitment: Patients seen by the Christchurch Hospital Rheumatology service will be recruited. Patients fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to participate.

Treatment of non-responders Patients who are deemed MTX non-responders (DAS&gt;3.2) will have the oral dose of MTX increased to the maximum tolerable dose or 20mg weekly. Lower doses may be used in patients with significant renal impairment at the discretion of the investigator.

If their RA remains active (DAS&gt;3.2) at the maximum dose the route of MTX administration will be changed to subcutaneous (SC) injection. Patients changed to SC MTX will be seen at weeks 8, 16 and 24 to determine disease activity and side effects to MTX. Red blood cell (RBC) methotrexat polyglutamate (MTXPGs) concentrations will be determined weekly until steady state concentrations are reached then at each follow-up visit. 

Patients starting or stopping MTX (Pharmacokinetic/clearance studies)
Ten patients with RA starting MTX will be recruited. Each patient will be seen at weeks 0, 8, 16 and 24. Disease activity will be assessed as outlined above. Blood samples will be taken weekly to determine RBC MTXPG concentrations until a steady concentration is reached. This is expected to take between 8 to 16 weeks. More or less frequent blood tests may be required depending on the initial data.

Ten patients with RA stopping MTX will be recruited. Each patient will be seen once when the MTX is stopped, then at weeks 8, 16 and 24. Blood samples will be taken weekly until concentrations of RBC MTXPGs are undetectable. This is expected to take 8-16 weeks. More or less frequent blood tests may be required depending on the initial data.</interventions>

Disease activity assessment
Disease activity will be assessed using standard clinical parameters comprising: swollen joint count, tender joint count, physicians global score (visual analogue scale), modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ), patient pain and fatigue visual analogue scales, and standardised questions related to side effects from MTX

This data will be used to calculate a Disease Activity Score (DAS28). Using this validated score patients will be defined as a MTX responder (DAS&lt;3.2) or MTX non-responder (DAS&gt;3.2).

Laboratory assessment:
1. Markers of inflammation - full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein 
2. Assessment of MTX toxicity  full blood count, liver function tests, creatinine
3. Intracellular effects of MTX - serum B12, serum and red cell folate</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low dose oral methotrexate (MTX) is used widely in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The dose individual patients require varies and is largely unpredictable. Differences in dose requirements are at least partially due to differences in the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate. Genetic differences in the enzymes that metabolise MTX may be important. Methotrexate is metabolised to form methotrexate polyglutamates (MTXPGs), which are stored in circulating red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells. MTXPG concentrations can be measured in these cells. There is evidence that the higher the RBC MTXPG concentration, the greater the likelihood a patients arthritis will respond to methotrexate. We wish to investigate MTXPG concentrations and clinical response in patients taking MTX for RA. This will involve studying patients that are starting or stopping MTX, as well as those on a stable dose of MTX. We will investigate the relationship between RBC MTXPG concentrations and clinical response to MTX. Patients who are not responding adequately to oral MTX are often changed to subcutaneous (SC) injections of MTX. In this group we will examine whether there is any improvement in clinical response and the relationship of response to RBC MTXPG concentrations after the change in route of administration. In order to explain individual variations in clinical response to MTX and variations in MTXPG concentrations we will investigate for differences in genes for enzymes or drug transporters that might influence concentrations.</summary>
