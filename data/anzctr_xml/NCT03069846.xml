Experimental: Measurement using Spectra-Scope - Short pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation onto the skin lesion / measurement with Spectra-Scope


Treatment: devices: Spectra-Scope
The Spectra-Scope consists of the light collection module and the spectral analysis module.
The light collection module is attached to the handpiece of short pulse Nd:YAG laser, and the analysis module is placed on the laser.
Each potential skin cancer site, which has previously been identified as requiring biopsy, should be assessed using five laser shots that last approximately 10 milliseconds per shot and measurement. The laser shots must be made before the scheduled biopsy.
All potentially cancerous lesions (or lesions that would usually undergo complete biopsy of the lesion or require follow up within three months) should be sampled. The Spectra-Scope will not provide a diagnosis at the time of sampling. Sites should record the spectra reported for each laser shot in the CRF.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint is to compare the aggregated emission spectra of skin cell carcinoma verses normal skin. - The aggregated emission spectra collected over a range of wavelengths from skin cells (skin cancer verses normal skin) irradiated with a commercial laser will be plotted to identify wavelengths with greatest spectra seperation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>We plan to recruit 150 patients within a 3 month time frame.</timepoint>
