  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will have a standard FDG PET scan as part of their cancer staging, as well as a second PET scan using the experimental tracer agent Pentixafor to be scheduled on a separate day within 2 weeks of the first scan. Both the FDG and Pentixafor scans involve insertion of a small intravenous cannula through which a small tracer dose of radioactive tracer is administered. This is followed by hour period of rest (uptake time). Both PET scans will be performed by nuclear imaging technologists at the Hollywood PET Centre. The patient will be required to lie still on the scanner for up to half an hour. The patient needs to fast for 4 hours prior to the scan. </interventions>
    <comparator>The standard PET scan currently available in Australia uses 18F-FDG which is a radiopharmaceutical used as a generic marker for glucose metabolism and thus is considered an indirect marker of malignancy. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether a scan called Pentixafor-PET is a more accurate imaging test than the standard FDG-PET scan in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 40 years or above and have a histological diagnosis of NSCLC and require an 18F-FDG PET/CT as part of routine work-up for diagnosis and staging. All participants in this study will have a standard FDG PET scan as part of their cancer staging, as well as a second PET scan using the experimental tracer agent Pentixafor. This will involve a second scan on a separate day within 2 weeks of the first scan. This will not delay or affect your treatment. If you participate in this trial a small dose of tracer will be administered via a cannula in the arm or hand. There will be a small additional radiation dose from the scan which is unlikely to result in any significant short or long term consequences.  The test will usually take less than 2 hours. Results of the two tests will be compared by two specialist doctors in order to determine whether the new Pentixafor-PET scan is more accurate than the FDG-PET scan for local staging and identifying sites of metastatic disease. With your permission the results can be made available to your specialist.
