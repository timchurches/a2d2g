  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves a questionnaire that is given to patients prior to each cycle of chemotherapy which is given every 3 weeks as an outpatient at secondary hospital settings in the MidCentral Region. Patients will receive up to 8 cycles of chemotherapy.
This questionnaire is a modified version of the NCI PRO-CTCAE neurotoxicity questions. It has been modified for use in this study by also incorporating questions regarding symptom duration and persistence of symptoms. The answers to the questions are then used by the treating clinician who is either the specialist medical oncologist or the training registrar under the supervision of the medical oncologist, to modify the Oxaliplatin dose according to a pre-specified guideline which is outlined in a flow-diagram. This guideline suggests the following modifications:
* No numbness or tingling continue with same dose
* Reported mild numbness and tingling triggers a 20-25% dose reduction in Oxaliplatin for the subsequent cycle
* If a patient reports that mild numbness and tingling occurred on no more than or lasted for no longer than 3 days, the clinician has the option of continuing with the same dose of chemotherapy
* If a patient reports persistent mild numbness and tingling present at the time of clinic, this triggers a hold on Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine continues. If the numbness or tingling improves or remains mild at the subsequent pre-chemotherapy clinic, Oxaliplatin can be reintroduced with a 20-25% dose reduction
* Reported moderate numbness and tingling triggers a hold on Oxaliplatin for the subsequent cycle
* Capecitabine chemotherapy continues, without Oxaliplatin
* Assessment of numbness and tingling at the subsequent pre-chemotherapy clinic
* If numbness and tingling is present and has not improved, Oxaliplatin is discontinued
* If numbness and tingling has resolved or has improved and is reported as mild on the modified PRO-CTCAE questionnaire, Oxaliplatin can be reintroduced with a 20-25% dose reduction
* Reported severe or very severe numbness and tingling triggers discontinuation of Oxaliplatin
* Dose reductions for numbness and tingling can be made on two occasions. If there is ongoing numbness and tingling after 2 dose reductions, Oxaliplatin is discontinued
The questionnaire is given to the patient when they come for their pre-chemotherapy clinic and Oxaliplatin modifications made for their subsequent cycle. At each clinic, the clinician will fill out a form, reporting whether the intervention has been followed and if it hasn't, the reason for this.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group for the primary outcome. 
The secondary outcomes, specifically best tumour response and progression-free survival will be compared with historical controls at MidCentral Regional Cancer Treatment Services. These controls will come from a local audit performed on patients who were treated in 2014 with XELOX chemotherapy including Oxaliplatin given at a dose of 130 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Currently, there is no clear, evidence-based guideline regarding dose modification for Oxaliplatin in response to neuropathy and practice varies between clinicians.
The secondary outcome of chronic chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy assessed as percentage reduction from baseline in the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire will be compared to findings in the N08CB/Alliance study (Clinical Trials Information: NCT00316914). This trial tested the ability of intravenous calcium and magnesium to reduce Oxaliplatin neuropathy. Patients were accrued for this study between June 2010 and June 2012 and in August 2015, Pachman et al. reported on the clinical course of Oxaliplatin induced neuropathy experienced by this patient population. Patients in this trial were treated with FOLFOX chemotherapy which included Oxaliplatin at a dose of 85 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. Oxaliplatin dose modification was not dictated in this trial but recommendations were included as guidelines for patient treatment. These recommendations included a dose reduction to 65 mg/m2 for patients with grade 2 sensory neuropathy (using NCI-CTCAE version 4.0) that did not resolve within 2 weeks and discontinuing Oxaliplatin in patients with persistent grade 3 neuropathy. 
Although these comparisons will provide us with limited information, they will provide guidance on whether this intervention should be looked at in a prospective randomized study. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability of the intervention defined by clinician compliance with the intervention - this will be measured as a percentage of individuals in which the intervention is implemented. This will be assessed using forms which are filled out by the clinician at clinic. The forms will ask what has the patient has recorded on their questionnaire, what modifications have been made to chemotherapy and if the intervention has not been followed, why this is. Acceptability requires that the intervention is implemented in at least 80% of individuals. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This is assessed at the completion of oxaliplatin chemotherapy, this being when the patient has stopped all oxaliplatin. Compliance is where the intervention has been followed throughout the chemotherapy course for an individual patient.

    <statisticalmethods>The study aims to recruit 30 patients over 12 months. This has been chosen as MidCentral District Health Board Treats approximately 40 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer annually using Xelox chemotherapy. This will provide sufficient information to inform whether the intervention will be taken forward to a prospective, multi-centre, randomized controlled study and will be considered if the intervention reaches acceptability criteria. Acceptability of the intervention requires clinician compliance with the intervention in at least 80% of individuals.  
Analysis will include patients who have received at least 1 cycle of XELOX chemotherapy and who have been assessed for cycle 2. 
* Patients lost to follow up prior to planned study completion will be included in the analysis
Primary outcome: 
* Success requires an intervention compliance rate of 80%. This will be analysed as clinician compliance with the intervention in 80% of individuals 
Secondary outcomes will be compared to historical controls, which has limitations. These outcomes serve as a guide to further inform whether this intervention will be taken forward to a multi-centre, prospective, randomized, controlled study   
* An exploratory analysis looking at neurotoxicity by compliance will be performed
Variables will be presented as means, medians, ranges, frequencies and percentages as appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Combination chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin is a commonly used first line chemotherapy regimen, in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. Potential oxaliplatin toxicities include chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which can be both acute and chronic and can substantially affect quality of life (QoL). Although acute CIPN is almost always reversible, chronic CIPN can persist following completion of chemotherapy and is frequently irreversible. Chronic CIPN can be reduced, however, by reducing the cumulative dose of oxaliplatin, however currently there is no evidence to guide dose reductions and achieve improved outcome. This study aims to define an acceptable guideline for oxaliplatin dose modification, using patient reported CIPN.
Aims and Objectives:
The aim of this study is to assess the acceptability of patient reported CIPN in addition to standard care, as a trigger for oxaliplatin dose modification. This could later be compared to standard care alone, in a prospective randomised trial.  
Primary objective:
To determine the acceptability of patient reported CIPN as a trigger for oxaliplatin dose modification, defined as the compliance rate of clinicians with the intervention.
Secondary objectives:
To determine the interventions effect on:
1.	The severity of chronic CIPN
2.	Cumulative dose of oxaliplatin
3.	Tumour response rate
4.	Progression free survival
Hypothesis:
The addition of patient reported CIPN as a trigger for oxaliplatin dose modification is acceptable and results in reduced severity of chronic CIPN.
Study Design and Target Population:
A single arm phase 2 acceptability trial, in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer undergoing palliative XELOX chemotherapy.
Intervention:
Patients will complete a modified PRO-CTCAE questionnaire prior to each cycle of chemotherapy and this will trigger pre-specified oxaliplatin dose modifications. 
Outcomes and Measures:
Primary outcome: acceptability of the intervention defined by a clinician compliance rate of at least 80%.
Secondary outcomes:
* Severity of chronic CIPN defined by the percent reduction from baseline EORTC QLQ-CIPN score
* Cumulative dose of oxaliplatin at the completion of chemotherapy
* Tumour response rate defined by the best response achieved on CT 
* Progression free survival at 6, 12 and 18 months
