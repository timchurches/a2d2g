  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Composite of Adjudicated Venous Thromboembolic Event (VTE)-Related (Pulmonary Embolism and Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Deep Vein Thrombosis[DVT]) and All-cause Death During the Intended Treatment Period - Event rate=Number of events divided by the number of patients evaluated. A mandatory bilateral ascending contrast venogram was to be obtained on Day 35 (Â± 3). Patients with confirmed symptomatic DVT at any time, or asymptomatic DVT upon venography, were to receive treatment for DVT according to the investigator's standard of care. Signs and symptoms suggestive of VTE included, but were not limited to: 1) lower extremity DVT: erythema, warmth, pain, swelling, tenderness; and 2) PE: pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, syncope, light-headedness/dizziness, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Intended Treatment Period started on day of randomization and, for patients who received treatment, ended at the later of 2 days after last dose of study drug or 38 days after the first dose (presurgery) of study drug. For randomized patients who did not receive study drug, the period ended 38 days after randomization.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Composite of Adjudicated Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), Nonfatal Pulmonary Embolism, and Venous Thromboembolic Event-related Death With Onset During Intended Treatment Period - Event rate=Number of events divided by the number of patients evaluated. Each patient was categorized as having no proximal DVT, having proximal DVT, being nonevaluable for proximal DVT, having no distal DVT, having distal DVT, or being nonevaluable for distal DVT. Adjudication criteria were: Normal=All deep veins were visualized, and there was no intraluminal filling defect (ILFD). ILFD=An area of reduced, or absent filling, at least partially surrounded with contrast medium in = 2 projections or a lack of filling in a vessel in which there was a cut-off that had the configuration of a thrombus. Indeterminate=A lack of filling of a region of the deep vein system, proximal or distal, without the presence of an ILFD elsewhere in the same region. Not Done=A venography was not performed. Proximal DVT was found if any of the proximal veins had an ILFD. Pulmonary embolism was radiographically (angiography, V/Q scan, computed tomography) determined.</outcome>

CRNM was defined as acute clinically overt bleeding that did not satisfy the criteria for a major bleeding event and met at least 1 of the following: epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleed, hematuria, bruising/ecchymosis, or hemoptysis. Minor bleeding was defined as an acute clinically overt bleeding event that did not meet the criteria for major bleeding or a CRNM.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to learn whether apixaban can prevent the blood clots in the leg
      (deep vein thrombosis) and lung (pulmonary embolism) that sometimes occur after hip
      replacement surgery and to learn how apixaban compares with enoxaparin in preventing these
      clots. The safety of apixaban will also be studied</summary>
