  <interventions>
    <interventions>- All participants will receive ongoing standard care for their cardiovascular health, including medications and secondary prevention advice from their doctors and referral to cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program. 
A free copy of the patient information booklet: Managing My Heart Health from the Heart Foundation (NSW Division) will be supplied. 

- The MyHeartMate app applies several successful game techniques, including point systems, built-in challenges and tracking of achievements
- Participants select short and long-term missions to undertake, which earn them points that they use to care for their virtual heart. 
- Missions include short- and long-term (up to 7 days) healthy lifestyle activities such as-
* healthy eating choices
* physical activity
* not smoking
* talking to their doctor and family about their feelings (psychological health)
* taking their medications
* engaging in behaviours to improve blood glucose and cholesterol levels.
Points earned are used to purchase heart care items such as food, exercise, relaxation and medications, which when spent, improve the visible health of their virtual heart. 
- They can share their achievements (points) via a community leaderboard and invite their friends (other known players) to share their leaderboard. 
- Fun games such as block movers and word guessing are included to enhance engagement with the game. 
- Patients track their real-world achievement by entering their current levels of exercise (daily) and blood pressure and weight (weekly).
The My Heart Mate interventional arm will receive: 
- an instructional video about the purpose and way to use the MyHeartMate app (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpf-Vs06aRU),
- the MyHeartMate app as a free download on their smart phone or tablet, 
- an invitation to participate in the MyHeartMate Facebook community (closed group), 
- a follow-up email at approximately two weeks from the research team to check they have successfully downloaded and are using the app, 
- weekly notification from the app if they do not use the app for a week (three times only), - automated emails generated via the app when they have met particular goals (missions) and/or challenges.

The participants are expected (but not required) to spend a short amount of time (up to 30 minutes) per day engaging with the app.

Participants will be followed up at 6 months when all primary and secondary outcome measurements will be repeated as per baseline.

Participants will be allocated to the intervention or control group following registration with the study coordinator based at the University.
The study coordinator will use an online web-based random assignment tool (https://www.randomizer.org/) to generate the randomisation schedule. 
Allocation will be recorded by the study coordinator and the research assistant informed and actioned. 
Baseline data will be collected at the hospital and a Fitbit will be applied on discharge date by the Research Assistant (Registered Nurse with 20 years experience).
Fitbits will be required to be worn for 4 continuous days (2 weekdays and 2 week-end days) at baseline and 6 months. 
Patients will be provided with a Fitbit Flex to wear on their wrist and instructions on wearing for the measurement period and provided with a stamped self-addressed envelope for returning. 
Fitbit Flex does not have a user interface/screen so participants cannot check their step count to meet any self-imposed or subconscious goal  this aims to reduce behaviour change that may occur simply as a result of monitoring.

Participants in the interventional arm will be contacted 1 week after discharge from hospital to confirm usage of the app and to determine if there are any difficulties experienced with usage.
Participants will be contacted at 3 months and will receive a text message as a reminder of the study and the follow-up due at 6 months

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project will be a pilot study to test the concept of gamification on cardiovascular disease (CVD) management by evaluating the effectiveness of a new and innovative smart phone app, "My Heart Mate", on engagement in important cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor behaviours and outcomes at 6 months follow-up. The game has been developed to promote uptake and acceptability in collaboration with cardiac patients (front-end users) and effective strategies in key risk factors by leading experts in cardiology and behaviour change. Our study will determine whether the novel MyHeartMate app can improve multiple CVD risk factors in coronary heart disease patients and evaluate patients views of usability and tolerability of the app and Facebook group. </summary>
