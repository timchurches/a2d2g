Treatment: drugs - fluorouracil
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin

Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Stratum I - AJCC Stages I-IIa - Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Patients also receive amifostine trihydrate subcutaneously on the same days they undergo radiation therapy.

Experimental: Stratum II - AJCC Stages IIb-IV - Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses. In weeks 10-18, patients undergo radiation therapy and receive amifostine trihydrate as in stratum I. Patients also receive 3 courses of cisplatin as before.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Two Year Event-free Survival (EFS) - The two-year event-free survival will be compared with a standard established from adult oncology data and the results of POG-9486.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying how well radiation therapy, amifostine, and chemotherapy
      work in treating young patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal cancer. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal
      cells from the side effects of radiation therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiation therapy together
      with amifostine and chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.</summary>
