    <studytitle>The Cardiac Interventions, Surgery and Cognitive Outcome (CISCO) Study</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The prospective observational CISCO (Cardiac Interventions, Surgery and Cognitive Outcome) study will document the preoperative neuropsychological status of patients presenting for coronary angiography (CA) and relate this to cognitive outcomes over the succeeding three months, taking into account their management (medical; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI); or Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>To test whether Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) prior to CA is associated with an increased risk of PPCD (Post Procedural Cognitive Dysfunction) and to compare cognitive changes between management techniques (medical; PCI; CABG surgery). Patients will complete a battery of conventional and computerised neuropsychological tests preoperatively.  They will then complete the computerised test battery at 24 hours, 6 days and 3 months post intervention to identify changes in cognitive function.  The tests takes about 1 hour to complete. Quality of Life (QoL), mood, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) will be assessed preoperatively and at 3 months post intervention.</interventions>
