Treatment: surgery: Radial EBUS biopsy
Radial EBUS is an endobronchial USS which is used to obtain biopsies from a peripheral lung mass.

Treatment: devices: Types of Radial Ultrasound probes
The Radial USS probe comes in two sizes. A thick USS probe that is 1.7mm and the thin USS is 1.4mm in diameter.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obtaining a tissue sample to diagnose parenchymal lung lesions (PPL) suspected of cancerous
      origin is of utmost importance. Due to it's markedly favourable safety profile, a
      bronchoscopic biopsy method called Radial EBUS is becoming increasingly popular. However, a
      meta-analysis reports the success rate of Radial EBUS in diagnosis is 73%, which in
      comparison to CT guided biopsy which is the gold standard in diagnosing PPL (90% success
      rate), is sub-optimal.

      There are 2 types of USS probes used in the R-EBUS procedure. Whilst the thicker USS probe
      (1.7mm) is capable of accommodating larger biopsy instruments, the thinner USS probe could be
      advanced more peripherally to obtain a biopsy.

      Therefore identifying what type of USS probe is better for a given PPL will aid in improving
      the diagnostic yield.

      In this study, investigators compare these two types of probes in the ability to diagnose a
      PPL.

      The biopsy instruments used for both arms are forceps and cytology brush. For the thick USS
      arm, in addition, an aspiration needle will also be used. (The thin USS guide sheath is too
      small to accommodate an aspiration needle)</summary>
