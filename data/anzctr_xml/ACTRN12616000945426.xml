  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this cross-over trial, participants will complete two laboratory-based conditions, separated by a 7 day wash out. The experimental condition involves 4.5 hours of prolonged sitting with intermittent bouts of gentle walking. Participants will remain seated for the initial 30 minutes (steady state period, after which they will consume a 75g glucose load and will complete a 2 minute bout of gentle walking every 20 minutes for the remaining 4 hours (total duration of walking = 12 x 2 minute bouts = 24 minutes). All activities will take place in a controlled laboratory environmental under the supervision of trained clinical research staff. During the condition, participants will be permitted to watch television, DVDs or read.  </interventions>
    <comparator>In a controlled laboratory environment, participants will complete 4.5 hours of prolonged sitting without breaks (only toilet breaks permitted). Participants will sit in a comfortable chair and will consume a 75g glucose load after an initial 30 minute steady state period. Participants will be permitted to watch television programs, DVDs or read during the condition, and all activities will be supervised and recorded by clinical research staff.
This study is a non-randomised cross-over trial, whereby the participant will complete both the experimental and control conditions. Women at risk of gestational diabetes mellitus will first undergo the control condition, which involves the recommended screening  for gestational diabetes mellitus. According to current guidelines, diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus is based on any one of the following: Fasting plasma glucose between 5.1 and 6.9mmol/l; a 1-hour plasma glucose post 75g oral glucose load greater than 10.0mmol/l; or a 2-hour plasma glucose post 75g oral glucose between 8.5 and 11.0mmol/l at 24-28 weeks gestation. This study will follow a non-randomised design to expedite management of hyperglycaemia in individuals with gestational diabetes mellitus who require immediate medical attention.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations have been made in relation to the primary outcome measures of postprandial glucose (venous collections). Based on our own data (1) and previously published work (2) , we have estimated that a sample size of 22 is needed to detect a between treatment difference of 0.9mmol/L with a minimum power of 80% and a probability of 0.05 (2-tailed test). This is based on the assumption that the within-patient standard deviation of the response variable is 1.04. As a safeguard and using our experience from previous behavioural interventions, we will over-sample to cover an estimated attrition rate of 15%. Thus, 25 participants will be recruited.

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with random intercepts will be used to evaluate the differential effects of the experimental conditions on the outcomes. All models will include a binary variable indicating the experimental condition, adjusted for potential period effects and period-dependent confounders (baseline values for the outcome of interest, dietary intake and physical activity). Given that the study uses a balanced orthogonal design and substantial imbalances due to dropout are unlikely, it will not be necessary to adjust for subject-level covariates (e.g., age). GLMMs are appropriate for correlated data (repeated measures) with various distributional assumptions and can easily accommodate missing data. A probability level of 0.05 will be adopted.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide, with current Australian prevalence rates estimated to be between 13-16%. The primary goal of GDM management is to prevent hyperglycaemia, as there is a clear dose-dependent relationship between increased plasma glucose levels during pregnancy and adverse outcomes for both the mother and child. Compliance rates for exercise intervention trials in pregnant women are generally poor (reporting adherence as low as 16-55%).

Furthermore, the majority of pregnant women do not reach the recommended levels of physical activity; and overall physical activity levels tend to decrease throughout pregnancy (particularly in caregiving, outdoor, household and recreational activities). The lack of adherence to an exercise regime could be due to feelings of tiredness and increasing immobility as pregnancy progresses, which would limit the ability or motivation for women to maintain exercise efforts for more than 10 min at a time, particularly for women who are not normally active. In light of the fact that brief (2-3 minutes), regular (every 20-30 minutes), light ambulatory activities have been demonstrated to be effective in improving postprandial glucose control in overweight/obese and T2D patients, consideration of the breaks in sitting approach may be appropriate for women at risk for or diagnosed with GDM. Given that post-challenge glucose is considered a surrogate for postprandial glycaemia, there is value in examining the effect of breaking up sitting in the context of routine screening for GDM. Based on past studies done within our laboratory, we anticipate that breaking up sitting will lower postprandial glucose responses compared to prolonged sitting without breaks, and may even prevent levels
from entering the GDM range. The results of this trial will help inform the design and development of a larger, chronic study looking at breaking up sitting to improve pregnancy outcomes for mothers and offspring.
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that regular, light intensity ambulatory breaks in sitting (2 minutes every 20 minutes) will lower post-OGTT glucose and insulin responses in women at risk for developing GDM, compared to sitting-only control.
Study Design: A cross-over trial, involving women at risk of GDM, of two laboratory-based interventions undertaken during a standard 75g oral glucose tolerance test.
Outcomes: Primary outcomes  postprandial glycaemic response calculated as the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) from half hourly blood sampling over a 4 hour period. Secondary outcomes  postprandial insulin response calculated as iAUC and mean blood pressure.</summary>
