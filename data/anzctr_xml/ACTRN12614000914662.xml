  <interventions>
    <interventions>The target muscle group in the experimental limb will be trained according to a progressive resistance program three times a week for 12 weeks. Participants will perform forty maximal contractions in four sets of ten. The first two sets of ten exercises will involve isometric contractions and the second two sets of ten exercises will involve isokinetic contractions. Resistance will be applied through the hands of a therapist. The therapist will always ensure that the resistance is maximal and completely exhausts participants by the end of each set of ten exercises. There will be a 2-minute rest after each set of ten exercises. Emphasis will be placed on progressively increasing the resistance. Resistance applied for each contraction will be measured using a myometer held by the treating therapist.  It is estimated that each treatment will take approximately 20 minutes. Weights or strengthening equipment will not be used because of the problems of ensuring maximal resistance is applied throughout range in very weak muscles that are not neurally intact. The intervention will be carried out by qualified physiotherapists and physiotherapist assistants who will be trained in how to carry out the intervention. </interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will continue to receive bilateral functional training. This will involve training for activities of daily living as considered necessary by their treating therapists (e.g., training to transfer, walk, roll and push a wheelchair). Participants will receive any other forms of therapy deemed appropriate for managing fitness, respiratory compromise, contractures, spasticity or pain. In addition, participants will receive any type of strength training program deemed appropriate by treatment therapists to all muscles on both sides of the body with the exception of the target muscle group in the control limb.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximal voluntary Isometric muscle strength at mid muscle length: A myometer will be used to measure peak isometric muscle strength for either the biceps, triceps, hamstrings or quadriceps at its mid muscle length (e.g., 90degrees elbow flexion for the elbow flexor muscle group). The myometer will sit in a constructed apparatus to allow a stable surface for the participant to push against. Strength will be recorded in N but then converted into Nm (using joint angle and distance between joint and force transducer head). Participants will be required to perform 10 maximal isometric muscle contractions or until they fatigue performed with verbal encouragement. There will be a 60-second rest between each trial. </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Spasticity: The Ashworth Scale will be used to assess spasticity in the target muscle. The participant will be positioned in supine on an adjustable physiotherapy bed. Only the target muscle will be tested but on both sides of the body. If testing a muscle that primarily flexes a joint, the joint will be placed in a maximally flexed position and moved to a position of maximal extension over one second. 
If testing a muscle that primarily extends a joint, the joint will be placed in a maximally extended position and moved to a position of maximal flexion over one second.
 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle fatigue: A hand held myometer will be used to measure muscle fatigue at its mid muscle length (e.g., 90degrees elbow flexion for the elbow flexor muscle group). Strength will be recorded in N but then converted into Nm (using joint angle and distance between joint and force transducer head). Participants will be required to perform repeated maximal isometric contractions of 4 seconds duration over the period of 3 minutes. They will receive a 4 second rest between each contraction. The mean torque generated over the last three contractions will be divided by the mean torque generated over the first three contractions to calculate the fatigue index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants' pereception of strength: At the completion of the trial participants will be asked to rate their impressions of change in strength of the target muscle group separately for each limb on a 7-point scale where 1 indicates Almost the same- not much worse, and 7 indicates An enormous deal worse. And the same 7-point scale for if they felt it got better, where 1 indicates "Almost the same- not much better", and 7 indicates "An enormous deal better". </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants' perception of function: At the completion of the trial participants will be asked to rate their impressions of change in their ability to use the target muscle group for functional activities separately for each limb on a 7-point scale where 1 indicates Almost the same- not much worse, and 7 indicates An enormous deal worse. And the same 7-point scale for if they felt it got better, where 1 indicates "Almost the same- not much better", and 7 indicates "An enormous deal better". </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A log will be kept of all new patients with SCI admitted to each SCI unit over the trial period. All these patients will undergo pre-screening for suitability by treating therapists. Initially, physiotherapists from the SCI units who are not involved in the trial will ask suitable in-patients if they are interested in participating. Interested participants will then be visited by a trial staff member who will undertake a pre-screening assessment including reviews of medical history and discussions with the treating doctors and therapists. If the participant meets the inclusion criteria, he/she will be invited to participate and given a Participant Information Sheet for consideration. After baseline assessments, the right or left target muscle group will be randomised to either an experimental or control condition. 
A secure random-allocation schedule will be computer-generated prior to commencement of the trial by an independent person and kept at a central off-site location. The randomisation schedule will not be stratified but will be blocked ensuring equal numbers of right and left target muscles groups assigned to the experimental condition. A participant will be entered into the trial when baseline details are logged at the central site and the allocation is provided. The person responsible for central randomisation will notify the treating therapist of the treatment assignment. This will not be disclosed to the blinded assessors.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 30 will be required to provide an 80% probability of detecting a between-group difference equivalent to 15% of mean baseline measures on maximal isometric strength of the target muscle group. This assumes a mean initial strength of 75 Nm (15% is 11 Nm) and a SD of the between-group difference of 10 Nm. All power calculations assume an alpha of 0.05, a loss to follow-up of 15% and a correlation between initial strength and outcome of 0.6.

All statistical analyses will be done using the principles of intention to treat. The t-distribution will be used to estimate 95% CI for between-group (that is, between-limb) differences in change scores for all strength and fatigue outcomes (post-test score minus pre-test score). Paired t-tests will be used to test for significant differences and probabilities of less than 0.05 will be considered significant although the results will be interpreted with respect to the pre-determined minimally worthwhile treatment effects (as defined above). The centile routine in Stata (v13; Statacorp, TX, USA) will be used to derive the 95% CIs for median between-group differences for the modified Ashworth and Global Impression of Change data. This method does not make assumptions about the distribution of the data.

    <summary>To compare the effectiveness of progressive resistance training and functional training versus functional training alone for increasing strength in partially-paralysed muscles in people with recent SCI. 
The results of this trial will have implications for the rehabilitation of people following SCI. In particular, the results will determine whether time and effort should be devoted to progressive resistance training programs or whether functional training alone will suffice. </summary>
