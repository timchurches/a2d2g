  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Maintaining a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) Response During the Double-Blind Treatment Withdrawal Period (Period B) - The PASI quantifies the severity of a participant's psoriasis based on both lesion severity and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. The PASI score can vary in increments of 0.1 and range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores representing greater severity of psoriasis. PASI75 response defined as at least a 75 percent (%) reduction in PASI relative to baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Maintaining a Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) Response During the Double-Blind Treatment Withdrawal (Period B) - The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 5-point severity scale (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; and 4=severe).

PASI is a composite scoring by the investigator of degree of erythema, induration, and scaling (each scored separately) for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin], and lower limbs [including buttocks), with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. PASI75 response is defined as at least 75% reduction in PASI relative to Baseline/Day 1. Baseline defined as the last observation up to first dosing date in Period C.

The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). A PCS score and MCS score are based on a normalized sum of the 8 scale scores; PCS/MCS summary concept score = (raw score*10) plus 50. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores to a mean of 50 and standard deviations (SDs) of 10, in the general population. In norm-based scoring, each scale is scored to have same average (50)/SD (10). With this method anytime a scale score is below 50, health status is below average, and each point is one-tenth of a SD. Higher scores indicate a better health related quality of life.</outcome>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of the study are to 1) compare the efficacy responses of CP 690,550 (5
      mg BID and 10 mg BID) versus placebo following 24 weeks of CP 690,550 treatment and
      subsequent withdrawal of active treatment at various timepoints during the 16 week double
      blind active or placebo treatment period; 2) evaluate the regain of efficacy responses of CP
      690,550 (5 mg BID and 10 mg BID) following 4 -16 weeks of CP 690,550 treatment withdrawal and
      subsequent re treatment; and 3) evaluate the safety and tolerability of CP 690,550 (5 mg BID
      and 10 mg BID) in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis who are
      candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.</summary>
