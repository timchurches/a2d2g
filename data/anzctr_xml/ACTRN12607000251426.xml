  <interventions>
    <interventions>112 day intervention of:
selenium enriched milk protein in volunteers who have already had the influenza vaccine and in volunteers who will be given the influenza vaccine.
Volunteers are required to consume 50gm of the randomly allocated milk protein once daily mixed with 200ml of tap water.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effect of a 112 day supplementation with Selenium (Se)-enriched milk on:
1) The incidence, duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI).
2) Immune responsiveness after exposure to influenza vaccine. Vaccine given at week 5.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1) The incidence, duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) is recorded in a symptoms diary every day of the study.
2) Immune responsiveness after exposure to influenza vaccine where the vaccine is given at week 5, then blood sample at week 16 to assess immune function and selenium concentration.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Parallel study of 150 healthy participants (male and female)  65 years of age or more who pass the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to 2 interventions.
	Approx. 75 people, to receive placebo (control) for a total of 112 days
	Approx. 75 people, isonitrogenous and isocaloric Se-enriched powdered milk supplement approx 120-150 ug Se/ day for a total of 112 days.  
The non-vaccinated volunteers will be inoculated with influenza vaccine at a common time point between 28 and 42 days (4 and 6 weeks) after starting the supplement.  Blood samples (20mL) will be collected during the experiment (days 0, one day between 28 and 42,112 and 150) to quantitate blood selenium, anti-oxidant status and immune function.  
Compliance and upper respiratory tract infection data will be collected by the volunteer for the duration of the study.  This data will be retrieved from the volunteer at the conclusion of the study. 
From these measurements, it shall be determined whether increased immune function was achieved during nutritional supplementation with the Se-enriched milk supplement compared to control.</summary>
