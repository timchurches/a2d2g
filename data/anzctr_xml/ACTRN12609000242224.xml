  <interventions>
    <interventions>Functional Incidental Training (FIT) which is defined as Care processes that are designed to increase activity and functional ability with emphasis placed on the repetition of exercises that are specific to the functional skills involved with toileting and other activities of daily living.  For this study FIT will be instituted to be undertaken four times daily from Monday to Friday and on weekends if possible.  The FIT exercise component will be designed to fit the individual abilities of the participant. For the standard physiotherapy plus FIT group this will mean weekly physiotherapy treatments, an additional visit from a physiotherapy assistant, encouragement to exercise from the Activity workers and residence staff and a written list of individualised exercises on the wall in their room.  The intervention will take place while the participant is occupying a Transition Care Program bed which averages approximately six weeks but may be up to 18 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard physiotherapy will be tailored to the person but may include a standing balance exercise class weekly, a chair based exercise class weekly, endurance walking, a chair based or standing exercise program, hydrotherapy or a gym program.  Standard physiotherapy takes place while the participant is occupying a Transition Care Program bed which averages approximately six weeks but may be up to 18 weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>The Transition Care Program assessor will give the potential participant information regarding the project.  If they agree to talk to the researcher a referral will be made.  The researcher will then contact the potential participant and explain the project.  If they agree to take part a consent form will then be signed.  The demographic and outcome measures will then take place prior to randomisation.  Allocation will be concealed as central randomisation will take place by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>The excel randomisation feature will be used to randomise to the standard physiotherapy or standard physiotherapy plus FIT groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After a hospital stay some older people will be accepted on the Transition Care Program into a bed based place.  They may go to a hostel or nursing home for a few weeks after completing their inpatient stay.  These people may receive physiotherapy treatment while they are staying there with the aim of helping them to assist them to get as well as possible.  As part of this study some of these people will be offered more physical activity and additional supervision whilst exercising.  The aim of this project is to see whether this will make any difference to where the people go at the end of their stay - to their home or long term in residential care.  Approximately 50 people will take part in this study over a period of two years.  The study will take place in Bendigo.</summary>
