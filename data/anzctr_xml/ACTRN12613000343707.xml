  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are administered a minimum of 20 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in a multiplace chamber. Each session involves the delivery of 100% oxygen at 2.4ATA, for 90 minutes.
Sessions will be administered once everyday consecutively (Mon-Fri), for a minimum of 20 sessions, up to 40 sessions (i.e. 20-40 working days)
Patients in the intervention group will receive oxygen via a plastic hood that encloses the head.  This creates a seal for oxygen to accumulate, allowing patients to breathe in 100% oxygen.</interventions>

Sessions will be administered once everyday consecutively (Mon-Fri), for a minimum of 20 sessions, up to 40 sessions (i.e. 20-40 working days)
Patients in the control group will receive oxygen via a mask that forms a seal over the patient's nose and mouth.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to compare the extent of refractive change in patients receiving HBOT via hood vs mask.  The results will aid in the understanding of the etiology of HBOT induced myopia, and aid in choosing the delivery method of HBOT in future treatment sessions.
The investigators hypothesise greater refractive change in the hooded group, in keeping with results of previous studies.  </summary>
