  <interventions>
    <interventions>Blood pressure was measured in hypertensive and normotensive pregnant women comparing an automated blood pressure measuring device and a mercury-free sphygmomanometer with a mercury sphygmomanometer as the gold standard. Both of the test devices use a standard blood pressure cuff, but have different ways of determining the blood pressure. The automated device inflates and measures blood pressure electronically, while the non-mercury device uses a manual bulb to inflate and deflate the cuff, similar to mercury sphygmomanometry.
Pregnant women were allocated on a non-random basis to either having the automated device vs mercury or the mercury-free device vs mercury. Each women then had nine blood pressures taken, alternating between mercury and the test device over a 20 minute period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Mercury sphygmomanometry is the traditional means and gold standard for determining blood pressure. A cuff of the appropriate size is wrapped around the patient's right upper arm and inflated with a connected bulb. The fall in pressure in the cuff is watched on a mercury column and the appearance of the patient's pulse listening with a stethoscope at the elbow is the systolic blood pressure and the disappearance of the pulse is the diastolic blood pressure. Each measurement takes about 10-15 seconds. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size of 85 women in each of four groups - non-mercury vs mercury and automated vs mercury - following British Hypertension Society protocol. Differences in readings between mercury and test devices categorised into the percentages of BP differences within 5, 10, and 15 mmHg.  For the device to receive an A classification, at least 60% of the differences must be in the less than or equal to 5 mmHg difference group, 85% in the less than or equal to10 mmHg group, and 95% in the less than or equal to15 mmHg category.
Data entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the IBM SPSS statistics (Version 20) statistical program used for analysis. Differences between the means of continuous data assessed using the t-test and categorical data tested using chi-squared tests. A probability of &lt;0.05  considered statistically significant. Bland-Altman plots used to determine the agreement between the readings using mercury and the test devices.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our aim was to find a suitable replacement for mercury sphygmomanometry to measure blood pressure in pregnancy. A mercury-free sphygmomanometer and an automated oscillometric device were compared with mercury sphygmomanometry in 170 hypertensive and 170 normotensive pregnant women. The mercury-free sphygmomanometer appears to be the more accurate and an acceptable replacement for mercury in pregnancy.</summary>
