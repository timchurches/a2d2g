    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - HMPL-453

Experimental: HMPL-453 - Two strengths of HMPL-453 tablets (25 mg and 100 mg based on the free base) will be used for clinical studies. The drug products are coated tablets, which are packaged in white induction sealed HDPE bottles. HMPL-453 will be administered to patients as oral tablet(s) on a daily basis, untill disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or death. Dose levels are to be potentially tested in this study include 25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 mg/day.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a first-time-in-human, phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of HMPL-453 in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid malignancies who have failed or are intolerable to
      standard therapies or for whom no standard therapies exist. There are preliminary two stages
      in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion stage (stage 2). We
      will decide whether to conduct stage 2 or not one month after the last patient included in
      stage 1.</summary>
