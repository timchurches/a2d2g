    <interventions>Iron absorption from isotopically Fe labelled FERRI PRO Trademark was directly compared against iron absorption from isotopically Fe labelled ferrous sulphate in a randomized cross-over study.  
   
An instant milk drink (250 ml) containing isotopically labelled FERRI PRO Trademark (2.4 mg fortification iron per serving) was fed twice after an overnight fast with both feedings being separated by a 3 h interval.  Emptied glasses were washed twice with 25 ml of milli-q water.  Participants consumed the washings in order to ensure complete intake of the drink and the isotopically labelled fortificant.  Participants were asked not to eat or drink between the two servings and for 3 h following the second administration.  All feedings were performed under close supervision of the investigators.  

Half of the participants were fed the FERRI PRO Trademark on the first day followed by the comparator ferrous sulphate on the second day whilst the other half of the participants were fed the comparator on the first day and FERRI PRO Trademark on the second day.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron deficiency and consequently iron deficiency anaemia develops when iron intake does not meet iron requirements over the long term.  Iron fortification of foods is considered to be the most cost-effective intervention to combat iron deficiency.  Fortification of foods can however be a challenge with problems ranging from undesirable taste issues to decreased nutrient absorption.  The Riddet Institute has developed an iron fortificant known as FERRI PRO Trademark that allows the addition of iron to food products with minimal effect on sensory characteristics and product shelf-life.  The purpose of this project is to evaluate the bioavailability of iron (how much iron is absorbed and utilised by the body) from a FERRI PRO Trademark fortified instant milk beverage.  

A stable isotope technique, based on the analysis of the incorporation of stable (non-radioactive) isotopes into red blood cells will be used to determine bioavailability.  Participants will be required to consume two iron fortified milk-based beverages on two consecutive days.  The two iron fortificants, FERRI PRO Trademark and ferrous sulphate will be prepared using stable iron isotopes 57Fe and 58Fe to allow us to track the incorporation of the iron into the blood cells.  Blood samples will be collected at the start and 14 days after the consumption of the drinks.  Analysis of these samples will tell us how much iron from each beverage has been absorbed and a comparison to be made.
