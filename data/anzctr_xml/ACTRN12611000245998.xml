  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients recruited to the study will receive the following: 

Panitumumab 9mg/kg IV, Day 1 of each cycle
Cisplatin 25mg/m2 IV, Day 1 and 8
Gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV, Day 1 and 8

Treatment is ongoing until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator discretion or patient request to cease.

Once off study treatment, patients will be followed-up 30 days after the last study drug administration, then every 12 weeks until disease progression (if patient had come off treatment for reasons other than progression) or commences new treatment.</interventions>

3.A response to CA19-9 has occurred if after two elevated levels prior to therapy there is at least a 50% fall which is confirmed by a fourth sample.
4.The two pre-treatment samples must both be &gt; twice the upper limit of normal and at least one week but not more than three months apart. At least one of the samples should be within 1 week of starting treatment.
5.The third sample must be &lt; 50% of the second sample.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining panitumumab with the standard cisplatin and gemcitabine treatment for advanced biliary tract cancer.

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with biliary tract cancer. You should have locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not suitable for removal by surgery OR disease which has come back after previous surgical treatment or radiotherapy. 
It has been shown that in other cancer types, panitumumab may be less likely to have an effect if the cancer cells have any mutation detected in a particular gene. That gene is known as KRAS. 
As part of screening for this study, you will be asked to consent to a test to find out whether your cancer cells have a KRAS mutation. If you consent, cells taken from a previous diagnostic procedure will be sent to a central lab for the KRAS test. Only patients with cancer that does not have any mutation in the KRAS gene can participate in this study.

Trial details
The patient population that may participate in this trial would routinely be treated with a combination of the chemotherapy drugs gemcitabine and cisplatin. Participants in this study will additionally receive panitumumab; so that the outcomes associated with treatment using the 3 drugs together can be evaluated. 
Participants will be monitored closely for side effects (toxicity) and for tumour response to treatment. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator discretion or patient request to cease. Once off study treatment, participants will be followed up for 30 days, then every 12 weeks until disease progression or commencement of new treatment, then according to best practice until death. 

Data from this trial can inform us about how safe and tolerable the treatment is, and we can make some comparisons to other trials of chemotherapy alone for this disease. If positive, this study may lead to improved treatment for patients with biliary tract cancer. If negative, it will still give information regarding the biology of the disease, including the incidence of KRAS mutation in this tumour type.</summary>
