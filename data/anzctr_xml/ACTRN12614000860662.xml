  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prior to their surgery, all consenting participants will require to complete a demographic questionnaire. Participants will be randomly assigned to a single-blind pre-operative administration from coded ampoules of either 4mg dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DBL Dexamethasone sodium phosphate 4mg/mL) or 10mg of triamcinolone acetonide (Kenacort - Registered Trademark -A 10 10mg/mL). The administration of all corticosteroids will be done in combination with 5mL of Naropeine to prevent high concentration damage to the soft tissues. The amount to be injected will be divided equally and infiltrated on the dorsal, medial, plantar and lateral aspects of the first metatarsal, in a Mayo block fashion proximal to the surgical site. The dose injected is based upon previous experiences of the podiatric surgeon and falls within the recommended dose ranges for soft tissue corticosteroid injections. Participants will then proceed to have the hallux valgus surgery performed as planned. All procedures of the surgery would follow the standard UWA hallux valgus protocol.

After the procedure, all patients will have their dressings applied uniformly by the same surgeon. This is important to eliminate the risk of increased postoperative pain secondary to a tighter bandage on one patient than on the other. All patients will also receive postoperative analgesic medication (Prodeine - Registered Trademark 15 tablets) as part of UWA Podiatric Surgery Clinics standard post-operative care procedure. A logbook and a self-administered Brief Pain Inventory short form (BPI-sf) questionnaire will also be given to the participants to document the pain outcomes of the injections.

The outcome is assessed only at one timepoint. Completing the BPI-sf immediately prior to receiving medications would allow assessment of the patient's pain intensity at its most intolerable state (pain score of 3/10 or greater). Patient would then consume the medication to relieve the pain.

Patients who do not need to consume any medications (pain score of 2/10 or lesser) would then complete the BPI-sf 14 days after the surgery, indicating no pain or slight pain that do not require consumption of any medication.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study population will comprise of subjects that are scheduled for the correction of hallux valgus at the UWA Podiatric Surgery Clinic. Participants will be recruited
prospectively through a volunteer sampling method following standard protocol for preoperative assessment at the clinic. Only subjects who register
interest in the study and fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited by the research investigators. 

Subjects who are eligible for inclusion in the study will be informed of the availability of study by the attending podiatric surgeon. They will be asked to contact the chief investigator, Associate professor Reza Naraghi via email requesting they be contacted regarding participation into the study. Interested subjects will be provided with verbal information about the research as well as a written participant information sheet. Informed consent will be obtained from all willing participants of the study prior to the intervention process, which involves randomization to either dexamethasone sodium phosphate or triamcinolone acetonide. All communications with participants thereafter will be made through the UWA Podiatric Surgery Clinic.

Allocation is not concealed
</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either dexamethasone sodium phosphate (4 mg/ml) or triamcinolone acetonide (10 mg/ml). Stratified randomization of participants will be conducted prior to the surgery using computer generated lists to ensure equal allocation of participants with differing prognostic factors to each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients recovering from surgical procedures generally require pharmacotherapy to assist in post-operative pain management. Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory agents often administered in their injectable form by podiatric surgeons during pre-operative analgesia in order to assist in reducing post-operative inflammation and pain associated with foot surgery. Despite their wide anecdotal application in podiatric practice, there are few studies supporting the use of injectable corticosteroids for this purpose, and no guidelines presently exist in regards to appropriate drug or dosage selection. A prospective, single-blind randomized controlled-trial will be conducted to demonstrate and compare the efficacy of short-acting dexamethasone sodium phosphate versus intermediate-acting triamcinolone acetonide in participants undergoing a surgical procedure to correct hallux valgus, facilitated through The 
University of Western Australia Podiatric Surgery Clinic. This study aims to investigate and compare the efficacy of the two different corticosteroids in post-operative pain management, assessed over a 14-day period through 4 end points: Brief Pain Inventory short form, time to post-operative analgesic medication, post-operative analgesic consumption and proportion of participants within each group that received post-operative analgesic medication. We hypothesized that injectable triamcinolone acetonide is more effective in reducing post-operative pain than dexamethasone sodium phosphate, following hallux valgus surgery.</summary>
