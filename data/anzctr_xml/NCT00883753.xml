      <outcome>Change From Baseline in FACIT-Fatigue Score - FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>

    <summary>This study was an extension to study MA21573 [NCT00750880], which was an open label single
      arm study to investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of tocilizumab monotherapy, or
      combination therapy with non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS), in
      patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who completed the 24
      week core study, and had at least a moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
      response, were eligible to enter this long-term extension study, and received tocilizumab 8
      mg/kg intravenous (iv) every 4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment was 1-2 years,
      and the target sample size was &gt; 500 individuals.</summary>
