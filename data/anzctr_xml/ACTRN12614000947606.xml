  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be issued with a mouldable pen (designed at Unitec) to use for 8 weeks. 
The researcher will show the participant how to mould the pen initially. It can then "set" into shape or be re-moulded if the participant wishes.
The pen has a latex exterior, the design of the internal contents are the intellectual property of the designer and Unitec Institute of Technology. 
Participants are asked to use the pen as they would a normal pen and to note when they use it.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be issued with a commercially available pen (the PenAgainTM) to use for 8 weeks. The PenAgainTM is available worldwide. It has a patented wishbone shaped design and has been ergonomically developed to fit to the contours of the hand. Use of this pen may help alleviate the symptoms of Writers Cramp, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Calluses, RSI, and Arthritis.

      <outcome>Count of joints affected by osteoarthritis of the hand. Hands will be examined for the occurrence of bony enlargements (1= present, 0= absent) and will be calculated as a summary of signs in both hands (range 0 to 30). The American College of Rheumatology criteria (Altman et al., 1990) will also be used as a diagnosis confirmation of hand osteoarthritis.

    <statisticalmethods>Using the Handwriting Assessment Battery for adults (HAB) legibility data from a pilot trial (by the same researcher) - baseline data from the writing aid was 76.5% accuracy (SD=13.9). A 15% change would require 24 people in each group, whereas a 20% changes would require 13 people in each group. Using HAB lower case writing data form the pilot study - baseline data from the writing-aid was 80.6% accuracy (SD=12.91). A 10% change would require 41 in each group, whereas a 15% change would require 18 people in each group. Taking these into account,a sample size of 40 people (20 per group) was chosen as being statistically justified and realistically attainable.

All analysis will be performed on an intention to treat basis and based on the aggregated data for each allocated group. Paired Students t-tests will be used to identify the differences at baseline and follow-up between the two pen allocation groups. Differences within the groups will also be analysed by paired samples Students t-tests. To account for differences in baseline the change from baseline in each group will be compared. Distributions will be examined for normality and parametric and non-parametric tests will be applied as required. In the case of data that are not normally distributed the Mann-Whitney test, which is suitable for independent samples, will be used. All of the endpoints will be continuous quantitative data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our hypothesis is that patients with moderate to severe arthritis of the hands will find the new writing-aid easier to use and therefore easier to write with.  The aim of this study is to trial the writing-aid in clinical practice, with two distinct clear research questions in mind:
1.	Is the participants handwriting improved with the writing-aid compared to a commercially available aid? 
2.	Do the participants find the writing-aid comfortable and easy to use?
