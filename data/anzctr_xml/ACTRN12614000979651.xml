  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Aphasia ASK intervention consists of a face to face intervention and follow-up phone calls provided by a speech pathologist up until 12 months post stroke. The intervention is for 6 to 8 weeks for an hour each week. The topics in the intervention include a number of modules and cover a range of areas including: caregiver training (e.g. communication partner training), education (on aphasia, successful coping strategies and support services) stress management, positive adaptive strategies, sharing of personal stories and developing peer-based support.  The participants will be able to prioritise the order of modules based on their personal interest and needs. The prioritisation occurs during the module getting started. Each module is colour coded rather than numbered to assist with this process. The first session establishes the goals for the program using collaborative goal setting techniques. The goals form the basis for prioritising the modules that are covered in future weeks. For example, if the participants goal is to stay positive, there is a module on positive thinking that includes information about and practice on exercises for strategies which were drawn from the counselling literature. At the end of each module, further resources are recommended including community based options/programmes/resources. Goals are revisited each session. The modules are designed as a guide and should be incorporated with clinical skill and knowledge to ensure the program is person-centred. Aphasia ASK is to be delivered as individual sessions with only one participant with aphasia and their family member(s) involved at any one time. Follow-up monthly phone calls or visits (which ever method is suitable for the participants) will be made until 12 months post stroke. The follow up calls with revisit the participant goals set during the program and provide additional information and resources where necessary. An Aphasia ASK program manual has been written for the provider therapist and a separate aphasia friendly workbook has been written for the recipients. Recipients will receive the written materials prior to each session.</interventions>
    <comparator>A secondary stroke prevention program forms the content of the attention control package. It will be provided in a similar dosage (1 hour session per week for 6-8 weeks and follow-up monthly phone calls until 12 months post stroke) and similar format (written support materials, delivered to both patients and their family) to the Aphasia ASK intervention The information that will inform the modules will include:

There are no other inclusion or exclusion criteria for family member participants. 

People with aphasia must present with their first incidence of post stroke aphasia and will be excluded for the following reasons:
 1) aphasia as an etiology other than stroke, 
2) a history of recurrent depression (that is, three or more previous diagnosed episodes defined as needing to see a health practitioner for treatment - either psychotherapy or medication prescribed, confirmed by self-report), 
3) a current psychiatric diagnosis (for example, depressive disorder or anxiety disorder confirmed by medical record), 
4) current depressive symptoms upon screening with the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire Hospital Version-10  (score of 9 or more) or The Depression Intensity Scale Circles  (score of 3 or more), 
5) receiving treatment in a psychiatric setting, or 
6) enrolled in other aphasia or depression treatment studies.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were calculated for both primary outcome measures (ALA and SADQ-21). Power calculations on the ALA have been calculated from an intensive aphasia treatment study and an Australian longitudinal aphasia study. Power calculations on the SADQ have been calculated from the Cost analysis of the Communication and Low Mood (CALM) study. The ALA required a larger sample size compared to the SADQ-21, and therefore, the larger sample size required by the ALA was determined necessary to adequately power the study. To achieve a power of 80 % with a 5 % level of significance in comparing the two arms of the study (Aphasia ASK versus attention control - SSPIP), we need 186 patients (93 per arm) with an effect size of 0.367, computed using ALA data. The extent to which power is diminished by clustering was considered in relation to the design effect (DE) =1 + (m -1)r10, where m = the average size of a cluster and r is the intra-class correlation coefficient. Typically, intraclass correlation coefficients are small (&lt;0.02); thus a conservatively estimated intra-class correlation of 0.02 was used. A cluster size of 20 was chosen based on the feasibility of running the intervention, as well as the availability of patients with aphasia within clusters. Thus DE = 1+ (20-1)*0.02 = 1.38, and the total sample size required was calculated as 186 * 1.38  258. To account for an attrition rate of 25 % to the 12-month follow-up period, 344 patients would be needed (172 per arm).

Baseline characteristics of participating patients of the two arms will be presented and compared for any meaningful differences at baseline. Outcomes of interest will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Multilevel modelling using mixed models, which takes into account patients being nested within clusters, will be able to examine whether changes in the outcomes, which are on interval-scale, vary over time as well as across the two (Aphasia ASK and attention control- SSPIP) programs, after adjusting for the effects of any potential confounders (if any). In addition, attrition patterns across the two arms will be examined to determine randomness of missing data, and if required, multiple imputations will be implemented. All statistical analyses will be performed using Stata statistical software. An alpha level of 0.05 will be accepted as significant. The results of the statistical models will be presented in the form of regression coefficients, their 95 % confidence intervals, and effect sizes. The residuals of the fitted models will be examined to ensure that all required assumptions are met. The statistician completing the data analyses will be blinded to group allocation until analysis is completed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overarching aim of this study is to decrease the incidence of depressive symptoms for people with aphasia and their caregivers. The specific aims are to determine whether a tailored, early intervention program (Aphasia ASK) leads to better mood and overall quality of life outcomes than an attention control (a secondary stroke prevention intervention) at 12 months post-stroke in both patients with aphasia and their caregivers.</summary>
