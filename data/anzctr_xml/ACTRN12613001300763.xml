  <interventions>
    <interventions>An 8-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial (n=300) of adjunctive SAMe versus a combination nutraceutical in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). 

Participants take 2 tablets and 2 capsules orally each day for 8 weeks. 

Group A: SAMe (800mg/day) + cofactors folinic acid (500mcg/day) and vitamin B12 (200mcg/day); 

Group B: enhanced SAMe combination nutraceutical formulation consisting of SAMe (800mg/day), Omega-3 concentrate (EPA-esters 1000mg/day, DHA-esters 656mg/day), 5-HTP (200mg/day), zinc picolinate (30 mg/day) + cofactors folinic acid (500mcg/day), vitamin B12 (200mcg per day), vitamin B6 (200mg/day), vitamin E (40IU/day), vitamin C (60mg per day), and magnesium amino acid chelate (40mg per day). 

Treatment adherence will be monitored through tablet and capsule counts at fortnightly assessment sessions.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be initially screened by phone to assess their suitability for the trial, then invited to meet the trial clinician at The Melbourne Clinic in Richmond or the Brisbane Royal and Women's Hospital in Herston for a baseline screening interview. During this interview, potential participants will receive detailed information about the study and will sign a consent form. A thorough screening interview will then take place, and those who meet inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the trial. Enrolled participants will be allocated a medication pack number, to which a treatment arm has already been randomly assigned by a disinterested third party. Trial clinicians will allocate packs sequentially, stratifying groups for higher/lower depressive symptoms (MADRS &gt; 24). The colour, size, shape, and taste of the tablets and capsules, as well as their packaging, will be identical across treatment arms so as to conceal treatment allocation from participants and trial clinicians. The key linking the medication pack numbers with treatment arms will be maintained by the disinterested third party until data collection is completed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Medication pack number allocation to a treatment arm will be randomly assigned using permutated block randomisation by a disinterested third party. Trial clinicians will then allocate packs to enrolled participants sequentially, stratifying groups for higher/lower depressive symptoms (MADRS &gt; 24).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit a sample size of 300 participants (100 participants in each arm), with a projected loss of 15-20% based on our previous RCTs. The study is powered to detect a potential small to moderate difference between the SAMe and combination nutraceutical (CN) groups (using all data via intention-to-treat analysis). Based on a two tailed analysis with a=0.05, beta=0.80, and a critical F2,298 of 3.02, 300 participants are required to detect a difference in MADRS scale score between SAMe, CN and placebo groups (Cohens d effect size of 0.36 or greater). The sample size of 100 per arm is sufficiently powered to provide statistical difference between the SAMe and placebo groups. 

Analysis of data will be conducted with blinding to group allocations. The primary efficacy analysis will assess average treatment group differences for the primary outcome measure (MADRS) over the entire study period and use a likelihood based mixed-effects model, repeated measures approach (MMRM). Results from the analysis of dichotomous data (e.g. demographics and genetic data) will be presented as proportions (e.g. Relative Risks), with 95% confidence interval, and Fishers Exact p-value where appropriate. Non-parametric statistics will be used when assumptions for parametric methods are violated. Cohens d effect sizes will be calculated. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted using a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals. Data will be analysed using SPSS 22.0.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of SAMe versus a combination nutraceutical (SAMe + 5-HTP, EPA and zinc) as adjunctive treatments in adults (n=300) with major depressive disorder in an 8-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome measure is severity of depressive symptoms using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).</summary>
