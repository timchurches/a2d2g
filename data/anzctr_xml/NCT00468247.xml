  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A multicentre, open, RCT to assess the safety and efficacy of the Navigator Guided
      Circulatory Management System versus conventional care in post-operative cardiac surgery
      patients. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the real time acquisition and
      subsequent processing and display of data produced by the Navigator guided circulatory
      management system provides the clinician with appropriate data and guidance to achieve and
      maintain a prescribed target haemodynamic stability in the post operative patient when
      compared to conventional care in an Intensive Care Unit setting.</summary>
