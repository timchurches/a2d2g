  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the long-term safety of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) in
      preventing hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks when it is administered under the skin of
      subjects with HAE. The safety of participating subjects will be assessed for up to 54 weeks.
      The long-term efficacy of C1-INH will also be assessed. Each eligible subject will enter the
      treatment phase, wherein subjects will be randomized to treatment with either low- or
      medium-volume C1-INH. Subjects who have an insufficient treatment response during the study
      will be given an opportunity to undergo a dose increase. The study aims to enroll eligible
      subjects who completed study CSL830_3001 (NCT01912456). Subjects who did not participate in
      study CSL830_3001 may also participate, if eligible and if space permits. Subjects from the
      United States (US) who complete Treatment Period 2 will be allowed to participate in an
      Extension Period. During the Extension Period participating US subjects will continue to
      receive treatment with open-label CSL830 for up to an additional 88 weeks.</summary>
