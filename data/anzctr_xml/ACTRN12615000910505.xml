  <interventions>
    <interventions>Propofol 200mg/20ml.  The 200mg will be drawn up in to a 20ml syringe, the concentration being 10mg/ml.  It will be administered in up to 6 intravenous boluses, with the initial bolus being 4 ml (40mg) and subsequent boluses being 2 ml (20mg), so that the maximum dosage will be 14 ml (140mg).  Boluses will be administered 3 - 5 minutes apart depending on patient response, with administration ceasing if the headache is resolved (pain rating zero), if an unexpected adverse event occurs, or when the maximum dose is reached.  The amount given, and times of administration will be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo used will be Intralipid 20%. This is identical in appearance to Propofol and is available in 500ml bags.  20ml will be drawn up in to a 20 ml syringe.  It will be administered in the same bolus amounts over the same time periods as described for propofol and will cease when either the headache resolves or the maximum of 14 ml has been given.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% with headache resolution (pain score 0 on the Numerical Rating Scale) by one hour from initial treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One hour from intial treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% with significant reduction in headache (by two or more points on the 0 - 10 numerical rating scale)</outcome>
      <timepoint>One hour from initial treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% with mild residual headache only (1 or 2 on the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale)</outcome>
      <timepoint>One hour from initial treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% requiring additional analgesic medication for migraine. If the pain rating is not zero at one hour, additional medication will be offered as per a defined Rescue Medication Sheet, which sets out the usual current treatments depending on whether the residual headache is mild, moderate or severe.  Details of medication given, and response to this (using the numerical pain rating scale 0 - 10), will be recorded on the Rescue Medication Sheet.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One hour from initial treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% reporting that treatment had the desired effect for them, taken as the response to the question: 	
Did the medication have the desired effect?     Yes           No</outcome>
      <timepoint>One hour from initial treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% with continued migraine resolution post-discharge. This will be asked on telephone interview and will utilize the numerical rating scale (0 to 10).</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hours post-discharge from the Emergency Department.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% with adverse events. The most common is stinging at the intravenous injection site.  Drowsiness, transient hypotension and transient hypoxaemia are all possible with propofol, but not expected with the low dose boluses being used in this study.  Allergic reactions to either preparation, usually to the egg or soy products contained in the emulsion of both preparations are rare (less than 1 per 1000).  Presence of abnormal vital signs will be noted during drug administration, as will occurrence of stinging at the injection site.  Allergic reaction would also be noted at the time.  Given the short half-life of propofol, no adverse reactions related to propofol would be expected after discharge, but patients will be asked to report any symptoms they have at the follow-up phone call.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any time from initial treatment to 48 hours post-discharge.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute migraine is a common and often debilitating condition for which people often seek treatment in Emergency Departments.  A number of treatments have proven efficacy compared with placebo, including metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine and sumatriptan.  These drugs are reported to lead to headache resolution by 2 hours from initial treatment in about 60% of people.  Recent observational studies have suggested that propofol, a sedative and anaesthetic agent, may lead to headache resolution (migraine and tension type headache) by one hour from initial treatment in about 80% of people.  These studies have used regimens where incremental small doses of propofol (20 to 40mg) are given every 3 - 5 minutes until either the headache resolves, or a maximum dose of about 140mg has been given.  The mechanism of action remains unclear.  No studies to date have compared propofol with placebo in adults with acute migraine, which is important, since the placebo response has been reported in previous migraine trials to be up to 40% (although it is most often around 10%).  If this study does demonstrate that propofol is significantly superior to placebo, then studies directly comparing propofol with other agents will be warranted.</summary>
