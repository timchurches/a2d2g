Experimental: 1 - Stress reduction intervention

No Intervention: 2 - Standard care


Behaviour: Stress reduction intervention
In addition to standard care, patients in the intervention group will receive a one-hour individually delivered programme administered once by a psychologist at least 3 days prior to surgery. This session aims to reduce stress and involves teaching relaxation and guided imagery exercises. Patients are provided a CD (or audiotape)of the relaxation instructions to take home and practice once a day.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a stress reduction intervention prior to
      surgery can improve wound healing and recovery.The investigators hypothesise that patients
      who receive a psychological stress reduction intervention prior to surgery will report lower
      stress and higher perceived control, have lower stress hormones, better wound healing and
      better self-reported recovery than patients who receive standard care alone.</summary>
