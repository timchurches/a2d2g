    <interventions>Twenty five subjects with diabetic foot ulcer will be treated fortnightly with standard 20-minute wound care (debridement and normal saline dressing) first, to be followed by 10 minutes of shockwave therapy for a period of 6 weeks. A handheld shockwave device will be applied gently against the ulcer surface by treating podiatrist to deliver 300 + 100/cm2 impulses of shockwave at 0.11 mJ/cm2 energy flux density during which the participant may feel light vibration and then crossover for another 6 weeks on fortnightly standard wound care alone with total duration of the study period of 12 weeks.  Log of device use time will be utilized to monitor adherence of the shockwave therapy.</interventions>

    <sequence>The randomization list will be prepared by an independent statistician by the method of computer-generated random numbers for each treatment. Patients in each stratum will be assigned numbers using a central stratified randomization scheme designed to provide 1:1 of patients in the 2 groups. Patients will be randomized to initial standard care + shockwave to be followed by standard care alone for another 6 weeks. The other group will have first 6 weeks of standard care alone to be followed by 6 weeks of both shockwave therapy and standard care. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The appropriate sample size was attained by assuming an anticipated difference in wound healing time of 12% (=66 days from an assumed mean of 75 days for diabetic foot ulcer patients at week 12 between the intervention and control group and a within patient variability (standard deviation) of 10days. A power set to 80% yields a calculated sample size of 22 patients per arm. Adding an additional estimated attrition rate of close to 15% = 3 patients per arm leads to an overall planned sample size of 25 patients per arm, and 50 patients in total.

Descriptive statistics including frequency tables and graphs will be provided for all variables, as well as for the changes from baseline within each treatment and the differences between the treatment groups at each visit. All data will be analysed using SPSS Version 22. Tests for normality will be performed and based on the outcome, parametric or nonparametric tests will be employed to determine the differences between the groups. The results will be given as mean + standard deviation.  Chi-squared analysis will be performed for categorical variables and student T test or Mann Whitney U test will be carried out for continuous variables for parametric or non-parametric data respectively. ANOVA will be used for determining differences among multiple groups. A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) is a new technology in the care of chronic non-healing wounds. The technology delivers high-energy pressure waves into the wound thereby enriching the ulcer with adequate blood through formation of new blood vessels. It also inhibits infection with its antibacterial property. Furthermore, it stimulates the body to produce natural growth factors which helps in repairing the damaged tissues of the wound.  Recently, ESWT was reported to be effective in the initiation and acceleration of wound healing in various clinical settings including longstanding diabetic foot ulcers. The effectiveness of ESWT in wound healing, especially in treatment of diabetic foot ulcers has been demonstrated in numerous trials (1-2). It has been shown to be more effective value for money compared to hyperbaric oxygen therapy in management of chronic diabetic wounds (3). There are evidences demonstrating reduced length of stay for admitted patients when using this treatment model (3-4). Its safety profile has been proven in various studies (1-4). Numerous scientific investigations have been conducted on biological mechanism of action of ESWT in animals and humans and both proved to be safe and effective (5-6). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ESWT therapy achieves long-term healing results in diabetic wound care (7). Thus using this technology at The Townsville Hospital would likely improve the weighted activity unit per bed day figure for medical patients by increasing the total bed days saved, as that capacity will be filled by current access block / unmet demand of the chronic diabetic foot wounds at the hospital.  

In spite of these facts, ESWT technology has not been utilised in the care of diabetic foot ulcer patients in Australia in general and at The Townsville Hospital in particular. This is despite the fact that this technology is non-invasive, simple to use, well tolerated by patients, and only needs to be administered on fortnightly basis whereas even more invasive therapies need more frequent administration. Furthermore, ESWT is applied through an unfocused applicator which assures an almost painless treatment with no anaesthesia required and each therapy session only taking about 10 to 30 minutes. 

The main objective of this study was to evaluate wound healing rate and anti-inflammatory effect of shockwave therapy in subjects with diabetic foot ulcer at the Townsville Hospital, Australia.
