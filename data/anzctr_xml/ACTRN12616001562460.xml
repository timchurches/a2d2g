  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an exploratory, qualitative study, investigating the personal experiences of people living with severe asthma. Interviews will be performed on a one-off basis. This will involve a video and audio recorded interview that will be conducted in their own home. Each interview would go for approximately 1-2 hours. 
Using rigorous, systematic qualitative methods we will analyse transcripts from in-depth individual interviews, and use these data to publish in peer reviewed international  journals. Also, part of our study will include developing a visual web-based information resource for use by the public (information and support) and health professionals (education/training).  We are following the DIPEx methodology, that has been used for thousands of participants in the UK, several other countries, and has been used for six studies within Australia so far (on www.healthtalkaustralia.org). </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be included if they are over 18 years old and must be diagnosed with severe asthma.  Severe asthma is defined as asthma for which control can be maintained only with the highest level of recommended treatment or good control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>In line with standard qualitative research practice we will use a  maximum variation sampling framework, which is a purposive sample of approximately 30-50 people with severe refractory asthma, who will be recruited from different settings across Australia. Therefore, no formal sample calculations were performed. We aim for depth in our interviews and we will keep interviewing participants until no new themes have emerged.The methods used for this project are based on those established by the Health Experiences Research Group (HERG) at the University of Oxford and managed through the DIPEx UK Charity. We will use systematic and rigorous qualitative research methods and analysis, using a narrative illness methodology and thematic analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: 
Asthma is a common chronic lung disease and symptoms vary from mild to severe. Within the general population with asthma, approximately 5-10% suffer with severe asthma. People with severe asthma run the highest risk for acute and/or severe exacerbations and mortality, yet there is not much empirical data on how this affects the patients lived experience.  
 
Aim:  
Using the Database of Personal Experiences of Health and Illness (DIPEx) methodology we aim to explore the personal experiences of people living with severe asthma.  
 
Methods: 
Participants will be included if they are over 18 years old and must be diagnosed with severe asthma. A maximum variation sample of approximately 30-50 participants will be recruited from different settings across Australia. DIPEx methodology involves audio and/or video recording potential participants and encourages them to talk without interruption about all aspects of their experiences that mattered to them. The collected data will be transcribed and coded into categories and themes. These categories and themes will be based on areas that are identified as important to the participants. 
 
Significance: 
These stories will be used as a reliable source of information to educate students and health care professionals, and as an evidence base to inform person-centered care and future policy improvements to understand the concerns, meaning and priorities of a diverse range of people with severe asthma. The topic summaries, and selected video clips, will also be published on the website http://healthtalkaustralia.org</summary>
