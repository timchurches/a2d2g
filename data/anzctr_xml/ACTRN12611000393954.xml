  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women in the intervention group will receive ten sessions of acupuncture given twice weekly over the first two weeks then weekly for the subsequent six weeks, a total of eight weeks duration of treatment. Acupuncture will be administered by trained practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine who have five years of more clinical experience and are registered with the Chinese Medicine Registration Board. Six acupoints will be needled at each visit (Kidney 6, Kidney 7, Spleen 6, Conception Vessel 4, Heart 6 and Liver 3). Needles will be retained for twenty minutes and manually stimulated at ten minutes. No cointerventions are allowed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women in the sham group will receive ten sessions of sham acupuncture according to the same schedule as the intervention group. Sham needles are blunt and do not penetrate the skin. Six non-acupuncture points will be "needled" and "retained" for twenty minutes, again with manual stimulation at ten minutes.</comparator>

    <concealment>A research assistant will randomly allocate the participants to either real or sham acupuncture using a computer generated randomisation schedule, stratified by practitioner and blocked randomised. She will inform the practitioner of group allocation by SMS or fax, depending on the practitionerâ€™s preference. The group allocation will be indicated only by the point prescription to avoid unblinding should the participant inadvertently see the fax or SMS.</concealment>
