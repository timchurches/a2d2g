  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants undertake 8-12 weeks of computerised cognitive training (CCT) using a commercially available program (Cognifit).

The Cognifit CCT platform will be used by participants in the experimental treatment condition and includes 33 computer tasks designed to train specific cognitive domains.  The training protocol is individualised using an automated algorithm that allocates tasks to each individual, and task difficulty levels are adaptive such that they are determined based on the participants actual performance.

Participants will be instructed to complete training on three separate days each week. Each session will involve the completion of 9 computer tasks and will last approximately 30 minutes.  The intervention period lasts a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks based on participant preference.

Adherence to the intervention is monitored via a combination of detailed automatic login and performance records provided by CogniFit, as well as by participants recording each training session in a persona diary provided to them at the start of the intervention period. A dedicated research staff follows up all participants with fortnightly phone calls to provide further support and encouragement, as appropriate.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the active control condition will play the same games as participants in the experimental condition. However, these games (presented on an identical-looking platform) will not have two key features of the games in the experimental condition - namely, adaptive difficulty levels accross sessions, and individual tailoring of task selection based on one's cognitive profile. 

The training dose will be identical to that in the experimental condition. Participants will be instructed to complete training on three separate days each week, with each session lasting approximately 30 minutes.  The intervention period lasts a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks based on participant preference. Adherence in this condition is monitored using a combination of personal diary entries, and fortnightly phone calls, as in the experimental condition. No automatic login and performance records are available on this participants in this condition.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite global cognitive score on a neuropsychological assessment. The score will be the mean of Z scores of several recognised measures of memory, attention, language and executive function. The cognitive performance measures include the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Logical Memory (LM, Story A only), The Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), the L'hermitte Board, The SydBatt, Verbal Fluency (letter and category), Trail Making Test, Digit-Symbol Coding, and Sniffin Sticks (olfactory identification) </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be assessed at all three timepoints (baseline, post-intervention, and 12 weeks post-intervention)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Domain specific cognitive performance. Composite scores in the domains of episodic memory, executive functions/working memory, and language will be calculated on the basis of performance on untrained measures listed above (e.g., the mean of the standardised delayed recall measure on the RAVLT, RCFT, LM, and L'hermitte Board for the composite memory score). </outcome>
      <timepoint>This secondary outcome will be assessed at all 3 time points (baseline, post-intervention, and 12 weeks post-intervention).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective day-to-day memory capacity. This outcome will examine participants self-rating of the frequency of memory mistakes in day-to-day life (using the MMQ)</outcome>
      <timepoint>This secondary outcome will be assessed at all 3 time points (baseline, post-intervention, and 12 weeks post-intervention).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Caregiver burden and wellbeing. This will be assessed using the Zarit Caregiver Burden questionnaire and the Caregiver Distress scale in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This secondary measure will be assessed at all 3 time points (baseline, post-intervention, and 12 weeks post-intervention). </timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and who provide consent will be invited for the baseline evaluation at the Centre for Research on Ageing, Health, and Wellbeing. Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomised to one of two treatment conditions using a computer program. Randomisation will be conducted by a researcher who is not involved in any aspects of study recruitment, participant assessment, or intervention delivery. This same person will keep the allocation sequence concealed and will only provide the group membership to the person delivering the intervention upon commencement of the intervention phase. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be done separately to participants with and with without MCI. Within the MCI group, cluster randomization will be performed stratified by whether the person belongs to the group with or without mood-related symptoms. A randomization table created by computer software (computer sequence generation) will be used .</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>GPower software was used to make sample size calculations. To detect a moderate effect (0.5 SD difference between participants in the experimental and in the control group post intervention) on the primary outcome (global cognitive composite), 33 participants per intervention group are required (66 total). To account for an estimated 20% attrition rate, a total of 78 participants will be recruited. Mixed linear models will be used to assess each of the outcomes of interest with intervention group and time as the fixed factors, participants as the random factor, and group by time as the main interaction of interest. Planned comparisons will be performed between assessment outcomes immediately following the intervention completion (T1) and at baseline (T0), and between assessment outcomes at the follow-up assessment (T2) and those from immediately post-intervention (T1). All analyses will be conducted using an Intention to Treat (ITT) approach. In the event that randomisation results in unmatched groups with respect to demographic variables that may influence outcomes such as age, gender and years of education, these will be added as covariates to the analyses. In the event that other person characteristics (e.g., computer experience) are found to correlate significantly with an outcome, they will be added as additional covariates to the analyses. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mounting evidence indicates that cognition-based interventions for people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are effective in maintaining independence and increase patient satisfaction. Studies to date have primarily focused on clarifying intervention parameters associated with greater efficacy, such as duration and frequency. Less is known, however, about the contribution of health related variables to the outcome of cognition-based treatments. Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in people with MCI and are associated with greater impairment, excess disability, and worse outcomes.
Despite this, studies evaluating the efficacy of cognition-based interventions in persons with MCI tend to exclude patients with NPS. Understanding the contribution of NPS to the outcome of such interventions is important in terms of their application in clinical settings. A double-blind randomised controlled trial design is proposed to compare the efficacy of a cognitive training intervention between individuals with MCI, individuals with MCI and NPS, and individuals with NPS and no MCI. The outcomes of the study will inform the selection of candidates that have the greatest potential to benefit from cognition-based interventions, with implications for clinical practice.</summary>
