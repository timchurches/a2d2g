  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS) System (Apnex Medical )

Experimental: Treatment - The Treatment Arm is implanted with the HGNS System and therapy is turned on at 1 month post-implant.

Other: Control - The Control Arm is implanted with the HGNS System and therapy is turned on at 7 months post-implant.


Treatment: devices: Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulation (HGNS) System (Apnex Medical )
The HGNS System in an investigational device that includes three implantable components: a neurostimulator, a stimulation lead, and a respiration sensing lead. The HGNS System is designed to activate the muscles in the upper airway to help keep the airway open during sleep. The HGNS System is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe OSA in individuals that have failed or do not tolerate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy.
