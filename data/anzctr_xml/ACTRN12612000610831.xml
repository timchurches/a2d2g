  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm1: 
30 g Probiotic feta cheese containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 with the dosage of 5 Ã— 106 CFU to consume in the daily diet.

 
Extraction of a 30 g chicory root for daily consumption. 

Method of administration: Participants were asked to slice the root, boiling it with 4 cups of water. After 15 min of boiling, the remaining water was the suitable extract participants had to consume as a drink. 

Duration of consumption: 4 weeks

Arm2: Only the mentioned probiotic cheese without the chicory root extract. (All details same as Arm1).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: The purpose of current study is to evaluate the effect of Probiotic cheese and chicory root extract consumption on lipid profile during a 4 wk period. Design: It is a triple blinded parallel randomized controlled trial in Tehran, Iran. 30 volunteers aging 18  65 will participate. Participants will be randomly assigned into three 10-person balanced groups and consume 30 g Probiotic cheese containing Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 and Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 with extract of 30 g raw chicory root, daily (intervention 1), 30 g of Probiotic cheese (intervention 2) and none of the above (control group). Fasting blood samples and anthropometric measurements will be collected in the beginning and after the consumption period at the Pathobiology Laboratory Center and SRBIAU Nutrition clinic, respectively.</summary>
