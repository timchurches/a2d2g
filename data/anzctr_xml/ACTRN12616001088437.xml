  <interventions>
    <interventions>Drug: Locally produced Enalapril-Envas (Cadila pharmaceutical, Ethiopia)
Dose: 5-20mg. Participants in this study are those whose blood pressure is controlled with Enalapril. Therefore, participants will continue on the dose that they  are currently taking for the duration of the trial. For example, if the patient is taking 10mg, she/he will continue taking the same dose. The dose determination and follow up during the study will be made by the treating physician.  
Frequency: once daily in the morning
Duration: There are 3 pairs of treatment periods. Each pair of treatment period comprises 1 week of Envas and 1 week of EnaDenk -treatment crossover occurs weekly. Individual patients will take Envas for 3 treatment periods of 1 week each. 
Mode: Per oral
Adherence monitoring : To avoid treatment non-compliance, every week, there will be a drug adherence counselling session by the study nurse before drug dispensing. Moreover, every week, the study nurse will check pill boxes and ask questions if there are missed medications.  
Washout period: Participants will move straight on from treatment period 1 to treatment period 2 on consecutive days. To account for washout from the previous period, the first two days of BP readings in each treatment period will be discarded i.e. two days analytical washout period. </interventions>
    <comparator>Drug: Imported Enalapril-EnDenk (PharmaDenk, German)
Dose: 5-20mg. Participants in this study are those whose blood pressure is controlled with Enalapril. Therefore, participants will continue on the dose that they  are currently taking for the duration of the trial. For example, if the patient is taking 10mg, she/he will continue taking the same dose. The dose determination a nd follow up during the study will be made by the treating physician.   
Frequency: once daily in the morning
Duration: There are 3 pairs of treatment periods. Each pair of treatment period comprises 1 week of Envas and 1 week of EnaDenk -treatment crossover occurs weekly. Individual patients will take EnaDenk for 3 treatment periods of 1 week each. 
Mode: Per oral

    <statisticalmethods>This is an individual pilot N-of-1 trial. Analysis and outcome report will be made for each patient. Sample size calculation is not required to assess outcome of interest. However, the number of observations taken in each treatment period is important. Every day, Patients will take six BP measurements (3 in the morning and 3 in the evening) at home. 
To assess the success of this pilot study, a total of 30 patients will be included. This is made based on literature.  
Differences in means will be compared using a paired Students t test as appropriate. Significance will be set at P = 0.05. Standard statistical procedures will conducted using the R-package. 
Possible side effects of the study medication and any serious adverse events will be tabulated for individual patients. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Drugs are  originally produced by one pharmaceutical company and are considered to be the perfect comparator products. When the patent expires, other companies can produce a similar product with comparable efficacy and safety. These drugs are called generic drugs. Currently, CADILA Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Ethiopia) produce the Enalapril (Envas) in Ethiopia.  However, to ensure its effectiveness,   the comparative efficacy and safety of this drug against the original products should be tested.. Currently, appropriate tests (bioequivalence tests) to prove effectiveness are not available in Ethiopia. 
Many patients with hypertension take Enalapril to control their blood pressure. Using locally produced Enalapril is a cheaper option for patients with hypertension. However, as mentioned above, there is no evidence that proves that locally produced Enalapril works as well as the original (standard) Enalapril.  The aim of the trial is to test whether locally produced Enalapril works as well as imported Enalapril in the treatment of hypertension.</summary>
