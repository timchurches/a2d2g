  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies indicate that men who have sex with men (MSM) have a high prevalence of anogenital
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and increased risk for HPV related anogenital lesions
      including anogenital warts, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (the abnormal proliferation of
      cells) and anal cancer. Currently in Australia, HPV vaccine for men is not covered by
      programs. This study will explore the prevalence of HPV infection and sexual behaviours
      associated with varying prevalence of HPV infection.

      The investigators will survey 200 MSM aged 16-20 years who just started their sexual life.
      The investigators will use a questionnaire to collect information of socio-demographic
      characteristics, lifetime sexual experience, recent sexual experience, the most recent sexual
      contact, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/HIV history and testing history, HPV
      knowledge and attitude, smoking/alcohol/drug/circumcision. The investigators will also
      collect oral, penile and anal samples as well as blood samples to test for HPV DNA and
      antibody.

      The study will include four visits in the 12-month period. In each visit, participants will
      be asked to fill a questionnaire and provide oral, penile and anal samples as well as blood
      samples.</summary>
