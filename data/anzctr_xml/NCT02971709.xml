    <interventions>Behaviour - Shade Sail

Experimental: Shade Sail - Shade sails were constructed over passive recreation areas in public parks between pretest and posttest. Shade sails maximized available shade in the passive recreation areas from 11 am to 3 pm in the summer.

No Intervention: Unshaded Control - Passive recreation areas in public parks that remained unshaded at pretest and posttest.


Behaviour: Shade Sail
Shade sails had powder-coated or gout galvanized steel poles and a lighter colored shade cloth to transmit visual light. The shade cloth met Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) ratings to reduce UV under the shade cloth by 94%. The final shade sail designs and sizes were determined with input from parks department staff and complied with all local engineering, building, and planning codes. Shade sails exceeded the minimum safety requirements for strength (for wind and snow load), resistance to light degradation, and UV transmission. The design minimized climbing access points and hazards to adjacent activities.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Observed Use of Passive Recreation Area by Adults - Any use of each passive recreation, assessed by observing each passive recreation areas for 30 minutes on four weekend days between 11 am and 3 pm when forecast high temperatures were had forecast high temperature were between 72째F/22째C and 95째F/35째C over a 20-week period during two summers (pretest summer, posttest summer) by trained research assistants. Observations were suspended during rain.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Passive recreation areas had to be located in public parks in Denver, Colorado USA or
             Melbourne, Victoria Australia metropolitan area.

          -  Parks had to contain at least two unshaded PRAs and be administered by the study
             municipalities,

          -  Passive recreation areas had to meet the definition of a passive recreation area,
             i.e., areas for sitting/standing while socializing, preparing/eating a meal, watching
             or coaching sports, watching a concert, taking a class, or waiting, or areas where
             people stroll (walk slowly) for sightseeing while observing outdoor displays (e.g.,
             festivals, gardens, zoo exhibits).

          -  Passive recreation areas had to be in full sun (i.e. no shade) at pretest.

          -  Passive recreation areas had to contain a space where a shade sail could be
             constructed, i.e., free from underground or above ground obstructions, relatively
             level, and large enough to accommodate the shade sail.

          -  Passive recreation areas had to be approved by parks department staff for shade sail
             construction.

          -  Adults had to appear to be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Adults had to be in the public parks.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Use of shade when outdoors is recommended by health authorities worldwide to reduce overall
      exposure to ultraviolet radiation. However, expensive physical environment changes are often
      required to provide shade and may be effective only when health education has created a
      social environment that motivate shade use. A multi-national research team will explore the
      use of built shade in passive recreation areas within public parks and compare use of built
      shade between the United States and Australia. The specific aims of the project are to: a)
      introduce built shade structures (i.e., shade sails) in public parks in Denver and Melbourne;
      b) compare the use of passive recreation areas with and without built shade; c) compare the
      change in use of the passive recreation areas in Denver and Melbourne after introduction of
      built shade, and d) examine the relationship among social environment and physical features
      of the environment and built shade.</summary>
