  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves communicating information prior to IV cannula insertion without using words with emotional negative content such as "sharp", "hurt" "sting". Ie. "I am about to insert the drip".

The intervention will be administered within 5 minutes of the IV cannulation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control communication uses typical language currently used prior to insertion of IV cannula ie "I am about to insert the drip which is sharp and will sting a bit".

The control will be administered within 5 minutes of the IV cannulation.</comparator>
