  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25mg in 0.05ml) every six weeks as required. Visual acuity and central macular thickness will be compared against these measurements that were taken at baseline (ie. no controls).

Repeat injections will be performed in those with macular oedema if there is: 
a) Persistence, relapse or increase of macular oedema involving the centre, or central macular thickness, demonstrated by examination and OCT
OR 
b) A decline of best corrected visual acuity of 5 letters (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Visual Acuity) below the best visual acuity after treatment

Repeat injections will be performed in those with uveitic CNV if there is:
a) A decline of best corrected visual acuity of 5 letters (ETDRS LogMAR) below the best VA after treatment, OR
b) An increase in OCT central retinal thickness of at least 100Âµm from the lowest thickness reading, OR
c) New macular haemorrhage, OR
d) New area of classic CNV, OR
e) Evidence of persistent fluid on OCT at least one month after the previous injection

Injections will be ceased if:
1. There is no improvement in either the visual acuity or central macular thickness after 3 injections in comparison to baseline measurements (i.e. Treatment failure), OR
2. Central macular thickness &lt; 220 microns with no evidence of subretinal or intraretinal oedema as measured and assessed on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), OR
3. Best corected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Visual Acuity is better than or equal to 6/6

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Macular oedema, or swelling around the macula, results in decreased vision. It is termed "refractory" when it does not adequately respond to the usual treatment methods. It can occur with conditions like diabetic retinopathy or uveitis. Without effective treatment, vision loss can progress and become permanent. Early studies have suggested that a new treatment called Avastin (Bevacizumab) may be effective in treating this type of macular oedema, however further research is required to confirm this. 

Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) is a condition where abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye and causes blurred or distorted vision. Without treatment, vision loss may be quick and severe. There are many causes of CNV, the most common being Age Related Macular Degeneration. Uveitis can also cause this condition. As Avastin (Bevacizumab) has been found to be useful in the treatment of CNV due to AMD, it is expected that it will be useful in cases of CNV from uveitis.

The purpose of this project is to assess whether Avastin (Bevacizumab) is both safe and effective in the treatment of the above conditions, namely:

1. Macular oedema due to diabetic retinopathy 
2. Macular oedema due to uveitis
3. Choroidal neovascularisation due to uveitis</summary>
