  <interventions>
    <interventions>16 weeks of progressive resistance training (weight lifting), three times per week, 45 min per session on eight machine-based resistance exercises in a circuit format:  seated leg press, knee extension, knee flexion, chest press, lat pulldowns, overhead press, biceps curls, triceps extension (Cybex International, Medway, MA).  Initial weights starting weights determined as a percentage of the extrapolated 1-repetition maximum (1RM) as previously described by Brzycki et al (1993). Thereafter using a graduated periodized regimen where subjects progress from 65% to 85% of their extrapolated 1RM over the course of phase 1, two sets at 85% during phase 2, three sets at 85% during phase 3, and a continuation of three sets at 85% until conclusion of the intervention.  Perform 6 to 8 repetitions with a 1 minute rest between sets.  Workloads increased by 5% when subjects can perform 10 repetitions.  Onsite exercise leaders supervised by lead clinical exercise physiologist encourage exercise at a a perceived exertion of hard, or 15, on the Borg scale.</interventions>
    <comparator>16 weeks of aerobic training: 3 times per week, 45 min per session, performing a graduated progressive cycle ergometry (Life Fitness, Schiller Park, IL) protocol in parallel with the resistance training group.  Gradual progression of 5 to 10% workload to minimise delayed onset muscle soreness. Subjects progressed from 65 to 85% of their heart rate reserve and encouraged to sustain a perceived exertion of hard on the Borg scale.  Heart rate and blood pressure monitored and recorded at peak steady state workloads.  Workloads (watts) and duration at peak intensity increased to accommodate subjects improved fitness levels.  Direct supervision by exercise leaders and lead clinical exercise physiologist.</comparator>

      <outcome>Anthropometric indices (Height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, waist/hip ratio:

Height and weight measured to the nearest 0.1cm and 0.1kg on a standard hospital-grade stadiometer and scale, respectively.  BMI calculated  from standard formula: kg/m2.  Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1cm at the end of normal expiration and the midpoint between the lower costal margin and the iliac crest using, and hip circumference taken with feet together at the widest protuberance of the buttocks, using a retractable steel tape measure (model F10-02.

      <outcome>haemodynamics (Heart rate (HR) and Blood Pressure  (BP)):  Seated blood pressure was measured in duplicate on the left arm after 5 minutes rest on a standard hospital-grade sphygmomanometer.  Heart rate measured by counting radial pulse for a full 60 seconds. Exercise pulse determined manually on all subjects, but corroborated by use of pulse monitor on aerobic equipment.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dynamic upper and lower body strength:  Due to level of obesity and deconditioning in this population and because strength was only determined as a means to identify starting weights, a 1-Repetition Max (1-RM) was deemed unnecessary. Instead a 10RM as determined by the protocol set forth by Brzycki (1993) was more appropriate to minimise delayed onset muscle soreness and possibly minimise early dropout.</outcome>

The SF36 quality of life questionnaire is comprised of 36 questions which encompass 8 different areas of physical and mental health and is useful for comparing the burden of different diseases, differentiating the health benefits produced by different treatments, and in screening individual patients.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A small number of multidisciplinary lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention and weight reduction have been conducted in obese Polynesian (Maori and Pacific Islands people) populations but to date none were designed to isolate the specific impact of the exercise component.  To our knowledge, no structured exercise trials have been conducted in obese Maori and Pacific Islands people with type 2 diabetes.  Therefore, the purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to evaluate whether high intensity resistance training (weight lifting) or aerobic exercise can improve glycemic control and associated cardiometabolic aberrations in sedentary Polynesian people with morbid obesity and diagnosed type 2 diabetes; and (2) to determine which type of exercise is more effective for improving glycemic control given an equivalent training intensity and duration.   Because resistance training has been shown to improve overall muscle strength and metabolism, we hypothesised that this form of exercise would result in greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin</summary>
