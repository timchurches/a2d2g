  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether adding the drug, Tocilizumab, to standard transplant immunosuppression is safe and effective at preventing acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 70 years of age and are undertaking HLA-matched allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HPCT). Trial details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive a single dose of 8mg/kg Tocilizumab by a 60 minute intravenous infusion (administered via the vein). This will occur one day before your HPCT. Participants in the second study group will receive a placebo treatment. Participants will be assessed for up to 2 years to determine the incidence of GVHD.
