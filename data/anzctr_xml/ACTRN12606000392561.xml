  <interventions>
    <interventions>We planned to test 11 healthy men on 4 randomly assigned nights including two active nights and two control nights. There will be at least one week interval between any two nights. Overnight polysomnography will be recorded for all the 4 nights.                                                                                                                                                                                                  In the two active nights, 30mg controlled-release oral morphine (MS Contin) will be given to each subject 4 hours before sleep. Upper airway resistance will be measured prior to the first active night sleep and prior to the matching control night sleep. Arousal and ventilatory response tests are not performed during the sleep of the first active night nor on the matching control night. During the second active night and its matching control night, arousal and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia during stage 2 sleep (stable sleep) would be tested.</interventions>

      <timepoint>The responses would be tested during the second active night and its matching control night. During the 2 nights, the responses would be tested once for hypoxia and once for hypercapnia during stage 2 sleep (stable sleep).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep-disordered breathing and Upper airway resistance</outcome>
      <timepoint>Upper airway resistance would be tested just before bed time on the first active night and its matching control night. </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep-disordered breathing would be tested continuously throughout that two nights.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Opioids are commonly used for acute and chronic pain management and as an adjunct to anaesthesia. Prescribed opioid-related deaths account for most of non-illicit drug poisoning deaths in America. Death from opioids is nearly always due to respiratory arrest. However, no study has assessed opioid effects on neural-chemical control of breathing during sleep, when respiratory drives are already naturally blunted and protective voluntary breathing is not possible. The present study may meet this gap in knowledge. In addition, this study may reveal whether the potential abnormalities in neural-chemical drive may progress to sleep-disordered breathing.</summary>
