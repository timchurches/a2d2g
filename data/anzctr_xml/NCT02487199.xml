    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of participants with post-treatment relapse within 12 weeks following end of treatment in each arm - Virologic relapse after treatment is defined as confirmed plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) &gt; the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) between the end of treatment and 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug among participants who completed treatment with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment.</outcome>
