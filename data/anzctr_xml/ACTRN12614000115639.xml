    <interventions>BLZ-100, a targeted fluorescent molecule that belongs to a class of products known as Tumor Paint (Trademark) bioconjugates designed to illuminate cancer foci to facilitate surgical resection. BLZ-100 will be administered as a single, intravenous dose approximately 48 hours before scheduled excision of skin cancer lesions.  The study consists of two parts: a dose escalation and a dose expansion.  In the dose escalation part of the study, the dose of BLZ-100 will be increased in cohorts of subjects until either the highest pre-specified dose level is reached or unacceptable side effects are noted.  The planned dose cohorts are 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 mg BLZ-100. Escalation to a higher dose cohort will proceed when the previous dose has been found to be reasonably tolerated based on available safety data for all subjects enrolled in the cohort. Upon completion of the dose escalation, a dose level shown to be well-tolerated will be selected to enrol subjects in the dose expansion part of the study.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety as assessed by vital signs, adverse events (AEs), physical examinations and laboratory safety parameters. The possible side effects of BLZ-100 in humans are unknown.  Data from animal studies suggests possible adverse events could include allergic reactions, decreased activity/slowed movements or sleepiness.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Vital signs:  5 and 60 mins and days 3, 5 and 8 post-BLZ-100 administration.
Adverse events:  Continuous assessment for at least 7 days (study day 8) post-BLZ-100 administration.
Physical examinations:  Days 3, 5 and 8 post-BLZ-100 administration.
Laboratory safety:  Days 3 and 8 post-BLZ-100 administration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Concentrations of BLZ-100 in the blood will be measured by collecting several blood sampled over time.  The blood will be analysed by chemical means to determine the BLZ-100 concentration and these data will be used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the safety of a fluorescent marker (BLZ-100) used to visualise cancer cells in adults with skin cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male or female aged 18 years or above who has been diagnosed with non-melanotic skin cancer (e.g. non metastatic basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas or amelanotic melanoma) and are scheduled for surgical excision. Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and the extent of surgical removal of the tumour is directly related to patient survival. However, it is often difficult for surgeons to distinguish tumour tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumour cells that have spread from the original tumour site. In addition, in some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal tissue around the tumour to prevent adverse effects on function. In this study all participants will be administered BLZ-100 intravenously (i.e. directly into the vein) approximately 48 hours before scheduled excision of cancer lesions. BLZ-100 is a targeted fluorescent molecule that belongs to a class of products known as Tumor Paint (Trademark) bioconjugates designed to illuminate cancer cells to facilitate surgical resection. We hope that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualise the edges of the tumour and small groups of cancer cells in real-time, as they operate.</summary>
