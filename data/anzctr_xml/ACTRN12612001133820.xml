  <interventions>
    <interventions>7 home visits, approximately 1 hour in length, when the child is 1 week, and 1, 3, 5 (all by lactation consultant), and 5.5, 7 and 9 (by trained nurse or other health professional) months of age providing anticipatory guidance to assist mothers to exclusively breastfeed to 6 months, then introduce complementary foods from 6 months following a modified baby-led weaning approach (BLW). This uses the concepts of BLW (infant self-feeds rather than parent spoon feeds, families eating together) but using resources that address concerns with BLW that have been raised by health professionals - including the potential for growth faltering, poor iron status, and choking.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both control and intervention groups will receive their usual "Well Child" care from their chosen provider. This usually consists of 6-7 home or clinic visits (from 6 weeks to 2 years of age) from trained health professional, targeting various issues including breastfeeding, eating, sleep, parenting, and physical activity. The intervention group will receive the additional 7 home visits detailed above.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Once consent has been obtained, an online randomisation programme will be used to randomise participants into BLISS or control groups. After allocation, participant blinding will not be possible. However, all outcome assessment data will be collected by research personnel blind to group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>As parity and SES may significantly affect the primary outcome, a stratified block allocation will be used (parity 1 vs. &gt;1, and NZDep low, medium, high) with a random block length that will ensure that participants are allocated to groups in the desired ratio so that there are final group numbers of approximately 150 in the BLISS and control groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS (BLISS) study will determine whether a novel approach to infant feeding using foods that infants can feed themselves encourages self-regulation of energy intake and prevents the development of overweight without detrimental effects on iron status and growth. 300 families will be randomised to Control (standard advice from birth-12 months), or BLISS (additional guidance and support to delay introduction of solids to 6 months, followed by infant self-feeding from 6-12 months). Growth, energy self-regulation, diet quality and iron and zinc status will be measured at 12 and/or 24 months. A baby-led approach that encourages children to eat in response to internal hunger cues rather than external cues from their environment should encourage better energy self-regulation and improved weight outcomes at 12 months that are maintained at two years of age.</summary>
