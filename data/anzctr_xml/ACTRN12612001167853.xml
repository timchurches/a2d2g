  <interventions>
    <interventions>Inhaled dry powder mannitol 400mg (10 x 40mg capsules) twice daily for 12 days as an adjunctive treatment during hospitalisation for an acute pulmonary exacerbation. Capsules were placed in a special delivery device which pierced the capsule and the contents were inhaled.</interventions>
    <comparator>Inhaled Placebo. The placebo used was large particle mannitol which is not respirable and therefore simply lodges in the upper respiratory tract on inhalation. This was also given as 10 x 40mg capsules twice daily for 12 days. As with thr active drug, capsules were placed in a special delivery device which pierced the capsule and the contents were inhaled.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To see if the addition of dry powder mannitol as an extra therapy during hospitalisation for an acute pulmonary exacerbation in young people with Cystic Fibrosis improves outcomes from that admission. Our hypothesis is that it will improve not only clinical status at the time of discharge but also measures of lung function.</summary>
