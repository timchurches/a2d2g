  <interventions>
    <interventions>A mandibular advancement splint will be used by participants in the study. The splint itself is not under examination in this study, but is being used to determine patient characteristics that predict treatment outcome.
A fully adjustable two-piece splint MAS will be used (SomnoDent, SomnoMed Ltd) with known high efficacy will be used. Fitting of the appliance is followed by an acclimatisation period (4-8 weeks) during which the mandible is incrementally advanced until the maximum comfortable limit is reached (under the supervision of the treating dentist). 
Participants will be recruited for approximately 2 years and will be observed during the study for 4-8 weeks. They will be referred back to their own sleep physician and dentist for continuation of their treatment.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common sleep-related breathing disorder. Oral appliances worn during sleep to gently hold the lower jaw in a forward position are a novel treatment often appealing to patients. Currently use is limited as there is no means to determine if patients will be treated successfully. There is a need for simple, clinical methods to predict which patients are best suited to this new treatment approach and this project will address this by developing such a method.
This study will use a combination of data measured from patients with obstructive sleep apnoea including sleep characteristics, lung function and facial dimension measured from photographs to produce a virtual model to predict whether or not a patient will respond to treatment with an oral appliance.</summary>
