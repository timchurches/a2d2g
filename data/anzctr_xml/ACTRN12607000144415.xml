  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial investigating the effect of treatment of very low birthweight infants with a probiotic combination (ABC Dophilus Infant Powder) on the primary outcome measure, late onset sepsis.                                                                                                                                                                                                      The intervetion ABC Dophilus infant powder contains 1x10^9 of total organisms, consisting of 3 bacterial strains (Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidus, Streptococcus thermophilus). This is presented in a powder form in a jar, which is opened, 0.5 teaspoon mixed with 3ml feed and given daily by mouth/nasogastric tube, from the start of milk feeds until dischared home or term (40 weeks post menstral age), whichever comes first. </interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo will appear identical to the probiotic and consists of maltodextrin.</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), death, length of the primary hospital admission including proportion experiencing prolonged hospital stay, number of courses of antibiotics, number of days until full oral feeds established (120 ml/kg). </outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be measured at EDD.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight, length and head cirucmference</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at the 6 and 12 months corrected age, and hospital admissions during the first year will be measured at 12 months corrected age.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Blood (1-2 ml) to measure immunoglobulins, number of Tregs, and IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Will be taken at 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A maternal questionnaire will be used to report atopic eczema, but will also note food allergies, and wheeze from term until 12 months corrected age.</outcome>
