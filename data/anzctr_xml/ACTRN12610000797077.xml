  <interventions>
    <interventions>glulisine and glargine insulin and continuous glucose monitoring. Glargine insulin is to be administered subcutaneously (SC) once daily for 24 weeks. Glulisine is to be administered subcutaneously (SC) once daily initially for a maximum of 20 weeks. Dosing of the insulin will be dependent upon the subjects glucose levels. Subjects are to be randomised to continuous glucose monitoring or conventional glucose monitoring. The frequency of the monitoring will be according to a pre-specified schedule which will take into account the subject's glucose levels.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research project is to evaluate a plan of action designed for general practitioners and practice nurses to safely and efficiently start patients with Type 2 diabetes on insulin injections who have high sugar (glucose) levels despite taking tablets.

To be eligible to take part in this study subjects must have Type 2 diabetes; be aged between 18-80 years old; are on at least two diabetes tablets at the highest doses that they are able to tolerate  and that these doses have been unchanged over the last 3 months, or based on the opinion of the general practitioner who normally cares for the patient insulin, is required to ensure ensure their health health. The subject must have a HbA1c (a simple laboratory measurement on blood that reflects average glucose levels in a person's blood over the previous three months) between 7.5-10.5% which indicates less than satisfactory diabetic control; and must have never taken insulin before. Women of childbearing age must not get pregnant during the study. There will be up to 142 subjects recruited for this study across 16 sites in Victoria Australia only.

Participating subjects will be commenced on insulin initially with a single injection of an insulin (Glargine) which lasts for 24 hours. The dose will then be adjusted to match the subjects needs. If necessary, because sugar levels rise after meals despite providing an appropriate dose of the long acting insulin, a second injection of a short acting insulin (Glulisine) will be added in to coincide with the subjects biggest meal for the day. 

A second purpose of this study is to determine if a new device that provides information regarding a patients glucose levels continuously is helpful in guiding treatment that results in better control of diabetes when compared to current methods for monitoring glucose levels by finger-prick readings. 

The study will be looking to see if the protocol used improves sugar levels as measured by a fall in HbA1c which will be measured at the start of a subject's involvement in the study, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.</summary>
