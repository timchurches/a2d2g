  <interventions>
    <interventions>Estimating corporal injuries through previous quantitative and qualitative measurements after a physiotherapy treatment. 
Carrying out a survey to the different testers: cream´s characteristics to clinical staff, patients and students of physiotherapy.
Before applying the cream, several studies will be carried out:
- Active mobility test
- Passive mobility test
- VAS scale
- Algometer measurement
When talking about the materials, creams, massage tables, gloves and sheet will be used.
The intervention will be delivered individually face to face by therapist with minimum 5 years experience. The duration will be 20 minutes per session once a day for two weeks. The timepoint is once a day Monday to Friday. The type of massage is massotherapy. The intervention will occur in urban clinics. The cream will be applied in treated body areas.
The massotherapy tecnique will begin with a superficial effleurage, followed by a deeper massage, moving deep tissues, muscular and conjunctive tissues.
The name of the cream is Physiorelax TM with Helenalin and the name of the placebo cream is the same than the other one but without the active ingredient. Physiorelax TM is in charge of supplying the cream.
After analysing the surveys´ results, physiotherapists measure if the cream is suitable for the patient or not and on the other hand they show if it is good for themselves.
Taking into account the results, we will carry out a more complex survey through general public.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Massage may produce, by the pressure done on tissue, a decrease in muscle stiffness, an increasing of blood flow by an increase of arteriolar pressure, as well as an increase muscle temperature due to rubbing. Depending on the techniques, we would expect an increase or decrease of neural excitability measured by Hoffman reflex (neurological mechanism); changes in parasympathetic activity measured by heart rate; blood pressure and heartbeat; and changes in hormone levels measured by cortisol levels following after a massage relaxation produced by the massage (physiological mechanisms).

It seems appropriate, to carry out a study to determine whether there is a significant improvement in patients who suffer from some type of skeletal muscle pathology and received a massotherapy treatment with the cream under study. Moreover, it seems clear that an analysis of the main factors affecting the purchase of massage creams should be performed, from a standpoint of general consumer and from the perspective of the therapist.</summary>
