    <interventions>Active attention bias modification training and exposure therapy versus a control attention bias modification condition and exposure therapy. Participants recieve one individual session (3 hours) of exposure therapy. The session involves assisting participants to sytematically and gradually face their fears. Half the participants will complete 1 session of attention bias modification training immediately prior to the exposure therapy session that involves training attention towards positive stimuli (happy faces) and thus away from threat stimuli (angry faces) while the control condition will have their attention trained equally to positive and threat stimuli. The attention bias modification training is delivered via a computer. Children will see happy-angry adult face pairs for 500 ms after which time the face pairs are replaced with an asterisk probe behind one of the faces. In attention training to positive stimuli, the probe always follows the happy face, in the control attention training condition, the probe follows the angry face and happy face equally. Children press one of two keys on the keyboard which side  left or right  the probe appeared on the screen. They will complete 160 trials, lasting approximately 15 min. The exposure therapy is delivered next by trained psychologists.</interventions>
    <comparator>Children in the control condition will respond to the probe presented on either the left or right of a computer screen which will be presented equally after threat and positive stimuli. Children will receive the 3 hour exposure condition.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects are consecutively allocated to either the active or control condition according to a pre-determined  schedule generated via www.randomization.com by an independent senior research assistant who had no ongoing involvement in the project. The identity of each condition in the schedule is concealed by using alternative codes that did not identify which condition is active v control. This corresponds to the name of each attention training file stored on the clinic computer for administering attention training prior to exposure. This means that neither the study coordinator advising therapists of the condition each subject is assigned to according to the randomization schedule, nor the therapists administering the attention training condition know which condition they are administering. None of the CIs on this project have a copy of the randomization schedule. In the event that unblinding is required, a copy is stored in locked storage within the School administration. Therefore, knowledge of what type of attention training subjects have been assigned to is concealed from the research team, the study coordinator and the therapists involved. New therapists are assigned at each assessment time-point and no record of the attention training condition assigned is retained in hard copy of subject files.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this trial is to examine whether Attention Bias Modification Training can augment a single session of graded exposure therapy in children and adolscents with a specific phobia. Cognitive-experimental studies show that anxious children display biased attention allocation to threat stimuli. This is a robust finding in anxious adults and consistent with cognitive models of anxiety. Attention Bias Modification Training is a promising treatment for anxiety disorders delivered via a computer.</summary>
