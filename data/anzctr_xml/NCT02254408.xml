  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>Baseline; Day 9</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Proportion of participants who develop a lower respiratory tract complication (LRTC) through Day 28 - An LRTC is defined as one of the below as determined by the adjudication committee :

LRTI due to unusual pathogens
Lower respiratory tract complication of unknown etiology</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants who develop respiratory failure (of any cause) requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) or all-cause mortality through Day 28. - Participants will be considered to have an event if either condition is met:
Participant develops a respiratory failure (of any cause) requiring mechanical ventilation (invasive or noninvasive) or;
Participant dies prior to or on Day 28</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Day 28</timepoint>

             reaction, direct fluorescence antibody, respiratory viral panel assay, or culture)
             using an upper respiratory tract sample collected = 6 days prior to Day 1

          -  New onset of at least 1 of the following respiratory symptoms for = 7 days prior to
             Day 1: nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, or sore throat, or worsening of one of

    <summary>This study will evaluate the effect of presatovir on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) viral
      load in autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients with an acute
      RSV upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), the effect of presatovir on development of
      lower respiratory tract complication, being free of any supplemental oxygen progression to
      respiratory failure, and pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of presatovir.</summary>
