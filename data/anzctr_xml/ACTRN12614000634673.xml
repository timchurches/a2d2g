  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete four experimental trials, each consisting of a maximal self-paced half-marathon. Trials will be completed using a double blinded, Latin squared design and will be separated by a minimum of 7 days. Two trials will be commenced in a fed state and two in an unfed state (fasted state following an 8-10 h overnight fast) and in each condition participants will be administered either Nicotinic Acid or a placebo given in capsules. A standardised diet will be provided for the 24 h preceding each trial, before participants report to the ACU laboratory at 07:00 h. Upon arrival participants will have a cannula inserted into the antecubital vein in the arm to enable blood sampling (6 mL). During the fed trials participants will be provided with a standardised high carbohydrate breakfast (2 g/kg carbohydrate, 30 g protein and 10 g fat) 2.5 hours prior to commencing the half-marathon, followed by either Nicotonic Acid (total of 15 mg/kg body mass) or placebo capsules (no active compounds). The fasted trials will be completed under the same conditions but without the consumption of the standardised breakfast. During the fed trials participants will also be provided 60 g of carbohydrate per hour at 20 minute intervals using a commercially available sports drink. The volume of water consumed during the first trial will be recorded and repeated for all subsequent trials. There will be 7-10 days between each trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects will be given a visually matched placebo (containing maltodextrin) in the same quantity and at the same time points as the Nicotinic Acid would be provided. </comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects will  volunteer for the study and be provided with an information sheet explaining all 4 experimental trials. If the volunteer wishes to take part in the study they will complete a consent form. They will complete an initial health screening prior to any experimental trials. The subject will be blinded to which trial they are completing each time as the capsules of placebo and Nicotinic acid will be visually identical.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each trial will be coded with a number by an individual that is not directly part of the testing procedures. A random on-line number generator will then be used to assign subjects to certain trials. This will ensure complete randomisation of the trials.</sequence>

Data will be analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).  A two-way ANOVA for repeated measures will be used to compare time points and trials.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endurance training stimulates many muscular adaptations such as an increase in mitochondrial content and enzyme activity, which enhance an athletes ability to utilise both fat and carbohydrate as energy sources during exercise. 

When exercising continuously at low to moderate intensities (50-60% of maximal aerobic capacity [VO2max]) the energy for muscular work comes predominately from fat-based fuels, with less reliance on carbohydrate-based fuels (Romijn et al., 1993). However, athletes typically compete at higher intensities (&gt;80% of VO2max). At such work rates, there is a reliance on carbohydrate-based fuels for oxidative metabolism. For example, OBrien et al (1993) reported 97% of energy from carbohydrate-based fuels when running a marathon (42.2 km) in 2 h 45 minutes, in comparison to a 68% contribution when running the distance in 3 h 45 minutes. 

Whilst well-trained individuals may be more efficient at utilising fat-based fuels during training, at race pace in events lasting 90-100 minutes carbohydrate-based fuels are the major source for muscle metabolism. However, to date few investigations have determined the contributions of fat and carbohydrate to fuel metabolism during races lasting ~90 minutes. 

The current study will quantify substrate utilisation during simulated half-marathon time trials and determine if blocking fatty acid metabolism (lipolysis) will impair performance in well-trained runners.

We hypothesise that blocking lipolysis by administration of Nicotinic Acid during a half-marathon time trial will not affect performance. </summary>
