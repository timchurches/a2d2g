  <interventions>
    <interventions>An appraisal of the two main outcomes in donor-site management (pain and time to healing) using two different dressings. Duoderm (a hydrocolloid and the current treatment of these wounds in our centre) and AWBAT-D (a new biosynthetic skin substitute specifically designed to expedite healing of these wounds). AWBAT-D consists of a wound surface of woven nylon matrix to which procine type 1 collagen fragments are bonded (matt), with a porous silicone outer surface (shiny). AWBAT-D is applied matt side down, shiny side up. The material is overdressed with Acticoat nanocrystalline silver polyester dressing. AWBAT-D remains in situ until healing occurs when it detaches spontaneously after 10-14 days. If one patient has two donor sites which allow them to be their own control (ie both materials will be applied, one to each site), the site to receive AWBAT-D is allocated by randomisation table. Duoderm is applied to the other site (adhesive side to wound). There is always sufficient gap between the materials to prevent cross-contamination by wound exudate</interventions>
    <comparator>The control dressing is Duoderm (specified above). This hydrocolloid is the current dressing for donor sites on our unit. Most patients (single small donor sites) are randomised to receive one or the other dressing. Large donor sites can be randomised to allow the patient to be their own control also. Duoderm has an adhesive side which is applied to the wound surface. Repeated changes of Duoderm are usually required since the hydrocolloid intreaction with wound exudate creates a thick yellow fluid and Duoderm's impermeability means that this fluid stays under the dressing (until it leaks out from the sides and soaks the outer dressings). Duoderm change frequency is determined by clinical need, not at set toimepoints, and will generally require 3 - 6 changes before healing occurs in 14 - 21 days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Discomfort experienced during healing (whether intrinsic to the wound, pain with dressing changes, pain with therapy/mobilisation). This is assessed by a pain score (vocalised analog score) 0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily from application until healing (expected within 14 days)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to re-epithelialisation of donor-site.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily from application until healing (expected within 14 days). Epithelialisation can be said to occur when the 'finely wrinkled' shiny, dry appearance of neo-epithelialisation is seen to cover the entire wound as opposed to the wet, shiny unhealed areas.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to compare the rate of healing and your perception of pain associated with the treatment of your skin graft donor site. The donor site is the wound left behind when a skin graft has been taken. It is frequently a very uncomfortable wound which usually heals by itself in 10-14 days. Two different types of dressing are being studied. One dressing is currently used typically for donor site care in burn patients on the Burns Unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (DuodermÂ®). This dressing is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for sale and use in Australia. AWBAT-D is approved by the Federal Drugs Administration for use and sale in the United States, but in Australia can only be used currently as part of a clinical trial (like this one). The decision regarding which dressing you will receive will be 'random'. If you require two separate donor sites, both materials will be used (one on each site.</summary>
