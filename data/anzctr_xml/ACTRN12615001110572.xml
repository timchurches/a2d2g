  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine  (artesunate 4 mg/kg body weight + amodiaquine 10mg/kg body weight once daily for 3 consecutive days) and artemether+lumefantrine (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine in a tablet) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection.. The doses of artemether+lumefantrine is based on weight bands: one tablet to those weighing 5-14kg; two tablets for 15-24 kg; three tablets for 25-34 kg and four tablets for greater than or equal to 35 kg;  once daily for 3 consecutive days.. The treatment will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. These two artemisinin-based combinations will be tested separately. The patient will be given either artesunate+amodiaquine or artemether+lumefantrine. Both of these drugs will be tested in each site. Eligibile subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 28 days.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients aged between 6 month and 11 years with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with artesunate+amodiaquine or artemether+lumefantrine and monitored for 28 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations.

Patients will enrolled sequentially to the two drugs: in each site patients will be enrolled for artesunate+amodiaquine until the sample size is reached and then patients will be enrolled into artemether-lumefantrine. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Currently the treatment failure rates to artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine in the study area are assumed 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients per test drug and per site must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study for each drug and each site. 

Excel WHO tailored database will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine  and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in two health centres in Pointe-Noire, Congo

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of the first-line and second-line treatments.

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine  for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.

Study Sites: study will be conducted in two health centres in Pointe-Noire City: district hospital of Tie-tie  and Integrated health Centre of Mbota 

Study Period: The study will be conducted from August 2015 to February 2016.

Study Design: A one arm prospective study for each drug combination.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged between 6 months and 11 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection will be enrolled.

Sample Size: 88 patienst per drug per site. For the two sites abd two test drugs a total of 352 patients will be enrolled.

Treatments and follow-up: artesunate+amodiaquine (daily dose for 3 days) and artemether+lumefantrine (twice daily for 3 days) will be given.

Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.

Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
