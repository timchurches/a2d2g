Other interventions - Conventional treatment

Experimental: 1 - Radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation:
Subjects assigned to the catheter AF ablation strategy will undergo ablation within 48 hours after baseline evaluation. The aim of the procedure is to achieve isolation of all Pulmonary Veins (PVs) and to restore sinus rhythm. Only radiofrequency catheter based AF ablation is permitted; other methods, like cryoablation, ultrasound and laser, are not permitted in this study.
Before ablation, a transesophageal echocardiogram must be performed in order to rule out presence of atrial thrombi.
Anticoagulation should be initiated, or continued, for at least six months post ablation. Six months after successful ablation and in absence of any recurrence of AF, antiarrhythmic drugs should be discontinued.

Active Comparator: 2 - Conventional treatment:
Subjects assigned to the conventional treatment strategy will be treated according to current guidelines for the management of patients with chronic heart failure and/or atrial fibrillation. Efforts to maintain sinus rhythm in this study arm are recommended.
Anticoagulation will be initiated, if not already started, and maintained throughout the study according to current guidelines.


Treatment: surgery: Radiofrequency ablation
Radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation

Other interventions: Conventional treatment
The best medical treatment according to the ACC/AHA 2005 Guideline Update for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Heart Failure in the Adult and the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for Management of Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. The
      incidence and prevalence of AF increase exponentially with increasing age and AF is
      associated with higher mortality, more frequent hospitalization, and lower quality of life.
      Furthermore, AF is often associated with heart failure. The majority of AF is initiated by
      ectopic foci found primarily in the pulmonary veins. It was shown that catheter ablation of
      those veins could eliminate episodes of AF. In patients with heart failure, catheter ablation
      could improve cardiac function, symptoms and quality of life. It remains still unknown
      whether AF ablation is more effective than conventional treatment in terms of mortality and
      morbidity.</summary>
