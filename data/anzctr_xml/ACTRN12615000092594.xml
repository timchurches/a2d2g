  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the study will perform whole body vibration therapy (WBVT) four times a week for 20 weeks. Each training session consists of three 3 minute WBVT with three minute rest breaks between each WBVT. Participants will weight bear (stand with or without aid) on a vibration plate that moves rapidly ( 12-22Hz) up and down over a small distance ( up to 10 mm) generating vibration stimulus. The vibration causes the muscle in the leg and truck to contract. Training sessions performed at schools are supervised by a physiotherapist. Training sessions performed at home are supervised by parents/caregivers with orientation and weekly visits from physiotherapist.</interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if:1)They have a fracture within 8 weeks of enrolment, pregnancy and acute thrombosis, muscle or tendon inflammation, renal stones, discopathy or arthritis. 2) There is a history of clinically significant organic disease or findings on physical examination, which in the opinion of the Investigator would prevent the patient from completing the study. 3)There is a history of using any of the following medications, regardless of dose, for at least 1 month, within 3 months of enrolment: anabolic agents, glucocorticoids (does not include inhaled glucocorticoids) or growth hormone. Participants will not receive Botulinium toxin injection throughout duration of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with other motor disabilities such as spina bifida, genetic motor disorders and injury related motor disorders have reduced muscle mass, impaired mobility and low bone density (osteopenia). While low bone density and fracture risk are multifactorial, muscle mass and weight bearing are two of the major factors affecting bone density. Therefore, one of the major focuses of therapy in poorly mobile children is to increase muscle mass and power, thereby increasing mobility, weight bearing and bone health. Unfortunately, there is a void in therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing muscle mass, muscle function as well as osteopaenia in these children. Whole body vibration training (WBVT) has the potential to fill this therapeutic void. WBVT studies in healthy adults and postmenopausal females have been shown to enhance muscle power and mass when used alone or when added to standard exercise regimens.  By maintaining muscle mass and bone mineral accrual during growth; WBVT can maximize mobility and bone strength into adult life improving both mobility and quality of life.  The proposed study aims to determine the effect of 20 weeks of WBVT on muscle and bone health in adolescents with heterogeneous locomotor disability.</summary>
