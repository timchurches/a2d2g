         17. Subject has untreated coronary artery disease, which in the opinion of the treating
             physician is clinically significant and requires revascularization.

         18. Subject has documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%.

         19. Subject is in cardiogenic shock or has hemodynamic instability requiring inotropic
             support or mechanical support devices.

         20. Subject has severe peripheral vascular disease (including aneurysm defined as maximal
             luminal diameter &gt;5 cm or with documented presence of thrombus, marked tortuosity,
             narrowing of the abdominal aorta, severe unfolding of the thoracic aorta or thick [&gt;5
             mm], protruding or ulcerated atheroma in the aortic arch) or symptomatic carotid or
             vertebral disease.

             subjects requiring 27 mm valve size, or severe iliofemoral tortuosity or calcification
             that would prevent safe placement of the introducer sheath.

         22. Current problems with substance abuse (e.g., alcohol, etc.).

         23. Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not
             reached its primary endpoint.

         24. Subject has untreated conduction system disorder (e.g., Type II second degree
             atrioventricular block) that in the opinion of the treating physician is clinically
             significant and requires a pacemaker implantation.</exclusivecriteria>
