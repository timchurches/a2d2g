    <interventions>Arms                                                Assigned interventions
Experimental Arm A. -"Nitro-Dur" 2.5mg daily, 24 hours, to single specified foot
Experimental Arm B. - "Nitro- Dur" 1.25mg daily, 24 hours, to single specified foot
Placebo Comparator  Arm C. - Placebo patch daily, 24 hours to single specified foot
Control Arm D. - No treatment
The patches are applied once daily by the participants in the study, and the trial subject's ability to do this is checked on the first measurement visit, when they are shown how to apply the patches and their ability to do this is observed. Each subject participates for a 6 month period of daily patch treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo Arm C. 
Placebo patch is visually almost identical to 1.25 mg "Nitro- Dur" patch using the same adhesive but with no drug content.
Control Arm D. 
No treatment but monthly monitoring as for all study arms</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1.	All study subjects who have met the inclusion criteria are allocated a sequential study number.

2.	Numbered envelopes are prepared with the study subject's numbers on the outsides of the envelopes

3. This study contains 4 treatment groups. They are as follows;- 
         1. High dose
          2. Low dose 
           3. Placebo and 
             4. Control

4.	Small paper chits, with the group numbers 1-4 are prepared in quantity adequate for the number of eligible subjects at each intake.

5. An intermediary person, not involved with the study will place these previously numbered chits in to the numbered envelopes in accordance with a random order.
This random number sequence is provided by the statistician involved with the study using Fisher's random number tables.

6. To achieve balance in the numbers of participants per group, the numbers 1 to 4 will be randomised in sets of four, and allocated to groups of four consecutively-numbered envelopes according to the randomised order. A separate randomisation is used for each group of four envelopes.

7. A witnessed scrutineer, independent of the study will then open the envelopes and record the allocated group for each study participant.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Charles Sturt University is carrying out a research project on foot circulation in 2012-13. This is to determine if angina patch medication can help people with poor circulation to their feet.

There is evidence to suggest that this patch treatment may be useful for many people by improving circulation to their feet and possibly also reducing pain and nerve damage associated with ischemia and diabetes. Reduced circulation to feet can be associated with problems such as foot ulcers, infection and amputations. The study involves about 100 volunteers who use a small dose patch on one foot and are monitored for the effects of this over 6 months of use. The effects on the circulation, the nerve function, wound healing and on foot pain in both feet will be checked.
This study has the approval of the Charles Sturt University Human Research Ethics Committee.

The study subjects are participating with the knowledge and approval of their general medical practitioners.

This study should provide answers to the questions of who can benefit from this treatment and the ideal ways to use this patch medication to improve circulation to feet. The study will be helping the growth of understanding in this important area. This is likely to lead to improved prevention and treatment options.</summary>
