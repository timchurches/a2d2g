    <interventions>Interventional study comparing 'new' citrate tubes with conventional fluoride tubes for measuring venous plasma glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test in pregnancy.  Pregnant women will have blood drawn into three test tubes at each time-point (0-hour, 1-hour, and 2-hour) of their routine oral glucose tolerance test taken between 24-28 weeks' gestation. The usual fluoride tube, the 'new' citrate tube, and a gel tube for the reference glucose.  </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will see if new blood tubes (citrate tubes) are better than the usual tubes (fluoride tubes) to test glucose levels.  All pregnant women are offered a test for gestational diabetes (GDM) at 24-28 weeks.  This is usually with a glucose challenge test (GCT) and / or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).  At present, we collect blood samples for these tests into fluoride tubes.  

We know that glucose levels may fall in the fluoride tubes in the first hour after the blood is taken.  This is important, as there is usually a slight delay between blood collection and laboratory testing of glucose levels. This can result in the measured glucose level being lower than it really is in the body.  We might then miss some women with GDM who have a falsely normal result.  In non-pregnant people, the new citrate tubes give results that are more accurate. No one has studied the new tubes in pregnancy.  We will compare the new citrate and usual fluoride tubes with a third way of testing glucose that measures the glucose level straight after the blood sample is taken.   This third way of testing glucose is the best, but it is not in everyday use as it takes a lot of time to do properly. 

We think that the new citrate tubes will be better at detecting GDM than the current system.  Missed and untreated cases of GDM can harm the baby.  If we show that the new citrate tubes are better, then changing to these tubes could mean that we miss fewer women with GDM in the future.
