  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two groups of study were made: 
- Group A was composed by patients with a conventional drainage (24Fr medovations straight thorax tube).
- Group B was composed by patients that had a soft silicone drainage (24Fr BiovacTM round silicone fluted drain). 

Silicone drainages are softer and each of their sections has a different shape, longitudinally slotted in the proximal sections that work through capillary action, and round-shaped in distal sections, in order to avoid any possible obstruction. In early studies their main inconvenience  the complications that appeared when evacuating air where there is a persistent air leak. Passively aspirational conventional drainages were considered the most suitable option for patients with a small air leak and the actively aspirational ones for treating patients with a major air leak. After Lung resection one Or two drainages are inserted for 3 Or 4 days. The silicone drainage is used in cardiothoracic surgery and general surgery. 

The  number of days that drainage have to stay depend of x-ray and this decision is taken by  thoracic surgeon</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The pleural drainages main objective is to restore the negative pressure in the pleural cavity and evacuate the liquid and air remaining after surgery, apart from allowing an early detection of possible complications. The first person to use them routinely in post thorax surgery patients was Lilienthal in 1922. Since then, several types of drainage have been created and today the most commonly used is the semi-rigid plastic drainage with active or passive aspiration, whose main inconvenient is that, since they are rigid, they cause pain after surgery, not allowing the patient to move in the early days and making it difficult for them to get back to their ventilatory dynamics. So it increases the length of the hospital stay. Because of this, soft silicone drainages were introduced, given that the patients adapt to them better but, despite this, they have not been widely spread due to a lack of studies that confirm their usefulness for both liquid and air drainage.
Silicone drainages are softer and each of their sections has a different shape, longitudinally slotted in the proximal sections that work through capillary action, and round-shaped in distal sections, in order to avoid any possible obstruction. In early studies their main inconvenient was the complications that appeared when evacuating air where there is a persistent air leak. Passively aspirational conventional drainages were considered the most suitable option for patients with a small air leak and the actively aspirational ones for treating patients with a major air leak. 
This is why a randomized clinical trial was performed so we can determine the usefulness of soft silicone drainages in post-operative thorax surgery.
