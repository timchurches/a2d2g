  <interventions>
    <interventions>The surgery involves the implantation of an artificial lens inside the eye that replaces the focusing power of the natural lens that has surgically removed as part of cataract surgery. The study device (HARMONI MODULAR Intraocular Lens Implant System) includes a base component and an optic component which allows optic exchange after the primary surgical procedure. A standard implant is a single piece (no components). 
This implantation of the study device occurs in one eye while the other eye receives a commercially available artificial lens. The primary implantation procedure takes about 5 minutes but the entire cataract procedure takes about 30 minutes, typically performed under topical or local anesthesia by an ophthalmic surgeon. An optic exchange may be performed 3 months after the primary surgery to adjust the subject's visual function. This procedure takes about 15 minutes under the same anesthetic method and also performed by an ophthalmic surgeon. The implant package label will be collected on the CRF.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size of this feasibility study is first calculated based on ISO 11979-7:2014. The HMIOL offers the optic component exchange. Another objective of this feasibility study is to assess the safety of the HMIOL optic exchange procedure with respect to its potential impact on the corneal endothelium. The required sample size is 44 HMIOL-exchange eyes with available ECC data at pre-exchange and 3 months post-exchange.  Based on literature review, the expected rate of non-optimal refractive outcome is expected to be up to 50% of subjects enrolled.  Therefore, a sample size of 100 to 200 HMIOL-implanted eyes will have enough statistical power for the ECC hypotheses.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The HARMONI(Trademark) Modular Intraocular Lens Implant System is an implantable artificial lens used to replace the natural lens that has been surgically removed as part of cataract surgery. The study lens is unlike a standard lens which is a single piece. The study lens has a base component and an optic component. The removable optic component allows optic exchange after the primary surgery to adjust the patient's visual function. 
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of HARMONI(Trademark) IOL (HMIOL) implantation and assembly in subjects undergoing cataract surgery. It also aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the HMIOL optic component exchange procedure (performed 3 months following primary cataract extraction) </summary>
