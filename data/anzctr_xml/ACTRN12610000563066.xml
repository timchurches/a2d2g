  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a one treatment arm study, where Estradiol valerate, will be given as a daily oral dose of a 1 or 2 mg tablet for 8 weeks prior to scheduled hysterectomy. An initial trial of 5 patients with 1 mg dose will be undertaken to determine if this low dose is sufficient to regenerate the endometrium. If inadequate, the 2 mg dose will be used. 

If the patient is already on hormone replacement therapy (ie 1 mg oral estradiol valerate, 1 mg oral micronized estradiol, 0.325 mg oral conjugated equine estrogens), the progestin component will be stopped and the patient will continue with the original estrogen alone for 8 weeks prior to hysterectomy</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Postmenopausal women who have not had a period for &gt;12 months who are scheduled to undergo hysterectomy for treatment of their underlying clinical condition, usually for pelvic organ prolapse but may include other indications (eg fibroids, menorrhagia). 

Women already on hormone replacement therapy will be recruited and if appropriate, the estrogen component will be changed to estradiol valerate without a progestogen.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Dr Anna Rosamilia will identify potential eligible participants seeking treatment for their urogynaecogical problem at Southern Health, Cabrini or Waverley Private Hospitals. A urogynaecologist is required for obtaining participation as it is necessary for her to diagnose that the patient requires a hysterectomy as part of the treatment for her clinical condition. Furthermore, a gynaecologist is required to determine the suitability of potential participants with respect to exclusion criteria for treatment with estradiol valerate (Progynova) and subsequent monitoring of these participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase 4 clinical trial is to determine whether estradiol valerate (1 or 2 mg daily for 8 weeks prior to hysterectomy) will regenerate the endometrium from postmenopausal women sufficiently to enable endometrial mesenchymal stem cells to be isolated from a biopsy taken during surgery just prior to surgical removal of the uterus. It is a proof-of-principle study to determine if endometrial stem cells can be isolated from postmenopausal women for potential autologous use in tissue engineering  as a construct for pelvic organ prolapse repair surgery.</summary>
