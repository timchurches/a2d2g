  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two current models of care will be employed during the intervention period and they are described below:

a) Hospital Model of Care ( HMoC):
Patients who receive the HMoC will receive the following services:
1.	Full nutrition assessment as per departmental standards 
2.	Nutrition care plan developed and implemented during the hospital admission. Discretionary referral to the ambulatory care dietitian.
3.	All the Dietary Education provided during hospital admission
4.	Long term care plan developed and managed by the hospital dietitian.
5. Time allocation is determined by the needs of the patient but is usually in the range of 60-90 minutes per admission.

b) Ambulatory Model of Care ( AMoC):
Patients who receive the AMoC will receive the following services:
1.	Full nutrition assessment as per departmental standards 
2.	Nutrition care plan developed and implemented during the hospital admission and immediate referral to the ambulatory care dietitian.
3.	Minimal Dietary Education provided during hospital admission.
4.	Long term care developed and managed by the ambulatory care dietitian.
5. Time allocation is determined by the AMoC dietitian but will be in the range of  3-6 monthly visits and these take approximately 30-60 minutes.

Process
1.	During the intervention period the hospital dietitians providing the service to these wards will assess all patients referred using a standardised nutritional assessment tool. If the patient is identified as either at risk or malnourished they will be offered a six month check up after the leave hospital. If the patient accepts this service they will also be screened for eligibility into the study. 
2.	If patients are eligible for inclusion into the study they will be approached by staff member who does not work on these wards and they will discuss the research study and provide and invite then to participate. If they elect to participate their names will be given to the allocation officer.

3.	Details on all patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be forwarded to the allocation officer (AO). This AO will randomly allocate these patients to one of the two models of care. Once allocation has been completed the hospital dietitian will be notified as to what model of care their patients will receive for the next six months.

4.	If their patients are allocated the HMoC , they follow the inpatient HMoC protocol as outlined in a).

5.	If their patients are allocated the AMoC they follow the inpatient AMoC protocol as outlined in b). This model of care requires the ward dietitian to liaise with ambulatory care dietitian during their patients admission in hospital. However, once the patient is discharged from hospital all care is managed by the ambulatory care dietitian.</interventions>

    <concealment>This study followed a stratified randomisation process. We used sealed opaque envelopes that each contained a number generated from a computerised randomised number generator program. A second separate random number generated list was created for those patients identified with a chronic airways limitation disease as per stratification randomisation procedure ( ).
A staff member, not involved directly in the study was assigned the role of Allocation Officer. Their task was to allocate on a daily basis during the week  all eligible patients and notify the hospital dietitans and the community dietitans when appropriate. Any admissions on the weekend were randomised first thing on the following Monday morning. They also kept a record of patient details and assigned allocation in the study database. If  the assignment  was for the  HMoC , this subject’s assessment details are returned to the hospital dietitian and if it was an AMoC assignment the community dietitian was provided with the patient details.  Both groups received identical hospital care from the hospital dietitans but in addition to the usual care the AMoC group received co-ordinated after hospital care and this long term management program commenced as soon as they were admitted into the study. The community dietitan introduced themselves to the patients during their hospital admission and explained the nutrition care service and organized an after hospital appointment. This was arranged according to the needs of the patient i.e. in the patient’s home or in a local community health facility.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized controlled trial comparing intensive ongoing dietetic management vs usual hospital care, using an intention to treat protocol. Those patients that volunteered were randomly allocated to either the hospital model of care(HMoC) or Ambulatory model of care (AMoC). The HMoC intervention consists of dietetic management throughout the hospitalisation period with referral to other healthcare providers upon discharge ( such as the local community doctor or  community support groups or private dietitian). The AMoC intervention consists of the same dietetic management throughout the hospitalization period but with formal requirement to provide ongoing support from a team of  community based dietitians for up to 6 months after discharge. The primary outcome measures will be ; the change in  nutritional status, evaluation of the patients dietetic management goals, assessment of the quality of the patients diet and patient level of satisfaction with the service provided. The secondary outcome measures collected will be mortality, readmission rates and total bed days occupied during the six month study period,</summary>
