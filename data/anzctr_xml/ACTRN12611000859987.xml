  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A:
We shall be providing sleep and mood information in a psychoeducational intervention (interactive slide presentation) in a group setting and booklets about sleep, relaxation and babies' sleep to first time parents in the third trimester. Due to parental time restraints we are intending to provide only two 1.5 hour sessions as research has shown that one session can be almost as effective as 4 sessions. The group sessions will be run by a Sleep Psychologist and will consist of groups of 4-10 couples or individuals. These participants will also receive a phone call at 3 and 6 weeks following delivery to monitor their progress and answer any questions they may have. Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline (prenatal), 6 weeks, 4 months and 10 months following delivery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Our control group will consist of first time parents-to-be, who will not attend the psychoeducational session but will receive information about sleep hygiene, relaxation and babies sleep. They will receive a phone call at 3 and 6 weeks following delivery to monitor their progress. This group will also complete the same questionnaires as Group A at baseline (prenatal), 6 weeks, 4 months and 10 months following delivery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep quality as indicated by scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index, Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. We hypothesise that the group receiving psychoeducation will have better sleep quality overall than the control group.

On approaching analysis, we realised that we had selected four questionnaires to measure the concept of sleep as primary outcomes. Therefore it should be noted that we will now be using the Bonferonni-Holm correction in order to share the 5% error rate between these questionnaires for our primary outcome</outcome>
      <timepoint>Prenatal, 6 weeks, 4 months and 10 months post natal.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mothers depressive symptoms as assessed by the Edinbugh Post Natal Depression Scale and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. We hypothesise that the group receiving psychoeducation will have lower depressive symptoms than the control group</outcome>

Measured through open ended queries on a generic questionnaire administered pre and post intervention. This generic questionnaire is not validated at present.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Experience of bonding demonstrated through scores on the Being a Mother &amp; Bonding Scale (BaMB) which assesses the experience of motherhood. We hypothesis the psychoeducational group will have lower scores compared with the control group.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep is commonly disturbed during pregnancy and following childbirth. Even individuals who have been healthy sleepers will notice a change in their sleep patterns during pregnancy. Given the high associations between sleep deprivation and depression amongst insomnia patients and depressed patients, it is important to note that sleep deprivation may be one factor that contributes to a greater propensity for women to become depressed in the post-natal period compared to other periods in their life. Post Natal Depression (PND) is common yet rarely acknowledged until after the full onset of symptoms negatively affecting all family members. The aim of the current study is to educate and prepare first time parents about sleep and sleep management with a new baby. First time mothers attending prenatal classes will be approached during the last trimester of their pregnancy and randomised to either a sleep psychoeducational intervention or treatment as usual. The primary aim of this project is to determine the efficacy of a brief pragmatic sleep intervention in improving sleep management and reducing depressive symptoms or prevalence of PND in first time mothers compared with treatment as usual.</summary>
