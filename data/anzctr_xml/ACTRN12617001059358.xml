  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approximately 21 eligible patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled into two cohorts.  
In the first cohort, nine (9) subjects will receive 1mg/kg of ipilimumab every 6 weeks and Nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity or a maximum of 12 weeks.
The second cohort of twelve (12) subjects will receive 0.3mg/kg of ipilimumab every 6 weeks and Nivolumab 3mg/kg dosed every 2 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity or a maximum of 12 weeks. 
Chort 1 and Cohort 2 will not be enrolled concurrently. Cohort 2 shall proceed after review of all Cohort 1 Day 8 data to identify if the study end point has been met.
Nivolumab &amp; Ipilimumab are administered intravenously in clinic at the study sites under the review of study doctors and nurses to ensure this is correctly administered and to review for any adverse reaction. When administered in combination Nivolumab is infused first followed by Ipilimumab on the same day.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of Nivolumab in Combination with Ipilimumab on biochemical and physiologic functions in Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a histologically or cytologically confirmed, metastatic or locally advanced solid tumor for which no standard therapy exists or standard therapy has failed. 

Study details
Approximately 21 eligible patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will be enrolled into two cohorts. 
In the first cohort, nine (9) subjects will receive 1mg/kg of ipilimumab every 6 weeks and Nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity or a maximum of 12 weeks.
The second cohort of twelve (12) subjects will receive 0.3mg/kg of ipilimumab every 6 weeks and Nivolumab 3mg/kg dosed every 2 weeks until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity or a maximum of 12 weeks. 

The investigators seek to identify/confirm circulating pharmacodynamic biomarkers that correlate with immune activation. </summary>
