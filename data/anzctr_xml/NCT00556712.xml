      <outcome>Time to Deterioration in QoL (Data Cutoff 17 May 2008) - The median time, in weeks, from the date of randomization until a clinically meaningful decline from BL in total FACT-L or death, whichever occurred first. Total FACT-L score was defined as the sum of the TOI, SWB and EWB of the FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB + FWB + LCS), SWB and EWB scores were obtained from 7-item (6-item in the case of EWB) questionnaires from the FACT-L V 4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms on a scale from 0-4, where 0 = "not at all" and 4 = "very much." Higher score indicated more severe symptoms. A clinically meaningful decline in FACT-L score was defined as at least a 6 point decline from BL. Participants without a clinically meaningful decline in TOI at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the last FACT-L assessment. The 95% CI was determined using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</outcome>

      <outcome>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) Scores (Data Cutoff 17 May 2008) - Total FACT-L score=sum of TOI, SWB, and EWB of FACT-L questionnaires. TOI (PWB+FWB+LCS), SWB, and EWB scores obtained from 7-item (6-item for EWB) questionnaires from FACT-L V4. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale 0-4; 0="not at all" and 4="very much"). Higher score=more severe symptoms. The 7-item LCS assessed symptoms such as shortness of breath, loss of weight, tightness in chest. Participants responded to questions assessing symptoms (scale: 0-4; 0="not at all" and 4="very much"). Scores from 0-35; higher score=more severe symptoms. The 27 items of FACT-G were scored in the following domains: PWB (7 items, total score 0-28), SWB (7 items; total score 0-28), EWB (6 items, total score 0-24), and FWB (7 items; total score 0-28), higher scores=better QoL. Participants responded to items on 5-point Likert scale (0="Not at all" to 4="Very much"; total score: 0-108). Higher score=better QOL.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This 2 arm study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Tarceva,
      compared with placebo, following platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced,
      recurrent, or metastatic NSCLC who have not had disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
      during chemotherapy. Following 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy, eligible patients
      will be randomized to receive either Tarceva 150mg po daily, or placebo daily. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression; the target sample size is
      500+ individuals.</summary>
