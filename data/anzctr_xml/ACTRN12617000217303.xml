  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who are randomly allocated to the intervention group will receive one session of 30 to 60 minutes of SNAP brief intervention, which aims to improve participants health, specifically through preventing them from returning to Smoking, improving their Nutrition through healthier eating, reducing or ceasing Alcohol consumption and increasing Physical activity. 

A Clinical Psychologist Consultant with 25 years' experience designed the SNAP intervention for this trial based on the theoretical model of Motivational Interviewing.  Four research assistants who are trained by the Clinical Psychologist Consultant and have passed the qualification assessment will deliver the intervention face-to-face in a prison interview room after the baseline interview, which is within two weeks before the participants' release date. An illustrative SNAP pamphlet will be given to the participants to facilitate the intervention.

The SNAP intervention will focus on Smoking in an attempt to maintain abstinence after prison release. The delivery of the SNAP intervention relies on the 5As framework, which is adopted in the SNAP guide by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP): 
1.	Ask (identify risk factors for smoking and affirm choice not to smoke)
2.	Assess (assess the level of motivation and their readiness to change) 
3.	Advise (provide feedback, advice and motivational interviewing based on readiness level), 
4.	Assist (develop a strategic and risk management plans and provide support for self-monitoring) 
5.	Arrange (refer to special services, offer Quitline phone counselling information, arrange follow-up with GP). 

Participants identified as having other risk factors will receive advice on how to modify their risk as per below:
1.	Poor Nutrition: Give brief advice according to Australian Guide to Healthy Eating and refer to eatforhealth.gov.au website. 
2.	Hazardous drinking: Referral to drug and alcohol services.
3.	Physical inactivity: Give brief advice based on Australian's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines. 

At the end of the intervention, participants will receive a pre-release bag which contains:
- Australian Guide to Healthy Eating posters
- Australian's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Adults (18-64 years) posters
- Quitline posters and magnet
- My Quitbuddy App Card
- Follow-up card with 'My Health, My Family, My Pocket.' printed on the back.

Participant engagement underlies the success of the SNAP intervention. Therefore the intervention is designed to be a client-centred conversation that will be tailored to individual participant's interest and motivation during the session. Intervention fidelity will be assessed in a two-weeks pilot where two intervention sessions for each research assistant will be audiotaped. The Clinical Psychologist Consultant will review the audio records and provide feedback. We will maintain intervention adherence by randomly select one session every month for each research assistant to be audio-recorded, and reviewed with feedback by the Consultant.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the between-group difference in the proportion of smoking abstinence on Day 90 post-prison release. 

Smoking abstinence in this study is defined as self-reported smoking abstinence over the whole follow-up period allowing up to five cigarettes in total, along with biochemical verification using exhaled Breath Carbon Monoxide (eBCO) testing within 7 days after reporting. 

Self-reported smoking abstinence will be assessed by face-to-face or phone interview or mailed questionnaire. For those who report smoke-free, eBCO test will be performed according to manufactural protocol at the end of the face-to-face interview or within 7 days after phone interview or receipt of mailed questionnaire at a community health centre appointment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured after 90 days from prison release.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of cigarettes smoked on day 1 and 2 post-release, as well as the total number of cigarettes smoked by day 7, 30 and 90 after release using a modified Timeline Follow-Back method. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The number of cigarettes smoked will be measured at the 90-days follow-up interview from prison release. Participants will be asked to recall the number of cigarettes they smoke on day 1, 2, 7, 30 and 90 days post release at the follow-up interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutrition: healthy dietary habits

Healthy dietary habits will be assessed by adherence to average daily servings recommended by the Australian Dietary Guidelines 2013. Short questions will be asked to measure participants eating from five food groups: fruit, grains, meat/poultry, dairy and vegetables.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary outcomes will be measured after 90 days from prison release.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Alcohol consumption

Alcohol use will be measured using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test Alcohol Consumption Questions (AUDIT-C) via face-to-face or phone interview. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary outcomes will be measured after 90 days from prison release.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation

One previous study in the U.S. reported that a behavioural intervention before prison release significantly increased smoking abstinence in the community at week 3 (25% vs. 7%) and week 12 (12% vs. 2%) compared to a control group (Clark et al., JAMA Intern Med, 2013).

We expect the proportion of sustained smoking abstinence at 90-days post-release to be 8% and 2% (odds ratio = 4.0) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. With 80% power at 0.05 significance level, a sample size of 412 is calculated using two-sample proportions test, with 206 in each group. Taking into account 50% loss to follow-up, we will enrol 824 inmates at baseline. Assume a 70% of inmates interviewed will be eligible and agree to be included in the study, we will need to screen 1,178 inmates.

Statistical Analysis:

The primary analysis will be an intention to treat analysis (ITT), with a p-value of &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. The absolute difference in point prevalence of smoking abstinence post-release will be compared between the intervention and control groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Northern Territory (NT) prison population comprises 92% Indigenous Australians and 88% smokers. The NT prison smoking ban creates a population-wide abstinence. 864 men will be randomised to receive the Health Intervention SNAP (Smoking, Nutrition, Alcohol and Physical activity), or usual care (control group). Released participants will be followed up to examine relapse to smoking at Day 30 and 90 post-release. An additional outcome will be the comparison of the two groups on Nutrition, Alcohol and Physical activity risk factors post-release. Participant records will also be prospectively linked with PBS, Medicare, AIHW, and PHRN records.</summary>
