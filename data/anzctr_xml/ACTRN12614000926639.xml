  <interventions>
    <interventions>5 x Primary Schools  Community, school and student derived sun protection policy (Intervention group) (Intervention Period - 20 school weeks)

Each of the intervention groups (parents, teachers and students) will work with researchers to devise policy changes to improve sun protection behaviours that are adopted by children during periods when students are exposed to ultraviolet light.
The behaviours sought to be modified include;
a)	Students wearing of wide brim hats and sunscreen during UV exposed periods of the day
b)	Students playing in shaded areas during periods of high UV exposure
c)	Teachers role-modelling the wearing of hats and sunglasses during exposed periods of the day 

The policy will be implemented by working with teachers (the primary change agent in schools) through professional learning workshops whereby they are given and develop their own strategies in how to model and encourage sun safe practices in primary school-aged children. These workshops will be guided by focus groups conducted with grade 6 students, parents and other teachers in the school community as to what are the enablers and barrieris to effective promotion of sun safe behaviours. The policies will also be required to adhere to the three pillars of the Health-Promoting Schools Framework.

Objective direct observation data collection will be used to monitor adhearence of teacher role-modelling behaviour. Post follow-up focus groups may also be conducted with teachers and students (time and funding pending) to ascertain the perceived adherence to the intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effect of a SunSmart policy intervention in schools on the quality of sun protection behaviours adopted by children during recess and lunch periods, and the role modelling of sun protection behaviour by teachers.

Who is it for?
Participants in this study are primary school students and teachers in existing NSW government schools within the Greater Western Sydney catchment area, that have an existing sun protection policy.

Study details
Schools in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Schools in one group will continue to implement their existing sun protection policies, whilst schools allocated to the other group will receive the SunSmart policy intervention. This runs over 20 school weeks, and involves parents, teachers and students working together with researchers to devise policy changes to improve sun protection behaviours that are adopted by children during periods when students are exposed to ultraviolet light. The behaviours sought to be modified include: a) Students wearing of wide brim hats and sunscreen during UV exposed periods of the day; b) Students playing in shaded areas during periods of high UV exposure; c) Teachers role-modelling the wearing of hats and sunglasses during exposed periods of the day.

Adherence to sun protection policies will be observed in all schools over a period of three school terms, in order to determine the efficacy of the policy-based intervention compared to schools who have not undertaken the intervention process.</summary>
