format affords cost-benefits over one-on-one
physiotherapy without compromising clinical outcomes
during post-acute lower-limb orthopaedic in-patient
rehabilitation: a prospective randomised controlled trial</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Do patients aged 50 years or over who have post-acute phase lower limb orthopaedic surgery who are in-patient in rehabilitation; that have a combined one-on-one/group-circuit physiotherapy format, compared with traditional one-on-one physiotherapy format show "cost-saving" as measured by length-of-stay and required physiotherapist contact hours?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants received physiotherapy twice daily as per the standard treatment regime in the Rehabilitation Ward. Group B  participants (experimental group) received a one-on-one physiotherapy session in the morning and a group-circuit session  in the afternoon (both 30 minutes duration, 5 days a week, for the length of the particpants admission). The non-physiotherapy components of multidisciplinary care, including occupational therapy, dietetics and pain management, were provided as required to both groups as part of standard practice within the Rehabilitation Ward. 
The Group B participants' morning session, that is one-on-one physiotherapy sessions. Were conducted under the direct and constant supervision of a physiotherapist from the Rehabilitation Ward, with a 1:1 therapist-to-patient ratio maintained at all times.These sessions were conducted as per usual care and were not based on any particular treatment protocol; rather, they were tailored to the individual patient based on the clinical decisions of the treating physiotherapist.
In the afternoon Group B participants' group-circuit physiotherapy sessions  included a maximum of six participants at any one time, with each class supervised by one physiotherapist and one physiotherapist-assistant working on the Rehabilitation Ward. These sessions included a set of core exercises that targeted flexibility/range of motion, functional strength, balance, mobility and endurance. Each participant worked at each station for 2 minutes before rotation to the next station.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group A (control group) received a one-on-one physiotherapy session in the morning and afternoon. Both 30 minutes in duration, 5 days a week and for the length of the participants admission.

    <concealment>All subjects that met the inclusion criteria that was admitted to the rehab ward. All beds in the ward were sequentially designated as “A” or “B”, with the treatment allocation code (control group “A” or experimental roup “B”). The nurse administrator responsible for bed allocation was not involved in the study and was unaware of the meaning attached to the bed allocation code.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects were randomly assigned into either the control group “A” or the experimental group “B”. Randomisation was generated from a simple random admission bed allocation system, whereby all beds in the ward were sequentially designated as “A” or “B”, with the treatment allocation code (control group “A” or experimental roup “B”) corresponding to the code attached to the bed that was allocated to each patient on the basis of ‘the next available’
at the time of admission to the Rehabilitation Ward.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of the traditional one-on-one physiotherapy format (control group) with a combined one-on-one/group-circuit
physiotherapy format (experimental group) during post-acute lower-limb orthopaedic inpatient rehabilitation. The studys research questions were, for post-acute lower-limb
orthopaedic in-patient rehabilitation:
1. Does a combined one-on-one/group-circuit physiotherapy format offer cost-savingsrelative to a traditional one-on-one model of physiotherapy service-delivery?
2. Is a combined one-on-one/group-circuit physiotherapy format as clinically effective as the traditional one-on-one model of physiotherapy service-delivery?
3. Are there any specific measures of recovery particularly influenced by the model of service-delivery?
4. How do the discharge scores for key functional mobility measures compare with normative data?</summary>
