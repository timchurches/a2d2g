    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - PF-00477736
Treatment: drugs - gemcitabine

Experimental: 1 - 


Treatment: drugs: PF-00477736
Escalating doses of PF-00477736 will be administered intravenously on Days 2 and 9 and gemcitabine will be administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (doses to be evaluated range from 750 to 1250 mg/m2 in three separated cohorts).
If a patient is administered Cycle 0 - only PF-0047736 will be administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for patients who have a 3-hour infusion and Days 1 and 8 of a 14-day cycle for patients who have a 24-hour infusion.

Treatment: drugs: gemcitabine
gemcitabine will be administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (doses to be evaluated range from 750 to 1250 mg/m2 in three separated cohorts).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine the overall safety of PF-00477736 when given in combination with gemcitabine, a
      chemotherapy agent, in patients with advanced solid tumors and determine the maximum dose of
      PF-00477736 that can be safely given in combination with gemcitabine. This is the first study
      of PF-00477736 in humans.</summary>
