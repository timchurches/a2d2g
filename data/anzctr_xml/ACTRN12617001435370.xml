    <interventions>The Strengths Model Case Management (SMCM, please see: Rapp CA, Goscha RJ. The strengths model: a recovery-oriented approach to mental health services. New York: Oxford University Press; 2011) has been developed to promote recovery through instilling hope and empowering the choices and autonomy of clients. Case management refers to the process of assessing needs, implementing a service plan, and monitoring progress to bring about positive outcomes The six fundamental principles of the Kansas SMCM are: (1) people with psychiatric disabilities can learn, grow, and change; (2) the focus is on individual strengths rather than deficits; (3) the community is viewed as an oasis of resources; (4) the client is the director of the helping process; (5) the worker-client relationship is essential; and (6) the primary setting is the community. 

SMCM comprises two primary tools that are used during sessions between case workers and clients: (1) Strengths Assessment, which appraises the clients strengths, niches, and other attributes, such as self-efficacy and sense of hope, as well as the resources available in the family and community; (2) Personal Recovery Plan, which uses the information obtained from the strengths assessment to derive a plan comprising recovery goals that are meaningful for the client. Co-construction of recovery goals between clients and case workers poses challenges. Weekly strengths-based supervision (i.e., group supervision and field mentoring that helps workers improve their practice skills in an actual setting with a service user) will assure the use of the SMCM tools. 

Group supervision follows these specific steps: (1) The presenting staff hand out clients strengths assessments and specify the help needed from the group. (2) The team are to clarify the assessment and brainstorm ideas. (3) The presenting staff review the ideas and state the next steps. Field mentoring is a structured form of supervision where the supervisor and case worker meet together with a client for the specific purpose of the case worker learning, developing, and/or enhancing skills or use of tools related to the model. Field mentoring sessions most often occur in the clients home or in the community but they can be conducted at the office in some circumstances as long as it is structured as a learning opportunity for the case worker. These implementation features will be monitored by the Fidelity Scale.

The intervention period is 12 months. The clients allocated to the Intervention Group will receive individual sessions of approximately 30 minutes once about every 2 weeks, at the centre or in the community. The case workers delivering the SMCM intervention received training provided by Kansas University previously. The Strengths Assessment and Personal Recovery Plan will be used to guide the intervention sessions. During the intervention, case workers will help the clients identify recovery goals that are meaningful to them. Case workers will attend group supervision sessions with Goscha (i.e. Dr. Rick Goscha, the founder of Strengths Model, he is the present project's one of the named investigators. Please see: Fukui S, Goscha R, Rapp CA, Mabry A, Liddy P, Marty D. Strengths model case management fidelity scores and client outcomes. Psychiatric Services. 2012;63(7):708-10) via Skype on a regular basis (i.e. once a month over the 12 month intervention period) and will engage in a weekly strengths-based supervision (led by their own agency's supervisor[s])run at ICCMWs. Strengths-based supervision includes review case notes, case discussion and seeking advise from team members and supervisors. Fidelity Scale will be used every 6-month to monitor if these high-fidelity activities take place as expected. A leadership team has been established in each ICCMW to oversee the activities.

    <comparator>Clients in the control group will receive generic recovery-based intervention (i.e. Standard care). Examples of intervention activities include recovery groups, medical appointments, leisure/hobby groups, general community activities, such as outings, and regular sessions with case workers (each session lasts approximately 30 minutes and will serve as the attention placebo).</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Participants will be recruited from multiple sites in Hong Kong, which are three Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness  (ICCMWs) operated by three non-governmental organisations. 

A small-scale qualitative study will be conducted to explore the therapeutic ingredients of SMCM and examine the link between fidelity features and clients recovery outcomes. Grounded theory methodology is chosen to guide the data collection and analyses for this qualitative study. The proposed method involves the analysis of in-depth interviews with 21 clients and nine case workers from the intervention group at the end of the 12-month assessment period using a maximum variation technique, a form of purposive sampling. We will use semi-structured interviews exploring the client and case worker participants perceived therapeutic ingredients, perceptions of the benefits, challenges of the intervention, and any suggestions for improvement. These interviews will be conducted at the ICCMWs for convenience.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Monte Carlo simulation for sample size calculation was conducted with Mplus v.7.1 to generate data for the intervention effect on the slope (change rate) of the primary outcome measure (a mean slope difference between the treatment and control groups), assuming a linear change trend across time. We hypothesized a medium effect size (Cohens d = .6) for the slope difference and assumed 15% and 30% missing data at the 6- and 12-month points, respectively, based on previous research. The results suggested that a sample size of 210 clients (n =105 per group) is required for the study to have 80% power to detect a medium effect with the amount of missing data taken into account.

We will examine the intervention effects on the outcomes as compared to the control group outcomes. Background information, including socio-demographic characteristics and all outcome variables, will be summarized using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies, percentages, and cross-tabulations for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate outliers, histograms, probability plots, and residual plots will be examined to select the best-fitting models. Clients will be nested within case workers who are nested within agencies (implementation sites) to test whether there are any post-intervention improvements in outcomes, e.g. recovery and hope. Given the small sample size at the worker and agency levels, a fixed-effects model will be used at the agency level to control for potential agency effects. We will perform intent-to-treat analysis to reflect the real-world setting. Model fit will be evaluated using the multi-index
approach, based on the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA values &lt; .08
are acceptable, but values &lt; .05 are preferred) and comparative fit index (CFI values &gt; .90 are acceptable, but values &gt; .95 are preferred). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatments for mental illness are largely based on the medical model, although recent research demonstrates that strengths-based approaches that mobilize individual and environmental resources can facilitate recovery. Existing evidence, including our own work on recovery-oriented services for individuals with mental illness, suggests that Strengths Model Case Management (SMCM, developed by Rapp and Goscha) offers a structured and innovative intervention. However, data on the effectiveness of strengths-based 
interventions come primarily from studies that lack methodological rigor, have failed to assure fidelity to the model, and/or were conducted mainly in the West.
The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of high-fidelity SMCM for the recovery outcomes of clients with mental illness, and will identify the critical components of the strengths model that exert positive impacts on clients. The specific hypothesis is that clients in the high-fidelity SMCM group will experience higher levels of personal recovery, as well as symptoms reduction, improved hope, self-efficacy, perceived strengths relative to their counterparts in a control group incorporating an attention placebo.</summary>
