  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to determine what is the most appropriate method of investigation of lung masses, or suspected lung cancer. Currently there is no guidance for clinicians as to which of the two commonest methods (bronchoscopy or CT-guided lung biopsy) is optimal. Our study hopes to determine if one of these two diagnostic procedures is more appropriate than the other in investigating patients with lung masses or suspected lung cancer. While either may be performed at present, there is no information to guide clinicians as to particular clinical features that may make one procedure more beneficial than the other, both in terms of maximizing the rate of achieving a diagnosis and also in minimizing the rate of complications.</summary>
