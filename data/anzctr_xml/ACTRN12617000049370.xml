    <interventions>Brief name: a structured, mindfulness-based practice 

The intervention period is six weeks, involving weekly 75-minute face-to-face sessions held in a meeting room at RPAH with a trained instructor (psychologist). The active intervention is based on an established mindfulness program delivered by Openground Mindfulness Training (http://www.openground.com.au). This group program utilizes cognitive strategies and reflective activities aimed to reduce stress, and improve wellbeing and resilience. One instructor will deliver the intervention and has been trained in our risk management protocols as used in our previous study of this intervention at the University. Participants will be encouraged to practice independently in between the sessions, with compliance reinforced at each instructional session with verbal encouragement. There will be no set duration/frequencies for independent practice, any form of independent practice is encouraged. Participants will receive a reminder email on the day of their session and adherence to the intervention will be monitored by registering the attendance at sessions, The intervention will be conducted twice, in consecutive terms. Adherence will be tracked

All potential participants will be informed of the limited numbers of places available in the course (max 20 per course). Whilst places are available in course one they can choose either the first, or the second course. Once places are filled in course one they will be informed and given the option of becoming part of the wait list control.</interventions>

Analysis
The measures will be analysed comparing pre-post changes. If there are sufficient control numbers comparisons will be made between participants and control groups using t-tests or Chi square as appropriate. Between-group comparison of these change scores will be examined using independent t-tests for both groups. Linear regression analyses will be used to control for the effect of the baseline (T1) on the follow-up (T2) scores and calculated change scores for each of the scales. Data will be analysed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach. The same approach will taken to analyse the first vs second groups to check for early adopter effects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to assess the effectiveness of structured, mindfulness-based practice on improving stress, empathy and workplace engagement in junior medical officers (JMOs) and final-year medical students who will imminently become JMOs. Based on current available evidence, we hypothesize that mindfulness-based program participation will:
1.	Reduce levels of stress, anxiety, and burnout, and improve mood
2.	Improve employee work-related outcomes including empathy and engagement
We also aim to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and implementation barriers to this approach in routine practice.
