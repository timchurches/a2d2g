  <interventions>
    <interventions>Video and computer-based interactive exercises that aim to enhance mobility through immediate feedback. Exercise sessions take place in addition to usual care under supervision of a physiotherapist, five times a week, one hour per day.  The additional exercise sessions start upon hospital admission and enrolment in the study and continue till discharge. The daily time participants spend in usual therapy will be monitored. In addition, adherence  and therapy content of the additional therapy sessions are monitored by keeping a therapy diary. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Between-group comparisons for each of the continuously-scored outcome measures will be made using linear models with baseline scores entered as a covariate. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach.

A total of 58 participants (29 per group) will provide 80% power to detect a significant, at the 5% level, 15% between-group difference in the continuous summary score of the SPPB. The sample size calculation assumed analysis using linear models with baseline scores entered as covariates and a correlation between pre- and post-measures of 0.7. For the continuous 3-point summary score of the SPPB the intervention group mean was assumed to 1.6, the standard deviation 0.41. We have allowed for a 20% dropout rate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There has been a recent surge in the use of video and computer-based interactive exercises in rehabilitation populations. It has now been shown in observational studies and pilot (phase II) trials that exergames can increase the dose of repetitive exercise completed in rehabilitation settings. 
The broad aim of this project is to enhance mobility outcomes for people undergoing aged care and neurological rehabilitation. The specific hypothesis of this trial is that the addition of video and computer-based interactive exercises involving feedback to usual care will lead to better mobility outcomes than usual care alone for people admitted to aged care and neurological rehabilitation wards with mobility impairments.
