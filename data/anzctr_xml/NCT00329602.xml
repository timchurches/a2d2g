  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in the International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Week 12 and Week 26 - A 10-item, participant-reported scale covering different symptoms of the condition. Each item is scored from 0 to 4; 0 represents the absence of a problem and 4 reflects a very severe problem. The best and worst possible scores are 0 and 40, respectively; higher scores represent a greater severity of symptoms. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement, and a negative treatment difference indicates a benefit of Ropinirole IR over placebo. The primary assessment was made by calculating the difference in the average score obtained at Baseline with scores at Week 12 and then Week 26.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in the International RLS (IRLS) Rating Scale Total Score at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 20 - A 10-item, participant-reported scale covering different RLS symptoms. Each item is scored from 0 to 4; 0 represents the absence of a problem and 4 reflects a very severe problem. The best and worst possible scores are 0 and 40, respectively; higher scores represent a greater severity of symptoms. The primary assessment from this study was made by calculating the difference in the average score obtained at Baseline with scores at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 16, and 20. Scores were adjusted for baseline IRLS total score, treatment group, visit, visit by treatment group interaction, and center group.</outcome>

                  the wash-out phase (see below). The subject must discontinue and wash-out any
                  previous medication for the treatment of RLS or sleep prior to the Baseline Visit
                  (Day 0). The minimum discontinuation period for wash-out is generally 5
                  half-lives of the medication or 7 consecutive evenings/nights medication-free
                  prior to baseline, whichever is the longer period.

                  severe sleep disturbance) at the Baseline Visit OR RLS symptoms that cause
                  severe/very severe discomfort in the limbs based on clinical judgment and guided
                  by subject response to Question 1 of the IRLS Rating Scale (e.g., this will
                  include a response of (3) severe or (4) very severe discomfort in limbs) at the
                  Baseline Visit (Day 0).

               -  Subjects must be experiencing RLS symptoms requiring treatment at night-time.

               -  Subjects must have given written informed consent prior to any specific study
