  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the intervention group will be invited to participate for 12 months in "MiDoctor," an automated system that monitors individuals with chronic diseases and promotes self-care by providing timely diagnosis, automated calls, and continual reminders via text messaging. The system reinforces patient attendance, helps patients adhere to medication and lifestyle changes, and alerts health personnel to inadequate adherence or changes in risk factors. Specifically, MiDoctor is a web-based system with an interactive voice response (IVR) component and SMS components. The system makes automated phone calls and sends SMS to the patient and, depending on the patient's response, it will send an email alert and place the patient on a work list for the clinical team to respond. The system calls the patient approximately once a week and sends them 1 SMS per week. Each automated phone call lasts approximately 1.5 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control group will not be invited to participate in MiDoctor during the evaluation phase of the study, but will be eligible to enroll in MiDoctor at the end of the evaluation phase. Patients in the control group will receive their usual care for diabetes.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Since the intervention constitutes an invitation to participate in the MiDoctor program, the study results will be subject to intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. In addition, a supplementary per-protocol (PP) analysis will be performed based upon acceptance of the invitation to participate. The sample sizes were designed to detect a difference of 0.3 units of hemoglobin A1c at a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, based on a standard deviation of A1c equal to 1.5.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomized controlled study of MiDoctor, an automated system that uses text messaging (SMS) to reinforce patient attendance, helps patients adhere to medication and lifestyle changes, and alerts health personnel to inadequate adherence or changes in risk factors. The study population consists of 1,054 patients with diabetes type 2, at least 18 years old, registered at Hospital de Curacavi, Chile, of whom 650 will be invited to participate in MiDoctor, while 404 controls will receive their usual care. One-year endpoints will include hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, urinary microalbumin, and patient adherence to appointments and medications. Intention to treat (ITT) analysis is planned, along with a supplementary per-protocol (PP) analysis of based upon acceptance of the invitation to participate.
