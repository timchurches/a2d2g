  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume as regular part of antepartum assessment of fetal well-being is done by the SDP method.
In order to calculate the SDP, the largest vertical diameter of a fluid pocket (not containing small fetal parts or loops of umbilical cord) is measured by two perpendicular diameters.
Oligohydramnios is diagnosed if there was no SDP of 2 x 1 cm.
Once a patient was assigned to SDP arm, all subsequent assessments of amniotic fluid were done accordingly. 
The amniotic fluid estimation used for this evaluation is the last volume within 3 days of delivery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume as regular part of antepartum assessment of fetal well-being is done by the AFI method.
In order to calculate the AFI, the operator divides the uterine cavity into four quadrants. In each quadrant, the largest vertical diameter of a fluid pocket (not containing small fetal parts or loops of umbilical cord) is measured. 
The sum of these four measures provides a single value for the AFI.
Oligohydramnios is diagnosed if the AFI was under 5.1 cm.
Once a patient was assigned to AFI arm, all subsequent assessments of amniotic fluid were done accordingly. 
The amniotic fluid estimation used for this evaluation is the last volume within 3 days of delivery.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the antenatal assessment of fetal well-being, amniotic fluid volume is an important parameter. Oligohydramnios is associated with poor perinatal outcomes. So, after diagnosing decreased amniotic fluid volume or oligohydramnios, many caregivers practice planned delivery by induction of labor or caesarean section. However, there is no clear consensus on the best method to assess amniotic fluid adequacy.</summary>
