  <interventions>
    <interventions>10 weeks of group drama therapy sessions, which will last for 1 hour per week. These sessions will be led by a qualified and experienced drama therapist. The drama therapy sessions will include a warm-up (such as vocal exercises, physical warm-ups like balloon games, or memory games), a main activity (such as telling an improvised story as a group or creating characters and narratives with props) and a warm-down. A register of attendance will be kept to monitor adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two control groups in this study:
1) An active control group: This group will participate in 10 weeks of conversation sessions led by the drama therapist. These sessions will involve group discussions on topics such as wellbeing, interests, memories and current events. This group is included to control for the likelihood that simply paying extra care to the residents and engaging them in a group activity will cause psychological and social improvements.
2) A waiting-list control group: This group will receive no intervention above the standard level of care. However, they will receive 10 weeks of drama therapy or conversation sessions (depending on which activity is found to be more enjoyable/beneficial for people with dementia) after the main study is complete. These sessions will begin 15-20 weeks after the start of the study (the schedule is still to be finalised).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aims to explore the benefits of group drama therapy for older people with dementia in rest homes. It will assess whether drama therapy: 
 	1) Reduces symptoms of depression, 
 	2) Reduces symptoms of anxiety, 
 	3) Increases socialisation, 
 	4) Improves psychological wellbeing, and 
 	5) Is enjoyed by rest home residents with dementia. 
Participants will receive 10 weeks of drama therapy. Their level of depression, anxiety, socialisation, wellbeing and enjoyment of the therapy will be assessed at various points before, during and after the therapy, and at a follow-up period of four weeks. Their results will be compared with a conversation control group and a waiting-list control group. The conversation group will spend the same amount of time with the therapist as the drama therapy group, but will participate in conversations guided by the therapist rather than doing drama activities. This group is included to control for the likelihood that simply paying extra care to the residents and engaging them in a group activity will cause psychological and social improvements. In contrast, the waiting-list control group will receive no intervention beyond the standard level of care. This group is included to control for any behavioural or psychological changes that may occur due to the passage of time. After the experiment, the waiting-list control group will receive 10 weeks of drama therapy or conversation sessions (depending on which activity is found to be more beneficial for participants). Participants will also be asked for their feedback on the drama therapy and conversation sessions.  
This design allows us to test whether drama therapy is enjoyable and beneficial for people with dementia, and whether any benefits still remain at the four-week follow-up period. </summary>
