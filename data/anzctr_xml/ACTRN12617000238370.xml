  <interventions>
    <interventions>Face-to-face delivery of the Care of Persons with Dementia in their Environments (COPE) intervention as described by Professor Laura Gitlin and colleagues. The COPE intervention incorporates environmental modification to decrease stressors, match the environment to the capabilities of the person with dementia and engage the person with dementia in daily activities. The therapist works with the person with dementia and their carer to identify key challenges and then problems solves using a collaborative approach and the use of skills building and role play. 
METHOD: Intervention will be delivered by community based registered Occupational Therapists with their existing clients. Face-to-face visits occur in participant's home or in acute rehabilitation settings (where necessary) with the person with dementia and caregiver together. Number of visits will vary from three to ten, upon discretion of the therapist based on extend of difficulties and success of intervention. Length of visits will be one to two hours, as required.
MATERIALS: The intervention will be delivered using the COPE Intervention Manual and the COPE Occupational Therapy Intervention Documentation Binder developed by Professor Gitlin and colleagues. The COPE Intervention Manual is complemented by prescriptions that provide specific strategies and advice for specific behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. The manual has been refined based on the learnings of the initial trial. Carers will also be provided with a loan copy of the book A Caregivers Guide to Dementia by Professor Gitlin and Dr Piersol. Adherence to the program protocol will be monitored with intervention logs including length of visit, resources used, strategies discussed and assessments conducted. A Fidelity Assessment tool has also been developed for this study and will be completed by therapists within six months of first implementing COPE. Coaching meetings, with up to 6 therapists at a time together with a master trainer, will be conducted every 3 months to discuss difficult cases.
INTERVENTIONIST: The interventionist is a registered occupational therapist. The therapist will receive training in administering the COPE intervention and will be supported by the coordinating principal investigator who will discuss all cases with the therapist.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Case Audit data will be entered into SPSS. Socio-demographic data will be summarised descriptively (e.g. mean, range, percentage). We will also summarise service characteristics descriptively. In regards to the intervention approaches used, we will describe how commonly these approaches are used (e.g. percentage of cases where a particular approach was used) and also describe the average number of approaches (and range) used across clients (eg. 'therapists used an average of intervention approaches with clients'). 

The DIBQ responses will be coded in SPSS. As the sample will be too small for statistical analysis, the information gathered will be used as indicative and descriptive information to inform the development and outcomes of the intervention.  

Responses to participant dyad survey data (pre and post measures) will be coded in SPSS, analysed descriptively and compared within and across groups. Data from the resource utilisation in dementia questionnaire (RUD Lite) will be used to cost both formal and informal services.  

All interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into QSR NVivo. Thematic analysis (developing codes) will identify patterns within the study group. A combination of inductive and deductive coding will be used. F or participant dyads coding will commence with experience of COPE program and perceptions of change, but will be open to unexpected findings that may contribute to these.  For health professionals the four NPT constructs will inform analysis of data gathered in order to build a comprehensive assessment of the barriers and facilitators; and thus informing implementation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>COPE is an evidence -based non-pharmacological program developed by Professor Laura Gitlin from John Hopkins University. COPE is proven effective in reducing dependency and engagement of the person with dementia, and in improving carer wellbeing in a randomised trial in the US. The program uses occupational therapy skills with complimentary nursing skills, centring the needs of both the carer and the person with dementia.  This implementation research project aims to integrate the COPE intervention within existing health and aged care systems in Australia. The project will examine facilitators and barriers at therapist, organisation and policy levels, explore funding models and building in features of sustainability. There will be a process evaluation (interviews, focus groups and observation) and a cost-benefit evaluation (questionnaires and data collection forms) included in the research project. The final output for the project will be an Implementation Strategies Document to influence policy and address how COPE can be rolled out wide-scale.</summary>
