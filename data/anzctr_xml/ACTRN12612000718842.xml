  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both the experimental group and the control will receive one module of a PC-based CD-ROM interactive training product entitled Drive Smart.  This is made possible by introducing a second phase in which the control group will receive Drive Smart training as a delayed intervention immediately after receiving the control condition.  Participants initially allocated to the control group will now receive Drive Smart training as a delayed intervention and will receive an additional assessment following training (4 assessment time points in total).  Follow-up will be 6-weeks for all participants.  All participants will be asked to complete one module of Drive Smart training (approximately 60 mins, completed on a single occasion). Drive Smart combines groups of exercises with scripted video sequences shot of every day driving scenes. The video sequences combine views through the front windscreen of a car, internal mirror and driver's side external door mirror. Multiple intervention concepts are embedded in the content of Drive Smart such as insight training (the process of increasing driver awareness of skill limitations) and commentary driving.  Commentary driving is a technique used in police driver training where the driver gives a running verbal commentary. The commentary combines information about what the driver can see, is thinking and what they are planning to do.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study will be improved hazard perception response time of participants as measured by a computer-based Hazard Perception Test (HPT) (Marrington, Horswill, &amp; Wood, 2008; Smith, Horswill, Chambers, &amp; Wetton, 2009; Wetton, Hill, &amp; Horswill, 2011). The test involves participants watching a short instructional video followed by a selection of short authentic traffic video clips. The clips depict potential hazards such as pedestrians stepping out into the roadway and are filmed from a real car driver's perspective. Selected clips will be randomly assigned to each HPT. The back end of the test is coded to measure hazard response latency by recording the location and timing of mouse clicks and converting earliest responses to potential traffic conflicts into a reaction time score. The final score is the mean latency score across all test items. Evaluation of The HPT's psychometric properties demonstrates good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient reported of 0.93 (Wetton, et al., 2011).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Experimental group (group A) time points: 0 (baseline), 1 (2 hours), 2 (6 weeks).

Control group (group B) time points: 0 (baseline), 1 (2 hours), 3 (3 hours), 4 (6 weeks).
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Risk perception will be assessed using a computer based test entitled Occupational Therapy Risk Perception Test (OT-RiPT). Participants will be assessed individually in a quiet room. Participants are asked to sit in front of a computer screen and watch a video recorded from a drivers perspective of real driving. The view is of the road ahead.  Participants will be asked to evaluate how risky they think the situation is using a visual analogue scale. The test takes approximately15 minutes to complete.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Experimental group (group A) time points: 0 (baseline), 1 (2 hours), 2 (6 weeks).

Control group (group B) time points: 0 (baseline), 1 (2 hours), 3 (3 hours), 4 (6 weeks).
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Brake reaction time will be tested using the RT-2S Simple Reaction Time Tester (Advanced Therapy Products Inc, 2008). The RT-2S is comprised of a test light box, foot pedal module and operator control box. Subjects sit in front of the test light box and adjust their sitting position to achieve good access to the foot pedal module. Subjects are instructed to accelerate by pressing the accelerator pedal until the green light on the test light box is illuminated. The subject is instructed to press the brake pedal as soon as the red light comes on. The red light is randomly controlled from the operator control box. One practice test is given followed by 3 trials. The 3 trial scores are summed and the mean calculated.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is good quality evidence that a link exists between negative driving outcomes and ADHD, yet reducing crash and traffic infringement risk for this group of drivers remains problematic.  The pilot study aims are to:
1) Determine the magnitude of the between-group and within-subject change in hazard perception skills, reaction time and risk-taking propensity in young drivers with ADHD or ASD exposed to Drive Smart training.
2) Determine if any between-group or within-subject change in hazard perception, risk-taking propensity or reaction time is maintained over time.
3) Estimate the variance of the primary outcome variable to enable sample size calculation.
4) Determine the rate of recruitment and retention of participants in order to establish if a full-scale evaluation of Drive Smart is feasible.
Young drivers aged between 16 and 25 years will be randomised to an intervention or control group.  Participants in the intervention group will receive a computer training session using a PC-based CD-ROM interactive training program.  A second phase is included, in which the control group will receive Drive Smart training as a delayed intervention.  This is intended to maximise resources and data collection within the reduced number of participants recruited.  This will facilitate investigation of the potential benefits of Drive Smart training beyond the current exposure with participants acting as their own control.  An additional benefit of including a second phase is that all participants receive the intervention.  This research will contribute to the evidence-base regarding the efficacy of interventions for improving the hazard perception skills of young novice drivers.
