    <statisticalmethods>From an overview of previous studies, for every 1% reduction in cholesterol there may be expected a 2% reduction in cardiac events and a 1% reduction in deaths due to coronary disease over a five-year period.  We may assume a 25% reduction in cholesterol with treatment given optimally.  With 80% compliance amongst attenders we should realise around 20% reduction in cholesterol.  Hence a 20% reduction in deaths due to coronary heart disease over a five to six year treatment period might be expected. Assuming 80% compliance amongst those taking medication with a 10% drop-out rate and a 10% drop-in rate, a sample size of about 9,000 would be required to detect reliably a reduction in mortality due to coronary heart disease of 25%. This would also provide reasonable statistical power to detect a reduction in total mortality of 20%. 
Analysis will be of time to study outcome, with allowance for covariates, using the proportional hazards model, if appropriate.
Potential covariates include age, gender, smoking, other diseases, level of entry lipids, MI/unstable angina, time from MI/angina attack until enrolled.

All analyses will be performed on the groups as originally randomised (ie, the "intention-to-treat" principle). Any subgroup analyses (eg, patients with myocardial infarction versus those with unstable angina) will be performed only on the combined outcome of CHD death and non-fatal myocardial infarction, as this is the only outcome for which there is any reasonable probability of distinguishing reliably between the size of treatment effects in different patient groups.

Three interim analyses are planned at approximately 2, 3, and 4 years after accrual ceases.  The events to be used for these analyses will be counts of deaths.  The occurrence of serious clinical and adverse events will be kept continuously under surveillance.

Should there be a difference in mortality rate or the incidence rate of major adverse reactions between the treatment groups of at least three standard deviations, then the Safety and Data Monitoring Committee will be informed, so that it may advise the Management Committee appropriately. 

The use of this stringent nominal significance level of 0.003 (3 SD) would cover the reasonable number of interim analyses planned and still preserve an overall type I error probability of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is designed to determine whether prolonged reduction in blood cholesterol with pravastatin, one of the class of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors, will reduce mortality from coronary heart disease in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris.  To qualify for entry, a patient must have a blood cholesterol level in the range 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L, and must have suffered a myocardial infarction or have been admitted to hospital with unstable angina, within three months to three years prior to screening.

The primary study outcome will be death due to coronary heart disease. Secondary analyses will be of death from all causes, combined incidence of non fatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease, stroke (total and non-haemorrhagic), cardiovascular mortality, coronary revascularisation (CABG and coronary angioplasty), and number of days in hospital during the follow-up period. The goal of intervention is to reduce total blood cholesterol by an average of 25% in patients allocated pravastatin compared with those allocated placebo. To detect reliably the expected effect of such a cholesterol difference on the primary endpoint requires about 9,000 patients be randomised in equal numbers to pravastatin or placebo, and that follow-up of these patients continues for a minimum 5 years for each surviving patient.
