Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Radiation Therapy (CR from Induction) - Patients will receive 6 cycles of Induction chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and etoposide (Cycles 1, 3, and 5) alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (Cycles 2, 4, and 6). The entire length of Induction is 18 weeks unless delay occurs due to myelosuppression or unanticipated toxicity. Each cycle of Induction will begin when ANC &gt; 750/L and platelets &gt; 75,000/L and when off filgrastim (G-CSF) for at least 48 hours. Following the Induction phase (weeks 0-18) those patient in CR will undergo radiation therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving a chemotherapy drug before surgery may shrink
      the tumor so that it is no longer present by conventional imaging and tumor markers from
      serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of
      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Combining different types of therapy may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This Phase II trial is studying how well neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without
      surgery and with or without high dose chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation,
      can increase response rates prior to radiation therapy and increase progression free and
      overall surviving patients with newly diagnosed intracranial germ cell tumors.</summary>
