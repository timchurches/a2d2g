  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a single-centre, double-blind, doubledummy, randomised, placebo- and positive-controlled, 3 way crossover, thorough QT/QTc (TQT) study in healthy male and female subjects. 

The effects of methoxyflurane at a supratherapeutic dose will be compared with matching placebo. A dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin will be included as a positive control for the effect on cardiac repolarisation.

Each active treatment (methoxyflurane and moxifloxacin) will have a placebo. There will be three treatment groups, defined as follows:
A.	single oral dose of moxifloxacin placebo + single inhaled dose of methoxyflurane (supratherapeutic dose)
B.	single oral dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) + single inhaled dose of methoxyflurane placebo
C.	single oral dose of moxifloxacin placebo + single inhaled dose of methoxyflurane placebo.
There is a washout period of 1 week (7days) between treatment periods.
Twelve (12) mL of methoxyflurane is added to the inhaler. The single dose of methoxyflurane (and methoxyflurane placebo) consists of 12 consecutive breaths, with finger on diluter hole.
Once the participants have been administered a treatment, they will be observed for 24 hours. </interventions>
    <comparator>The study has two controls: placebo and active control.  The effects of methoxyflurane at a supratherapeutic dose will be compared with matching placebo. A dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin will be included as a positive control for the effect on cardiac repolarisation.  See above for information, dosing frequency and duration of treatment of placebo and active controls.
The moxifloxacin placebo is microcrystalline cellulose. The methoxyflurane placebo is water.</comparator>

    <concealment>Eligible subjects will be randomised on Day 1 (Study Period 1) and allocated the next randomisation number at the site. The randomisation number will define the order each subject receives the treatments during the study (e.g., ABC, BCA, etc.). The randomisation code and sealed individual code-break envelopes will be prepared by a nominated individual(s) in the biometrics department. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be assigned in the order in which they are enrolled into the study and receive the next available randomization sequence number allocated to the study site. The randomization sequence is computer generated.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Penthrox® (methoxyflurane) is an analgesic/device combination product, which is currently registered and marketed in Australia.    Methoxyflurane belongs to the fluorinated hydrocarbon group of volatile anaesthetics.  It is inhaled as a vapour at low (sub-anaesthetic) concentrations to provide analgesia in stable, conscious patients.  hERG studies have indicated a potential for QT prolongation, a known property of this pharmacological class.  However, clinical history has provided no indication that methoxyflurane may cause ventricular tachyarrhythmia or Torsades de Pointes (TdP) under conditions of use in analgesia. This study is specifically design to assess drug effects on the QT interval. </summary>
