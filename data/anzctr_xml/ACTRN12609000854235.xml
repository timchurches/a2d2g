  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be the provision of a free breakfast at primary schools in deprived areas in the North Island, New Zealand. This will be delivered as either the Red Cross Breakfast in Schools Programme or a non-branded five day a week breakfast food provision programme.  At a minimum, the breakfast provides weetbix and milk. There is no minimum or maximum amount of food allowed to be taken. The breakfast is provided in a suitable communal area prior to school starting, and is available for any child to attend of their own volition. It will be available every school day from the randomised start time over one school year. Participants will be followed up four times over the school year.</interventions>
    <comparator>The trial will be a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial, where there is a one-way crossover of schools from control to intervention group at randomised periods. The control group consists of students in schools who have not yet crossed over to start receiving the breakfast in schools intervention. Control schools will start receiving the breakfast intervention at the randomised timepoint when they cross over from control to intervention. There are four cross over timepoints spread over the school year.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial design, which is most similar to a cross-over trial. However, cross-over is only one way (from control to intervention). Schools cross-over at one of four time points during the study (total 14 schools), and comparison is made between schools who are receiving the intervention and those who are still in the control group. All schools will be receiving the breakfast programme by the end of the study, but their randomised start time has been staggered over the year. At first, only four schools are receiving the breakfast programme while the remainder are control schools. At the next crossover, 7 schools will be receiving the breakfast programme, and 7 will be control schools. At the next crossover, 10 schools will receive the breakfast programme and 4 schools will continue being controls. Finally, all 14 schools will be receiving the breakfast programme.</designfeatures>
