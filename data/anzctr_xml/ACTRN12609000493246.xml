  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 mL intravenous 70% ethanol is instilled into each lumen of the tunnelled intravenous catheter as a lock, at the end of the haemodialysis treatment, once weekly.  The ethanol is withdrawn before the next dialysis session, 48 hours later. The patient remains on the study until the catheter is removed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three times weekly, as per usual practice, Heparin (5000 units per mL) is instilled into each lumen of the tunnelled intravenous catheter as a lock (volume as per lumen instructions - this amount is variable depending on the brand of catheter/size of lumen), at the end of the haemodialysis treatment and withdrawn before the next dialysis session, 48 hours later.  The patient remains on the study until the catheter is removed.</comparator>
