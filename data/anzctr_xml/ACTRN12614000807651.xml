  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be asked to attend 4 test sessions of ~5 hours each, with ~one week between each session. Each session commences ~4 hours before the participants' habitual bedtime, concluding 1 hour after. 

The first two sessions will be dim-light exposures (&lt;1 lux), with citalopram 30mg being administered on the first evening, and placebo on the second. The first evening serves to confirm that citalopram 30mg does not influence absolute levels of melatonin, which would impede our ability to measure the suppression of melatonin during the following light exposures. The second night serves as a dark-control for subsequent light exposures.

The final two nights are light exposures (~100 lux) with participants being randomised to receive either citalopram 30mg, or placebo, first. Each participant will be exposed to both conditions.

A single capsule of citalopram 30mg (or matched placebo) will be administered in the laboratory ~4 hours prior to each participants' bedtime according to their sleep-wake schedule. This takes place during all in lab sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>A single Avicel powder filled capsule will be administered in the laboratory ~4 hours prior to each participants' bedtime according to their sleep-wake schedule during each of their four in-lab test sessions. The study is repeated-measures, therefore all participants will undergo a two dark controls (one with placebo, one with citalopram 30mg) and two light exposures (one with active medication and one with placebo).</comparator>

      <outcome>Alertness Testing: Objective and Subjective.

Objective alertness is assessed via an auditory psychomotor vigilance task. 

Subjective alertness is assessed every 60 minutes using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>Test sessions will last for a total of ~5 hours in duration. Four test sessions are included in the protocol: two dark controls and two light exposures where either Citalopram 30mg or Placebo are administered on each occasion (active dark, placebo dark, active light, placebo light). 

Objective alertness is assessed bi-hourly beginning 2 hour post administration, and subjective alertness is assessed hourly beginning immediately before administration. </timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each participant will take part in all conditions, with the order of the light exposures being randomised. 

The pharmacist dispensing the medication is responsible for allocating the specific order or administration and this will remain blinded to the researchers until testing has been completed, and individual level analysis has been conducted. A-B categorisation will be provided once individual analysis is complete, so that group level analysis can be completed before researchers will be unblinded.</concealment>
    <sequence>The pharmacist responsible for dispensing the medication and matched placebos (Monash University Campus Pharmacy) generated a randomisation table for the light exposure allocations.

Dark controls were conducted in the same order for all participants. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effect Citalopram (a common SSRI medication) has on the body's response to light exposure at night. It is hypothesised that as compared to placebo trials, administration of Citalopram will will result in an altered response to night time light exposure.
