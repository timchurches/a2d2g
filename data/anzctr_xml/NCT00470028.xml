  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study to assess the effectiveness and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for depressed 13-18 year olds.

      In rTMS high-intensity, fluctuating magnetic fields non-invasively stimulate the cortex of
      the brain depolarizing neurons. No anesthetic is required and the treatment in subconvulsive.
      Recent studies suggest that rTMS can be an effective treatment for depressive illness in
      adults (Loo and Mitchell, 2005) and appears to be quite safe.

      Minimal data of TMS use in adolescents psychiatric disorders. Data only existed in seven
      patients of the four that were depressed two showed improvement in their depression
      (Quintana, 2005). No sham-controlled studies have been conducted.

      The investigators wish to assess this in a sham-controlled study of 30 adolescents. The
      investigators hypothesize that rTMS will have an antidepressant effect and produce no
      neuropsychological impairment.</summary>
