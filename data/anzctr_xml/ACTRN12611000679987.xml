  <interventions>
    <interventions>This group will follow a low-fat diet (25% total dietary fat from energy) for 6 weeks. The low-fat diet consists of subjects consuming 5 serves of vegetables per day, 2 serves of fruit per day, 3 serves of low-fat dairy per day, a maximum of 5 serves of carbohydrates (rice, pasta, bread etc) per day and a maximum of 3 serves of fats (butter oil, margarine etc) per day. Subjects are also given a list of foods to try and avoid, including fatty snacks like chips, biscuits cakes etc. Subjects will undergo a one on one dietary counseling session with the nutritionist where the diet they will be following will be explained to them, and questions they may have will be answered. This counseling session occurs once at the beginning of the study, but a weekly phone call will be made to subjects to give them the opportunity to ask questions throughout the 6 week period.</interventions>
    <comparator>This group will follow a portion control diet for 6 weeks. Subjects will be given a plate to use to reduce their portion sizes of their main meals. Subjects in this group will be advised by the nutritionist in their one on one counseling session to reduce everything they are now consuming. They will be told that they do not have to change what they are eating, just the amount. They will also be told that they are not to make up for eating smaller meals by snacking more regularly.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oral sensitivity to oleic acid will be measured using 3-alternate forced choice methodology, where they need to accurately differentiate between control samples and those containing a certain concentration of oleic acid in ascending order from lowest concentration (0.02mM) to the highest (12mM). Samples are presented to subjects in non-fat milk. Subjects are presented with 3 samples, 2 control and one fatty acid and asked to pick the odd sample. Subjects are advised to wash their mouth only between tests, not between individual samples within the same test. Detection thresholds for each fatty acid were defined as the concentration at which the subject correctly picked the odd sample out in three consecutive sample sets.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Oral sensitivity will be measured at baseline and week 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatty acid taste receptors will be measured by collecting tongue tissue via non-invasive tongue swabs and running these cells in real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tongue cells will be collected at baseline and week 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety will measured using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at baseline and week 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food and fat intake: Subjects completed a 24 hour diet diary from which energy and macronutrient contents were quantified, they also completed a a food frequency questionnaire, to assess dietary variety.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The diet diary will be recorded at baseline, week 2, week 3, week 4 and week 6. And the food frequency questionnaire will be recorded at baseline and week 6.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjects will have a photograph of their tongue taken to determine if the number of taste buds they have on their tongue is related to their sensitivity to fatty acids.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at week 6 only.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Height, weight and body mass index</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and week 6, all subjects will be weighted and measured without shoes and in light clothing. Body mass Index (BMI) was calculated from these measurements.</timepoint>
