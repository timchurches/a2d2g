  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consisted of an aerobic workout, in which the volunteers had their heart rate monitored for heart rate monitors, this training was supervised by two previously trained professionals, they recorded the volunteers' heart rate during training sessions and gave verbal feedback to them to keep the frequency target rate in the range previously established. The training had a frequency of three times weekly, the training sessions had a gradual increase in the first 30 minutes duration and the final 55 minutes long, also the training protocol was 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>In this study, there was really a control group itself, or did not receive the treatment.Our study had one group that initially received no treatment during which we obtained our baseline, after a period of 6 weeks all volunteers received treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study had as main variables: pain.  
The instruments used to assess pain were questionario WOMAC and visual analog scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical performance: exercise total time this evaluated by a graded exercise test on a treadmill</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional performance - the test of steps which the patient had to go up and down a flight of stairs as quickly as possible safely.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cell activation-analysis of blood samples by flow cytometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our study had control variables, which were the following: body mass index.  The body mass index was measured the weight and height measurement, write down the values after using the following calculation: weight / height.height.Measurements were collected using a mechanical scale with a platform equipped with a stadiometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist-hip ratio was used in the tape which was measured at the waist with legs abducted 30 cm was collected to measure two fingers above the navel and hip cincuference legs reasons, being used, the most prominent point of the buttocks</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist circumference: measure the waist of the volunteer with the legs abducted to 30 cm and the measure two fingers above the navel.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on admission, after 6 weeks, and after 12 weeks of training.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
