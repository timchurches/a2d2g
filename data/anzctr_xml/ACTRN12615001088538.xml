  <interventions>
    <interventions>The investigational agents are diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) and imiquimod, two dermatological immunotherapies for topical administration to cutaneous in-transit lesions. Each agent will be administered topically with a 5mm peripheral margin to uniformly treat between 5-20 target lesions over a minimum of 12 months or until complete clinical resolution of loco-regional disease. 

Treatment Arm A  5% Topical Imiquimod Cream: Self-application 5 times weekly, regular clinical review, time to best response and formal 12 month assessment, regular clinical surveillance for duration of remaining trial.

Treatment Arm B  Topical DPCP Cream: Sensitisation with 2% solution then treatment using 0.005% solution - titrated to effect to a maximum of 5% , Responders commence treatment regimen - self-application once weekly, regular clinical review, titration to effect, time to best response and formal 12 month assessment, regular clinical surveillance for duration of remaining trial.

During the scheduled clinical review participants' records of dates (treatment log) of medication self-administration will be used to monitor adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical control. Following completion of the TIDAL Melanoma Study a comparison to retrospective data will be made for patients treated with isolated limb infusion and PV-10 treatments. These modalities represent the existing standard of care at our institution. Data for these control treatments were derived from institutional records between 1996 - 2014.

PV-10 treatment involves an intra-lesional injection of Rose Bengal solution into in-transit melanoma metastases and has been investigated as a part of another phase II trial completed at our centre. For the formal treatment results of this investigation please refer to: Thompson JF, et al. Phase 2 Study of Intralesional PV-10 in Refractory Metastatic Melanoma. Ann Surg Oncol. 2014.

Isolated limb infusion involves isolating the vascular supply to a limb affected by in-transit melanoma metastases and instilling a loco regional chemotherapeutic agent, melphalan. For the formal institutional treatment results of from therapy please refer to: Barbour AP, et al. Isolated Limb Infusion for Malignant Melanoma: Predictors of Response and Outcome. Ann Surg Oncol. 2009.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study Details
This study aims to compare two different non-invasive topical immunotherapies in patients with multiple, in-transit, cutaneous melanoma metastases. The hypothesis is that these treatments are at least as clinically effective as current therapies for patients with selective in-transit melanoma metastases and can be used to enhance patients quality of life and decrease health-related costs.

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or older and have been diagnosed with histologically or cytologically proven in-transit melanoma metastases, which are considered unsuitable for surgery. 

Intervention Description 
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will be given imiquimod cream and asked to apply it to their lesions five times weekly for up to 12 months. Participants in the other group will be given diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP) cream instead, and asked to apply it to their lesions once weekly for up to 12 months. All participants will undergo regular clinical review with measurement of the treated lesions and assessment of their lymph nodes, routine blood tests and CT/PET scans, in order to evaluate the response to treatment. Patients will also be asked to complete a questionnaire evaluating quality of life at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. 

Study Outcomes
The results of this study may lead to improved patient rated outcomes compared to current strategies through a reduction in the burden of local disease, fewer serious treatment-related complications, more convenient application, streamlined review and ultimately decreased healthcare-associated expenditure.</summary>

    <publicnotes>Patients will be assessed and treated through the Melanoma Specialist Outpatient Clinic at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. Access to two novel, topical immunotherapies will be provided without charge to eligible patients and will involve ongoing, multi-disciplinary care from dermatologists, plastic and reconstructive surgeons, general surgeons, oncologists and nursing specialists.</publicnotes>
