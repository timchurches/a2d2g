  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is being conducted as the second study (Phase 1) in the clinical development of NV-52 as a new drug for inflammatory bowel disease. It is important to know that patients who are entered onto Phase I studies generally start with one dose of the drug(s) to be tested, then take doses of the drug over the following days. The purpose of the study is to determine the bio-availability, that is, can the drug be detected in blood or urine of NV-52 when administered orally (pill form).  Also, to see if the drug is well tolerated in patients, without side effects.</summary>
