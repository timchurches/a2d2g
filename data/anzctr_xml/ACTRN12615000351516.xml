  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive a 30-minutes session per week for 4 weeks which includes mobilization-with-movement technique, taping for the shoulder and therapeutic exercises to improve scapular control, strengthen scapular stabilizers and rotator cuff muscles and stretch for the anterior and posterior shoulder and scapular elevator. Participants will be informed to perform the therapeutic exercises at home daily which will take around 30 minutes.  A physiotherapist with more than 4 years of practice will administer the manual therapy and physiotherapy at the clinic as well as improve the exercises weekly at each appointment. A shoulder diary will be used to monitor adherence to the exercises performed at home and also to monitor pain scores during the 28-days protocol. </interventions>
    <comparator>Twenty-two age- and gender-matched healthy participants with no history of shoulder or neck pain or injury will also be recruited as control group. The control group will not receive any intervention since they are not shoulder pain patients.</comparator>

    <concealment>There is just one treatment for shoulder pain patients, therefore just one group of subjects treated which will be compared with healthy subjects. The purpose of the study are to characterise the sensory profile of subjects with shoulder impingment and to identify predictors for the success of the treatment based on the pain profile of the patient.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>There is no comparable data from people with shoulder pain on which to base our sample size. Based on similar work in whiplash, 22 participants with shoulder pain and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls will be recruited. Sample size was calculated based on a power analysis (0.80), and the assumption of a 2.1 degrees Celsius (SD 2.4) difference in CPM functioning between groups.
Paired sample t-tests will be used to compare within-subject differences in CPM measured at 30- and 60-seconds after the cold pressor test. Reliability of measures for each group will be assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 3,1). To compare differences between shoulder pain and control groups at baseline, Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used for measurements with skewed distributions or one-way ANOVA for equal distributions (HPT, CPT, PPT, cold pressor test and TS). Linear correlations will be performed to assess predictor factors for the successful treatment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a growing body of evidence of altered sensory processing in people with shoulder pain however it is not known which pain modulation pathway is affected in this population. It has also been reported that manual therapy techniques for the shoulder complex improve outcomes in patients with shoulder impingement compared to standard physiotherapy, sham or control interventions; however some findings suggest that a subgroup of individuals with shoulder pain may exist who will respond dramatically to these interventions. The aims of this study are to determine 1) the dominant pain modulation process in shoulder impingement individuals and 2) prognostic factors from the history, physical examination and pain modulation process in individuals with shoulder impingement who are likely to experience improvements following physiotherapy associated with manual therapy techniques. In this instance the population will be individuals with shoulder impingement symptoms and healthy controls. For the first aim of the study, all the subjects will be assessed twice at the baseline, with an interval of 48 hours between the measurements. For the second aim of the study, subjects with shoulder impingement will be treated during 4 weeks with manual therapy, physiotherapy and, when necessary, shoulder taping, and then reassessed after the 4-weeks rehabilitation program. The primary outcome measures will be heat pain threshold, cold pain threshold, cold pressor threshold, conditioned pain modulation and temporal summation of pain. The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the dominant pain modulation process as mechanism for success in this technique and to guide physical therapists in selecting which patients with shoulder pain may experience improved outcomes following physiotherapy and manual therapy treatment. To date no scientific study has been conducted to investigate the pain modulation pathways in this population neither the predictive factors for successful outcomes concerning pain modulation in people with shoulder pain.</summary>
