  <interventions>
    <interventions>The exercise training program will be embedded within the pulmonary rehabilitation programs currently offered by the Physiotherapy Departments at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and Royal Perth Hospital. The 8-week training program will consist of 60 minutes training sessions which patients will attend three times per week. Circuit training will include aerobic (walking and cycling) and resistance training (upper and lower limbs). All sessions will be fully supervised by an experienced physiotherapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment (weekly phone calls over the same 8 week trial period to control for attention and usual care). Phone calls will not have the aim to encourage people to increase physical activity or to exercise. The purpose of phone calls are: (i) to have a general discussion about participants' recovery, (ii) to ask them about their physical activity levels and pain and (iii) to remind them of their upcoming appointments. Usual care will comprise prescribed medication and doctor visits.</comparator>

      <outcome>Force-generating capacity of peripheral muscles. 
Maximal isometric force-generating capacity of the quadriceps will be measured in an upright seated position using the HUMAC NORM isokinetic dynamometer (CSMi, Stoughton, MA, USA). Individuals will be asked to perform 5 maximum contractions of the quadriceps at 60 degrees of knee flexion separated by a minimum of 30 seconds. The best of the highest three contractions which do not differ 5% from each other will be recorded as the test result. 
Isometric handgrip force will be measured with a hydraulic hand dynamometer (Jamar dynamometer; JA Preston Corporation; Jackson, MI). Peak handgrip force will be assessed at the dominant side with the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion, and the forearm and wrist in a neutral position.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will explore the role that supervised exercise training has in helping Stage I or II lung cancer patients to recover. 

Who is it for?

You can join this study if you have previously had a lung resection (lobectomy) for lung cancer (Stage I or II non-small cell). With or without chemotherapy, and live in the metropolitan Perth area.

Trial Details

Following completion of previous treatment for lung cancer (surgery with or without chemotherapy), you will be randomised either to a group that receives 8 weeks of supervised exercise training, or usual care where you will be followed up by weekly phone calls for general discussion about your recover. Measures will be made before and after this 'intervention' period. Specifically, measures will be made of; (i) lung function, (ii) exercise capacity, (iii) disease-specific health-related quality of life, (iv) feelings of anxiety and depression, (v) peripheral muscle force (i.e. strength) and, (vi) daily physical activity. 

This trial will be the first randomised controlled trial of supervised out-patient exercise training in this patient population, and look to optimise recovery for patients following lung cancer resection.</summary>
