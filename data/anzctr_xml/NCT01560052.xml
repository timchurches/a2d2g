  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - methylprednisolone
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Active Comparator: oral methylprednisolone - oral methylprednisolone
Original Cohort:
Methylprednisolone group; start at 0.8mg/kg/day with a maximal 48mg/kg/day x 2months, taper by 8mg/day every month with optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines.
Low Dose Cohort:
Methylprednisolone group; start at 0.4mg /kg/day with a maximal dose of 32mg/day and a minimum dose of 24mg/day, reducing over 6-9months.
All participants will also receive standard guideline based care, without steroid therapy. Prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (a single strength tablet daily or half a double strength tablet daily) will be used during the first 3 months in the low-dose cohort, after randomisation, for the prevention of severe PJP infection, unless there is a documented sulfa allergy.

Placebo Comparator: placebo - Original Cohort:
Matching placebo; Optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines; Low Dose Cohort; Matching placebo: Optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines.
All participants will also receive standard guideline based care, without steroid therapy. Prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (a single strength tablet daily or half a double strength tablet daily) will be used during the first 3 months in the low-dose cohort, after randomisation, for the prevention of severe PJP infection, unless there is a documented sulfa allergy


Treatment: drugs: methylprednisolone
Original Cohort:
Oral methylprednisolone or placebo 0.8mg/kg/day with a maximum of 48mg/day x 2months, taper by 8mg/day every month, patients will also receive optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines
Low Dose Cohort:
Oral methylprednisolone or placebo 0.4mg/kg/day with a maximum 32mg/day and minimum of 24mg/day then reducing over 6-9months. All the patients will also receive optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines throughout the trial.
Prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (a single strength tablet daily or half a double strength tablet daily) will be used during the first 3 months after randomisation in the low dose cohort, for the prevention of severe PJP infection, unless there is a documented sulfa allergy.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Intervention: Drug: Placebo
Original Cohort:
Matching placebo tablets, all the patients will receive optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines throughout the trial.
Low Dose cohort:
Matching placebo will be given reducing over 6-9months. All the patients will also receive optimal blood pressure control and full dose of ACE inhibitors or ARBs as recommended by guidelines throughout the trial.
Prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (a single strength tablet daily or half a double strength tablet daily) will be used during the first 3 months after randomisation in the low dose cohort, for the prevention of severe PJP infection, unless there is a documented sulfa allergy

    <summary>This study will evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of low dose oral
      methylprednisolone compared to matching placebo, on a background of routine RAS inhibitor
      therapy, in preventing kidney events in patients with IgA nephropathy and features suggesting
      a high risk of progression.</summary>
