    <statisticalmethods>People with AOGC are anticipated to have a median PFS of 2 months after prior chemotherapy (i.e. a PFS rate at 2 months of 50%). An increase in median PFS to 3.33 months for the participant group given regorafenib is considered of clinical interest. Assuming that time to progression follows an exponential distribution, a median PFS time of 3.33 months corresponds to a progression free rate at 2 months of 66%. Based on Simons optimal two stage design, a sample size of 92 participants in the regorafenib group will have 90% power at the 5% level of significance to reject the null hypothesis of a PFS rate at 2 months of =50% compared to the alternative hypothesis of a PFS rate at 2 months of =66%. This design allows for a futility analysis after 33 regorafenib participants have had PFS evaluated at 2 months. If 16 or more out of 33 (evaluable) regorafenib participants have progressed by 2 months then the study regimen/design will be reassessed or the study stopped. 

The target sample size for the regorafenib arm will be 100 to allow for drop-outs/ ineligibility. A sample of 50 placebo participants will allow estimation of the endpoints to inform the reference values used in any future sample size calculations for a phase III trial. Accrual will take place over 18 months with the final analysis planned to be undertaken after the last participant has either progressed or been followed for a minimum of 3 months (from date of randomisation), whichever comes first.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effect of a drug called regorafenib for treatment of advanced oesophago-gastric cancer. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with advanced (metastatic or locally recurrent) oesophago-gastric cancer which has not responded to treatment. 
Trial Details: 
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants will either take regorafenib (Group 1) or a placebo (sham) (Group 2) tablet oncer per day on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle. Treatment will continue until disease progression or prohibitive adverse events. Participants will not know whether they are taking regorafenib or the placebo until after the trial is completed. Participants will be followed up every 2-4 weeks in order to evaluate how they are responding to treatment.</summary>
