    <interventions>Following removal of their plaster cast, baseline assessments will be performed. Group 1 will then receive an educational handout from the plastics registrar that advises on how to self manage their hand now that their hand is no longer immobilised. Participants will be re-assessed at 2 weeks post.</interventions>
    <comparator>Following removal of their plaster cast, baseline assessments will be performed. Group 2 will receive the same handout that advises on how to self manage their hand now that their hand is no longer immobilised, but will also have one, one-on-one physiotherapy session (approximately 30 minutes)  to supplement the handout. Participants will be re-assessed at 2 weeks post.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a non-inferiority study.  We hypothesised that utilising a physiotherapy handout for education and self management post immobilisation (Group 1) for simple and undisplaced phalanx and metacarpal fractures is adequate to achieve full active range of motion and function compared with a one-on-one hand therapy by a physiotherapist (Group 2).  The null hypothesis is that Group 1 is inferior to Group 2 and the alternative hypothesis is that Group 1 is not inferior to Group 2.  The proportion of full active range of motion and function after two weeks with Group 2 is approximately &gt;95%.  With a margin of equivalence of 0.1 we need a sample size of 60 in each of the two groups to have a power of 83% for the non-inferiority study, at a significance of 0.05.   

Non-inferiority design analysis method will be employed.  The difference of the proportion of full active range of motion and function after two weeks, with the corresponding 90% confidence interval between the two groups will be calculated.  We will also compare the difference for several continuous outcome variables such as pain scores and categorical variables between the two groups using independent sample T test and Chi-square test, respectively. For paired outcome variables general linear model with repeated measures will be utilised.  Data will be analysed using SPSS.             </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The PMH physiotherapy and plastics department would like to review the current practices of how we manage children with the simpler, uncomplicated finger fractures (broken bones). We want to see if we can provide treatment in a more time efficient and cost effective way, whilst ensuring the fractures continue to heal well.
	
These fractures tend to managed with a 3 week immobilisation in a plaster cast. Currently, after seeing the doctor and having the cast removed, families and patients may wait over two hours to see the physiotherapists for advice on exercise and a home program to help with the stiffness after the cast is taken off. This long wait to see the physiotherapy continues despite many changes made to the way we run the clinics in an attempt to decrease this wait time. Many families have complained about this long wait time.

We have investigated how other childrens hospitals in Australia manage simple fractures of the hand. We found that the treatment varies between the Australian states and there is little in the medical literature that gives us guidance as to whether children have any short or long term problems if they dont have physiotherapy after the cast is taken off. 

We want to determine if children with simple hand fractures are able to achieve full active movement of all the fingers and wrist with just the provision of an education and physiotherapy exercise handout alone, instead of the one-on-one hand therapy currently provided by the physiotherapist.   This in turn will reduce the burden on the family to travel to PMH for unnecessary appointments and decrease the wait time for physiotherapy, as fewer children will need this service during clinic.  It will also ensure the physiotherapist can safely prioritise patients with other more complicated fractures where physiotherapy is essential to improve their recovery. The outcome of this study will identify the most efficient and effective way of managing the simple finger and hand fractures.  Other Australian states are interested in changing their practise based on our results.
