    <interventions>Study groups
In total, 93 employees participated in the study. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of the following study groups: i) Sitting in the armchair and use the massage program while listening to the mental training programs (n=19), ii) Sitting in the armchair and use the massage program only (n=19), iii) Sitting in the armchair and listen to the mental training programs only (n=19), iv) Sitting in the massage chair but not use either the massage program nor listen to the mental training program.

Study design
The study lasted for a total of 8 weeks. During these weeks the participants in group i-iii took a break for their regular work and sat in the chair for 15 minutes three times each week, preferably between at 13.00-16.00. The participants who used the massage program (i.e., group i and ii) all used the same massage program, but were able to make individual adjustment regarding the strength of the massage. The participants who listened to the mental training programs (i.e., group i and iii) listened to different programs in the following order: Recovery-week one, Mindfulness-learn to live in the present, week two,The way to a better and deeper sleep-week three, Reduce the negative stress -week four., "Learn to think positively-week five "Increase your mental strength-week six,  How to get a greater enjoyment of life-week seven andRecovery-week eight.  

The participants in group iv took a break from their regular work and sat in the chair for 15 minutes three times each week, however they did not use neither the massage program nor listen to the mental training programs. Group v served as a control group and continued their work as usual. The intervention was followed by the participants kept a diary throughout the study period. They described, for example, technical questions regarding the treatment, experiences of treatment, disease. In three of the workplaces the participants choose themselves when to use the chair. In the fourth workplace, due to a hectic schedule, the participants were assigned specific time points when to use the chair.

The statements included in the questionnaire are part of the larger questionnaire the Swedish Scale of Personality (SSP). SSP is a revised form of the previous Karolinska Scale of Personality (KSP). In this updated form the scales have been shortened, modernized and psychometrically evaluated. The SSP has been evaluated for more than 3000 individuals including more than 1000 patients. SSP contains 13 subscales where each subscale has seven statements with a four point response format, ranging from does not apply at all to apply completely (Gustavsson et al., 2000). In the present study the following five subscales, and corresponding items, were included: Somatic Trait Anxiety (STA), Psychic Trait Anxiety (PSTA), Stress Susceptibility (SS), Detachment (D) and Social Desirability (SD).

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured by using an automatic manometer that is clinically validated and approved in accordance with the protocols of the International Society of Hypertension. (Omron M6 Comfort, Omron Healthcare, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands). The manometer was attached on the participants left arm and placed in line with the heart. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Background data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) in order to compare similar studies Since the number of participant in each group was relatively small a normal distribution could not be taken for granted and non-parametric statistical test were used to analyse the results. The Kruskal Wallis Test for independent samples, as well as the Mann-Whitney test for independent samples, was used to test for the differences between groups at single time points /start, four weeks and eight weeks). Friedmans Two-way Analysis of variance by rank was used to test for differences within each study group during the entire study period.  Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to test for differences between two time-points within each study group. Changes between start and four weeks, between four and eight weeks, as well as between start and eight weeks were analysed. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered significant and P-values &lt; 0.1 were interpreted as a tendency.


Calculation of estimated number of participants were performed based on the results of previous studies using KSP [1, 2]

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the proposed study the first aim is to scientifically evaluate the effects of mechanical massage fron an armchair and mental relaxation program, separately or in combination in regard to health and well-being.  A second aim will be to explore the underlying mechanisms behind the effects on health and well-being in response to these treatments. We are particularly interested in exploring the role of endogenous oxytocin in the mechanisms that promote health and well-being. Such knowledge might be of importance for the development of other types of health-promoting interventions.</summary>
