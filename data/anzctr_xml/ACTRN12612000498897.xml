  <interventions>
    <interventions>1)Operators were divided into following groups according to experiences:
Group T1 (n=50): Anesthesia technician with less (than two years) experience (5 operators)
Group T2 (n=50): Anesthesia technician with more (than two years) experience (5 operators)
Group A1 (n=50): Research assistant doctor with less (than three years)  experience (5 operators)
Group A2 (n=50): Research assistant doctor with more (than three years) experience (5 operators)
2) After intubation, endotracheal tube cuff was inflated by two different methods,  until the leakage sound was discontinuated or pilot balloon palpation by operators.
Each of the operator from these groups were to conduct the application on 10 patients, and endotracheal tube cuffs were inflated according to leakage sound in half of the patients (n=5) and pilot balloon palpation in the other half (n=5). 
3) After endotracheal entubation, cuff was inflated immediately. cuff pressures were measured at the 5th and 60th minutes of endotracheal intubation and immediately before emergence from anesthesia</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: In this study, we planned to investigate the effects of operator experience and cuff pressure inflation method differences following endotracheal tube cuff pressure (ETCP) and complaints about it.
Materials and methods:  Two hundred fifty patients were planned general anesthesia included in this study. ETC was inflated by operators with distinct experience according to leakage or pilot balloon palpation techniques. ETCPs were measured by manometer at three periods as 5 and 60 minutes after endotracheal intubation, and before emergence. Complaints about it were recorded in post anesthetic care unit and postoperative 24th hour.
Results: Though we found experience of operator had significant effect on the ETCP, we observed inflation methods hadnt effect. But experienced operators also were found ETCP was higher than normal range. A correlation was observed between cuff pressure and operation duration with postoperative complaints. 
Conclusions: Our study concluded that used methods do not have an precede over one another, ETC inflated at normal pressure increases as operators experience increases but experience does not suffice alone in adjusting ETCP, a healthier method such as manometer should be used in routine applications instead of conventional methods, and CP and operation duration have correlations with some postoperative complaints.</summary>
