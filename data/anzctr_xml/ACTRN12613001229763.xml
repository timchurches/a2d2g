    <statisticalmethods>For sample size considerations, we used published literature reporting repeated measures of FGF23.  Based on published data, we assume the mean (SD) FG23 to be 72 (39) RU/mL in the control group.  Based on a reduction in FGF23 of 33% we assume the mean (SD) FGF23 to be 48 (39) RU/mL in the experimental group, which is a clinically important and detectable difference.  We have assumed an overall correlation between baseline and follow-up measurements of 0.7 based on a number of studies, but have also tested the sensitivity of power calculations using modelled correlation values of 0.1 and 0.9. Modelling these assumptions using repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), allowing for a 25% drop-out rate, and using a correlation value of 0.7, treatment groups of 18 would provide adequate power (power 0.9, 2-sided alpha 0.05). When correlation values of 0.1 or 0.9 are assumed sufficient treatment groups are 22 and 7 respectively.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary goal of this study is to determine if treatment with niacinamide will reduce levels of FGF23 in patients with CKD.  FGF23 is elevated in CKD and has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac death.  Low phosphate diet and phosphate binders have been shown to reduce levels of FGF23.  If niacinamide is shown to successfully reduce FGF23 levels it will provide an easier "real world" approach to the early treatment of the mineral and bone disorder associated with CKD.</summary>
