  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will be conducted within the routine early assessment clinic at GP Plus Marion. Patients are asked to allow 2 hours for this clinic but each clinician works to a 30 minute assessment schedule. The intervention for this study is the tape recording of the sessions as outlined below.
The patient accompanied by their caregiver is first assessed by the Nurse Practitioner for a 30 minute physical assessment. The patient and caregiver are then seen together by the social worker for a 30 minute assessment of social needs. After the social work assessment the patient is assessed alone by the psychosocial nurse for coping and adjustment to illness while the caregiver is assessed alone by the Caregiver Network Facilitator. These individual assessments take 30 minutes.
The whole clinic assessment should not take any longer than 90 minutes.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to quantify the differences in communication that occurs within the patient, family care giver and health professional triadic consultation.
The tape recorded interviews will be transcribed verbatim and the content coded to quantify communication variables. A grounded theory approach is utilised for the qualitative component of the study.NVivo software will be utilised to analyse the qualitative component of the study.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary objective is to establish the emotional content of consultation clinics when patients are seen together with their caregivers and compare that to when they are seen apart. This will be assessed through coding of the transcripts. The coding will identify the use of open and closed questions, cues that are ignored, who is dominating the conversation and any expression of tears will be coded as high emotional impact. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample of 30 patients and 30 caregivers has been chosen. This is a mixed methods study. The sample size for the qualitative components will be reached through saturation of themes. The coding of communication variables will be conducted on the transcripts of consultations with 30 patients and their caregivers combined with the health care professional, and then with the same 30 patients alone with health care professionals and the same 30 caregivers alone with health care professionals. This will provide a total of 90 transcripts to be coded, which will provide sufficient power to enable group comparisons.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research design: This will be conducted as a mixed methods study within the psychosocial outpatient clinic setting where patients are seen together by the Nurse Practitioner and Social Worker and then separated so that the patient is seen by the psychosocial nurse alone and the caregiver is seen by the Caregiver Network Facilitator alone. The Caregiver Network Facilitator is a relatively new role introduced into the palliative care team as a support role to assist family caregivers to mobilise their own social networks.
Methods:
Tape recorded interviews of patients and their caregivers seen both together and separately will be transcribed verbatim, and the content coded to quantify communication variables. The coding will identify the use of open and closed questions, cues that are ignored, who is dominating the conversation and any crying that takes place. Coding will be conducted by the chief investigator with one other investigator coding some of the transcripts to ensure coding reliability. 
A grounded theory approach is utilised for the qualitative component of the study, as it involves the reading of transcripts, identifying possible themes, comparing and contrasting themes and building theoretical models. NVivo software will be utilised to analyse the qualitative component of the study.
