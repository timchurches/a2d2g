  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia Caesarean section is most commonly performed under regional anaesthesia, usually spinal or epidural. These techniques are associated with a significant incidence of shivering which can cause the mother significant distress, prevent her from holding her baby &amp;  interfere with monitoring of blood pressure and other vital signs. Ondansetron is a widely used anti  nausea drug, with a good safety profile and very few adverse effects. It has been shown to reduce the incidence &amp; severity of shivering in non obstetric patients undergoing regional or general anaesthesia. We plan to investigate whether the prophylactic administration of ondansetron prior to regional anaesthesia will decrease the incidence and severity of shivering in women undergoing elective caesarean section.</summary>
