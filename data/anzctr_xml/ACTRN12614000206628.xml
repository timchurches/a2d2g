  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive the SaltSwitch smartphone application for 4-weeks.  SaltSwitch enables users to scan the barcode of a packaged food and receive an immediate, interpretive traffic light nutrition label on the phones screen.  Traffic lights are provided for four key nutrients:  total fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar.  Red indicates 'fine for an occasional treat'; amber is an 'okay choice'; but choosing green is even better.  The app also provides healthier lower-salt options to 'switch' to.  Use and acceptability of the app will be assessed by a follow-up questionnaire at the end of the intervention period (weeks 6). </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be enrolled by a Research Assistant via the telephone.  Stratified block randomisation will take place manually at the end of baseline (end of week 2).    The Research Assistant will use a set of pre-prepared envelopes to randomise households according to different stratum (ethnicity and age).  Envelopes will be stored in a locked cabinet to which only the Research Assistant holds the key.  Envelopes will be numbered and used in sequential order as per the randomisation list.  When a new participant is ready to be randomised, the next envelope for that participants stratum will be used.  The Research Assistant will telephone particiants to notify them of the group they have been randomised to.</concealment>
    <sequence>A statistician will create a computer-generated randomisation list according to stratum (ethnicity and age) which will be used to prepare the randomisation envelopes.  The randomisation list will be stored in a secure electronic folder, and the envelopes will be prepared by a Research Assistant not involved in the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One in five New Zealanders 35-years and older already has cardiovascular disease (CVD).  Following a diet low in salt is especially important for these people because it can reduce their blood pressure and chance of another heart event.  However, many people with CVD find making heart healthy food choices confusing and difficult.  A simple, free smartphone application (app) providing shoppers with interpretive nutrition labels could provide a novel solution.  The aim of this trial is to determine the effect of the SaltSwitch smartphone app on the salt content of food purchases made by households with at least one member with diagnosed CVD.  The primary hypothesis is that 4-weeks intervention with the SaltSwitch smartphone app will reduce the mean salt content of household food purchases compared with control.</summary>
