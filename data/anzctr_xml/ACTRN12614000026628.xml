  <interventions>
    <interventions>A nasal spray containing saline solution and 1.6 mg/ml carrageenan will be taken by participants in the active group during cold season.  Each participant will take one spray into each nostril 3 times each day for 8 weeks.  The participants will take a daily record of cold symptoms and a nasal swab will be taken at the beginning and end of the study, as well as when cold symptoms develop, to ascertain levels of rhinovirus in the nose.

    <concealment>Our current HRC programme He Kainga Oranga/Community Housing and Health Intervention Research Programme (12/1071) examines whether simple bedroom interventions can reduce the incidence of rhinovirus infection in children, and involves collection of a two month Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI) symptom diary from each child over winter with viral swabs taken at the beginning and end of the period.  The parents from this study will be asked to participate in this double-blinded randomised controlled trial of Iota Carrageenan.  Allocation concealment will be by central computer randomisation. </concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation will occur by using using a randomisation table created by computer software, applied at the time of recruitment. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>In the parental age group 20-45 years, the frequency of reported respiratory illness is 2-3 episodes per year, most of which are likely to occur during the peak rhinovirus months of autumn, winter and spring. Assuming that 75% of parents develop cold symptoms during the two months of symptom diaries, then 40 subjects in each group will have 80% power (0.05) to detect a reduction to 42.2% (ie a 44% relative reduction) in the number of parents who develop cold symptoms. Comparison between groups will be made using Chi square tests for the primary outcome and ordinal or nominal distributed variables. Students t tests will be used for continuous variables, such as rhinoviral loads, after log transformation if they are not normally distributed. If they are not normalised by transformation then non parametric tests will be used. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot randomised control trial (RCT) to investigate whether using nasal Iota Carrageenan spray is protective against the development of colds caused by rhinovirus. The regular spraying of Iota Carrageenan may reduce the incidence of rhinovirus infections by blocking the binding of virus particles to nasal cells. If successful, the pilot study data will be used as the basis of a larger study to examine whether Iota Carrageenan can reduce rhinovirus infections among asthmatic adults.</summary>
