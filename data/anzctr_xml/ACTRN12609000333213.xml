  <interventions>
    <interventions>At baseline, eligible patients in treatment practices (ie those with T2DM &amp;/or CHD and will be screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) .  A score of 5 or over indicates the patient has mild, moderate, moderately severe or severe depression and is eligible for inclusion in the study.

These patients will be recalled for an assessment of lifetyle, biometric (see Key secondary outcome below) and psychological risk factors.

Based on this assessment, a Practice Nurse will draft a Care Plan jointly with the patient prioritising risk factors and documenting appropriate behavioural goals to ameliorate these risk factors.  The Plan will be reviewed by the patient's General Practitioner (GP) and endorsed or revised as appropriate.
The treatment goals may comprise a range of interventions including: 
Medication (eg selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilisers)
Psychological counselling (eg one on one group sessions with a psychologist using cognitive behavioural techniques) over three to six months.
Exercise program (this might consist of a range of approaches, depending on patient preferences and resource availability; eg a self led personal exercise program such a regular walking; a referral to a gym or an exercise physiologist, the latter initially for an Medical Benefits Schedule subsidised 8 session group program based on an individualised assessment.  Further participation will be subject to user pays )
Patients will then be recalled for regular monitoring by the practice nuse/GP team at 3, 6 9 and 12 months visits.
At each visit the patients progress will be reviewed:
The patient's goals set at the previous session will be reviewed, outcomes recorded and goals changed or modifed if appropriate.
The PHQ-9 questionnaire will be re-administered and the patient's  score will be monitored to guide any changes to the treatment care plan.

A quality of life measure (Short Form 36 [SF36 version 2] will be administered at baseline and 6 and 12 month visits.</interventions>
    <comparator>participating General Practitioners (GPs) in control practices will be advised of the identity codes of patients who have scored 5 or over on the PHQ-9 instrument (ie indicative for mild, moderate, moderate severe or severe depression) and asked to provide them with non defined usual care for 6 months.  Intervention will be at the GPs discretion.

Such usual care may comprise a range of interventions by the GP or the Practice Nurse including the following:
it may or may not include medication (eg selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilisers)
it may or may not include psychological counselling (eg one on one group sessions with a psychologist using cognitive behavioural techniques) over three to six months
It may or may not include an exercise program (eg referral to an exercise physiologist or gym)
Pateints may or may not be recalled for regular monitoring by the practice nuse/GP team at intervals.
The patients progress may or may not be reviewed:
Behavioural goals for the patient may or may not be set
Behavioural goals may or may not be reviewed at subsequent visits
Outcomes may or may not be recorded and goals changed or modifed if appropriate.

At the end of of the 6 month period of usual care:
the PHQ-9 questionnaire will be re-administered.
A quality of life measure (Short Form 36 [SF36 version 2] will be administered.
The nature of intervention for each patient that was initiated by the Control Practice over the previous six months will be documented.

There are fundamental differences between the interventions for patients in the Treatment practices and the Control practices: eg
In the former, patients will experience a mandated twelve month period of regular review at three monthly intervals.  
Their care will be provide by a team comprising a Practice Nurse and GP
A Care Plan detailing key risk factors (Lifestyle, biometric and psychological) will be prepared and behavioural goals set and reviewed systematically</comparator>

    <concealment>Meetings at three sites (northern Rivers, Melbourne and Adelaide South and West) were organised by the local Division (Network) of General Practice.  Invitations to atttend the meeting were issued to all practices in the three study areas.  Divisional staff subsequently interviewed practice representatives who had expressed an interest in participating until the quota for each area was reached (6,6,3 and 3).  The practices who agreed to participate were  then randomly allocated to the treatment cluster and control cluster using a computer based random number generator.</concealment>
