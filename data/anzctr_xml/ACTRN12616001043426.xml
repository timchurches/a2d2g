  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a retrospective translational research study on breast cancer patients treated with dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy. FFPE tumor samples and blood samples were obtained between 2010 and 2013 at diagnosis and were collected from the treating institutions where they were stored for the purposes of this translational research study between 2/2016 and 6/2016 in order to evaluate the prognostic role of protein expression, mRNA levels, gene amplification and mutations of key cellular elements in association with measures of outcome (overall survival, disease-free survival). The follow-up of each patient will be at least 10 years from patient enrolement.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of prognostic value of each biomarker (exploratory outcome of protein expression, mRNA levels, gene amplification and mutation of key cellular elements e.g. HER2 protein and mRNA expression and gene amplification) with disease-free survival (DFS). DFS was defined as the interval from study entry to first locoregional recurrence, first distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, secondary neoplasm, death from the disease or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3, 5 and 10 years post enrolment </timepoint>

      <outcome>Evaluation of prognostic value of each biomarker (exploratory outcome of protein expression, mRNA levels, gene amplification and mutation of key cellular elements e.g. HER2 protein and mRNA expression and gene amplification) with overall survival (OS). OS was measured from study entry until death from any cause.</outcome>
