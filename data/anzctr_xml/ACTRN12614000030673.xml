  <interventions>
    <interventions>The school-based health education and exercise program consists of eighteen 1-hour sessions which will be held on a weekly basis. The program is scheduled according to the school calendar, and there will be no sessions during exam period, special school events, and school holidays. The content of the program include 1) health education workshops (5 hours) on the benefits and basis knowledge about physical activity; 2) Fitness-walking exercise (3 hours) and 3) skill training sessions (10 hours) on skipping (for boys and girls), street dancing (for girls) and martial arts (for boys).  

To encourage students' participation and adherence to the program, the program activities will be designed as team-based activities or games so students can learn in a fun and relaxing atmosphere. The activities are facilitated by instructors and coaches who are currently studying in college, and these "big brothers big sisters" will stand as a role model for the students. The research team will also work closely with the school teachers on any feedback throughout the program. Students who complete 80% of the program will be awarded with an attendance certificate. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study aim: To assess the effectiveness of a school-based health intervention program in promoting physical activity and fostering positive development among adolescents in Hong Kong.

Design: This study employs a quasi-experimental design. Four schools with similar socio-economic backgroud in Shatin/ Ma On Shan area will be invited to participate in this program. The four schools will be randomized into the intervention and control groups. Eligible students will be invited to participate in the program while no program will be implemented in the control schools.

Setting: Secondary schools in Hong Kong 

Participants: F1 and F2 students (aged 12-14) from the participating schools. 

Intervention: Eligible students will be invited to attend a 18-week school-based health promotion program developed based on the findings from formative research. Students in the control schools will not receive any program. 

Primary outcome measures: weight and height, body fat composition, physical fitness, physical activity level and perceptions on physical activity.
