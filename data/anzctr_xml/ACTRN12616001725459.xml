  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cough is a very common problem in childhood. Chronic wet or productive cough can be distressing and irritating, both for children living with it and their families. The journey through investigations, diagnoses and management can be diverse and costly.
This project (also known as a clinical trial) aims to compare two weeks versus four weeks of an antibiotic (amoxycillin clavulanic acid) for the treatment of chronic wet cough in children. This antibiotic is widely used by respiratory doctors however there is little evidence to support the correct duration. This project aims to determine if
two or four weeks of amoxycillin clavulanic acid (Augmentin Duo) cures the wet cough and helps to delay the time until the child becomes unwell again with wet cough.
This project also aims to improve our understanding on the bacteria found in the airways of children with wet cough and antibiotic resistance.
Children can be enrolled if they need antibiotics to treat their chronic wet cough (defined as &gt;4 weeks of wet cough).
All children enrolled will receive 2 weeks of amoxycillin clavulanic acid and then another 2 weeks of either placebo or amoxycillin clavulanic acid. The study duration will be for 7 months in total; 1 month on study medications and 6
months of follow up via phone.</summary>
