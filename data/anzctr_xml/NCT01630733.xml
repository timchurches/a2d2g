  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Primary endpoint and variable for the study is overall survival (OS), defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival per RECIST v1.1 - Progression Free Survival: time from date of randomization to first objective documented progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Tumor lesions measured in at least one dimension with minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan, 10 mm caliper by clinical exam. Malignant lymph nodes must be &gt;15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate as defined by RECIST v1.1. - Objective Response (OR) is defined as achieving a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as defined using RECIST v1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Disease Control - The Duration of Disease Control is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study) or death, whichever occurs first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events - Adverse events and concomitant medications will be collected throughout the study up to 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. Medical history will be assessed, mutation status will be collected, if available, and an electrocardiogram will be performed at screening. Physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory evaluations will be conducted at screening and throughout the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Objective Response - The evaluation of overall response at each assessment is a composite of target lesion response, non-target lesion response, presence of new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate - The disease control rate will be calculated as the total number of patients in each group with best overall response of CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) divided by the total number of randomized patients in the group and will be compared similarly as Objective Response Rate (ORR.)</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
