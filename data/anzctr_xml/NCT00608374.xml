  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as chlorambucil and fludarabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. It is not yet known whether chlorambucil is more effective than
      fludarabine in treating Waldenström macroglobulinemia, splenic lymphoma, or lymphoplasmacytic
      lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chlorambucil to see how well it works
      compared with fludarabine as first-line therapy in treating patients with previously
      untreated Waldenström macroglobulinemia, splenic lymphoma, or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.</summary>
