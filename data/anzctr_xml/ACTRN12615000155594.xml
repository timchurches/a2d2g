  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a web based Colorectal cancer RISk Prediction tool (CRISP) risk assessment tool utilising a risk model to provide patients with a personalised risk assessment and colorectal cancer screening advice based on their risk.
Patients in the intervention group will be invited to complete the risk tool with a trained researcher prior to a consultation with their GP. The tool will take a maximum of 7 minutes and will be completed at baseline only. Participants will receive their risk of colorectal cancer and screening advice based on their risk which they will take with them into their consultation with their GP. All participants will also complete a paper based survey collecting information about cancer risk perception, worry and bowel cancer screening intention and behaviour at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after recruitment. The follow up survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete and will be sent through the post.</interventions>
    <comparator>'Usual care' in a primary care clinic as well as general information about 'How to Cut Cancer Risk' from the Cancer Council of Victoria. 'Usual care' implies screening for colorectal cancer will be based on the NHMRC guidelines for colorectal cancer screening. Control patients will be having a consultation without being provided with absolute risk of colorectal cancer.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of participants who have had risk-appropriate screening for colorectal cancer after 12 months follow-up. Risk-appropriate screening will be determined by current NHMRC colorectal cancer screening guidelines. Data will include patient self-report and results of faecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy from GP records, Medicare, the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program and the Victorian Admitted Episodes Data (VAED).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health service utilisation and health care costs. We will measure GP consultations, referrals for colonoscopy, and completion of FOBT. Costs of delivering the CRISP and control consultations will be calculated.

    <concealment>Primary care patients between 50 and 75 years old waiting to attend an appointment with their GP will be approached by a trained research assistant who will check their age and invite them to discuss a trial. The RA will take interested patients to a research fellow/nurse in a private room who will determine eligibility and then follow the informed consent protocol if they are interested and eligible patients. Once consented, the researcher will randomise the patient and then if in the intervention group, the researcher will go through the risk tool (CRISP) with the patient, and provide risk output and screening advice which they will pass on to their GP. If in the control group, the patient will not discuss bowel cancer screening. Both groups will be given questionnaires and information about general cancer prevention.
Detailed information including recruitment rate and feasibility issues will be recorded by the two researchers who will be recruiting.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence has been generated by a statistician and unknown by the researcher. The sequence generated is either 'A' or 'B'. Following the generated sequence in order, either an 'A' or a 'B' on a folded piece of paper has been placed in non see-through envelopes which have then been numbered on the outside from 1 to 110. This has been completed by another researcher (not conducting the randomisation). The researcher doing the consenting and randomisation will assign 'A' or 'B' as 'intervention' or 'control' by flipping a coin at the beginning of the trial, then inform the statistician which is which. Both recruiting researchers will be blinded to the contents of the envelopes until a participant consents and then the researcher will email the participant number and 'A' or 'B' to the statistician so they can keep an independent record.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is aiming to test an intervention led by the practice nurse in general practice to discuss people's risk of bowel cancer and screening tests to diagnose it early. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a primary care patient aged between 50 and 74 years who has an appointment with a general practitioner (GP) who is participating in this study. Anyone who has had a previous colorectal cancer diagnosis will not be eligible. Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will continue to receive the usual care in the primary care clinic. Participants in the other group will go through a web-based colorectal cancer risk assessment with the practice nurse, who will then provide risk output and screening advice which can be discussed with their GP. Our primary aim is to determine how feasible the implementation of this tool is. The results of this feasibility study will assist in the design of a future Australian wide study before it is used more widely in practice. The research is part of a larger body of research: the 'NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence for Reducing the Burden of Colorectal Cancer by Optimising Screening: Evidence to Clinical Practice'.</summary>
