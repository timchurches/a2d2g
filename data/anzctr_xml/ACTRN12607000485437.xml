  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomly allocated into groups to commence the trial (placebo and  treatment condition). The SAM-e condition receive capsules containing SAM-e 400mg. Subjects will be required to take the capsule daily in the morning throughout the trial. Each treatment condition is of 8 weeks duration. This repeated measures design is of 8 weeks duration in total.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo condition receive capsules that are of identical appearance but containing no SAM-e. Subjects will be required to take the capsule daily in the morning throughout the trial. Treatment condition is of 8 weeks duration.</comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects were referred by their medical practitioner and attended an information evening where they were enrolled. For each diagnostic category, those who meet the inclusion criteria are then randomly allocated to a starting treatment condition to determine the order of treatments in this trial. Allocation concealment was achieved by using a central randomisation table created by computer software. Both subject and experimenter will be blind to the treatment conditions.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fundamentally, the trial aims to conduct a gold-standard test of the clinical impact of SAM-e in the treatment of depressed mood and general symptoms of fibromyalgia (FMS)

As such, salient clinical and pathological parameters will be assessed over a 16-week period in 70 patients who will be provided with the supplement (8 weeks) and placebo preparation (8 weeks). On the basis of previous literature, it is hypothesised that patients in the active treatment group will experience moderate but significant improvements across the clinical measures, and that these gains will be significantly greater than any reported in the placebo group. All patients will provide informed consent. All procedures will be conducted under medical supervision and the preparation itself is very safe when used in the manner proposed for the trial.</summary>
