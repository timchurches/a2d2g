  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to see whether taking the drug metformin in addition to drug aromatase inhibitor can stop cancer cell activity in hormone receptor positive breast cancer in post menopausal women waiting for surgery. Who is it for? This study is open to postmenopausal women aged 18 and over, with Stage 1 or 2 operable invasive breast cancer scheduled for surgery. Further inclusion and exclusion details for this study can be found in the relevant sections in this form. Trial details In this study, you will be randomised to one of two groups. Arm 1 will involve taking 2 weeks of metformin (oral tablets, 1 gm per day) followed by 2 weeks of metformin (oral tablets, 1gm per day) in addition to aromatase inhibitor (oral tablets 1 mg per day Arimidex (trade name) or oral tablets 2.5 mg per day Femara (trade name)) in the lead up to your scheduled surgery. If you are randomised to Arm 2, you will receive 2 weeks of metformin (oral tablets, 1gm per day) followed by 2 weeks of aromatase inhibitor alone (oral tablets 1 mg per day Arimidex (trade name) or oral tablets 2.5 mg per day Femara (trade name).</summary>
