  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this Phase III study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      two fixed-dose combinations of inhaled aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate, aclidinium
      bromide, formoterol fumarate and placebo in patients with moderate to severe Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Long-term efficacy, pharmacoeconomic and health-related
      quality of life assessments will also be evaluated. This extension study will include a 28
      week treatment period, followed by a four week follow up visit. All patients will remain in
      the same treatment group as for the lead-in study and continue on one of the four treatment
      arms or placebo.</summary>
