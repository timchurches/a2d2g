  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lactation counseling given to mothers by certified lactation counselors via telephone twice monthly to each lactating mother plus the current conventional care (thus it is expected that every mother will receive twelve lactation counselings at the end of the study). Contacts are discontinued at any time if mother decide to completely stop breast feeding. Mothers are allowed to receive the current conventional care (postnatal breast feeding promotion or support by own healthcare provider). The duration of each lactation counseling depends on each of the mothers' need. This intervention will be conducted for 6 months postpartum for every participant in the intervention group.  

Lactation counselors in this study are the nursing staffs from Maternity Hospital Kuala Lumpur who are certified as lactation counselors (have undergone 40 hours lactation management and counseling course).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study attempts to provide data whether the change in the conduct of lactation counseling could help in the promotion of breast feeding, particularly exclusive breast feeding among mothers. The antenatal breast feeding programme within the Malaysian public health care system can be considered as good as almost all of the public hospitals have been certified as Baby Friendly Hospital. However, it was noted from observation and personal experience that there is lacking in the postnatal support for lactating mothers in Malaysia.

Among the questions that may be resolved from this research are:
1.	Is there any difference in the breast feeding patterns among mothers if there is change in the conduct of lactation counseling, or will telephone lactation counseling cause the change in breast feeding pattern?
2.	What are the factors that will influence the mothers breast feeding practices?
3.	What is the probability of mothers to continue breast feeding if they were subjected to different postnatal support programme?
4.	What are the factors associated with the failure of exclusive breastfeeding?
5.	What are the common lactating problems among mothers in Malaysia?


Thus, the primary objective of this research is to study the effects of telephone-based lactational counseling towards the breast feeding patterns among mothers in Kuala Lumpur. 

The specific objectives are:
1. To determine the proportion of different breast feeding patterns between the intervention (received proactive lactation counseling and the current breast feeding promotion programme) mainly, exclusive breast feeding, predominant breast feeding, complimentary feeding and stopped breast feeding. 
2. To determine the other factors associated with the different breast feeding outcomes. 
3. To determine the common problems discussed among the lactating mothers with the lactation counselors
4. To determine the factors associated with the failure of exclusive breastfeeding

The Null hypothesis, Ho in this study is: there is no difference in the proportion of different breast feeding practices between the intervention and the control group</summary>
