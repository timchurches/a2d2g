      <timepoint>Ten mL of arterial blood will be taken immediately before (T 0) the first dose of aspirin (or at T0 in control patients not treated with aspirin) and after 1 hour (T 1), T 1.5, T 4, T 8, T 24, T 32, T 48.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of trends in clinical outcomes shown by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score reductions in treated compared with control populations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily measures for 2 days during study period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of safety as measured by new onset bleeding or renal injury among aspirin and untreated disease controls in ICU patients with sepsis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous clinical observation during ICU stay for study period and further 3 days for new onset bleeding. Daily measure of urea and electrolytes for renal injury (increase by greater than factor of two in baseline creatinine) during study period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Ninety critically ill adult patients over 18 years of age with SIRS or sepsis (infected site plus SIRS) will be enrolled having given informed consent. Study subjects will be required to have not taken aspirin in the 6 weeks prior to admission to ICU. An untreated control population consisting of 45 patients with SIRS or sepsis that are not treated with aspirin will be recruited and blood samples will be drawn to allow comparison of changes in PD parameters with aspirin treated patients.</inclusivecriteria>

 coagulopathy with INR&gt;2 or active bleeding (eg, trauma, gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding) will be excluded. Patients with pre-existing renal injury as per RIFLE guidelines will be excluded. 
Patients will have study medications ceased if there is evidence of hypersensitivity to aspirin (new onset of severe bronchospasm or urticarial rash), renal injury (serum creatinine doubling / GFR reducing by &gt; 50%) or new onset of bleeding.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proposal will examine the impact of aspirin on 15-epi-lipoxin A4 biosynthesis in severely ill patients for the first time. Low doses of aspirin have been clearly demonstrated to modulate this anti-inflammatory pathway. We will define the pharmacokinetics of low doses of aspirin in SIRS/sepsis patients providing critical information for future large-scale use of this agent in this population. Focusing on aspirin triggered lipoxins (ATL), we will explore the pharmacodynamics of low dose aspirins effects in SIRS/sepsis patients. This will extend previous measurements of beneficial impacts on nitric oxide, PMN apoptosis and TNF secretion by systematically analysing adaptive and innate immunological processes. The clinical trial is designed to be definitive and provide a clear answer on the basis with which to proceed to large-scale intervention trials.</summary>
