  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
      (ADME) of ASA404 following a single intravenous administration of 3000 mg (approximately 1800
      mg/m2) ASA404 containing 60 µCi of 14C over a period of 20 minutes in patients with advanced
      solid tumors. Metabolic pathways, route (s) of elimination, distribution characteristics in
      plasma and blood, and exposure characterization in plasma and blood, and exposure
      characterization of the parent drug and metabolites will be obtained from the study.</summary>
