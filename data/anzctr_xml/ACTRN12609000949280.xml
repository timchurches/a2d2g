  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study 1 and Study 2 will be conducted seperately and consist of different volunteers. 
Subjects within each study will undergo 5 treatments, in double-blind, randomised, cross over fashion. Gastrointestinal (GI) motility, hormone release, appetite and energy intake will be evaluated. The nutrient infusions will be administered for 120 min at a rate of 3 kcal/min, corresponding to the average rate of postprandial gastric emptying treatments. Treatments within each study will be  separated by 7-10 days.

Study 1 will evalutate:
i) lipid
ii) carbohydrate
iii) protein
iv) macronutrient combination of lipid:carbohydrate:protein (30:50:20)
v) saline control

Study 2 will evaluate:
i) lipid
ii) protein
iii) protein:lipid (2:1)
iv) protein:lipid (1:2)
v) saline control</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Antropyloroduodenal motility - During the 120 minute infusion antropyloduodenal motility was assessed via changes in the pressures within specific portion of the gastrointestinal tract (antrum, pylorus and duodenum) which was captured by sensors on the catheter, and connected to a computer-based system, running commercially available hardware (Flexisoft)</outcome>
      <timepoint>-15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite and hunger  - Using visual analogue scale questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>-15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 150 minutes</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hormone release - Cholecystokinin (CCK) and Peptide YY (PYY). Blood samples were drawn from subjects every 15 minutes until t=90, and then once more at t=120. Radioimmuno assays were used to determine the concentration of these hormones in plasma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>-15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 and 150 minutes</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake - At t = 120 min the infusion will be discontinued, and the subject extubated and offered a cold buffet-style meal (t = 120 - 150 min). The meal will be weighted before and after consumption to for the assessment of energy intake using Foodwork</outcome>
      <timepoint>120 minutes</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects will all be healthy males between age 18 -55 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 - 25 kg/m2.

    <exclusivecriteria>Each subject will be questioned prior to the study to exclude:
(1)	significant GI symptoms; disease or surgery
(2)	current use of prescribed or non-prescribed medications (including vitamins and herbal supplements) which may affect energy metabolism, GI function, body weight or appetite (eg domperidone and cisapride, anticholinergic drugs (eg atropine), metoclopramide, erythromycin, hyoscine, orlistat, green tea extracts, Astragalus, St Johns Wort etc.)
(3)	diabetes mellitus 
(4)	individuals with low blood iron levels

(8)	allergy to local anaesthetic
(9)	intake of &gt; 20 g alcohol on a daily basis 
(10)	smokers (cigarettes/cigars/marijuana)
(11)	unrestrained eaters, as determined by a score of =12 on the eating restraint questionnaire component of the eating questionnaire.</exclusivecriteria>
