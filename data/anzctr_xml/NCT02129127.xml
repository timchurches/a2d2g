  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Late Lumen Loss (LLL) - LLL is determined by assessing the difference between the minimum lumen diameter (MLD) immediately after treatment with the DCC and the MLD at angiographic follow-up. LLL will determined by the Angiographic Core Laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 Months (BTK) or 6 Months (ATK)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device Success - This is defined as the percentage of procedures that accomplish less than 30% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection at target lesion after DCC treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approx 1 hour</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Technical Success - This is defined as the percentage of cases in which the DCC is able to be delivered to and inflated at the intended target lesion location successfully.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approx 1 hour</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device Related Adverse Events (AEs) - Occurrence and Severity of any DCC Related AEs will be analyzed</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freedom from Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) - This will calculate the number of patients who do not require a clinically indicated TLR. Clinically indicated TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention at the DCC target lesion or bypass surgery at the DCC target vessel performed for &gt;50% restenosis or another complication of the target lesion</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days / 3 Months (BTK only) / 6 Months / 12 Months (ATK only)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Amputation Free Survival - This is a composite endpoint which counts the number of patients who experience limb salvage. Patients will fail this endpoint if they undergo a major amputation (defined as unplanned amputation at or above the ankle) or if a procedure related death occurs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days / 3 Months (BTK only) / 6 Months / 12 Months (ATK only)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patency - The percentage of cases in which the treated lesion is patent. Patency is demonstrated by a Peak Systolic Velocity ratio &lt;2.5 at the target lesion assessed on Duplex Ultrasound without the need for re-intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 Months / 12 Months (ATK only)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This first-in-man study is to evaluate the Drug-Coated Chocolate (DCC) Balloon for
      percutaneous arterial angioplasty in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.
      The study focuses on acute device performance and peri-procedural safety and also seeks to
      further characterize the performance of the device.</summary>
