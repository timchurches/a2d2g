  <interventions>
    <interventions>Broccoli-enriched diet (200 g of microwave-steamed broccoli with lunch and dinner) for 6 days (Days 3-8).

Two food diaries will be used to monitor adherence to the diet. Furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate (a broccoli constituent responsible for changes in CYP-enzyme activity) will be detected in participant plasma using an HPLC assay.

Five drugs will be administered as CYP-isoform-selective probes to assess enzyme activity. On study days, participants will receive 100 mg caffeine (CYP1A2), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19), 25 mg losartan (CYP2C9), 30 mg dextromethorphan (CYP2D6) and 2 mg midazolam (CYP3A4) in 5% dextrose solution. All medicines will be administered orally.

The phenotyping cocktail will be administered before (Day 1), concomitantly with (Day 2) and 6 days after a broccoli-enriched diet (Day 9). Please note, the broccoli-enriched diet is administered for 6 days from Days 3-8 (inclusive) with a single 200 g amount concomitantly administered with the cocktail on Day 2.</interventions>
    <comparator>Prospective, sequential design; each participant is their own control i.e. before broccoli-enriched diet versus after broccoli-enriched diet</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 as per the below metrics. CYP-isoform-specific probe-drug concentrations will be measured using a previously-validated LC-MS/MS assay. 

Please note that this is not a composite primary outcome but five discreet, independent study endpoints.

CYP1A2: Ratio of paraxanthine to caffeine plasma concentrations (micromol/L) at 4 hours post-dose
CYP2C19: Ratio of 5-hydroxyomeprazole to omeprazole plasma concentrations (nmol/L) at 4 or 6 hours post-dose (at 4 hours if detectable otherwise at 6 hours)
CYP2C9: Ratio of EXP-3174 AUC0-6h to losartan AUC0-6h
CYP2D6: Ratio of dextrorphan AUC0-6h to dextromethorphan AUC0-6h
CYP3A4: Ratio of 1-hydroxymidazolam AUC0-6h to midazolam AUC0-6h

If the distribution of CYP isoform activities is normal then a paired t-test will be used to test these hypotheses at a significance level of p = 0.05. In the case that the distribution of CYP isoform activities is not normal the non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test will be performed instead.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On Day 1 (baseline), Day 2 (short-term broccoli condition) and Day 9 (medium-term broccoli condition) at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h post-dose of the CYP phenotyping cocktail.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Endpoints (CYP activity metrics) will be natural-log-transformed and analysed using a linear mixed-effects model as per recent studies utilising a phenotyping cocktail approach. This technique has demonstrated suitability for analysing crossover, repeat-measures data of this nature. Least-squares means and standard errors of the differences between endpoints across study days will be log-back-transformed and presented as geometric mean ratios with 90% confidence intervals (p = 0.1) as in recently published studies.

While the variability of CYP activity varies between isoforms, CYP1A2 is recognised as having one of the highest inter-subject variabilities. Further, multiple studies performed by our research group have focused on this isoform and as such, robust data are available for more accurate assessments of its variability in this study's target populations.

A sample size calculation has been performed with guidance from a biostatistician using the GLIMMPSE sample size calculator for crossover studies with repeat-measures found at http://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org. At 80% power with a standard deviation of 0.3 (from the literature and our group's previous research) a total sample size of n = 12 (n = 6 in each ancestry group) is required to detect a difference of up to 25% in the primary endpoint with an alpha of 0.1 (90% confidence interval approach commonly used in studies of this nature).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will aim to observe the short- and medium-term effects of a broccoli-enriched diet on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 in men of European and South Asian ancestry.

It has been hypothesised that the broccoli-enriched diet will initially reduce the activity of these CYP-isoforms and increase their activity after 6 days of consumption.</summary>
