    <interventions>Intervention: The Integrated Family Intervention for Child Conduct Problems (Dadds &amp; Hawes, 2006)
Program description and procedure: The program consists of 10 x 1  hour treatment sessions focusing on managing child aggression, non-compliance and disruptive behaviour. Parents are empowered to strengthen and develop strategies that encourage positive child behaviour by giving attachment rich positive reinforcement and rewards, and discourage challenging behaviour through the provision of consistent, attachment and emotionally neutral behaviour management strategies. The program also includes modules that address parental mental health, marital adjustment and family communication, and, additional modules to address specific concerns such as management of anxiety and worry, emotion regulation  and school consultation.
Mode: The intervention is delivered face-to-face in an individual family format (not group).
Location: The program is delivered at the Child Behaviour Research Clinic.
The program is delivered by clinical psychologists, psychologists and provisionally registered psychologists under the supervision of senior clinicians. 
Materials/resources: The program is delivered as per the therapist manual for The Integrated Family Intervention for Child Conduct Problems (Dadds &amp; Hawes, 2006)</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Children with conduct problems (DSM-V Oppositional Defiant Disorder and or Conduct Disorder) as assessed using the DISCAP V. We adhere to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) guidelines that research into the externalising disorders is compromised by exclusion of the major and naturally occurring comorbidities, Thus ADHD, affective/anxiety disorders, learning problems, and mild autistic features are allowed if conduct problems are also present and the child is not receiving or is stabilised on psychoactive medication in relation to them at the time of assessment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The REAL Treatment project will investigate the inter-play between evidenced-based interventions that improve the child caregiving context, childhood behavioural outcomes, and, changes in DNA methylation of the major neurodevelopmental genes. 400 Children aged 2 to 8 years and their families will be recruited through the Sydney Child Behaviour Research Clinic over a 4 year period to participate in the REAL Treatment Study: A parenting Intervention for Child Conduct Problems. Families and the research team will form a supportive partnership to assess and monitor a childs behavioural, emotional and neurodevelopmental progress, as well as parenting progress and family environment over the course of a 6 to 10 week tailored, evidenced-based parenting intervention to address child conduct problems. 

Assessments will be taken prior to and directly after receipt of the intervention as well as at a three month follow-up review assessment. Assessment will cover areas including: Child adjustment and diagnostic status, caregiver/parent adjustment, family environment, engagement with and dose of intervention received, epigenetic assessment (buccal cell collection for methylation assessment) and neurodevelopmental assessment (examining processes of emotional attention and responsiveness to stimuli). A multi-informant assessment method will be applied throughout the research protocol that includes gathering data from: parents/caregivers; clinical interviews; the use of standardized questionnaire and psychometric assessments; coding of observational data of child and family interaction activities; and, teacher/educator reports and completion of questionnaires. 

We aim to a) confirm an emerging model of how epigenetic regulation of the major neurodevelopmental systems maps onto individual differences in comorbid symptom profiles before and after intervention; b) to examine how this regulation and mapping predicts individual differences in responsiveness of children to intervention that produces standardised and measurable improvements in the child caregiving environment; c) to examine how early intervention alters epigenetic regulation of the major neurodevelopmental systems and REAL (responsiveness, emotional attention and learning) phenomena, thus modifying risk versus protection for future development.
