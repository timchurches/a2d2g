  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is radical prostatectomy using a robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical technique, the Ohio State University Technique. This is is similar to the classical Montsouris technique but with some variations. The procedure takes approximately 3 hours.

This will be conducted at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH). An information booklet will be provided to the participant outlining expectations for the scheduled operation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is open radical prostatectomy, using the modified Scardino Technique. The procedure takes approximately 2-4 hours. This will be conducted at the Royal Brisbane &amp; Women's Hospital (RBWH). An information booklet will be provided to the participant outlining expectations for the scheduled operation.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Men will be recruited via the Royal Brisbane &amp; Women's Hospital (RBWH) Urology Outpatient Clinic and urologists' private practices. Eligible men who consent to take part will complete baseline assessment, and be randomly assigned to receive either robotic prostatectomy or open prostatectomy. Allocation concealment will occur, with randomisation being undertaken by the holder of the allocation schedule who is based at the central administration site. Randomisation will be concealed from investigators.  
 
Following randomisation, patients will be notified by mail of their designated surgical procedure, and given an information booklet outlining expectations for their scheduled operation. Patients are then placed on the surgical waitlist at the RBWH and scheduled a procedure as per hospital policy and processes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a computer generated table. Eligible participants will be stratified by age (40-49, 50-59, 60-69), prostate size (&lt;=80g, &gt;80g), IPSS (0-7, 8-19, 20-35), and need for lymphadenectomy.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase III single centre randomised controlled trial. The study aims to assess the differential clinical outcomes for 400 patiens undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) using an open versus robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical technique at the Royal Brisbane &amp; Women's Hospital, Australia. The study targets a number of unresolved issues in relation to RP for prostate cancer. These include the clinical oncological results from both open and robotic approaches in a randomised trial, the quality of life effects fom both treatments, economic costs to funding bodies and individual patients, and evaluates testing for the presence of prostate cancer and the biological aggressiveness of the tumour using prostatic fluid. Data will also be collected to develop an instrument for life expectancy prediction of these patients.</summary>
