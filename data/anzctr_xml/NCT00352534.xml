  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - therapeutic conventional surgery
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Other interventions - dactinomycin
Treatment: drugs - doxorubicin hydrochloride
Treatment: other - 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy

Experimental: Nephrectomy and re-evaluation (very low-risk disease) - Patients undergo nephrectomy only. If they meet criteria, they are then observed periodically for 5 years. Patients with recurrent disease undergo surgery (immediate or delayed) and receive chemotherapy as in stratum III. Patients with no metachronous renal disease receive radiotherapy. Patients with metachronous disease undergo renal-sparing surgery and chemotherapy as in stratum III, but no radiotherapy. Treatment continues for up to 25 weeks.

Experimental: Nephrectomy, chemotherapy (standard-risk, stg I or II) - Patients undergo nephrectomy. Between 9 and 14 days post-nephrectomy, patients receive vincristine IV beginning on day 1, every week for 10 weeks then every 3 weeks for a total of 15 doses. Patients receive dactinomycin IV beginning day 1, alternating every 3 weeks with doxorubicin hydrochloride IV for a total of 5 doses of dactinomycin and 4 doses of doxorubicin. Treatment continues for up to 25 weeks.

Experimental: Nephrectomy/biopsy, chemotherapy (standard-risk, stage III) - Patients undergo nephrectomy, if feasible, or biopsy. For patients who undergo biopsy only, definitive surgery is undertaken at week 7 or 13. Between 9 and 14 days post-nephrectomy, patients receive vincristine IV beginning on day 1 every week for 10 weeks then every 3 weeks for a total of 15 doses. Patients receive dactinomycin IV beginning day 1, alternating every 3 weeks with doxorubicin hydrochloride IV for a total of 5 doses of dactinomycin and 4 dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride. Patients undergo radiotherapy over 5-7 days after nephrectomy. Treatment continues for up to 25 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin with or without
      radiation therapy or observation only to see how well they work in treating patients
      undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III Wilms' tumor. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. Sometimes, after
      surgery, the tumor may not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case,
      observation may be sufficient.</summary>
