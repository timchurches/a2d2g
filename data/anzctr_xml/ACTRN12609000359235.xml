    <interventions>3-point compression ultrasonography for the diagnosis of proximal lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis performed by emergency physicians in the emergency department. 

This ultrasonographic examination only involves evaluation of the compressibility of specific veins at three sites: the common femoral vein just below the inguinal ligament, the great saphenous vein approximately 3 - 4cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction, and the popliteal vein in the popliteal fossa. 

It is a brief and simple examination which we expect to take less than 10 minutes to perform. 

Those performing the ultrasonography will be consultant emergency physicians: no doctor or healthcare worker of a lesser experience level will participate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Reference-standard formal full-leg duplex ultrasonography for the diagnosis of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis performed in the radiology department. 

This reference-standard ultrasonographic examination involves an interrogation of all the deep veins in the symptomatic limb, with Doppler flow measurements and other augmentation techniques. 

It is performed in the Radiology Department by an ultrasonographer technician, and then interpreted by a Radiologist. 

It is currently considered the practical 'gold-standard' in diagnosing lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). 

The duration of the actual examination itself can extend up to 30 - 40 minutes. 

Patients will first have the 3-point compression ultrasonographic index test performed in the Emergency Department by the Consultant Emergency Physician, and then have the reference-standard formal full-leg duplex ultrasonography performed in the Radiology Department. 

The referral for the Radiology Department ultrasonography will be made upon patient enrolment, and will occur as soon as possible after the Emergency Department ultrasonographic examination: the time between the examinations will vary, because the Radiology Department normally can only perform this type of ultrasonographic examination during working hours.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: sensitivity and specificity of 3-point compression ultrasonography for the diagnosis of proximal lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis when compared with reference-standard formal full-leg duplex ultrasonography.

The results of the 3-point compression ultrasonographic examinations will be collected through a Standard Data Collection Form and subsequently classified using a standardised protocol, as being either: positive, negative, or equivocal.

A positive examination will be one in which there is any evidence of any thrombus in any target vein. A negative examination will be one in which there is no evidence of any thrombus in any target vein. An equivocal examination will be one which is indeterminate: for example, if a particular vein cannot be confidently identified by the participating Consultant Emergency Physician.

In the event of a positive examination, participating Consultant Emergency Physicians will also record where any thrombus was identified.

In the event of an equivocal examination, the Consultant Emergency Physicians will record the reasons why they failed to complete an unequivocal examination.

These results will then be compared to the results of the reference-standard formal full-leg duplex ultrasonography performed in the Radiology Department, which will be taken from the Hospital electronic medical records system and then subjected to a similar standardised classification system.

Appropriate statistical modeling will be used to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy of the index test compared to the reference-standard test.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>learning curve experienced by consultant emergency physicians in performing the 3-point compression ultrasonography for the diagnosis of proximal lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis, represented by chronological location of false-positives, -negatives, and equivocal results in the context of their accumulating experience as they perform more examinations in the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>the duration of the study, 15 - 24 months.

This outcome will be assessed once the study has been completed. This will be possible as the Standard Data Collection Forms used to document the results of each ultrasonographic examination performed by each individual participating Consultant Emergency Physician will record adequate information to allow each single examination to be located in their individual series chronologically, and for the results of these examinations to be known.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>rate and cause of equivocal results returned by 3-point compression ultrasonography performed by consultant emergency physicians.

As previously outlined for Primary Outcome 1, the results of both the index and reference tests will be adequately recorded and will then be subjected to standardised classification systems.

3-point compression ultrasonographic examinations will be considered equivocal if: (a) any target vein could not be identified, OR (b) the clinician remains unsure as to whether thrombus was present at any target location.

The Standard Data Collection Forms will ensure adequate information is collected to enable this sub-classification to occur and for the cause of each 'equivocal' examination to be known.</outcome>

      <timepoint>the duration of the study, 15 - 24 months.

This will be assessed once the study has been completed. The Standard Data Collection Forms will ensure that all the data necessary to perform this analysis will be collected.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>anecdotal qualitative data gleaned from the experiences of the experienced consultant emergency physician through the Initial Training Period aspect of this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Initial Training Period of the study, 1 - 4 months.

This anecdotal qualitative outcome will be assessed following the completion of the 'Training Phase' of the study, once all participating Consultant Emergency Physicians have completed three supervised 3-point compression ultrasonographic examinations on patients fitting the selection criteria. 

 This will represent approximately 30 examinations in total, as approximately 10 Consultant Emergency Physicians are envisaged to take part.

The supervisor, AProf. Robert Dunn, will record this anecdotal qualitative data regarding the performance and learning-curve of the training participating Consultant Emergency Physicians on the Standard Data Collection Form he will use to first examine the patient with the 3-point compression technique, before continuing to supervise the training participating Consultant Emergency Physicians.

AProf. Dunn is highly experienced in the use of ultrasonography to diagnose DVT with a 3-point technique.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>statistical analysis of the rate at which consultant emergency physicians are able to correctly predict that their ultrasonographic examination shall return equivocal results.

Participating Consultant Emergency Physicians will, before beginning each ultrasonographic examination in the trial, be asked to predict whether the examination will be equivocal or unequivocal. 

Their predictions will be compared to their actual results, as recorded on the Standard Data Collection Forms, and as classified via the standardised classification protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>the duration of the study, 15 - 24 months.

This outcome will be assessed once the study has been completed.

The relevant data will be recorded on the Standard Data Collection Form for each 3-point compression ultrasonographic examination, and so this post-study assessment will be possible.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>statistical analysis of the association between the reported patient factors of obesity, degree of inaccessibility of the sites required for the 3-point compression ultrasonographic examination, history of vascular surgery on the symptomatic limb and history of deep venous thrombosis as reported by the patient, and equivocal results returned by the consultant emergency physician-performed ultrasonographic examinations. The existence of these patient factors will be recorded on the Standard Data Collection Forms: patient-reported values for height, weight, history of vascular surgery and history of deep venous thrombosis will be recorded, and their ability to move their leg to accommodate an ultrasonographic examination will be assessed and recorded by the participating emergency-physician ultrasonographer. These patient factors will then be correlated with the results of the relevant examinations, using appropriate statistical methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>the duration of the study, 15 - 24 months.

This outcome will be assessed once the study has been completed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>direct measurement of the percentage of reference-standard formal full-leg duplex ultrasonographic examinations which detect isolated proximal great saphenous vein (GSV) thrombosis in our patient population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>the duration of the study, 15 - 24 months.

This will be assessed once the study has been completed.

The relevant data will be collected for each 3-point compression ultrasonographic examination and reference-standard examination, to enable this post-study assessment to be performed.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the overall usefulness of 3-point compression ultrasonosgraphy performed by emergency physicians in the emergency department for the diagnosis of proximal lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis. 

In order to be useful, the examination should be accurate, fast, technically adequate and easy to learn. Therefore, this study will examine the accuracy, rapidity and technical adequacy of the examination, as well as the learning curve emergency physicians experiencing with the examination.

We hypothesise that the examination will be useful.</summary>
