  <interventions>
    <interventions>A four month treatment period whereby the patient applies non invasive  transabdominal gastrointestinal stimulation (TAGS) for one hour per day using a convenient garment that houses the electrodes. TAGS delivers a safe electrical stimulation to the abdomen. The stimulation parameters used are in common use by physiotherapists for treating pain (4,000hz carrier with a sweep frequency between 80 -160Hz) at a current level that is comfortable for each patient.</interventions>
