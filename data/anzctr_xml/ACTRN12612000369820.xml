The dietary pattern will be translated and consumed daily for the duration of the study in the form a dietary plan that incorporates freely available foods from the current food supply. This will include a breakfast, lunch and evening meal and snacks that will reflect the dietary composition described.</interventions>

    <summary>To evaluate, in overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus the chronic effects (24 months) of an energy restricted, very low carbohydrate (&lt;50 g/day), low saturated fat (&lt;10%) diet compared to an isocaloric high unrefined carbohydrate, low fat diet on:
Primary outcomes: glycemic control, cardiovascular disease risk factors and endothelial function
Secondary outcomes: weight loss, body composition, appetite, diet acceptance, renal/bone health.</summary>
