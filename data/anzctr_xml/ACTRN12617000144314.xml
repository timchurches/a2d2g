    <interventions>Honevo, which is topical medical grade Kanuka honey (10% glycerine and 90% Kanuka honey) is liberally applied to the affected eyelid margins once per day at night for 60 seconds for a period of twenty eight days. A participant ediary will record applications every four days during this period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment is focused around lid hygiene. Participants in the control arm will liberally apply Sterilid (active ingredient is tea tree oil) once a day at night for 60 seconds for a period of twenty eight days.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome  is the acceptability of Honevo for the treatment of Blepharitis as compared to standard Sterilid therapy. These are assessed using five-point Likert-like questionnaires and will be compared using ordinal regression. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be randomised 1:1 to treatment with either: Sterilid or Honevo. The randomization list will consist of 30-sequential allocation codes, numbered 1 to 30, which will correspond to one of two treatment groups, of which there will be an equal number. A randomisation field coded within the system that relays a randomisation schedule generated by the study biostatistician, will randomise patients at the time of enrolment at the opticians via the tablet.</concealment>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Participant and study site staff will not be blinded to the allocated treatment due to the nature of the investigational product. Data analysis will be conducted by a statastitian blinded to the allocation. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>30 participants comprising 15 in each treatment arm will be recruited. Simple descriptive statistics appropriate to a feasibility pilot study will be undertaken. This will include the proportional comparison of patient reported acceptability, degree of symptomatic and physical improvement between the treatment groups. Acceptability measured on a ten point scale will be compared with t-tests. The Patient Assessment Score (PAS) and Blepharitis Severity Score (BSS) are five level Likert-like questionnaires and will be compared by ordinal regression. In order to attempt to establish the MCID a Likert scale will be used for participants to rate their improvement and a range of optimal cut-points based on this scale and the PAS and BSS will be explored to determine an appropriate level to set for a likely minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for these instruments. The distribution of the response instruments will then be used to model a translation of this to an ordinal odds ratio reflecting the likelihood of a clinically important response.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Blepharitis treatment represents a key issue common to many chronic diseases that rely on over the counter treatment and prevention, namely the limited efficacy and range of available treatment options. Whilst often undiagnosed and unrecognised by the general public, many chronic blepharitis patients are markedly debilitated by their symptoms, struggling to perform visually reliant, day-to-day tasks such as reading or driving. A 2012 review found no cure for blepharitis with the majority of treatments marketed to patients without sufficient evidence. This pilot study aims to investigate Honevo (10% glycerine/90% Kanuka) as an alternative, acceptable treatment for blepharitis. The results of this study will be used to decide whether or not to pursue larger, efficacy based trials for the use of Honevo in blepharitis.</summary>
