  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sedentary women scoring 14 or higher on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were randomized to either yoga group or wait-list control group. Participants in the yoga group enrolled in a 60 minutes yoga session, twice per week for 12 weeks. The yoga program incorporated pranayama (breathing exercise), asana (postures), and savasana (meditation/relaxation), and was group-based and led by an experienced yoga instructor.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group was instructed not to engage in any yoga practice and to maintain their usual level of physical activity. After completing the post-test, participants in the control group were provided a free 12-week yoga program.</comparator>

The sample size needed for this study was calculated based on the results of previous meta-analyses on exercise and depression in clinical populations (Craft &amp; Landers, 1998;
Lawlor &amp; Hopker, 2001). The calculated total sample size to detect a significant difference between treatment groups on changes in BDI-II scores was 34 (i.e., 17 participants in each
group) with an alpha level of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an effect size of 0.5. The sample size was calculated using a computer software  GPOWER (Erdfelder, Faul, &amp; Buchner, 1996).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week yoga program on depressive symptoms and cardiac autonomic control in women. We hypothesized that after 12 weeks of yoga training, depressive symptoms would be reduced and cardiac autonomic control would be improved.</summary>
