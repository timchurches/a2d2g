  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, multicenter, multi-cohort study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Genvoya®; E/C/F/TAF)
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced
      HIV-positive, adult participants with mild to moderate renal impairment.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of E/C/F/TAF on renal
      parameters at Week 24. The proportion of subjects achieving virologic response of HIV-1 RNA &lt;
      50 copies/mL will also be assessed.

      At sites able to conduct the appropriate testing, approximately 30 participants will be
      enrolled into an intensive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) substudy to evaluate the
      PK/PD parameters of the individual components of E/C/F/TAF as well as tenofovir diphosphate
      (TFV-DP).</summary>
