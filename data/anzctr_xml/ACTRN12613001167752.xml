    <interventions>INTERVENTION
The positive psychology intervention will involve the serial completion of activities (known as positive activities) over a period of eight weeks; one activity per week. The positive activities to be performed are: Week 1 - "What Went Well"?;  Week 2: Gratitude Letter; Week 3 - Acts of Kindness; Week 4 - Best Possible Future Self; Week 5 - Nurturing Social Relationships; Week 6 - Get Active; Week 7- Committing to Your Goals;  and Week 8 - Increasing 'Flow' Experiences. The activities take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete and only needed to be completed once during the week. Adherence will be monitored through bi-weekly phone calls to the participant to check activity completion. Participants will also be required to keep a diary recording activity completion. This will be collected by the study investigators at the end of the intervention phase.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care (treatment as usual) following presentation for suicidal behaviour varies and may involve receiving a psychiatric intervention (crisis stabilisation within an inpatient setting that may involve a combination of medication and psychotherapy), psychological intervention (e.g. cognitive behaviour therapy within an outpatient setting), treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, counselling, anger management, or GP follow-up care. The type of care received is determined by the medical and mental health professionals in the emergency department.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be enrolled in the study in the week following their discharge (over the phone) and then randomised to receive either the intervention or treatment as usual. The randomisation process will be concealed by having a research associate carry out the randomisation process. An allocation schedule will be used to prepare a set of opaque consecutively numbered sealed envelopes, with the treatment group (intervention/control) indicated inside the envelope. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be created by using a computer-generated randomisation procedure generator (http://www.randomization.com) to generate an allocation schedule.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size of this study is based on the expected effect on the primary outcome measure, i.e. the reduction in severity and intensity of suicidal thoughts. In order to be able to demonstrate an effect size of 0.45 (Cohens d; Cohen, 1988) with a = 0.05 and beta = 0.20 (Power = 80%), 80 subjects are needed in each condition (Dupont and Plummer, 1990). When including an expected drop-out of 15%, the total sample size is determined at 190 at a 1:1 ratio. Statistical analysis of pre and post-intervention data will be performed using IBM SPSS statistical software (version 19.0). A demographic comparison will be made between the intervention and control groups at baseline; using an independent samples t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Further suicidal behaviour: counts and means will be calculated for each of the two experimental groups. A t-test will be used to compare the means of the two groups. Change in scale scores: counts and means will be calculated for each of the two experimental groups at each assessment point (baseline, 12 weeks and 26 months). T-tests will be used to compare the means of the two groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine if providing a group of individuals who present to the emergency department with suicidal behaviour with a handbook containing activities to perform over 8 weeks reduces the severity and intensity of their suicidal ideation when compared to a group receiving treatment as usual. We believe that the group receiving treatment as usual plus the handbook with activities to perform will have lower mean suicidal ideation severity and intensity scores than the group receiving treatment as usual alone.</summary>
