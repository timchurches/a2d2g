    <studytitle>Administration of clinical doses of neostigmine, commonly used in anaesthesia, and assessment of its effects on  muscle strength, using a dynamometer, in healthy  awake volunteers.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Do clinical doses of neostigmine induce muscle weakness, when administered to awake volunteers,  in the absence of exposure  to any non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents and if so  does  this have features of depolarising or non-depolarising blockade?

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Determination:
Assumed the Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate group would have a 20% mean reduction in the primary outcome from baseline (standard deviation (SD) 20%) while the Placebo group would have a 0% mean change (SD 5%), a sample size of 21 participants with 14 in the Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate group and 7 in the Placebo group would be sufficient to detect a difference of 20% between the study groups using a two-sided t test with 80% power and a 5% significance level. Sample size calculation was done using G*Power (software version 3.1, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany).  
A 2:1 allocation ratio was selected after balancing considerations of reduced statistical power as the result of unequal allocation and increased opportunity to make quantitative and qualitative observations on the potential effects of neostigmine administration in awake volunteers.

 Baseline characteristics were compared using the t test for continuous variables or the Chi-squared test for categorical variables. A hierarchical test procedure was applied to the analysis of quantitative primary and secondary outcomes. Initially repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare changes from baseline over the 30-minute study period. The maximal percentage change from baseline observed during the 30-minute study period in the Neostigmine/Glycopyrrolate group was then compared to the change in Placebo group at same time point using the t test only if repeated measures ANOVA found a significant difference. This would avoid unnecessary multiple testing at each 5-minute time interval. A conservative significance level of 0.01 was applied to all statistical tests to accommodate multiple comparisons.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase agent that is commonly used in anesthesia to reverse non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). It is used to improve the rate of recovery from moderate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade and reduce the incidence of residual blockade. Neostigmine increases acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine (Ach), which competitively antagonizes the NMBA. Neostigmine also acts at muscarinic sites leading to unwanted cholinergic side effects. Therefore the anti-muscarinic agents glycopyrrolate or atropine are administered in conjunction with neostigmine to reduce the severity of the effects. 
Clinical doses of neostigmine have been reported to cause muscle weakness when administered after full recovery from blockade. However, these reports are potentially confounded by the presence of other anesthetic agents also known to influence neuromuscular blockade.Without the use of quantitative neuromuscular function monitoring, patients who have spontaneously recovered from NMBAs may be given neostigmine unnecessarily.  
The primary aim of this study is  to determine if clinical doses of neostigmine administered to healthy, unanesthetized volunteers would cause muscle weakness and impair respiratory function. We sought to define the size of the effect with hand grip strength, electromyography and spirometry. The secondary aim was to record the signs and symptoms experienced by the participants.
