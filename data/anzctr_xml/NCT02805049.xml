  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Echinocandins

Experimental: The study population - The study population consisted of patients admitted to the ICU for septic shock associated with secondary peritonitis and requiring antifungal therapy via echinocandins (micafungin or caspofungin).


Treatment: drugs: Echinocandins
The patients included in this protocol require routine treatment with caspofungin or micafungin. Though this intervention is under study, it is not modified by this protocol.
