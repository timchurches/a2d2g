    <interventions>A First-in-Human, Randomised, Double-Blind, Double-Dummy, Placebo and Active Controlled Phase I Study in Healthy Volunteers Aged 18 to 45 Years.

A total of 75 healthy men and women will be enrolled and randomized into 3 groups where each participant will receive a single dose of either CodaVax, Fluzone or placebo (30:30:15). 

Thirty (30) participants will be administered CodaVax, 15 participants will be administered a placebo and 30 participants will be administered the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, Fluzone "Registered Trademark'. All subjects will receive an intranasal (IN) dose of either CodaVax or Leibovitzs L-15 medium (placebo), and an intramuscular (IM) (deltoid) dose of QuadriFlu- Tetravalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) (Fluzone) or Saline for Injection (placebo).

Arm 1: Intranasal CodaVax and Intramuscular saline injection
Arm 2: Intranasal Leibovitz's L-15 medium and intramuscular dose of QuadriFlu - Tetravalent influenza Vaccine (Fluzone)
Arm 3: Intranasal Leibovitz's L-15 medium and intramuscular saline injection

CodaVax is a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) manufactured using a proprietary SAVE platform against the H1N1 A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) strain. The vaccination dose will be 5 x 10^3 PFU in 200 microlitre of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) Leibovitz's L-15 media, and is to be administered through an intranasal sprayer into one nostril only.

Fluzone is an inactivated influenza vaccine which contains haemagglutinin of four different influenza strains. These are A/California/07/2009 X-179A (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 X-263B(H3N2), B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B Yamagata lineage), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B Victoria lineage). Dose will be 0.5ml Fluzone injection once. 

As this is a first-in-human study, 2 sentinel participants (1 placebo and 1 CodaVax participant) will receive the first dose of placebo or CodaVax by IN sprayer and IM injection on Day 0 and will be monitored for 7 days. If dosing of the sentinels proceeds without clinically significant adverse events (AEs) over 7 days, all remaining participants will be dosed.

Following vaccination all participants (CodaVax, Fluzone and placebo) will be monitored at the clinic for at least 60-90 minutes following vaccination, after which they will return to the clinic (Day 2, 4 and 6) to be monitored until Day 6 post-vaccination and on Day 30 post-vaccination for a Follow-up visit.

A soft-lock will be placed on the database after the Day 30 Follow-up visits are complete, at which point the data will be unblinded and an interim preliminary report will be written.

All participants will then receive an open-label Close-out phone interview 6 months post-vaccination and a final clinical study report will be written.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group is an intramuscular (IM) (deltoid) dose of QuadriFlu-Tetravalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV) (Fluzone) given as a single dose on Day 0 and will also receive an intranasal dose of Leibovitz's L-15 medium (placebo). 

The placebo group consists of an intranasal (IN) dose of Leibovitz's L-15 medium and an intramuscular (IM) dose of Saline for Injection given as a single dose on Day 0. </comparator>

    <summary>CodaVax, the study drug being researched in this project, is an experimental vaccine being developed by Codagenix, Inc. This means that it is not an approved treatment in Australia, and is not yet approved anywhere else in the world.

CodaVax is a vaccine that is intended to prevent influenza.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of CodaVax influenza vaccine compared to active and placebo controls when administered to healthy adults.
