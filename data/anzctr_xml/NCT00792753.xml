  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  The patient has a planned intervention of a single lesion in one or two separate major
             epicardial territories. Each lesion/vessel must meet the following criteria:

          -  De novo

          -  The target lesion reference site must be visually estimated to be &gt; 2.5 mm and &lt; 3.5
             mm in diameter.

          -  The target vessel must be a major coronary artery or major branch with a visually
             estimated stenosis of &gt; 50% and &lt;100%.

          -  The visually estimated target lesion must be able to be covered by a single, 14, 18 or
             28mm stent Elixir Stent or a single 14, 18, 24 or 30mm Endeavor Stent. Note that the
             8mm Endeavor Stent will not be used in this study.

          -  Maximum lesion length is 24 mm.

          -  &gt; TIMI 1 coronary flow.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage />
    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  The patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,
             ticlopidine, clopidogrel, mTOR inhibitor class drugs, cobalt chromium alloy,
             methacrylate or polylactide polymer, or sensitivity to contrast which cannot be
             adequately premedicated.

          -  There will be an untreated significant lesion of &gt; 40% diameter stenosis remaining
             proximal or distal to the target site after the planned intervention.

          -  Total occlusion or TIMI 0 coronary flow in the target vessel.

          -  Restenosis lesion

          -  The proximal target vessel or target lesion is severely calcified by visual
             assessment.

          -  Aorto-ostial location, unprotected left main lesion location, or a lesion within 5 mm
             of the origin of the LAD or LCX.

          -  Lesion involvement of a significant side branch (branch diameter &gt; 2 mm) that would be
             covered by stenting.

          -  The patient has suffered a myocardial infarction with total creatine kinase (CK) &gt;2
             times normal within the past 72 hours (exactly three days).

          -  The patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

          -  The patient suffered a stroke, transient ischemic neurological attack (TIA) or
             significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleed within the past six months.

          -  The patient has renal insufficiency as determined by a creatinine of &gt; 2.0mg/dl.

          -  The target lesion, or the target vessel proximal to the target lesion, contains
             thrombus.

          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction of &lt; 25%.

          -  The patient is a recipient of a heart transplant.

          -  The patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French
             sheath insertion or extreme anti-coagulation.</exclusivecriteria>
