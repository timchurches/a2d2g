      <timepoint>At 2-years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences in other measures derived from the diagnostic polysomnograph including: arousal index, proportion of REM sleep, stage 111 and 1V, lowest oxygen saturation and longest apnoea.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2-years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biochemical: changes in fasting blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide (insulin resistance and beta cell function using homeostatic model assessment), fasting tri-glycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, ALT, AST, microalbuminuria, and CRP. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes in 2-years </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical: changes in blood pressure, differences in medication required in managing sleep apnoea, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and other comorbidity of OSA or obesity, change in associated obesity comorbidity, ovulatory dysfunction, diabetes, enzyme markers of liver function, asthma and gastroesophageal reflux, weight change as measured by change of weight (kg), BMI, percentage excess weight loss and the percentage of excess BMI lost, (At 2-years the incidence of major adverse events would not be expected to be high. However, any differences in mortality, major vascular morbidity, major complications, and the development of clear evidence of serious obesity related disease, will constitute major adverse events and be reported. The study has not been powered for the detection in differences of major adverse events of safety.) </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications: any complications of the Lap-Band including peri-operative morbidity or mortality or late complications including band obstruction, intolerance, gastric slippage or pouch development, erosion, access port leaks, infection and tubing problems, any complication or lack of tolerance of therapy for OSA and medical therapy used in the treatment of OSA, obesity or their related comorbidities. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Costs of all therapy required for management of OSA or obesity related conditions will be reported, including hospital, medical, and allied professional costs and the costs of CPAP therapy, pharmaceuticals and prescribed nutrient supplements.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Have a body mass index between 32 and 50kg/m2, able to indicate several genuine attempts top lose significant weight, be recently diagnosed (6-months) with moderate to severe symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea (AHI&gt;20/hr) and have been advised to use nasal CPAP therapy for treatment (Satisfactory implementation or compliance with CPAP therapy would not be required as an entry criterion), be willing to be randomized into one of the two treatment programs and be able to understand the options, study requirements, and to comply with the requirements of both programs. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Failure to have made at least 3 significant attempts at weight loss, , history of previous abdominal surgery which would potentially preclude laparascopic placement of the band , obesity hypoventilation syndrome requiring BIPAP therapy (i.e. raised CO2 levels) or contraindication to a diagnostic sleep study, history of surgery to the airway for snoring or OSA, finding of a significant upper airway deformity or obstruction that was not obesity related (e.g. enlarged tonsils or nasal obstruction), medical problems which contra-indicate the application of either arm of the study including acute myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, dementia, active psychosis, concurrent experimental drug use, autoimmune disease, pregnancy, lactation, illicit drug use, excessive alcohol intake, use of drugs known to affect body composition, cytotoxic drugs, internal malignancy or major organ failure), sex if gender stratification is necessary due to numbers randomized . Gender stratification may be necessary as approximately equal numbers of men and women will be admitted to the study. If 26 of one gender have been randomly allocated the remaining subjects will be of the opposite gender.</exclusivecriteria>
