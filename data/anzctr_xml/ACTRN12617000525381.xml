  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Basidiobolomycosis is a rare fungal infection caused by Basidiobolus ranarum (B ranarum). The synonym Basidiobolomycosis is given to diseases caused by Basidiobolaceae which is a family coming under entomophthorales which is a subdivision of Zygomycetes. B. ranarum was first described in 1886 and was isolated from frogs. It has  been found in decaying vegetation, foodstuffs, fruits, and soil. It is also excreted from the gastrointestinal tracts of reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insectivorous bats. 

The organism B ranarum may be found all over the world but Basidiobolomycosis is most commonly reported from tropical and subtropical areas of the world. It typically causes a subcutaneous disease of arms, trunks and buttocks. The mode of transmission is assumed to be minor skin trauma and insect bites. Extracutaneous Basidiobolomycosis is rare, however,  it has been reported in lungs, retroperitoneum  and gastrointestinal system. Iatrogenic causes of infections, like needle transmission, has also been suggested by some authors. The disease may be transmitted by inhalation, by the soil, water and vegetation that is contaminated with animal feaces. 
Gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis (GIB) is considered to be a rare type of mycosis that is characteristically being reported in immunocompetent rather than immunocompromised patients. The first presumed case of GIB was reported in a 6 year old Nigerian boy in 1964  while the first culture proven case was diagnosed in 1986 in USA. During the last 30 years the reported cases were diagnosed mainly from arid desert region of USA and from Middle Eastern countries especially Saudi Arabia. Clinically, gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis may mimic malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease or chronic infections like tuberculosis. Due the rarity of the disease and its wide spectrum of presentations, high index of suspicion may be required for accurate diagnosis. Serological tests and histopathological findings can help in diagnosing the condition, nevertheless, the most definitive diagnostic tool is culture. Among all GIB reported cases, colon is the most common organ involved and may reach up to 82% of the affected organs in some reports. Moreover, surgical intervention is required in most of these cases. 

In this study we are reviewing the clinical presentations, indications and surgical outcomes of all patients who were diagnosed and treated from colonic basidiobolomycosis in the last 10 years in Aseer Central Hospital, A tertiary referral hospital in the southern region of Saudi Arabia.
