  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will follow modified sternal precautions (MSP) that will include asking the participants to:
1.use both arms and keep them close to the body when lifting light objects or standing up from a chair and getting out of bed 
2.avoid pushing or pulling with one arm
3.support the chest with a cushion/folded towel when coughing 

Participants will be instructed to use comfort to set the safe limits. They will also be encouraged to do active exercises of the upper limbs and trunk e.g. arm forward elevation to a point of comfort to the right and left, trunk rotation to a point of comfort. The participants will be encouraged to perform these exercise three times daily and repeat each exercise fifteen times. This will take approximately 20 minutes per session. 

The intervention will commenced within a week following cardiac surgery.  The participants will receive the group training led by the treating physiotherapist. This will be a one-off group training session to teach participants the exercises and precautions they should adhere to (30 minutes).  This will be supported with written information that includes a handbook of exercises and post-operative guidelines that include sternal precautions. Each participant will be provided with a flyer developed for the trial that has images and clear instructions regarding sternal precautions specific to their group (i.e modified sternal precautions group).  This intervention will be applied for a period of six weeks. Telephone calls to measure adherence to the sternal precautions guidelines by a physiotherapist will be conducted weekly for the first 6 weeks and monthly from then until three months post-operatively. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive the usual post-operative care that will include asking the participants to:
1.avoid pushing or pulling through the arms 
2.restrict one arm (unilateral) activity
3.limit the elevation of the arms to 90 degrees 
4.avoid lifting objects greater than 2kg 
5.support the chest with a cushion/folded towel when coughing 
6.avoid using the arms when transferring from sitting to standing and getting out of bed 
7.avoid placing the arms behind back. 

Participants will be advised not to continue tasks and/or exercises that are painful, to rest as required and focus on a gradual return to their level of function before surgery. They will also be encouraged to do active exercises of the upper limbs and trunk e.g. arm forward elevation to the right and left, trunk rotation. The participants will be encouraged to perform these exercise two times daily and repeat each exercise five times. This will take approximately 10 minutes per session. 

The intervention will commenced within one week following cardiac surgery.  The participants will receive the group training led by the treating physiotherapist. This will be a one-off group training session to teach participants the exercises and precautions they should adhere to (30 minutes). This will be supported with written information that includes a handbook of exercises and post-operative guidelines that include sternal precautions. Each participant will be provided with a flyer developed for the trial that has images and clear instructions regarding sternal precautions specific to their group (i.e standard care group).  This intervention will be applied for a period of six weeks. Telephone calls to monitor adherence by a physiotherapist will be conducted weekly for the first 6 weeks and monthly from then until three months post-operatively.

    <concealment>Participants will be randomized to the trial if they meet the eligibility criteria, consent and have completed baseline testing. Randomisation will be performed by an independent person offsite at University of Melbourne who will use a computer to generate a random number sequence and use sealed opaque envelopes. After baseline testing when a participant is ready to be randomized, a member of research team not involved in participant recruitment will request for the next consecutive envelope to be opened by offsite person. A member of research team not involved in participant recruitment will then inform the treating physiotherapist of group allocation. Participants will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to one of two groups (1) standard care, and Intervention group (2).  The blinded assessor will not be informed of the allocation</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All data will be analysed using intention to treat principle. Descriptive statistics including mean and SD; median and interquartile range; number and percentage; and frequency will be used to summarize data (depending on distribution and type of data): this includes participant demographics and adherence to sternal precautions. Differences between groups at baseline will be compared using Independent-samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test for parametric and non-parametric data respectively. Changes in outcomes between groups over time will be analysed with a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) or a mix model to include other baseline variables. Logistic regression will be used to determine pre, peri and post-operative risk factors associated with the development of post-sternotomy chest pain and complications. 

Sample size calculations were performed using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) as the primary outcome variable that evaluates physical function. Using the minimal important difference (MID) of 2 points out of total score of 12 points with a SD of 2.7 points based upon acute care inpatients populations that 29 participants will be required per group (total 58). We have increased this to a total of 72 participants based upon 20% drop out rate from our previous study in cardiac surgery from Royal Melbourne Hospital (Reference: Balachandran, S. PhD Thesis, 2015)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia 33,000 open-heart surgery operations are performed annually via an incision at the breast bone. Chest pain and non-union of the breast bone have been reported as complications following cardiac surgery. This is significant as if patients have pain that persists beyond 6 weeks it is more likely to continue as chronic sternal pain thus highlighting the importance of optimal pain management in the initial post-operative period. Following surgery patients are encouraged to observe sternal precautions that restrict the use of their arms and trunk to prevent these complications. These precautions are applied across Australia and worldwide practice without evidence to support them. Sternal precautions may be overly restrictive and not necessary for all patients as they may delay recovery by impacting on function. Upper limb movements have been shown to reduce post-operative pain and improve function. The aim of this project is to examine whether modified precautions that allow the use of the upper limbs and trunk within safe limits will facilitate recovery and function following cardiac surgery via a median sternotomy.
