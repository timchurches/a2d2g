  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will
      assess the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab in patients with asthma whose disease remains
      uncontrolled despite daily therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid and a second controller
      medication. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive double-blind treatment
      with subcutaneous lebrikizumab ("highest", "middle", "lowest" dose) or placebo every 4 weeks
      for 52 weeks, in addition to their standard-of-care therapy. This will be followed by a
      52-week double-blind active treatment extension. The anticipated time on study treatment is
      up to 104 weeks. There will be a safety follow-up of 24 weeks after the last dose of study
      drug for all patients.</summary>
