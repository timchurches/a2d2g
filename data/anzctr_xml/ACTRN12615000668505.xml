  <interventions>
    <interventions>All the cases with severe oligoathenospermia (OAT) from 2012 to 2013 were counseled about the efficacy of the intracystoplasmic morphologicaly selected sperm injection  (IMSI ) technique and its possible role for increasing the pregnancy rate, those accepted and consented on the new technique were enrolled in the study for IMSI group. For IMSI, spermatozoa were selected at 6600Ã— magnification using an inverted microscope equipped with Nomarski (differential interference contrast) optics.
it may be administered on multiple occasions within a given time period.
IMSI is an advanced and sophisticated method of ICSI, where prior to sperm injection, the morphology of the sperm is evaluated under high magnification. In addition, the IMSI procedure involves a few minor modifications in sperm preparation which are not carried out during the conventional ICSI procedure, such as the use of MSOME criteria, the requirement for a glass-bottomed dish for selection, prolonged sperm manipulation following separation from the seminal fluid, and sperm storage prior to microinjection. 

The maximal number of times that this procedure may be undertaken in each couple is 3 times, and the overall duration of the intervention period is once every 2 months.

    <comparator>For conventional intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) , spermatozoa were selected at 400 times magnification.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the pregnancy rate which is diagnosed by positive serum beta-hCG assay (&gt; 50 IU/L) 14 days after embryo transfer (ET) . Moreover, clinical pregnancy is confirmed by observing the number of the gestational sacs and fetal cardiac pulsations 2 weeks after positive beta -hCG test by trans-vaginal ultrasonography (TVS).
