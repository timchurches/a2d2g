  <interventions>
    <interventions>The present study aims to examine the effectiveness of an online prevention program for eating disorders which addresses clinical perfectionism. The proposed study is a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) targeting female adolescents aged 14 to 19 years old. Participants will be randomized into one of three groups (online guided self-help cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism [CBT-P], online guided self-help cognitive behaviour therapy for nonspecific stress management [CBT-S] or waitlist control [WLC]). 
The intervention is CBT-P, which is based on an empirically supported and theoretically driven material Overcoming Perfectionism: A self help guide using cognitive behavioural techniques (Shafran, Egan &amp; Wade, 2010).
CBT-P consists of 8 sessions that are completed over 4 weeks (2 sessions per week) with each session taking approximately 30minutes to 1hour. To monitor adherence to the intervention, participants are sent a generic weekly sms reminders to log in to the program "Hi (name), please login this week to the beyoutiful program to complete sessions x and y (session number). Thank you!". Participants who have not provided a mobile phone number will be contacted via email. If unresponsive, participants will be contacted by the phone number they have provided on their consent forms.</interventions>
    <comparator>The effects of CBT-P will be compared against a nonspecific CBT-S and a waitlist control [WLC]). 

The CBT-S program which serves as an active control will be based on a published CBT self-help manual for stress Overcoming Stress: A self-help guide using cognitive-behavioural techniques (Brosan &amp; Todd, 2009). As with CBT-P, CBT-S consists of 8 sessions that are completed over 4 weeks (2 sessions per week) with each session taking approximately 30minutes to 1hour. To monitor adherence to the intervention, participants are sent a generic weekly sms reminders to log in to the program "Hi (name), please login this week to the beyoutiful program to complete sessions x and y (session number). Thank you!". Participants who have not provided a mobile phone number will be contacted via email. If unresponsive, participants will be contacted by the phone number they have provided on their consent forms.

The waitlist control will not undergo any treatment from pre-treatment to 6 months follow-up. After 6 months, the waitlist control group are given the option to participate in the program of their choice - either CBT-P or CBT-S</comparator>

Each hypothesis predicted a Group x Time interaction. An a priori power analysis was conducted based on data from previous studies that assessed the efficacy of CBTP, with large effect sizes (d = 1.36-1.90) found with small sample sizes (Riley et al., 2007; Steele et al., 2013). The highest attrition rate of 50% noted in online formats of randomised controlled trials was used (Christensen et al., 2009). An a priori power analysis was used to estimate the sample size range by using the effect sizes. To achieve 80% power at an alpha level of 0.01, with three groups, using a moderate Group x Time interaction (f = .3) at the Bonferroni adjusted alpha power level of .01, the required total sample size was 57 (G*Power 3.1, Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2009). After adjusting for attrition rate of 50%, the estimated total sample to be recruited was 86. As mentioned, GLMM did not rely on participants providing data at every assessment point; GLMM used all data present at each assessment point, thereby reducing the impact of subject attrition on statistical power (Elobeid et al., 2009).

Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) was used to test for differential changes in outcomes between intervention and control groups, and effect sizes to measure the efficacy of interventions. GLMM was chosen because it is able to accommodate the violations of normality and homogeneity of variance, and sphericity. It is robust to unequal group sizes, and most importantly, it is less sensitive to participant attrition which is common in interventions because it does not rely on participants providing data at every point, thereby optimising statistical power (Elobeid et al., 2009).

A series of GLMMs, one for each of the six outcome measures, was developed in order to test for treatment and prevention effects. The GLMMs were implemented through SPSSs (Version 22) GENLINMIXED procedure. The GLMM represents a special class of regression model. The GLMM is generalised in the sense that it can handle outcome variables with markedly non-normal distributions. The GLMM is mixed in the sense that it includes both random and fixed effects. Each of the present GLMMs included one nominal random effect (participant), one nominal fixed effect (group: CBT-P, CBT-S, waitlist control), one ordinal fixed effect (pre-test, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up), and one 2-way interaction (Group x Time).

Effect size and clinically significant change. To supplement statistical hypotheses testing, effect sizes and clinically significant changes were computed. Pre-intervention, post- intervention, 3-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up intervention effect sizes were calculated using Cohens d (Cohen, 1988) for the three groups. Cohens d could not be used to measure interaction effects, and partial eta squared was used instead. The formula is eta squared = F/(F+df2) where .01 = small, .06 = moderate, .14+ = large. Cohens d (GLMM2) was calculated for post-hoc least significant difference (LSD) tests, conducted to locate the source of the significant interactions (i.e., pre- to post-intervention, pre-intervention to 3-month follow-up, pre-intervention to 6-month follow-up). Cohens d was estimated from the LSD t-values using the following formula, d = 2t/sqrt(df). Conventions for Cohens d were used, .2 = small, .5 = moderate, .8 = large (Cohen, 1988).

Clinically significant and reliable change indices were used to determine whether the intervention groups produced a clinically important change. Jacobson and Truax (1991) methodology was used to assess the reliability and clinical significance of each participants pre- to post-treatment and pre-treatment to follow-up change scores. A clinically significant change had to first be statistically reliable, which was assessed with the reliable change index (RCI; Jacobson et al., 1986).  The RCI was the degree to which the person changed on the outcome variable divided by the standard error of difference (S diff) between the pre-treatment (X1) and post-treatment (X2) scores, Absolute RCIs less than or equal to 1.96 indicate no change. When the absolute value of the RCI exceeded 1.96, it was likely that the pre- to post-treatment change score reflected a real or reliable change (Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991).
Once the RCI had been calculated to determine that the intervention had produced a statistically reliable change in a particular client, it was important to determine whether the change were clinically significant. Testing for clinical significance involved classifying changes in symptom severity in categories of recovered, improved, unchanged, or deteriorated (Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991). Using the classification system required cut-off points to be calculated. Three possible cut-off points were suggested in this system: Cut-off point a was where the post-treatment score fell at least two SDs beyond the mean of a dysfunctional population. Cut-off point b was where the post-treatment score fell within two SDs of the mean for the functional population. Cut-off point c is where the post-treatment score placed that client closer to the mean of the functional population than it did to the dysfunctional population.
Jacobson and Traux (1991) suggested that cut-off point c was the most preferable to use when norms are available for both the dysfunctional and functional populations.
The clinical cut-offs were used in conjunction with the RCI. A classification of recovered was used when the RCI was greater than 1.96 and their post treatment score was in the functional range. If the RCI was greater than 1.96, and the score moved towards the functional mean but still fell within the clinical range, it was classified as improved. When neither conditions were met, the classification of unchanged was used. When the RCI was greater than 1.96, but the score had moved away from the functional mean and toward the clinical population, a classification of deteriorated was used. Each individuals scores on the respective outcome variables were tested for reliable change and clinically significant change, and chi-square tests were conducted to determine whether the three groups differed in proportions of cases showing reliable change and clinically significant change.
While there is clear evidence of a two-factor structure of the CPQ, different researchers had included different items in each of the two factors (cf. findings from Chapter 2, Dickie et al., 2012; Egan et al., 2016; Stoeber &amp; Damian, 2014). For this study, the data from Chapter 2 with Perfectionistic Strivings (CPQ Factor 1); M = 13.19, SD = 3.40 and CPQ Factor 2 (Perfectionistic Concerns); M = 9.69, SD = 2.49 were used to calculate clinically significant change. Because these data were obtained from a functional population, and no alternate data from a dysfunctional population was currently available, cut-off point b was used. As discussed in the Measures section, the empirical derived threshold = 2.30 for the global score (Mond et al., 2004) was a suitable, but not ideal, cut-off for clinically significant eating disorder psychopathology for the sample. To measure clinically significant changes on the RCADS for anxiety and depression, the study adhered to the manual (Chorpita et al., 2000) where a T-score of = 70 indicated a clinical threshold of a disorder for females aged 14 to 18 years old. To measure clinically significant changes on the RSES, the study used the cut-off of low self-esteem of = 15 as indicative of clinically significant low self-esteem ( Rosenberg, 1965). No alternate community or clinical data for females aged 14 to 19 years with eating disorders were available that used the RSES scoring of 0 to 30, as recommended in Rosenberg (1965).

Z-score test for two population proportions.
Several researchers in the prevention field have examined clinically significant changes where they compared the migration of proportions of participants who recovered, improved and deteriorated overtime (Shochet et al., 2001; Stice et al., 2011b; Wilksch et al., 2008). The present study adopted the methodology of several prevention studies that compared the proportions of participants who recovered, improved or deteriorated over time and included both prevention and treatment effects (Shochet et al., 2001; Stice et al., 2011b; Wilksch et al., 2008) even though the key research interest of the study concerned prevention effects. Given the low numbers of participants who were categorised as recovered, improved and deteriorated, the z-score test for two population proportions was used to see whether groups differed significantly in prevention and treatment effects (Shochet et al., 2001; Stice et al., 2011b; Wilksch et al., 2008).
Consistent with the definition of prevention effects, the analysis focused on cases that deteriorated in each group across time, so as to determine whether the control groups demonstrated increased symptomatology and/or diagnosis compared to the CBT-P group which has an absence of an increase in symptoms over time (Gillham et al., 2000). Similarly, when examining treatment effects, the analysis focused on cases that recovered or improved in each group across time, so as to determine whether the CBT-P group showed greater improvements in symptomatology or diagnoses in comparison to controls over time (Gillham et al., 2000).
To measure clinically significant prevention effects, a two-tailed test was conducted. To minimise the number of tests conducted, and therefore type I error, analyses were first conducted on groups collapsed across time (i.e., combined across pre-intervention, post-intervention, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up). If results yielded non-significant p values, it was assumed that the smaller n differences across groups at each time point would also be non- significant. To further reduce type I error, if the z-test results collapsed across time yielded significant p values, analyses were first conducted on groups with the biggest difference in n in the deteriorated categories at each time point. If results yielded non-significant p values, it was assumed that those with smaller n differences at each time point would also be non-significant. The same analysis was repeated for clinically significant treatment effects, but analysing the cases who recovered or improved in each group over time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research aimed to develop and examine the efficacy of a selective prevention program consisting of eight sessions of online self-help which targeted clinical perfectionism. A randomised controlled trial involving 94 females without eating disorders aged 14 to 19 years was conducted. Participants were randomised into one of three groups: online cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for perfectionism (CBT-P), online CBT for nonspecific stress management (CBT-S) or waitlist control. CBT-P resulted in large reductions in clinical perfectionism (CPQ Factor 1 [Perfectionistic Strivings] and CPQ Factor 2 [Perfectionistic Concerns]), moderate decreases in eating disorder, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and large increases in self-esteem, with changes  maintained at 6 month follow- up. Changes in clinical perfectionism, eating disorder symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and self-esteem were significantly larger in CBT-P than CBT-S and waitlist control. Some clinically significant prevention effects were found, with CBT-P being superior to CBT-S in preventing deterioration of clinical perfectionism (CPQ Factor 2 [Perfectionistic Concerns]), and depressive symptoms, and CBT-P being superior to waitlist control in preventing deterioration of eating disorder symptoms over 6-month follow-up.
The findings support the notion of clinical perfectionism as a transdiagnostic process and suggest that it may be a useful target for prevention of eating disorders in female youth. The use of technology to promote and engage young women in prevention programs are increasingly popular and accessible, suggesting that online programs may be useful for the prevention of eating disorders, particularly in a stepped care model.</summary>
