  <interventions>
    <interventions>The key research question is to assess and evaluate the surgical management and outcome of the applied surgical intervention in women with recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) after initial treatment with synthetic mesh in the vagina for POP (mesh-failure).
The applied surgical management will be assessed and evaluated. The key research question is the assessment of the surgical management which can vary from patient to patient depending on the previous surgery. Follow-up time is 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively. The overall duration of this observational study will be 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>no control group is required. This study is conducted as a case-series. All women undergoing prolapse surgery for the condition of a recurrent prolapse after mesh-surgery (mesh-failure) will be included in this study.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment and evaluation of the applied intervention for the treatment of women with recurrent POP after mesh-failure.
All patient will complete the Queensland Pelvic Floor Questionnaire as well as examined according to the ICS-POP-Q staging pre-and postoperatively as routinely performed in any patients undergoing prolapse surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>Preoperatively, 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery as routinely performed in patients undergoing prolapse surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the failure of the applied intervention all patient will be asked to complete the Queensland Pelvic Floor Questionnaire and the principal investigatior will examine the patients according to the ICS-POP-Q staging pre-and postoperatively as routinely performed in any patients undergoing prolapse surgery.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the proposed project is to report the clinical presentation, the subsequent surgical management and the outcome of a series of 20 patients with recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) following implantation of synthetic mesh in the vagina for the treatment of POP (mesh-failure). This study is conducted to obtain a better understanding of the surgical management after vaginal mesh-failure that should be proposed.
The hypothesis of this study is to evaluate and to assess the surgical treatment in women who underwent surgical correction for recurrent POP after initial treatment with synthetic mesh in the vagina for POP. For gynaecologist clear surigcal strategies are required to propose the surgical intervention that is most effection in this situation.</summary>
