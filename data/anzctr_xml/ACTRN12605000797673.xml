  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to receive a pressure of  -5cm; 0cm; 5 or 10cmH20 for a period of 12minutes, after a 12 minute acclimation period. (to the room)

Participants will return a further 3 times, at which time they will be randomised to receive one of the remaining pressures. Each pressure application will occur not less than two days apart and no more than 2 weeks apart.

Nasal mucosal temperature geometry will be measured after each 12-minute pressure application.</interventions>
