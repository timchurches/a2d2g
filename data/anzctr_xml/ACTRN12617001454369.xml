  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double-blinded, randomised, 4-way crossover trial. Participants are required to attend 4 clinic visits. At each clinic visit participants will be randomly allocated to consume one of 4 treatments (4 different soluble fibre formulations, containing 12g of different types of oligosaccharides in various combinations ), plus 2 slices of white bread and 250ml water (room temperature). Study meals will be consumed in random order, with a minimum one-week washout period between clinic visits. 

In the 2 days prior to the scheduled appointments, participants will consume a fibre-controlled background diet. This will include consumption of no more than 3 serves of fruits and vegetables combined per day, and avoidance of other high soluble fibre content foods including oats, legumes (kidney, navy, lima, baked beans), wholegrain bread and cereal products. Participants will be provided with a standardised non-fermentable evening meal (lasagna), which they will be asked to consume the night before each of their scheduled appointments. They will also be asked to fast for 12-hours prior to the clinic visit. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for plasma SCFA (total, acetate, propionate, butyrate) will be determined using the trapezoidal rule and peak plasma SCFA concentrations will be identified. Differences between meals will be compared using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis testing with posthoc analysis, as appropriate. Differences between peak SCFA and baseline will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. In addition, two-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test the effect of meal and time on plasma SCFA concentrations. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Soluble fibre is a source of plasma short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are known to have antiinflammatory properties. This study will investigate the plasma short chain fatty acid (SCFA) yield over 10 hours following consumption of four different soluble fibre supplements in healthy adult males and females. This will provide a proxy for rating the antiinflammatory potential of each type of soluble fibre. This information will be used in the design of future clinical intervention trials.</summary>
