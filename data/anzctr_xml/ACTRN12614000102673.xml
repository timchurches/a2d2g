  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adminstration of ACH-0142684 at 200mg per day and ACH-0143102 at 25mg per day together. Group 1 subjects will receive 21 days of ACH-0142684 and 14 days of ACH-0143102 (introduced at Day 8). Group 2 subjects will receive 21 days of ACH-0143102 and 7 days of ACH-0142684 (introduced at Day 15). ACH-0142684 will be a 2ml solution administered orally via a syringe. ACH-0143102 will be a single capsule administered orally.
Medication compliance and adherence will be monitored by weighing, counting and calculating both of the remaining product and monitoring the source documentation regarding drug administration. All drug will be taken in clinic under staff supervision and recorded in the subject notes / source documentation.

    <statisticalmethods>Non compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated for ACH-0143102 and ACH-0142684.  The drug interaction will be assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach on ln transformed plasma PK parameters Cmax, AUC(0-24), and AUC(0-24) of ACH-0143102 and ACH-0142684. 
Results of the ANOVA will be used for the calculation of the ratios of least squares means (LSM) of the ln transformed PK parameters following co administration of ACH 0142684 and ACH-0143102 (Day 21) over ACH-0142684 alone (Day 7) to determine the effect of ACH-0143102 on the PK of ACH-0142684  in Group1; and following co-administration of ACH-0142684 and ACH-0143102  (Day 21) over ACH-0143102 alone (Day 14) in Group 2.
Plasma concentrations of ACH-0143102 and ACH-0142684 will be listed by subject. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV], standard error of the mean [SEM], number [N], minimum, maximum, median, geometric mean, and geometric SD) will be calculated for plasma concentrations and PK parameters. Geometric mean and geometric SD will be provided only for Cmax and AUC(0-24). 
Other PK evaluations may be conducted as needed. Baseline characteristics, demographic data, and safety measurements will be listed by subject and summarized by descriptive statistics (for continuous variables) or incidence of occurrence (for categorical variables).
AEs will be summarized by system organ class and high level term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA 'Registered Trademark') for active treatment and placebo within Group 1 and Group 2.  Likewise, within each Group, changes from baseline for clinical laboratory evaluation, vital signs and ECG will also be computed for active treatment and placebo subjects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 1 study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of ACH-0143102 in combination with ACH-0142684 when administered to healthy volunteers.  In each of 2 groups, a monotherapy phase of each drug  will precede the addition of the second drug. The duration of each monotherapy arm is designed to ensure that steady state conditions are achieved before the second drug is added. Given the observed half life and associated variability for ACH-0142684 200mg, the 7 day duration of monotherapy in Group 1 ensures that steady state conditions are achieved prior to initiation of ACH-0143102. The plasma terminal half life of ACH-0143102 is considerably longer, approximately 250 hours, and the duration of the monotherapy phase in Group 2 is therefore increased to 14 days in order to achieve near steady state conditions. In this study, a full PK profile (0-24 hr) is obtained for each drug when administered alone at steady state (last day of monotherapy phase), after one dose of the other drug when the other drug is at steady state (first day of co-administration period), and after both drugs have achieved steady state conditions (last day of co-administration period). The use of a fairly large control group (active:control = 2:1) will decrease the likelihood that random safety events are erroneously attributed to the study drug. In order to obtain the intensive pharmacokinetic evaluations needed and optimally manage subject safety, all subjects will remain in house during the entire study.  Safety evaluations will be performed on subjects daily, and safety laboratory assessments will be reviewed in real time to facilitate early intervention for any safety issues identified during the study. Assuming that data from this study demonstrate no insurmountable pharmacokinetic issues, and that no important safety issues are identified, the results of this Phase 1 study will be used to support initiation of a proof of concept study with HCV patients.</summary>
