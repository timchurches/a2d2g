  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>1. This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of a vitamin, mineral and herbal formulation. The aim is to investigate if the formulation reduces cold &amp; flu symptoms including symptom duration compared to placebo.
2.  All participants are provided with the cold/flu treatment pack  which includes the product (active treatment or placebo), a daily symptom diary and a pre-prepared QML pathology form for Influenza antigen testing.
3. If a participant experiences 2 or 3 more cold/flu symptoms during the 6 month study period (according to the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey), they need to a) start treatment, b) have the antigen test taken at a local QML pathology collection centre, c) record their symptom severity in the diary every day until symptoms resolved.

4. Within 2 weeks from the cold/flu resolving, the participant is asked to attend a final interview, returning the diary and unused product.

5. There will be regular communication with all participants during the study.  Once the number of cold/flu episodes reaches the quota (49 per group), all participants will be informed that the study has been completed.  Therefore, it is expected that not all participants will experience a cold/flu episode while enrolled in the study.</summary>
