  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Response at Week 12 - CDAI is a number which consists of information collected from a 7-day diary from the participants regarding symptoms. Remission is considered a score of 150 or less. Active disease is considered 200 or greater. A response to therapy is considered a decline in CDAI score of 70-points from baseline. The score was algorithmically derived from the sum of participant reported Crohn's disease symptoms recorded over 7 days and investigator recorded assessments of the participant's condition, laboratory parameters and use of anti-diarrhoeal medication. CDAI score was calculated based on the data collected in the diary card. The total CDAI score ranged from 0 to approximately 600, where higher scores indicate more severe disease. Both participants and investigators made their entries via IVRS each evening before going to bed. Percentage of participants with CDAI response at Week 12 was presented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With CDAI Remission at Week 12 - CDAI is a recognized scoring system to categorize disease severity with scores of &gt;= 220 to &lt;= 450 describing the moderately-to-severely active population. Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score &lt; 150 points if baseline CDAI is &gt;= 150. If baseline CDAI is &lt;150, the participant was not considered in remission. Participants with missing CDAI scores were considered not in remission according to the missing=no effect imputation. Percentage of participants in clinical remission at Week 12 was presented.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response (CDAI Decrease From Baseline of &gt;= 100 Points) at Both Week 8 and Week 12 - Responders were defined as participants with CDAI decrease from baseline of &gt;= 100 points. CDAI is a recognized scoring system to categorize disease severity with scores of &gt;= 220 to &lt;= 450 describing the moderately-to-severely active population. The score was algorithmically derived from the sum of participant reported Crohn's disease symptoms recorded over 7 days and investigator recorded assessments of the participant's condition, laboratory parameters and use of anti-diarrhoeal medication. Both participants and investigators made their entries via IVRS each evening before going to bed. Percentage of participants with CDAI decrease from baseline of &gt;=100 points was presented.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission (CDAI &lt;150 Points) at Both Week 8 and Week 12 - Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score &lt; 150 points if baseline CDAI is &gt;= 150. If baseline CDAI is &lt;150, the participant was not considered in remission. participants with missing CDAI scores were considered not in remission according to the missing=no effect imputation. Percentage of participants in clinical remission defined as a CDAI score of less than 150 points at other time points was presented.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Total Score at Both Weeks 8 and 12 - The IBDQ is a 32-item IBD-specific health related quality of life instrument evaluating general activities of daily living, intestinal function, social performance, personal interactions, and emotional status. Each item response was graded from 1 to 7 for each area evaluated. A higher score indicated better function in that area. Total IBDQ score was obtained by summing up scores for all 32 questions. Total IBDQ score ranged from 32 to 224. A higher score indicated better quality of life and lower score indicated worse quality of life. Day 1 assessment was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting value at Baseline from value at Weeks 8 and 12.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0), Week 8 and Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) - Data for number of participants who presented one or more adverse events (serious or non serious) was reported. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of two doses (500 mg once daily and 500 mg twice daily) of GSK1605786A as compared to
      placebo over 12 weeks in adult subjects with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease.
      Efficacy will be assessed by proportion of subjects achieving response, defined as a decrease
      in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of at least 100 points (clinical response).
      Clinical remission (CDAI score less than 150 points) will be evaluated as a key secondary
      endpoint. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical laboratory
      parameters, vital signs and electrocardiogram (ECG). Population pharmacokinetics will
      evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes assessments will include changes in
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2), EQ-5D and
      Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-CD (WPAI-CD) and receipt of disability.</summary>
