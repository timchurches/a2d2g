  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of
      experimental medication BMS-986016 administered alone and in combination with nivolumab in
      patients with solid tumors that have spread and/or cannot be removed by surgery.

      The following tumor types are included in this study:

      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell
      carcinoma, bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and melanoma, that
      have NOT previously been treated with immunotherapy. NSCLC and melanoma that HAVE previously
      been treated with immunotherapy.</summary>
