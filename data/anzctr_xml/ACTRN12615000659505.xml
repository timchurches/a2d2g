Random selection of patients to assess the efficacy of the stethoscope and establish normal bowel patterns in normal babies
Our aim was to establish normal bowel patterns before, during and after feeding in this observational study. SO, sample size calculation was not possible without having any prior information in the literature on whats normal in this age group. This is the reason we designed it  as a prospective, time restricted, pilot observational study in which all the consecutive newborns born during a 6 month period were approached to participate in the trial. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The stethoscope is the standard tool used to assess bowel sounds, however, a regular stethoscope does not allow recording of bowel sounds and therefore can be subject to bias. We aimed to establish normal bowel motility patterns in relation to feeding in newborn infants using the Littmann Electronic Stethoscope 3200. This tool enables transmission of real time bowel sounds to a computer for further analysis and standardisation of frequency and amplitude. We hypothesis there is no difference in peristalsis in relation to feeding.  </summary>
