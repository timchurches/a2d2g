  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome is to determine the incidence of inadvertent intraoperative hypothermia, defined as core temperature &lt;36°C at any time during the perioperative period. The core temperature is assumed to be that of tympanic membrane temperature, since tympanic membrane temperature is easily obtained and has been validated to reflect core temperature. Infrared tympanic thermometer is used for assessment (Genius 2, Mansfield, USA)</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify possible correlations with perioperative hypothermia of risk factors such as age, sex, height, weight, preoperative fasting period, ASA physical condition score, habits, comorbidities, type and size of surgery, endoscopic surgery usage, duration of anesthesia and surgery, irrigation and infusion fluids, room temperature and humidity, active or passive heating usage.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We determined the incidence of unintended perioperative hypothermia in patients undergoing general anesthesia and examined risk factors. 2015 patients were studied and the incidence of perioperative hypothermia was 78.6%. There was a statistically significant difference between the patients with and without hypothermia in terms of age and age group, body mass index (BMI), ASA classification and chronic disease status (p &lt;0,05). The age and BMI of hypothermic patients were significantly higher than those without hypothermia. Patients with hypothermia who were older than 65 years, those with a BMI greater than 25 kg / m2 and any chronic disease were significantly higher than those without hypothermia. Patients with ASA-I had a significantly lower percentage of hypothermic patients. Percentage of those with grade 3 or 4 surgery, patients with endoscopic surgery, duration of anesthesia over 2 hours, infusion or irrigation amount greater than 1000 ml were significantly higher than those without hypothermia.</summary>
