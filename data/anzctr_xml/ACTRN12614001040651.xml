  <interventions>
    <interventions>Full spine adjustments will be carried out during the experimental sessions. The entire spine and sacroiliac joints will be assessed for vertebral subluxations and adjusted where deemed necessary by a registered chiropractor with at least ten years clinical experience. The vertebral subluxation indicators that will be used to assess the function of the spine prior to and after each spinal adjustment intervention include assessing for tenderness to palpation of the relevant joints, manually palpating for restricted intersegmental range of motion, assessing for palpable asymmetric intervertebral muscle tension, and any abnormal or blocked joint play and end-feel of the joints. All of these biomechanical characteristics are known clinical indicators of spinal dysfunction (Fryer, Morris, &amp; Gibbons, 2004; Hestboek &amp; Leboeuf-Yde, 2000). These findings will be documented prior to and after each spinal adjustment intervention. The improvements in segmental function following spinal adjustments will also be recorded for each subject. Subjects will attend 2-3 adjustment sessions a week for 6 weeks with each session lasting 10 minutes on average. The adjustment schedule will be determined by the chiropractor who is providing care to the participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention will consist of passive and active movements of the subjects head, spine and body that will be carried out by the same chiropractor who pre-checks the participants for vertebral subluxations and who performs the adjustments in the experimental intervention sessions. This control intervention will involve the participants being moved into the adjustment setup positions where the chiropractor would normally apply a thrust to the spine to achieve the adjustments. However, the experimenter will be particularly careful not to put pressure on any individual spinal segments. Loading a joint, as is done prior to spinal adjustments has been shown to alter paraspinal proprioceptive firing in anesthetised cats (Pickar &amp; Wheeler, 2001), and will therefore be carefully avoided by ending the movement prior to end-range-of-motion when passively moving the participants. No spinal adjustments will be performed during any control intervention. This control intervention is not intended to act as a sham adjustment but to act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that will occur with the type of passive and active movements involved in preparing a patient for an adjustment. It also acts as a control for the effects of the stimulation necessary to collect the dependent measures of the study, and acts as a control for the time required to carry out the adjustment intervention. The control intervention will take approximately 10 minutes and will only be applied between the pre and post assessment tests on the days that the participants undergo the neurophysiological testing. During the rest of the control period participants will be able to engage in their usual health care activities, apart from receiving chiropractic care. The full control period will last 6 weeks, during which the participants will receive the control intervention at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over the past ten years a growing body of evidence has accumulated that suggests neural plastic changes occur
following chiropractic adjustments (for recent review see Haavik &amp; Murphy, 2012). Recently we presented the
findings from eight subjects that demonstrated that a full spine chiropractic adjustment session resulted in an
increase in the subjects ability to maximally voluntarily contract their lower limb muscle by almost 73%. (Niazi et al.
2013) There was also a 50% increase in cortical drive and a shift in the H reflex curve. These exciting findings were
not observed following the control intervention and are similar to those reported in a study that investigated the
effects of three weeks of strength training (VilaCha,
Falla, Correia, &amp; Farina, 2012).
In this study we plan to expand on these findings by investigating the effects of six weeks of chiropractic care on H
and V waves. We will randomly allocate 32 subjects to one of two groups in a basic science parallel group randomised controlled trial. The experimental group will receive chiropractic care 2-3 times per week (at the discretion of the chiropractor providing care) for six weeks. The control group will receive six weeks of no care. During the assessment sessions the control group will receive a passive movement intervention to act as a physiological control for the chiropractic adjustments that will be provided during the assessment sessions when they are receiving the experimental intervention. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and weeks one, three, and six. Data will be recorded over a 24 hour period following an adjustment session. Data will be collected by a bioengineering research assistant according to established protocols
(VilaCha et al., 2012). Coded data will be analysed according to established protocols (Rosner, 2012) by an
independent data analyst blinded to group allocation
