There will be an initial one hour nurse led consultation followed by weekly 15-30 minute telephone calls for the first month, then fortnightly for the next month. At 3 months, participants will be invited to attend a second face-to-face consultation with the nurse. After the second consultation the participant will have monthly follow up calls for the next two months and a final face-to face consultation at 6 months</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To improve psychological (depression, anxiety and quality of life) outcomes in those with CVD.

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to assess ongoing depressive and anxiety symptomatology. The SF-12 Health Survey will be used to indicate ongoing physical and emotional health status. Comparing ENRICHD scores along the data collection period will indicate social support.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On recruitment, 3 months, 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine if improved physiological outcomes in patients with CVD are associated with adherence to guideline risk factor modification.

The participants will be asked several questions in regards to their walking and sport habits to assess their level of physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Additional ongoing measure of modifiable biometric and lifestyle risk factors (RR, body weight, BMI, blood cholesterol) will indicate adherence / change to secondary prevention guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On recruitment, 3months, 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify the components of the nurse-led intervention that participants perceive as most beneficial.

A modified Michigan Academic Consortium Patient-Satisfaction Questionnaire (MAC-PSQ) will be used to assess patient satisfaction</outcome>
