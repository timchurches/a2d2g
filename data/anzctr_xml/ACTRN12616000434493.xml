  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study was designed as a sequential, explanatory, mixed-methods, cross-sectional, practice-based, external pilot study of patients seeking chiropractic services in Western Australia. A select non-random sample of independent private chiropractic practices was recruited and between July-September 2014 consecutive adult patients self-presenting to these practices for the first time were invited to participate. Patient participants were assessed on a single occasion only at the time of first presentation to chiropractor within the study period. Data for analysis were collected using a computer-based online questionnaire; including various patient demographic data and human quality of life measures (HQoLs; SF-12 and PIQ-R).  Both qualitative and quantitative responses were collected from the practice practitioners and support staff and a descriptive analysis which characterised the sample practices and chiropractors is provided.</interventions>

      <outcome>Critique of pilot study

Acceptability and feasibility of carrying out the study for chiropractors and chiropractic office staff, assessed using a Likert Scale and open-ended (qualitative) questionnaire designed for this study. Thus the primary purpose of this external pilot study was to provide a critique of the research design and methods and collect data from a selected sample of chiropractic practices, with a view to offer recommendations related to the design, feasibility and implementation (including sample size calculations) for a definitive study, and provide insights into the possible outcomes of such a study. </outcome>

Sample estimation
Arriving at an estimation of the practice sample size was difficult to determine. The default position was to have as many practices involved as possible from as many regions as possible. However, this was tempered by a pragmatic recognition of the likelihood of practice drop-out and the assumed lesser number of practices in rural and remote geographical settings. 
Target sample size for the pilot study was thus determined by team consensus on 'best fit', logistics, available resources and time, and calculations. Each chiropractic practice was estimated to average at least 6 new self-presenting adult patients per week. With a potential ~35% of patients declining to participate or not completing the survey, it was estimated that approximately ~320 patients could be recruited into the study during the 12 week study period across at least 7 practices. The estimated rate of those declining to participate was based on; (1) the invitation was face to face, (2) low chance of participation fatigue (prior invitation), (3) the issue was salient to the participants and (4) low demands in terms of participation. Since there is no issue of finding participants to recruit, this estimate was considered somewhat conservative. Calculations to determine priori sample size estimation using G*Power software indicated a total sample of 320 would be sufficient to achieve a study power of &gt;80% (assumed effect size 0.2, a=0.05 assumed df=5; www.gpower.hhu.de).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The emerging focus in healthcare is to have care services delivered using strategies that are cost-efficient and evidence-based, while engaging with the broadest applicable workforce. Therein is the opportunity for the chiropractic profession to play an expanding role within the context of a multi-disciplinary care, particularly in the area of musculoskeletal/spinal health. Practice-based data collection would offer insight into the nature of chiropractic practice and contribute to resolving the conundrum of chiropractics role in contemporary healthcare, latterly informing care service policy. However, there is little formal data available about chiropractic practice to inform us about the nature and role of chiropractic within the context of a modern multidisciplinary healthcare context in Australia, particularly at a local and regional level. This purpose of this prospective, mixed-methods, cross-sectional, external pilot study was to provide a critique of the research design and collect data from a selected sample of chiropractic practices, with a view to offer recommendations related to the design, feasibility and implementation of a future confirmatory study. A narrative critique of the research methods of this pilot study is offered, covering: (a) practice and patient recruitment, (b) enrollment of patients, (c) data collection methods, (d) acceptability of the study methods, (e) sample size calculations, and (f) design critique. The result of this critique provides a sensible sample size estimate and recommendations as to the design and implementation of a future confirmatory study. Furthermore, we believe that a confirmatory study is not only feasible, but indeed necessary, with a view to offer meaningful insight into chiropractic practice in Western Australia.</summary>
