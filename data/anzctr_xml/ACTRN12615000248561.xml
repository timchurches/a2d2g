  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessment of pelvic floor muscles function through PERFECT scheme (power, endurance, repetition, fast contraction, co-contraction and timing of pelvic floor muscles). Participants will undergo assessment immediately prior to intervention and at four week post intervention.
Pelvic floor muscle training  these are exercises for strength and endurance of pelvic floor muscles. The number of pelvic floor exercises undertaken as part of each session is 8-10 times with duration of each session for 30 minutes. The sessions are carried out on an individual basis. There will be 4 appointments with a physiotherapist over 4 weeks, supplemented by a daily program of 3 exercise sessions. The duration of each session with physiotherapist is 45 minutes. The duration of daily home program sessions is 8-10 repetitions 3x30 minute sessions daily for 4 weeks. Each session involve voluntary contraction of urethral, vaginal and anal opening in supine position, side-lying position, sitting and in standing position. Duration of each voluntary contraction of each opening is 6-8 seconds under supervision by physiotherapists.There are not applicable strategies for monitor adherence to the intervention.TENS is not administered to the intervention group. The duration period between treatments is one week.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) will be put on the participant once weekly for 4 weeks but will not emit any current through the electrodes which will be placed over the buttock region for 10 minutes. It is false treatment as it has no treatment value as there will be no output. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pelvic floor muscle strength
For assessment of pelvic floor muscle strength is used PERFECT SCHEME(p-power, e-endurance,r-repetition, f-fast contraction, e-elevation, c-coontraction, t-timing). The power/strength of the maximum voluntary contraction is determined from the modified Oxford scale. 
Modified Oxford Grading:
Grade 0: No discernible contraction
Grade 1: Very weak contraction, aflicker. Slight change in tension only
Grade 2: Weak contraction
Grade 3: Moderate contraction with some squeeze and lift ability. 
Grade 4 : Good contraction; squeeze and lift against resistance
Grade 5: Strong contraction, squeeze and lift against strong resistance.

      <outcome>Pelvic floor muscle endurance
For assessment of pelvic floor muscle endurance is used PERFECT SCHEME(p-power, e-endurance,r-repetition, f-fast contraction, e-elevation, c-coontraction, t-timing). Endurance - the duration of the contraction is noted, up to 10 seconds.

Information will be provide to participants and baseline questionnaire and consent form posted to potential participants. On return of form participants will be assessed by physiotherapists with regard to pelvic floor muscle function measures, then randomised to intervention or control group by the Project Coordinator via the remote automated computer randomisation application.Every consenting participant will be registered and given a unique trial number.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics is used for describing the distribution of a single variable, including its central tendency (including the mean, median, and mode) and dispersion (including the range and quantiles of the data-set, and measures of spread such as the variance and standard deviation). 
The significance of differences in power and endurance of pelvic floor muscle at the first and the last assessment are determined by the chi square test. 
Correlation between differences in power and endurance of pelvic floor muscle at the first and the last assessment is determined by the correlation coefficient.
Correlation between power of pelvic floor muscle and quality of sexual life is determined by the correlation coefficient.
Correlation between endurance of pelvic floor muscle and quality of sexual life is determined by the correlation coefficient.
Correlation between pain and quality of sexual life is determined by the correlation coefficient.
Confidence interval will be used to assess possible differences interval value based on perceived differences between samples.
All results will be considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.
The sample was selected randomly. The method of random sampling was conducted using a random number table. List with the initials of participants will be added to the numbers, and then will be randomly assigned numbers from a table of random numbers. The study  will involve participants whose initials placed under a number that is randomly selected from a table of random numbers.
The number of participants needed to achieve study objectives was determined by the computer calculator program to estimate the required sample size at the Medical Faculty, University of Zagreb (web.mef.hr/if/alati/racunala/tekst/velicina_u.htm).
The number of participants needed to achive study objectives will be determined by the significance level, the statistical power, smaller minimum detectable differences. An increase in sample size will be caused by either decreasing the significance level, by raising the statistical power and by demanding smaller minimum detectable differences. A minimum necessary group size based on this consideration ensures that a mean group difference can be detected at the significance level less than 0.05 with a minimum statistical power of 0.80. Effect size will be selected as the smallest effect that would be important to detect (a change that would be considered meaningful and worthwhile by the patients), in the sense that any effect would not be of clinical of substantive significance. Effect size will be measured as change obtained by dividing the difference in scores from baseline to postreatment by the SD of the baseline scores. The value of the  effect size represents the number of SDs by which the scores have changed from baseline to postreatment. An effect size of 0.2 will be considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8. large.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sexual problems are highly prevalent and are frequently associated with personal distress and impaired quality of life. Approximately 42% of women complained of one or more sexual problems, compared with about 30% of men.Sexual dysfunction often cause problems in sexual life like pain, decreased sexual desire or libido, lack of responsiveness to sexual stimulation, and diminished sexual pleasure or satisfaction.
The aim of this randomised cross-over repeated measures study is to determine whether there is a measurable difference in outcomes for pain and sexual function in patients receiving pelvic floor muscle training compared to a control intervention.
