  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the music therapy intervention group will attend 20 weekly 2-hour choir sessions consisting of singing and social interaction. 90 minutes of singing activities (vocal warm-ups, participant requested songs, round singing, and simple part singing) will be followed by 30 minutes for social interaction over refreshments. The intervention will be facilitated by a Registered Music Therapist in a community venue (ie. community hall, day centre). Music therapist will receive training in how to deliver the intervention protocol (the therapeutic choir sessions) to ensure standardisation of the intervention. An intervention protocol has been developed for this training. This training includes strategies for how to provide cues and modify songs and musical activities  to maximise engagement for people with dementia and also their family caregivers. It will also focus on strategies for managing safety issues and negative responses to the intervention.

The intervention also includes provision of education to participants in the intervention group on how to use their own music therapeutically at home (to promote relaxation and reminiscence) and recordings of songs from choir sessions to use as desired. This education will be provided in the form of written handouts to caregivers with tips and examples for how music can be used to manage behaviour and modify mood. The therapist will check in with caregivers regularly throughout the intervention and provide feedback and suggestions for how to use music therapeutically at home. There is no minimum requirement for participants to use the home music program, rather we will monitor the amount of home music use via a diary completed at each weekly choir session. Attendance logs will also be completed at each weekly choir session to monitor adherence to the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the wait-listed control group will receive usual care only. Usual care for this study is defined as the usual daily activities of participants without the addition of therapeutic choir participation.
Control participants will be able to join a therapeutic choir following completion of their final assessment at week 21.</comparator>

All analyses will be conducted according to intention-to-treat principles, meaning that all available data will analysed as allocated. 

For the health economic analysis, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves will be plotted for each cost-outcome combination to show the likelihood of one treatment being seen as cost-effective relative to another for a range of (implicit) values placed on incremental outcome improvements. Using the net benefit approach, monetary values of incremental effects and incremental costs will be combined, and net benefit derived. This approach allows costs and outcomes to be considered on the same monetary scale, taking account of sampling uncertainty and adjusting for baseline covariates and clustering.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Relationship quality between community-dwelling people with dementia (PwD) and their family caregivers (FCG) is recognised as a major factor that influences health and wellbeing of both, and consequently impacts their ability to live together in the family home. The family home with familiar people and surroundings is recognised as the optimal care environment for PwD. Supporting PwD to remain in the family home also reduces care costs to individuals and society, and is recognised as a strategic priority by the Australian Government. The primary aim of this proposed randomised controlled trial is to determine whether therapeutic choir participation and supported home-based music engagement improve relationship quality between community-dwelling PwD and FCG. Secondary aims will examine whether the choir intervention is cost effective and can improve wellbeing and quality of life indicators for PwD and FCG. 

Key questions to be addressed by this randomised controlled trial ask whether therapeutic choir participation and home-based music engagement for community-dwelling people living with dementia and their family caregivers improve ratings for:
	the primary outcome measuring relationship quality between PwD and FCG
	and secondary outcomes measuring:
1)	quality of life for PwD and FCG 
2)	depression for PwD and FCG
3)     social connectedness for PwD and FCG
3)	caregiver experience for FCG
4)	observations of anxiety in PwD

Using a single-blind, randomised controlled trial, 180 PwD + FCG dyads will be randomised to either 20 weekly choir sessions with home-based music program facilitated by a registered music therapist or a waitlisted control group. Eligible participants, recruited from 6 sites (4 metropolitan and 2 rural), will be community-dwelling people with a diagnosis of dementia and family caregivers who provide the majority of care in the home. Outcome measure questionnaires, collected by a blinded assessor, will be taken prior to the intervention (baseline), midpoint (week 11), and following completion of 20 choir sessions (week 21). </summary>
