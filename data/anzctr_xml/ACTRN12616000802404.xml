  <interventions>
    <interventions>Phase 4, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study with three intervention groups; Intervention Group 1 (IG1), Intervention Group 2 (IG2) and a Control Group (CG). The interventional medication is Varenicline tartrate oral tablets, using both the commercial 0.5mg and 1.0mg tablets. IG1 will be administered a step-up dose, IG2 will be administered a step-down dose, and the control group will take the standard varenicline regimen. Treatment will last for 16 weeks, with 12 weeks of non-treatment follow-up.

IG1: 0.5mg once daily for 7 days, 0.5mg twice daily for 7 days. 1.0mg once daily PLUS 0.5mg once daily for 7 days, 1.0mg twice daily for 11 weeks, two weeks of placebo.
IG2:Placebo for 2 weeks, 0.5mg once daily for 3 days, 0.5mg twice daily for 4 days, 1.0mg twice daily for 11 weeks, 0.5mg twice daily for 7 days, 0.5mg once daily for 7 days.
CG: Placebo for 2 weeks, 0.5mg once daily for 3 days, 0,5mg twice daily for 4 days, 1.0mg twice daily for 11 weeks, placebo for 2 weeks.

The tablets will be provided in Webster-paks(R) to improve ease of dosing, and to monitor tablets adherence during the study. </interventions>

Data will be analysed using SPSS and the following:
- General Linear Models will be used to evaluate differences in the frequency, severity, and duration of adverse effects, cravings, and withdrawal symptoms.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Varenicline remains the most effective pharmacological agent in supporting smokers to quit, though its effectiveness in promoting long term abstinence is inhibited by a number of issues 1. A recent meta-analysis reported that varenicline caused an increase in discontinuation compared to placebo as a result of adverse events, negatively impacting medication adherence and the likelihood of a quit attempt being successful 2. As adherence to varenicline is a major predictor of success during a quit attempt, ensuring completion of the prescribed regimen is needed to optimise the likelihood of a successful quit attempt 3. An additional issue during varenicline treatment is the resurgence of cravings and withdrawal symptoms at the end of the prescribed treatment period. Experiencing these symptoms increase the likelihood of lapse and relapse after achieving initial abstinence 4. 
The primary objective of this clinical study is to compare differences in safety and efficacy outcomes of three different varenicline regimens for smoking cessation over a treatment period of 16 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of follow-up. The regimens are designed to reduce the frequency and severity of adverse effects, cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The secondary objectives are a comparison of carbon monoxide (CO) confirmed continuous abstinence rates (CAR), 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates, and adherence to the study medication throughout treatment.
The primary endpoints are the frequency, severity and duration of adverse events, cravings and withdrawal symptoms. The secondary endpoints are 7 day point prevalence and CO confirmed continuous abstinence rates from weeks 12-16, and weeks 16-28, and medication adherence.
This study is a phase 4, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled single-center study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of varenicline in motivated, smoking subjects allocated to a control group, step-up intervention group, or step-down intervention group. A total of up to 201 participants will be enrolled in to this study at a single site, with 67 participants randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups. This will provide at least 80% power to detect a moderate effect in the primary endpoints. 
Participants meeting eligibility criteria will enter the 16-week double-blind treatment phase, followed by a 12-week follow-up phase, with the study completing at week 28. Follow-up will continue for participants who cease treatment early. Participant enrollment will run from December 2016 to December 2017, with data analysis occurring during and after this period.</summary>
