  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial will be comparing the effectiveness of single lumen needle (study group) against double lumen needle (control group) for the use of  oocyte collection procedure. The single lumen needle is manufactured by the same supplier as the double lumen which are being used routinely at Fertility North,  and both are for single use only. All oocyte collection procedures will be performed by one of the Fertility North specialists at the theatre of Joondalup Health Campus, with one ovary being aspirated using a single lumen and the other using a double lumen needle for each patient. Usually the egg collection procedure takes 10-40 mins. A one-off randomisation in terms of needle type and ovary order is to be performed before oocyte collection, with all other procedures carried out according to standard protocol at the clinic.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two ovaries of the same patient will be randomised for the order of collection and for either single lumen needle (study group) or double lumen needle (control) treatment. Fertilisation outcomes of sibling oocytes collected via both types of needle  and developmental potential of subsequent embryos will be compared.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the efficacy of single lumen needle compared to the double lumen needle which has been routinely used at Fertility North. Each ovary of patients undertaking oocyte collection as part of their IVF/ICSI treatment is aspirated by either a single lumen or double lumen needle after randomisation in randomised order. Subsequent oocytes and resulting embryos are tracked according to their origin, and fertilisation and time-lapse embryology parameters are compared between 2 groups..  </summary>
