  <interventions>
    <interventions>Rapid Syllable Transition Treatment (ReST) - is a complexity based speech therapy approach for children with Childhood Apraxia of Speech. It is based on current Principles of Motor Learning with the intention of maximising long-term maintenance and generalisation of skills. 

ReST has Phase I / II research evidence (e.g. Ballard, Robin, McCabe &amp; McDonald, 2010). 
Treatment dose: 1 hour individual therapy sessions, 4 days a week for 3 weeks. Each session will include 100-120 production trials to ensure consistent practice across treatments.</interventions>
    <comparator>Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme - Third Edition (NDP3) - is a comprehensive treatment package that has been utilised in clinical practice for approximately 30 years since the release of the first edition. The programme aims to improve articulation, voice, resonance and in later levels of the hierarchy morphology, syntax and prosody. The program is hierarchical (bottom-up). The programme works on the next level of skills needed and with frequent, systematic practice  moves onto more complex levels.   

NDP3 has Phase I / II research evidence (e.g. Teal, 2006; Lundeborg &amp; McAllister, 2007) 
Treatment dose: 1 hour inidivual therapy sessions, 4 days a week for 3 weeks (same as ReST treatment).  Each session will include 100-120 production trials to ensure consistent practice across treatments.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) is a motor speech disorder. Children with CAS have difficulties planning the movements required for speech sounds and melody. The difficulties associated with CAS often persist through life and are deterimental to academic, social and vocational development, despite normal intelligence. Currently a number of single case designs are available yet few treatments have been tested or replicated. 

We intend to complete the first randomised control trial to compare two treatments for CAS. The speech therapy treatments we want to compare are 1) the Rapid Syllable Transition Treatment (Ballard et al, 2010) and 2) the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme (3rd edition) (Williams &amp; Stephens, 2004). Both treatments have preliminary promising evidence. 

We want to know if these treatments improve speech sounds and melody in children with CAS age 4-12 years. We also want to know which treatment will make better gains in treated sounds/words/sentences AND untreated but similar sounds/words/sentences.</summary>
