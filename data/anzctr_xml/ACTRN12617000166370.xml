    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint for this trial is a clinically important improvement in the FACT-L TOI. This is defined as an improvement of 5 points or more from baseline, which is maintained for at least 2 consecutive assessments. The proportion of patients in each arm who achieve the primary endpoint will be reported along with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. A chi-squared test of independence will be performed to test the null hypothesis that the proportions are equal against a two-sided alternative, using a 5%
significance level. Supplementary analyses will include adjustment for stratification factors that were used in the randomisation, as well as consider changes in the raw TOI score over time.

Analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed according to the same principles. Binary outcomes will be presented as proportions and compared using chi-squared tests of independence. Continuous outcomes will be summarised by means or medians and compared using independent t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. Time-to-event outcomes will be presented using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared using a log-rank test. A two-sided 5% significance level will be used for all tests and there
will be no formal adjustment for multiple comparisons, but statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes will be interpreted conservatively, particularly if the primary analysis is non-significant. Supplementary subgroup and adjusted analyses will be defined in the statistical analysis plan. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether early referral for palliative care can improve quality of life, cost effectiveness and quality of end of life care for adults who are newly diagnosed with advanced lung cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, extensive small cell lung cancer or advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma within the last 60 days.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either standard care referral to palliative care at the discretion of the treating oncologist, or to receive early referral to palliative care within 7 days of enrolling in this trial. With the exception of the timing of the referral, the palliative care received by each group will be as per standard care, with information and care provided by the palliative care team as required for each participant.

Participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires relating to quality of life and cancer symptoms at regular time points until their death. Carers will be asked to complete quality of life and death questionnaires and an interview at regular intervals up to six months following participant death.

It is anticipated that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether early referral to palliative care following diagnosis of advanced lung cancer is beneficial for patient quality of life and end of life, and cost-effectiveness of care.</summary>
    <trialwebsite />
    <publication />
    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>Patients will be asked at screening to nominate a carer who would be willing to complete study assessments. A carer may be any person (including a relative or friend) whom the patient:
(a) Perceives to be their main support person (primary carer)
(b) Agrees for the research team to approach for potential research participation; and
(c) Is agreeable to have their medical information shared.
Written informed consent must be signed and dated by the carer, and signed and dated by the Investigator, prior to any trial-specific carer assessments being completed.
It is preferable for patients to have a nominated carer however patients unable to nominate a carer who are willing to complete the trial assessments will still be eligible for the trial.</publicnotes>
