Placebo Comparator: Placebo Q2W - Placebo (for alirocumab) subcutaneous (SC) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W) added to stable non-statin lipid modifying therapy (LMT) or diet alone for 24 weeks.

Other: Alirocumab 75 mg Q2W/Up to 150 mg Q2W (Calibrator) - Alirocumab 75 mg SC injection Q2W added to stable non-statin LMT or diet alone for 24 weeks. Alirocumab dose up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W from Week 12 when targeted LDL-C levels at Week 8 were not achieved i.e. LDL-C =70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) or =100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) depending on cardiovascular risk or &lt;30% LDL-C reduction from baseline.

Experimental: Alirocumab 150 mg Q4W/Up to 150 mg Q2W - Alirocumab 150 mg SC injection every 4 weeks (Q4W) alternating with placebo (for alirocumab) Q4W added to stable non-statin LMT or diet alone for 24 weeks. Alirocumab dose up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W from Week 12 when targeted LDL-C levels at Week 8 were not achieved i.e. LDL-C =70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) or =100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) depending on cardiovascular risk or &lt;30% LDL-C reduction from baseline.


Treatment: drugs: Alirocumab
Solution for injection in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of the upper arm by self-injection or by another designated person using auto-injector (also known as pre-filled pen).

Treatment: drugs: Placebo (for Alirocumab)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by a regimen of
      alirocumab including a starting dose of 150 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) as add-on to non-statin
      lipid modifying background therapy or as monotherapy in comparison with placebo in
      participants with primary hypercholesterolemia not treated with a statin.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To evaluate the effects on other lipid parameters of alirocumab 150 mg Q4W versus
           placebo.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab 150 mg Q4W.

      Alirocumab 75 mg Q2W was added as a calibrator arm.</summary>
