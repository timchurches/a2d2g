  <interventions>
    <interventions>An experienced clinical nurse will be appointed to the Cardiometabolic Health Nurse (CHN) position for the six-month trial. Participants randomly allocated to CHN care will attend a baseline CHN appointment involving cardiometabolic assessments including body mass index and waist-hip ratio, health behaviour assessments (eg diet and physical activity), blood pressure, and reviews of cardiometabolic and antipsychotic medication adherence and side-effects. During the subsequent 24-week intervention, the CHN will manage primary care of participants through strategies such as organising further CHN consultations or telephone appointments, providing health behaviour education, and organising referrals to other health professionals and ensuring that these linkages are maintained. All CHN participants will attend a follow-up appointment 24 weeks after their baseline appointment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the usual care group will not attend a CHN appointment, thereby receiving usual standards of primary care within the mental health service for the 24-week trial.</comparator>

    <concealment>Mental health nurses (MHNs) will be responsible for  participant recruitment over a two-month period. MHNs will invite N = 154 adult consumers who they believe to meet eligibility criteria to participate in this study.  MHNs will first provide a brief verbal description of the study, and then provide the consumer with a study information sheet and informed consent form. Completed informed consent forms will be provided to an independent biostatistician who will randomise participants to CHN or usual care using SPSS software. The CHN will be provided with contact details for participants allocated to CHN care for the purposes of arranging and following up on appointments; as a result the CHN will not be blinded to participant treatment allocation, and participants will not be blinded to treatment allocation as they will know whether or not they receive CHN care. A research assistant (RA) will be responsible for conducting telephone interviews with all study participants at three time-points. The RA will be blinded to treatment allocation of participants. Additionally MHNs will be blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The biostatistician will perform simple randomisation of participants using the SPSS random sample of cases function(i.e. computerised sequence generation).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this six-month randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to determine whether access to a cardiometabolic health nurse (CHN) results in improved primary care for the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disorders such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, compared to usual care in a regional Queensland mental health service. The secondary aim is to determine whether the CHN group demonstrate improvements in objectively-assessed and self-reported physical and mental health. We hypothesise that:
1.	Greater numbers of primary health care services for cardiometabolic health disorders will be provided to the CHN care group than the usual care group during the six-month intervention.
2.	Greater improvements in measures of physical and mental health will be observed in the CHN care group over the six-month intervention compared to the usual care group, and the CHN care group will also demonstrate improvements in health behaviours.</summary>
