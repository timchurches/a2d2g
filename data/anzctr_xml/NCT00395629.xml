  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change of Serum Ferritin From Baseline to the End of Extension, by Dose Cohort (Extension Per-protocol Population) - Mean absolute change in serum ferritin from baseline to the end of the extension study.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Concentrations of Deferasirox (ICL670), by Dose Cohort (Per-protocol Population) - A blood sample was collected just prior to administration of the next dose of Deferasirox (pre-dose trough level) or approximately 24 hours after the previous dose at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. The mean trough concentration at each time point was calculated.</outcome>
