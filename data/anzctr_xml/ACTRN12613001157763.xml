    <summary>This study is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) for the treatment of lung tumours.  

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if; 
+ you are aged 18 years or above
+ have 1-3 lung metastases from any  non-haematological primary tumour
+ you are medically inoperable, high risk or have decline surgery
+ you have not had any previous high-dose radiotheradpy to the chest region

Study details: 
SABR is an exciting novel radiotherapy technique that is delivered over very few sessions. In the case of limited lung metastases, SABR can result in long-term survival. It is non-invasive and associated with high rates of tumour control and relatively low toxicity. Additionally, the large doses of precision radiotherapy involved may evoke a strong immune response to recognise and attack any remaining tumour cells. There are two SABR techniques emerging in Australia; fractionated and single fraction treatments. 
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to receive either multi-fraction SABR (4 fractions over 2 weeks) or single fraction SABR (1 fraction only). 
All participants will be assessed at regular intervals post treatment in order to evaluate the toxicity, Quality of Life, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of single fraction SABR compared to multi-fraction SABR. 
The follow-up visits occur every 3 months in 1st year post  treatment, then every 4 months in the second year and then 6 monthly until study closure (2 years after the last participant finishes study treatment).
