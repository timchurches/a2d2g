  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cholecalciferol liquid (1000 IU/0.2 mls) administered orally at a dose of 50,000 IU (10mls) weekly for 8 weeks and then monthly until 6 months</interventions>
    <comparator>placebo; 10 mls of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) administered orally weekly for 8 weeks and then monthly until 6 months. MCT is the base for the active drug used in this study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences in muscle strength between placebo and active treatment arms.
Muscle strength is assessed using hand grip and Chatillon dynomometers. 
Muscle groupls assessed: hip flexors, knee flexors and extensors, elbow flexors and extensors, shoulder abductors, grip strength using standard protocols for testing.
Differences in  strength of individual muscle groups and for overall summed musculoskeletal function will be assessed at baseline and 6 months by 2 sample  t-test and by comparing percentage change from baseline to 6 months. Test results for musculoskeletal tests will be transformed to z-scores and summed for an overall index of musculoskeletal function measure according to O'Brien (see references).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Laboratory data: differences between groups in levels of 25OHD, calcitriol, ALP and bone specific ALP, intact-PTH, TRACP-5B, Ca and P. All analyses performed on samples of serum or plasma taken by venesection prior to commencement of dialysis following the longest weekly interdialytic break (3 days).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life scores (KDQOL 36).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulse Wave Velocity (an indicator of vascular stiffness). This is assessed as time for pulse wave transmission from the carotid to femoral artery using ultrasound and the SpygmoCor machine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events:  hypercalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia,  falls, fracture, parathyroidectomy, hospital admission, cardiovascular events, all cause mortality.
The patient's falls diary will be checked monthly.
Levels of calcium and phosphate will be assessed on routine monthly bloods.
Adverse events including surgery, other admissions, medical complications or new symptoms will be assessed by monthly telephone interviews with the attending dialysis nursing staff and for verification, reference to the patient's hospital record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional testing: 
Timed Chair Stands: participants are asked to fold their arms across their chests and to stand up from a sitting position once. If they successfully rise from the chair, they are asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional testing:
Standing balance: subjects are asked to attempt to maintain their feet in the side-by-side, semi-tandem (heel of one foot beside the big toe of the other foot), and tandem (heel of one foot directly in front of the other foot) positions for 10 seconds each. If participant is unable to hold the position for 10 seconds, record result.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional testing:
Six minute walk test: measures the distance covered when subjects are instructed to walk as quickly as they can for 6 minutes on a level course. This test has been used as a measure of cardiovascular exercise capacity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants will be randomly assigned to active treatment with oral cholecalciferol using a single (10 ml) dose of 50000 IU weekly for 8 weeks then 50000 IU monthly or identical placebo. Dosing will be under the supervision of dialysis nursing staff at the conclusion of dialysis sessions. Testing at baseline and 6 months will be performed as described above.</summary>
