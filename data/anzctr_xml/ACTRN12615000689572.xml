The primary HRQOL endpoint will be the patients profile of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) over the first 12 months from randomisation. Analyses will be based on contrasts of predicted means that estimate the mean area under the time curve (AUC) of HRQOL scores for each treatment arm. The repeated measurements of the HRQOL score over the first 12 months will be analysed by fitting linear mixed models using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The F-test will be used to test for a treatment by time interaction and comparisons between treatment groups at each time point will be based on t-tests that utilise the predicted means and standard errors of difference that are recovered from the fitted mixed model. A non-inferiority t-test is used to compare the contrasts of the predicted means that correspond to the trapezoidal rule for calculation of the mean AUC in each treatment arm. The null hypothesis for this test will specify a non-inferiority margin of -109 units (approximately 15% of the corresponding 12-month conjectured AUC in the EORTC Phase III Soffietti 2013 paper) and the test will be one-sided with alpha=0.05.

Sample size:

The sample size for this phase II study has been pragmatically determined. Nevertheless with 30 evaluable patients in a treatment arm, the non-inferiority t-test (one-sided alpha=0.05) of the null hypothesis that that mean AUC in the observation is more than 109 units below the mean AUC in the adjuvant arm has more than 80% power when the arms are exactly equivalent, the standard deviation of an assessment is 21, and, the intraclass correlation (ICC) (between-patient variance divided by the total variance) is less than 0.32. We will randomise 32 patients in each arm in order to account for potential drop outs.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to address whether the timing of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) after surgical removal of brain metastases impacts on quality of life; that is, whether treatment on local recurrence (disease returning at the surgical cavity) impacts on quality of life more than upfront SRT following resection of brain metastases. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have had 1-3 brain metastases surgically removed.

Study details:
After surgical removal of brain metastases, in the absence of further treatment, about half of patients will develop a recurrence (disease returning) within the surgical cavity(s), while about half will not.
 
For patients who had 1-3 brain metastases surgically removed, SRT targeting the surgical cavity(s) has been shown to provide local control rates of 70-90% at 1 year. Nevertheless, approximately 50% of patients are destined to never recur at the surgical cavity(s); hence close observation, with radiotherapy at the first sign of recurrence is also often practised. This approach spares treatment in potentially half of patients. By using regular 3-monthly MRIs of the brain, most recurrences should be detected while they are small and before symptoms develop. 

The study aims to address whether the timing of SRT after surgical removal of brain metastases impacts on quality of life. We are also studying the effect of treatment on patients neurocognitive function (memory, thinking processes). It is hypothesized that delivering SRT on local recurrence is no worse than upfront SRT to resection cavity in terms of patients quality of life.
