  <trial_identification>
    <studytitle>A study of providing adult smokers, who smoke at least one cigarette per day, the opportunity to sample a range of nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) in everyday non-medical community locations, to determine if this is acceptable to smokers, and whether it increases their motivation to quit smoking, encourages them to use NRTs, and helps them to quit smoking and remain abstinent for three months. </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A pilot uncontrolled single arm non-randomised open-label trial of the acceptability and effect on motivation to quit and compliance with use of nicotine replacement therapy of supplying nicotine replacement therapies to smokers in community locations regardless of their motivation to quit smoking.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial will consist of kiosks in community locations where smokers go about their everday lives (such as shopping malls), which are staffed by trained quit coaches.  People who smoke at least once per day, will be given the opportunity to sample a range of nicotine replacement therapies while being guided in the appropriate manner of using them by an expert coach. They can choose from the following products: Nicotine patch (21mg, 14mg, 7mg); nicotine gum (2mg, 4mg); nicotine lozenge (2mg, 1mg); nicotine mouthspray (QuickMist) 1mg/spray; Nicorette Inhalator 15mg. They can choose to sample as many products as they wish, however, if participants have not voluntarily chosen to try wearing a patch, they will be gently encouraged to do so, although they can decline to try wearing a patch if they do not want to.  If participatns wish, they may take a free sample of a week's worth of as many of the products as they want (however, they must be products that they have chosen to sample at the kiosk under supervision of an expert coach).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>7-day point prevalence (not smoking even a puff in the past 7 days).  This will be by self-report (either by telephone or by visitng the kiosk at the mall), and if the subjects are willing to visit the kiosk at the mall, this will be verified by an exhaled carbon monoxide level of less than 10 parts per million.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 18 after first attendance at the kiosk.  At these time-points every effort will be make to encourage participants to attend the kiosk to provide carbon monoxide verification of their abstinence status (abstinence defined as &lt;10ppm), however if subjects are unwilling to visit the mall, this outcome will be measured by self-report over the telephone.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Amount of nicotine replacement therapy/therapies used, measured by self-report via telephone or at visit to the kiosk locations.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study of making a range of nicotine replacement therapies available to smokers in locations where they go about their everyday lives, regardless of their level of motivation to quit smoking.  The hypothesis is that giving smokers the opportunity to sample a range of therapies, under the guidance of an expert coach, will increase their motivation to quit, increase their usage of nicotine replacement therapy, and lead them to try to quit smoking.</summary>
