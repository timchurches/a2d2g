  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A total of 100 people with chronic HCV and recent injection drug use or recipients of opioid
      substitution therapy will be enrolled in 5 countries and 21 study sites. Participants with
      genotype 1a infection or cirrhosis will receive 12 weeks of open-label
      paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir and dasabuvir ("3D"), and twice-daily ribavirin.
      Participants with genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis will receive 12 weeks of open-label
      "3D". The study consists of a screening phase (6 weeks), treatment phase (12 weeks) and
      follow-up phase (96 weeks) to evaluate treatment response and reinfection.</summary>
