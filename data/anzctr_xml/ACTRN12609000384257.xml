  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is provided to participants while undergoing radiotherapy, which can vary between 20 and &gt;40 treatments. It is provided by a psychologist in 10minute sessions twice weekly, following radiotherapy for the duration of treatment. At each session, participants receive Psycho-Education for depression, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for depression, Motivational Interviewing for nutritional compliance. These are psychological therapies and involve short discussions with a psychologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group was a sample of Head and Neck Cancer patients recruited in 2007-2008 as part of an earlier observational study using identical inclusion criteria. The control group did not receive any Psychological intervention and received radiotherapy treatment as usual. In the context of a psychological intervention within an oncology population, the historical control group was considered to have been the "no treatment" arm of the study.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of additional psychological support for people receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer in helping with depression and malnutrition. 

Participants will receive: - psycho-education for depression - cognitive behaviour therapy for depression - motivational interviewing for improving nutrition. These are 10 minute sessions, twice weekly, following radiotherapy treatments. 

Participants are assessed for depression and malnutrition during the first week of treatment, last week of treatment and four weeks after treatment. Depression and malnutrition are both measured using validated assessment tools. 

The study aims to see whether depression and malnutrition can be effectively addressed by providing additional psychological support.</summary>
