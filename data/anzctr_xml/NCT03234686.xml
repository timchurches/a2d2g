  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Deferiprone 600mg delayed release tablets
Treatment: drugs - Placebo Oral Tablet

Experimental: Deferiprone - Patients will orally receive the equivalent 15 mg/kg of 600mg delayed release Deferiprone tablets twice daily.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Patients will receive matching placebo tablets designed to mimic the experimental treatment, twice daily


Treatment: drugs: Deferiprone 600mg delayed release tablets
The active substance, Deferiprone, is a member of the 3-hydroxypyrid-4-one class of iron chelators, which have a high affinity for ferric iron, binding it in a 3:1 (Deferiprone:iron) molar ratio.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo Oral Tablet
The placebo will mimic the Deferiprone arm in every way, except the placebo will not include the active ingredient

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy of Deferiprone - Comparison of the efficacy of Deferiprone (15 mg/kg) administered orally twice a day with a matching placebo in subjects with pAD (MCI with brain amyloid pathology) or mAD at 12 months relative to baseline. This will be measured by a series of paper and electronic assessments called the NTB</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Safety and Tolerability) - Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence and severity of AEs and changes from baseline of all relevant parameters, including clinical laboratory values, vital signs, ECG and other safety biomarkers. Severity of AEs will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 4.03. All subjects will be monitored for AEs until resolution.</outcome>

    <summary>This study is a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of Deferiprone in participants with Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (pAD)
      and Mild Alzheimer's Disease (mAD). In this phase 2 study, the investigators aim to determine
      whether Deferiprone (15 mg/kg BID orally) slows cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. As
      secondary outcomes, safety and iron levels in the brain will be evaluated.</summary>
