  <interventions>
    <interventions>A set of hand motor skill (to catch a toy, to brush the teeth, to fling an object, to dress the hair, to button and to moor), and other motor skills during standing (to kick the ball, to spin, to walk and to run) was observed if they are present or absent for infant and adult subjects. For each action composing the two sets of motor skills it was calculated the absence or presence rate in percent of total group (infant and adult). All observations were recorded in one skill test.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence rate of actions observed in two sets of motor skills (handling and standing actions). Rates was calculated by number of subjects presenting action per total of subjects (infant or adult).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pesence rate of observed actions was recorded in one skill test.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absent rate of actions observed in two sets of motor skills (handling and standing actions). Rates was calculated by number of subjects not presenting action per total of subjects (infant or adult).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Absent rate of observed actions was recorded in one skill test.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aimed to observe presence and absent rate in the achievement of some motor skills of handling and other carried out standing in sample of infants and adult deaf-blind comparing if the proportions observed in the infancy presented discrepancies with the proportions expected in the maturity.</summary>
