    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment will be achieved through the use of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. These envelopes will contain the unique patient identifier code and allocated study therapy details.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomised 1:1 to the intervention or standard care. Subjects will be stratified into “high risk of AKI” and “low risk of AKI” using well recognised criteria.
The randomisation sequence will be generated by an independent statistician using computer-generated random numbers to ensure even distribution of the stratification factor across both arms and to minimise the predictability of the allocation sequence. Participants will be randomised to treatment just prior to surgery.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart surgery is a common procedure, with more than 2500 operations each year in New Zealand. Damage to organs, including kidneys, liver and heart is common after heart surgery and some of the damage may be caused by extra oxygen given on cardiopulmonary bypass. This study will randomise patients to receive normal levels of oxygen or the traditional high levels during heart surgery. Endpoints include a number of blood tests that are very sensitive for detecting damage to the kidney, liver, heart and other organs. In total 286 patients having heart surgery at Auckland City Hospital will be included in this study over a two year period.</summary>
