  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-sequence study.

Subjects will remain housed in the study center through the first 14 nights and receive the following treatments orally with approximately 240 mL of room-temperature water in a fixed sequence:

Days 1-2:	One placebo capsule once-daily taken immediately before a standard breakfast.
Day 3:One IPX233 ER C0003 capsule 4 mg taken immediately before a standard breakfast.
Day 4:One placebo capsule taken immediately before a standard breakfast.
Days 5-6-7-8-9-10-11:One IPX233 ER C0003 capsule  4 mg  once-daily taken immediately before a standard breakfast.
Days 12-13:One placebo capsule once-daily taken immediately before a standard breakfast.

      <timepoint>Serial blood samples (6 mL each) will be collected at the following timepoints relative to the time of study drug administration on each day:

Day 1: Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours postdose
Day 2:  Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing) and 12 hours postdose
Day 3: Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours postdose
Day 4: Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing) and 12 hours postdose
Day 5:Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours postdose
Days 6-7-8-9-10:Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing) 
Day 11:Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours postdose
Day 12: Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing) and 12 hours postdose
Day 13: Pre-dose (up to 30 min before dosing) and 12 hours postdose
Day 14: 	Approximately same time as when subject was dosed
Day 15:	Approximately same time as when subject was dosed (if subject is required to return for safety assessments)
Day 16: 	Approximately same time as when subject was dosed (if subject is required to return for safety assessments)
Day 17: 	Approximately same time as when subject was dosed (if subject is required to return for safety assessments)

      <outcome>Safety</outcome>
      <timepoint>12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs including orthostatic heart rate and blood pressure, adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications will be evaluated over the course of the study from screening to Study Exit at Day 17.  Physical examinations will be performed at Screening and at Study Exit.  12-lead ECGs will be evaluated prior to the administration of IPX233 and after dosing.  Vital signs including standing orthostatic heart rate and blood pressure will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments.
