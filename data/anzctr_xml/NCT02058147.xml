    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Insulin glargine/lixisenatide Fixed Ratio Combination
Treatment: drugs - Insulin glargine (HOE901)
Treatment: drugs - Lixisenatide (AVE0010)
Treatment: drugs - Metformin

Experimental: Insulin Glargine/Lixisenatide Fixed Ratio Combination (FRC) - FRC once daily (QD) for 30 weeks. Dose individually adjusted.

Active Comparator: Insulin Glargine - Insulin glargine QD for 30 weeks. Dose individually adjusted.

Active Comparator: Lixisenatide - Lixisenatide 10 mcg QD for 2 weeks, then 20 mcg QD (maintenance dose).


Treatment: drugs: Insulin glargine/lixisenatide Fixed Ratio Combination
Insulin glargine/Lixisenatide FRC was self-administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in the morning within one hour before breakfast using one of the 2 prefilled disposable SoloStarÂ® pen-injectors: Pen A containing 100 U/mL insulin glargine (Lantus, 100 U/mL) and 50 mcg/mL lixisenatide in a ratio of 2 U:1 mcg, used for administration of doses from 10 U to 40 U (10 U/5mcg to 40 U/20mcg). Pen B containing 100 U/mL insulin glargine (Lantus, 100 U/mL) and 33 mcg/mL lixisenatide in a ratio of 3 U:1 mcg, used to administer doses from 41 U to 60 U (41 U/13 mcg to 60 U/20 mcg). The starting dose was 10 U/5 mcg. Dose was then adjusted individually to reach and maintain fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) of 80 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycemia.

Treatment: drugs: Insulin glargine (HOE901)
Insulin glargine (100 U/mL) was self-administered by SC injection at approximately the same time every day. Dose was adjusted individually to reach and maintain fasting SMPG of 80 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycemia.

Treatment: drugs: Lixisenatide (AVE0010)
Lixisenatide was self-administered by SC injection within 0 to 60 minutes before breakfast or evening meal. If the maintenance dose of 20 mcg was not tolerated, dose could be reduced to 10 mcg.

Treatment: drugs: Metformin
Pharmaceutical form: Tablet; Route of administration: Oral administration.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in HbA1c From Baseline to Week 30 - Primary outcome was to test superiority of FRC versus Lixisenatide and non-inferiority versus Insulin glargine.
Change in HbA1c was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 30 value.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 30</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HbA1c &lt;7.0% or =6.5% at Week 30 - Participants without Week 30 value for HbA1c were counted as non-responders.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 30</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Plasma Glucose Excursion From Baseline to Week 30 - Plasma glucose excursion = 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) value minus plasma glucose value obtained 30 minutes prior to the start of meal and before investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration if IMP was injected before breakfast. Change in plasma glucose excursions were calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 30 value. Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Body Weight From Baseline to Week 30 - Change in body weight was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 30 value.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) From Baseline to Week 30 - Change in FPG was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 30 value.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in 7-point Self-monitored Plasma Glucose (SMPG) Profile From Baseline to Week 30 - Participants recorded a 7-point plasma glucose profile measured before and 2 hours after each meal and at bedtime two times in a week before baseline, before visit Week 12 and before visit Week 30 and the average value across the profiles performed in the week before a visit for the 7-time points was calculated. Change in average 7-point SMPG was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 30 value. The analysis included all scheduled measurements obtained during the study. The missing data was handled by mixed effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Reaching HbA1c &lt;7.0% at Week 30 With No Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia (PG = 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) During 30-Week Treatment Period - Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of =70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). The analysis included all HbA1c measurements at Week 30, including those obtained after the IMP discontinuation or the introduction of rescue medication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 30</timepoint>

If fasting SMPG value exceeded the specified limit for 3 consecutive days, the central laboratory FPG (and HbA1c after Week 12) was performed. Threshold values - from Week 8 to Week 12: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L), and from Week 12 to Week 30: fasting SMPG/FPG &gt;200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c &gt;8%.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Events Per Subject-Year - Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of = 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).</outcome>
      <timepoint>First dose of study drug up to 1 day after the last dose administration (median treatment exposure: 211 days)</timepoint>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia - Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of = 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).</outcome>
      <timepoint>First dose of study drug up to 1 day after the last dose administration (median treatment exposure: 211 days)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia - Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose measurements might not have been available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal was considered sufficient evidence that the event had been induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia included all episodes in which neurological impairment was severe enough to prevent self-treatment, and which were thus thought to place participants at risk of injury to themselves or others.</outcome>

    <summary>Primary Objective:

      To compare the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination to lixisenatide alone
      and to insulin glargine alone (on top of metformin treatment) in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)
      change from baseline to Week 30.

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the overall efficacy and safety of insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio
      combination (FRC) to insulin glargine alone and to lixisenatide alone (on top of metformin
      treatment) over a 30 week treatment period in participants with type 2 diabetes.</summary>
