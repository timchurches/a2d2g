Behaviour - Walking exercise

Experimental: 1 - 

Active Comparator: 2 - 


Behaviour: Skilled motor training
This involves training subjects to independently and cognitively activate the deep abdominal muscles, transversus abdominis, with minimal or no activity in other trunk muscles. The contraction is held for 10 seconds and subjects complete three blocks of ten contractions, twice per day for two weeks. This training protocol is commonly used clinically for people with chronic back pain.

Behaviour: Walking exercise
The control intervention involves walking exercises for ten minutes, twice per day. Subjects are advised to walk at their own pace with no instructions on activation of specific trunk muscles. The exercise is performed over two weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The motor cortex of the brain changes following chronic pain and injury, and this is linked
      to pain-associated changes in motor behaviour. This study aimed to investigate whether
      therapeutic exercises in patients with chronic pain can induce reorganisation of the motor
      cortex and restore normal motor behaviour. The investigators hypothesised that motor training
      can induce reorganisation of the motor cortex and that these changes are related to improved
      motor behaviour.</summary>
