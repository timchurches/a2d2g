    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Individuals will be randomised when  a  group of 6-12  consenting participants at a particular site have achieved therapeutic effect on Consta at 6 weeks, and each of the participants consent to participate in the study.  The group of 6-12 participants will be randomised into two groups, one group of 3-6 to receive the control condition (Consta alone) and the other group of 3-6 to receive Consta and collaborative therapy. There will be a time window during which participants can be randomised, between 6 weeks since starting on Consta and 3 months since starting, when collaborative therapy will be commenced for the treatment group. Allocation is not concealed from the researcher running the group, however it is consealed from the researchers conducting the post group assessments. Method of allocation concealment: central randomisation by computer with allocation schedule in a password protected and encrypted file.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation tables are created by computer software. We use permuted blocks stratified by site. Randomisation is block simultaneous.</sequence>
