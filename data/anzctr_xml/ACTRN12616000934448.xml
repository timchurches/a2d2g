  <interventions>
    <interventions>The maternal cervix will be assessed using shear wave elastography during the fetal morphology scan.  This assessment will indicate the strength of the maternal cervix.  The shear wave imaging will be performed by Australian Sonographer Accreditation Registry (ASAR) accredited Sonographers under the supervision of Radiologists.  The extra assessment of the cervix using shear wave imaging will add up to 10 minutes to the standard ultrasound examination.
The imaging will be performed at the private medical imaging practice of SKG Radiology in Perth, Western Australia.  The community branches that will be used for data collection are located at Morley and Rockingham. 
Participants will receive a patient information form prior to consenting to be part of the study that they will keep, and a consent form will also be signed.
All Sonographers who are involved in the data collection will receive training prior to commencement.  This training will comprise two times two hour sessions.  The topics that will be covered will include the physics of shear wave ultrasound presented in a power point format and practical demonstration of the technique.  This will take place with small group sessions of less than 10 Sonographers.  The training will be conducted by the Sonographer who will lead the data collection for this research, following consultation with the Radiologist leading this research.  The sites utilized for training will be at the locations of SKG Radiology Morley and Rockingham. A two hour session will be performed at each site.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be the non-pregnant women who are enrolled into the study.  The cervical mean cervical strength for the non-pregnant women will be  compared to the strength of the pregnant participants.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>For this research data analysis will be performed using SPSS software (SPSS, Chicago, USA). 
A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 
This research will have multiple outcomes.
1. Standard stiffness values for the pregnant and non-pregnant cervix in the transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound approaches will be formulated; this descriptive data will be presented as mean +/- standard deviation. 
2. A cut-off value between what would be considered a normal cervical stiffness and a reduced cervical stiffness which would indicate an increased risk of preterm birth will be formulated; the accuracy of cervical stiffness, as assessed by both transabdominal and transvaginal techniques, in the prediction of subsequent preterm birth status will be assessed with the use of binary logistic regression modelling.
3. Formulation of a standard ratio between the myometrium and cervix for a strong and soft cervix; this descriptive data will be presented as mean +/- standard deviation. 
4. Inter-operator and intra-operator testing will also be performed; the continuous quantitative measures will be performed using the 
paired t-test of non-equality. 
5. Relevant demographic and medical history of participants will be presented as  variables that will also be included in the set of candidate predictors
Estimation of sample size has been performed with consultation from a statistician.  A peer reviewed journal article identified a statistically significant difference between the stiffness of cervical tissue in ripened and unripened hysterectomy specimens of the cervix utilising shear wave elastography.  The difference between the mean values and the standard deviations of these values were utilised to formulate a sample size using an equation for samples sizes in medical research, a level of significance of p&lt;0.05 was also utilised.  Calculations resulted in a requirement of 50 normal (non-pregnant) cervices needing to be compared to 50 soft cervices with cervical ripening indicative of imminent birth.  The preterm birth rate in Australia in 2011 was 7.5% of all pregnancies.  This rate equates to a ratio of 1:12.33 for babies born preterm to those born at term.  This ratio was then used to calculate that for every 667 babies born, there should be 50 that are born preterm.  So we expect that 50 babies will be born preterm out of the sample off 667 participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of this study is to trial the use of ultrasonic shear wave elastography to test the strength of the maternal cervix during pregnancy. The primary objective of this research is to establish the correlation between cervical stiffness and risk of preterm birth due to reduced cervical strength. This research will have multiple hypotheses.  The first being that the cervical stiffness registered in non-gravid participants will be greater than in gravid participants.  Secondly participants who deliver at preterm will have a reduced cervical strength compared to women who deliver at term.  A further hypothesis is that cervical length will be related to cervical strength, the longer the registered cervical length, the greater the strength of the cervix, and also the cervical strength will be greater than the strength of the myometrium (muscle of the uterus).</summary>
