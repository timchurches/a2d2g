          3. Patients must have completed or withdrawn from CSLCT-SCIG-05-23 and wish to continue
             SCIg therapy; or, patients ineligible for CSLCT-SCIG-05-23 but for whom the
             Investigator believes SCIg may be a suitable form of Ig replacement, for reasons such
             as: poor tolerability of IVIg, difficult venous access, or, preferred route of
             administration.

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Patients eligible for CSLCT-SCIG-05-23 if still open for recruitment.

          2. Patients with known anaphylaxis reactions to immunoglobulin therapy.

          3. Patients with known selective IgA deficiency or antibodies to IgA with a history of
             reactions to Ig therapy.

          4. Patients with protein-losing enteropathies.

          5. Patients who are suffering from an acute or chronic medical condition, other than PID,
             which may, in the opinion of the Investigator, affect their treatment or the conduct
             of the trial.

          6. Females who are pregnant, breast feeding or planning a pregnancy during the course of
             the study. Females who are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy
             test at screening.

          7. Patients unwilling to comply with the protocol.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous Ig NextGen 16% in
      patients with Primary Immune Deficiency who require Immunoglobulin (Ig) G replacement
      therapy. Ig NextGen 16% is a liquid immunoglobulin (antibody) preparation.</summary>
