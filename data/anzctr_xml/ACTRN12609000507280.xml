  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will have a blood sample taken to measure blood fats and cholesterol. Participants will then ingest a sugar solution to raise their blood sugar level over two hours, and a further blood sample will be taken. A series of physical measurements will be taken and participants will complete questionnaires about their demographics, health behaviour, health status, use of health services and usual care. Participants in the intervention arm will then attend 6 sessions of a diabetes prevention program (diet and lifestyle modification) with an accredited provider. Session 1 is a 45-60 minute individual session with the program facilitator, Sessions 2-4 are 1.5 hour group sessions held at 2 week intervals, and Session 5 is a 1.5 hour group session held at 8 months after Session 1.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The estimation of reduction in the risk of diabetes imputed from the outcomes of clinical trials, using extrapolation of the changes in weight and waist circumference.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 months (intervention group only) and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparative information from clinical measures (blood pressure, hip measurements, and blood lipids/fats/glucose) from intervention and control participants. More specifically, blood pressure will be assessed using a simple mercury sphygmomanometer; hip measurements will be taken using a plastic tailors measuring tape; and blood lipids/fats and glucose will be assessed by blood analysis of blood taken from the vein in the antecubital fossa.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 months (intervention group only) and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparative information from behavioural measures (as assessed by validated clinical tools) from intervention and control participants</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 months (intervention group only) and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health economic information about the diabetes prevention program (and comparison with usual care) will be assessed by combining the cost data with the clinical and behavioural data to produce a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). This ICER will be comapred to a reference threshold (i.e $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) to determine 'value for money'. The modelled evaluation will use a Markov approach to estimate the health impacts of changes in diabetes risk status over the lifetime of participants. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by members of the study team, mainly by approaching people in pharmacies and invitng them to complete a diabetes risk test. Those who score within the 'high risk' range will be invited to participate in study. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group after they have been screened for diabetes. Randomisation will be conducted by the project manager. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation will be generated by a random number table and placed in individual, numbered and sealed, opaque envelopes; this will be conducted by the trial Biostatistician. Once a participant has consented and meet the eligibility criteria, the study team member will contact the Project Manager who will select the next sequential envelope, open it in front of an independent witness, and inform the study participant of the randomisation group. A randomisation log will be kept which will contain the participant number, treatment group, envelope number and signatures from both the Project Manager and the independent witness.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this NH&amp;MRC funded project are to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a structured primary care based diabetes prevention program (Life!) being implemented in Victoria for people of the age over 50 years who are at high risk of type 2 diabetes.
This will be achieved by monitoring clinical and behavioural outcomes of participants of the Life! program before and after completion (particularly any reduction in diabetes risk, weight and central body obesity, and changes in quality of life) and by comparing these with another group receiving usual care at the same time. Economic assessment will be performed by
evaluating whether the program is value-for-money using economic analysis, modelling of longer term impacts, and evaluating of any efficiency issues.</summary>
