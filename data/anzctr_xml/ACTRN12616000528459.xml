  <interventions>
    <interventions>The goal of this work is to, in a prospective, randomized study, examine whether there are differences in transfer of knowledge between printed and web-based information to children and relatives before anesthesia and surgery.

a). The web-site includes information about the body and how it works, how it is being in hospital and what happens before, during and after anesthesia and surgery.
The system is interactive and contains age-specific information i.e. cartoons, web-books, videos and interviews with children in different ages. The information for children is available in Swedish, English, Spanish and Arabic. The information for adults is available in over 25 different languagues.
b) The information is administred to the families on the pre-anaesthetic meeting 2-3 weeks before the day of surgery.
c) The information for children and parents have the same contains in general but in addition ,for the parents, information is provided about how to prepare the child for the hospital visit, when to talk to them, what to say etc.
d) The information is available and free internet. The families get a card with the web-adress.
e) The web-site contains data about i.e. the number of the visitors entries, what specific parts which have visitors, how often and for how long time, country and choice of languages. These data can be seen in trends over the days, seasons and years</interventions>

      <outcome>Aggregated score by the children regarding answers to control questions at the day of surgery, prior to anesthesia induction.

The questions where designed specifically for this study. Same answers can be found in both medias (webb and broschure). 
The questions includes:
1. Knowledge of specific terms often used at the hospital.
2. Fasting procedures iv-procedures
3. Sterile and safety procedures 
4. Pain management

    <statisticalmethods>The power analysis is based on the ability to detect a 20 % difference in aggregated points of the answers to the preoperative control questions (p &lt; 0.05). The power analysis resulted in the need of a total sample size of 200 patients (100 patients in each group). To handle a greater difference than the expected 20 % an interim analysis is included after a total of 120 patients, when with a requested p-value &lt; 0.02.

Traditional non-parametric statistics will be used to compare the total aggregate points between the two study groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The provision of preoperative information is of key importance in paediatric anaesthesia. As a complement to the preoperative conversation with the anaesthetist conventional brochure information is often provided to the children and their parents. However, web-based information is currently preferred in many situations in society today. The aim of this study is to compared knowledge tranfer between a modern interactive web-based information format with that of traditional brochure information. Our hypothesis is that web.based information is more effective concerning knowledge tranfer compared to the traditional text material.</summary>
