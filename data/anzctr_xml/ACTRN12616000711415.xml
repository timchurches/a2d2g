    <interventions>Standardised paediatrician care and in-home nudge modifications (intervention group):

Standardised paediatrician care will be delivered by community-based general paediatricians trained in the assessment of obesity for the study. Parent(s) and the child will attend a single 45-minute consultation at the childs usual paediatric practice. The consultation will provide: (1) brief clinical assessment of weight-related health (usually to confirm simple obesity without unusual causes or comorbidities requiring medical management); (2) effective communication about obesity using simple tools understood by families; and (3) additional testing, treatment or referral to a specialist tertiary weight management clinic for the few cases for whom these would be clearly indicated. There will be no cost to families for this consultation. Though unlikely, families will be free to schedule further weight management appointments at the paediatricians' discretion without the involvement of the research team.

The in-home nudge modifications will be delivered in person by a trained research assistant over four home visits. The first visit will be an assessment (60 minutes, one researcher), followed by further visits one week later to implement the nudges (90 minutes, two researchers) and one and three months later to refine them (both 30-45 minutes, one researcher). Phone support with a trained research assistant will be available for the duration of the intervention. 

A nudge is any aspect of the decision-making environment that encourages choices that individuals recognise are good for them but which they may nevertheless struggle to make (eg whether or not to have that second slice of cake). It does not  restrict their options. In the context of obesity, nudges are about making healthy choices easier. The nudges used in this study are derived from existing methods that have shown some promise in the promotion of health behaviour. Examples include (but are not limited to) smaller tableware to limit overconsumption, cutlery designed to slow eating rate and enhance internal satiety cues, school lunchboxes with compartments specified for healthy foods, and fruit bowls to make healthy foods visible and easily accessible, while less healthy alternatives are out of sight and less easily accessed. 

At home visits, the research assistant will recommend a suite of nudges to each family based on (a) their questionnaire information and (b) the first home assessment. Families will choose which nudges they feel able to implement based on their own situation. As each nudge is could have at most a small impact in and of itself, and nudges are expected to be additive, we will encourage families to choose as many suitable nudges as possible. Families will be asked to maintain the nudges until the follow-up assessment six months after randomisation. Self-reported adherence will be assessed using study-designed questions in the follow-up survey, and we will record whether implemented nudges have been sustained at home visit 3 and 4. Encouragement  will be given at the home visits and in any family-initiated telephone support to improve  fidelity.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care (control group):

Families in the usual care group will not be offered the standardised paediatric care consultation or in-home nudge modifications. Parents will be informed that they are free to seek assistance for obesity from their childs paediatrician and/or other health services. Should they present to a paediatrician trained for the study, the paediatrician will be able to assess the child's health using skills gained in the training process. Based on our experience in previous obesity trials, we expect very few to do so suggesting that this source of contamination will also be low in this study. Even for those that do, resulting BMI change is unlikely since they will not receive the nudge intervention and a single paediatrician assessment has not be shown to result in relative BMI reduction. </comparator>

3. are taking medication known to significantly affect weight (eg risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole metformin, topiramate, SSRIs, and SNRIs), or

    <concealment>Eligibility will be determined by a trained research assistant during a screening session at the participating paediatric practice  (inclusion criteria) and a subsequent follow-up call (exclusion criteria). Eligible and interested families will be sent an enrolment pack with a consent form and baseline survey. Upon receipt of the completed consent form and survey, participants will be automatically allocated to groups when their details are entered into the REDCap database used for the study. Allocation concealment will be achieved by (a) these details being entered by a research assistant not otherwise involved in the project, and (b) randomisation using a concealed allocation sequence in REDCap stratified by child gender and pre-generated by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute. The allocation sequence will be uploaded to an otherwise inaccessible section of the database.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>We aim to recruit a sample of 20 children, A power calculation was not conducted as this is a pilot trial to examine feasibility and acceptability. Instead, this sample size is informed by our previous experience conducting obesity intervention studies and allows for computation of 95% confidence intervals for the median of continuous outcome measures (eg change in BMI z-score) without requiring normal distribution assumptions (ie non-parametric confidence intervals).

The statistical methods used will inform sample sizes and inclusion criteria for a subsequent trial assessing efficacy. Screening and recruitment rates will be reported. Sample characteristics of potential outcome variables and covariates will be described, using mean, range, standard deviation and distribution quantiles. Parent report of the acceptability of the intervention will be presented, as will barriers to paediatrician consultation attendance and uptake of specific home modifications. Individual changes in obesity measures will be calculated and reported for each group using measures of central tendency (eg mean, medians with 95% confidence intervals) and data dispersion (eg standard deviation, interquartile range), and effect sizes will be established.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this pilot randomised controlled trial is to determine the acceptability and feasibility of a novel approach to the treatment of childhood obesity. The approach has two components: 1) an assessment of obese 3-11 year old children's weight-related health by a trained paediatrician, and 2) an in-home intervention where the research team will work with these children's families to make a series of small 'nudge' modifications to the home environment that encourage healthier decision making (eg replacing plates with smaller versions to counter unintentional overconsumption). We hypothesise that the approach will be acceptable to children, parents and paediatricians and feasible to deliver. If so, this pilot study will inform the development of a larger trial designed to test whether the approach is effective.</summary>
