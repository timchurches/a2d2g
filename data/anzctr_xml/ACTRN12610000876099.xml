  <interventions>
    <interventions>Inflation of a pneumatic tourniquet device on an upper limb for one, two or three periods of five minute at a time to induce remote ischaemic preconditioning (assignment to control, one, two or three cuff inflations will be by randomisation using a computer generated list of random numbers).  Each period of inflation involves inflation to a pressure of 200mmHg for five minutes and is followed by five minutes of deflation.</interventions>
    <comparator>No blood pressure cuff inflation (Note this is a Dose Comparison but a dose of zero will be used).  For the control, a blood pressure cuff will be placed on the upper limb but will not be inflated.</comparator>

    <concealment>Eligible patients will be approached the day prior to planned coronary artery surgery and will be randomly assigned to control of one of three escalating doses of remote ischaemic preconditioning.  Allocation will be concealed from subjects as they will be under general anaesthesia at the time of intervention; however, the trial will not otherwise be blinded.</concealment>
