  <interventions>
    <interventions>After obtaining written informed consent, the patient will undergo to 5 consecutive 30-minute trials: 1) Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV_1); 2) Venturi mask; 3) Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV_2); 4) Optiflow; 5) Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV_3). 
The sequence of Venturi mask and Optiflow trials will be randomized, according to a sequence generated by a computer. During non-invasive ventilation (NIV) trials (NIV_1, NIV_2 and NIV_3), the inspiratory support will be given with a dedicated ventilator for NIV, in Pressure Support Ventilation mode, through a mask, as clinically indicated.  The Optiflow will be initially set with the highest flow value between 50-60 L/min, according to the patient's tolerance. The nasal cannula size will be appropriately chosen. Moreover, the temperature of the heater will be set at 37 degrees 
During all trials, FiO2 will be kept unchanged, in order to assure an arterial saturation in O2 &gt; 94% (SpO2). </interventions>
    <comparator>The Optiflow will be compared with the application of simple Oxygen therapy delivered throughout a Venturi mask with a nominal FiO2 equal to those set during NIV and Optiflow trials. The L/min of Oxygen will be modified according to the nominal FiO2 required and to the Venturi kit used.</comparator>

    <concealment>Everyday all patients admitted in our intensive care unit will be screened for meeting inclusion criteria. The randomization sequence for the cross-over design is contained in sealed opaque envelopes, in the office of the director of the ICU. When the patient is enrolled, a nurse or a doctor not involved in the study is asked to take the envelopes and read to the investigator the randomization sequence for Venturi and Optiflow.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use a computer-generated randomization sequence, which will be generated by an independent statistician who is not otherwise involved in the trial. The envelopes will be kept in the head nursesâ€™ office. The nurses who open the envelopes will be those on shift and will be totally independent from the enrollment process. They will communicate the random treatment allocation to the physician responsible for the patient enrollment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In patients affected by severe exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure (SE-CRF), with worsened hypercapnia and respiratory  acidosis, the sole oxygen therapy is not enough and a ventilatory assistance is required, most of the time through a mask or helmet, so call non-invasive ventilation. The advantage of NIV is to guarantee a ventilatory assistance, avoiding complications related to the presence of the endotracheal tube, such as ventilator associated pneumonia. Furthermore, it has been widely shown that, in patients with SE-CRF, NIV reduces the mortality rate, as opposed to invasive mechanical ventilation.
However, NIV is a "bridge-therapy", applied in the attempt to permit the pharmacological treatments (i.e. antibiotics and bronchodilators) solve the underlying reason of exacerbation; afterwards, patients can be weaned from NIV, and, whenever required, starts oxygen therapy.
Among devices for oxygen therapy, Venturi mask is frequently used in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), because it is possible to provide a nominal fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) between 24 and 60%. Recently a new device has become commercially available (Optiflow, Fisher &amp; Paykel, New Zealand) able to provide high flow of heated and humidified gas through nasal cannula. The humidification of gas flow reduces the risk of mucosa dryness and airway muco-ciliar clearence. The use of high-flow of gas (up to 60L/min) permits to provide accurate FiO2 during all the inspiratory phase and to wash out the naso-pharyngeal dead space, in addition to the application of a minimal positive pressure. In patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failures of mild to moderate degree, Optiflow has been shown to be better tolerated and to guarantee a better oxygenation, in comparison with Venturi mask. Moreover, in another study a high-flow oxygen-therapy system has been shown to reduce the respiratory rate in patients with CRF and the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). 
Basing on these data, the Optiflow system could potentially positively influence the inspiratory effort of patients experiencing SE-CRF, when compared to Venturi mask.
Though both commonly used in clinical practice, nowadays no study has compared Optiflow with Venturi mask at this regard.
We aim to evaluate if some differences in respiratory effort exists between Venturi mask and Optiflow, in patients recovering from SE-CRF, through a diaphragm ultrasonogaphy evaluation.</summary>
