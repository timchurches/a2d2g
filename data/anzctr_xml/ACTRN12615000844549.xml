  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, two-arm superiority trial. Eligible participants will be aged 50-80 years undergoing primary unilateral anterior THR for osteoarthritis. Participants will be assigned to intraoperative periarticular infiltration of 2.5ml/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine or 0.9% saline. All other care, including anaesthetic technique, postoperative analgesia and mobilisation programs, will be the same for both groups.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Recovery-15 score. QoR-15 is a well-validated patient reported outcome measure, designed to assess generic early postoperative quality of recovery. It consists of 15 questions on an 11 point scale to give a potential total score of 150. The questions are whether the participant has been able to breathe easily, been able to enjoy food, feeling rested, have had a good sleep, able to look after personal toilet and hygiene unaided, able to communicate with family or friends, getting support from hospital doctors and nurses, able to return to work or usual home activities, feeling comfortable and in control, having a feeling of general well-being, moderate pain, severe pain, nausea or vomiting, feeling worried or anxious and feeling sad or depressed. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Before study commencement, 114 opaque, sealed, stapled envelopes containing the written letter ‘R’ for 0.2% ropivacaine or ‘S’ for 0.9% saline will be placed in sequential order, according to the stratified randomisation schedule. They will be labelled, placed in a secure box and stored in Compounding Pharmacy at Epworth Richmond. This will be done by two competent individuals who are not otherwise involved in this study. The sterile study solutions will be pre-prepared in individual identical containers with content labels by an independent hospital pharmacist. After enrolling a participant on the day of surgery, the research nurse will inform the pharmacist of the name, gender and study number of the participant. The pharmacist will write the participant’s name on the relevant envelope, then open it to determine the study drug to be supplied. The allocated drug container will be relabelled with the participant’s name, gender, study number and the words ‘0.2% ropivacaine or 0.9% saline’, then transported to the operating suite. Allocation will be concealed until after completion of statistical analysis.</concealment>
    <sequence>A biostatistician will prepare a computer-generated randomisation schedule using random permuted blocks. Participants will be allocated to one of of two treatment arms. Based on best practice for smaller samples and female: male ratio (1.5:1) from previous data, randomisation will be stratified by gender.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint of the study is group difference in quality of recovery as measured by the QoR-15. Examination of the relevant literature as well as discussion with the developer of the QoR-15, suggests that a difference in group means between the placebo and the LIA group of 10 points on the QoR-15 could be expected, and is clinically significant. The pooled standard deviation of the QoR-15 score for the two groups is estimated to be 12-15. Using the conservative estimate of 15 for the SD, the expected effect size is estimated to be 10/15 = 0.67. Assuming a statistical power of 0.90 and a 2-tailed alpha value of 0.05, and employing SAS Power and Sample Size, 49 patients per group would be required. Allowing for 15% attrition, 57 patients per group will be required, for a total of 114 patients.

An intention-to-treat analysis will be used. Group baseline characteristics will be examined for confounding factors. The primary outcome, QoR-15 score, will be analysed with means and standard deviations, as will other dimensional variables, with methods appropriate for extreme scores that have previously been applied to the analysis of musculoskeletal data being employed if necessary. Categorical variables will be analysed using appropriate binomial or chi-square tests, while count variables will be analysed using appropriate methods such as those based upon the Poisson distribution. 95% confidence intervals will be computed throughout. Statistical analyses will be conducted using standard packages such as Stata v13. No interim analysis is planned.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Major joint replacement surgery has an important role in improving the quality of life for many people. As Australias population grows and ages, joint replacement surgery will be performed more often. In 2014, over 11,000 hip joint replacements were performed in Victoria alone. Improved postoperative and longer-term mobility and comfort provides benefits not just for an individual, but also for the whole community.
The anaesthetists role as a perioperative physician means that one clinical responsibility is to provide patients with rapid recovery to an appropriate level of function. This can be achieved by providing effective analgesia, which can be administered well, with few side effects. In practice, there is sometimes a trade-off in the balance between these goals. The widely used technique of infiltrating local anaesthetic into the hip joint during surgery is simple, with seemingly few side-effects. It is usually used together with analgesics such as paracetamol, anti-inflammatories and morphine tablets. However, recent studies have questioned its effectiveness at reducing pain in the traditional surgical approach to hip replacement. To date, no study has examined its effectiveness in the setting of less invasive surgery (anterior hip replacement).
We aim to determine whether adding intraoperative local anaesthetic infiltration to standard multimodal oral analgesia will improve recovery after anterior hip replacement. 114 participants will be randomly allocated to receive infiltration of local anaesthetic or saline placebo during surgery. Any improvement in general wellbeing and mobility, or reduction in postoperative pain, will have a positive impact on a large surgical population. A negative result will provide evidence that the local anaesthetic infiltration technique should no longer be used for pain relief after anterior hip replacement surgery.</summary>
