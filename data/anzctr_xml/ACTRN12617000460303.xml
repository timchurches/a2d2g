    <interventions>Brief title: Home-based aerobic exercise program. 4 groups; Ex-Dose 1, Ex-Dose 2, Ex-Dose 3, Ex-Dose 4

The same intervention (home-based exercise aerobic exercise) will be delivered in all 4 arms of the trial, only the dose will differ.

Dose is defined as the total accumulated exercise time per week. 
Ex-Dose 1 = 30 min/week (3x10min sessions) 
Ex-Dose 2 = 45 min/week (3 x 15 min sessions
Ex-Dose 3 = 60 min/week (3 x 20 min sessions)
Ex-Dose 4 = 75 min/wee, (3 x 25 min sessions)

Physical materials: participants will be provided with 
A heart rate monitor (includes a chest strap and wrist watch, (Garmin Forerunner 25, or similar).
An iPad or Tablet (if they do not own a suitable device)
An information booklet and exercise program

The intervention will consist of exercises designed to increase heart rate to required target zone. Exercises may include activities such as walking, marching, sit to stand exercises, mini-squats and combination exercises. Each exercise session will have a 5 minute warm up and cool down period. Exercise sessions will consist of short bouts of alternating high (target 85% HR max) and low (target 55% HR max) intensity activities. The length of the intensity bouts will progressively increase, to the target of 2 min low intensity/ 2 mins high intensity. Programs will take into account initial fitness level, degree of disability and participant exercise preference.

 The intervention will be delivered by a research team members with minimum qualifications of bachelor degrees in exercise and sports science, physical education, physiotherapy, or other allied health, who have been trained by the lead investigator.

All intervention sessions (home based aerobic exercise) will be supervised via the internet (telehealth) by research team members.  

Frequency: 3 times per week
Time period: 8 weeks
Number of sessions: 24
Intensity:  Target intensity of 55-85% of age predicted maximum heart rate 
Session Duration: The session duration will vary by group (Ex-Dose 1 = 10min/session; Ex-Dose 2 = 15min/session, Ex-Dose 3 = 20min/session, Ex-Dose 4 = 25min/session) plus 5 min warm up and 5 min cool down per session.
Location: in-home

The intervention will be personalised for each participant, based on their initial fitness, stroke severity, and exercise capacity such that the target heart rates are met in each session. Exercise programs may be adjusted individually if target intensities are not being met. Clinical judgement will be used to change or adapt programmed exercises if required while the overall dose is maintained.

Intervention adherence:
All exercise sessions will be supervised via telehealth, and heart rate data monitored in real time.

    <designfeatures>A dose-finding design. Cohorts of participants (n=5 per dose) will be given increasingly higher doses of exercise until a pre-defined proportion show an increase in cardiorespiratory fitness above a pre-defined clinically important threshold following an 8-week exercise program. 

Dose is defined as the total accumulated exercise time per week, commencing at 30 min.week-1 (3x10min) increasing incrementally per dose by 15min/week (5min per session). The subsequent doses are 45 (3x15), 60 (3x20), 75 (3x25), min.week-1. 

Minimum response criteria (MRC). An increase in VO2peak of 2ml.kg-1.min-1. This is the mean change reported in previous studies of stroke survivors and represents an increase of approximately 15%.

Dose limiting threshold (DLT): DLT is reached if participants i) fail to complete more than 50% of the prescribed weekly exercise dose due to factors related to the intervention ii) are unable to exercise for the required session duration iii) withdraw from the study due to injury or illness that can be attributed to the intervention or iv) experience difficulty performing their normal activities of daily living following the exercise dose. The dose limiting threshold must not be reached by more than one third of any cohort.
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The design minimises the numbers of participants treated with both low ineffective doses and high toxic doses. A total sample size of n=20 (5 per dose, 4 successive doses). 
Descriptive statistics will be used to assess whether individual participants met the minimum response criteria (increase in VO2peak of at least 2ml.kg-1.min-1) and the dose limiting criteria.
Within participant change in the secondary outcome measures will be assessed descriptive statistics.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To determine the minimum dose of exercise required to elicit a positive clinically meaningful improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness in stroke survivors.

Eligible participants are independently- ambulant, community dwelling stroke survivors who have met the screening criteria. Fitness will be assessed pre, during and after an 8-week exercise intervention. Habitual activity (over a 7-day period) will also be assessed at these time points.

Baseline measures include demographics (age, gender, living arrangements), stroke-specific variables (stroke type and severity, time since stroke, side affected, level of disability, anthropometric measures (height, weight, girths), cognitive function and exercise preference.

Intervention
Participants will participate an 8-week 3 day/week home-based individually prescribed exercise program and will be monitored remotely via tele-rehabilitation.. 

Exercise sessions will consist of 5 minute intervals at alternating higher/lower intensities (55-85% HR max), progressing from 30s/30s to 2min/2min by week 8 as tolerated. Programs will take into account initial fitness level, degree of disability and participant preference. The starting dose duration will be 30 min/week, progressing 15min/week per dose.

The primary outcome will be the smallest dose of exercise required to increase cardiorespiratory fitness by 2ml.kg-1.min-1 in 8 weeks where dose is defined as the total number of minutes of exercise prescribed per week at a moderate to vigorous intensity (55 to 85% HR max).

Secondary measures include blood pressure, weight, girths, cycle GXT peak power output, peak HR, lactate, walking ability, mood (anxiety and depression), physical activity level and health-related quality of life factors (HRQoL).</summary>
