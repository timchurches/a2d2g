  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety as measured by the number of treatment-emergent and related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE (v4.03). - Safety will be assessed as the reported incidence, number and severity of AEs, SAEs or AE-related discontinuation from the study, change from baseline in vital signs (body weight, blood pressure, heart rate), out of reference range laboratory results (serum chemistries including renal function, hematology, coagulation) and ECG assessments through week 24. [Time Frame: Treatment Period (24 weeks) and Follow-up Period (week 24 to week 128)]</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy as measured by the percentage change in lactate dehydrogenase or LDH levels from baseline to Day 169 during treatment with ALXN1210. - Percentage change in serum LDH levels (IU/L) from Baseline to week 24.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximal concentration of ALXN1210 in blood (tmax)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in concentration of complement factor 5 (C5). Change from baseline in serum levels of terminal complement activity - Pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of ALXN1210 will be assessed by changes from baseline in complement related and hematologic parameters [Time Frame: Treatment Period (24 weeks) and Follow-up Period (week 24 to week 128)]</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Development of antibodies against ALXN1210. - Assessment of anti-ALXN1210 antibodies (whether detectable, and titers if positive) from baseline through end of study [Time Frame: Treatment Period through Follow-up Period (week 24 to week 128)]</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 128 weeks</timepoint>
