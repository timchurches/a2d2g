  <interventions>
    <interventions>All intervention participants will separately complete 6 lessons of Internet based treatment about the management of symptoms of depression. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 7 days between lessons and a maximum of 14 days). Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Group 1 participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, weekly reminder emails, and one-on-one contact with the Clinician (Clinical Psychologist) by telephone or email in the first 2 weeks, then as required. The participant receives a template email from the clinician twice in the first two weeks congratulating the participant on their progress. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and contact with the participant either by phone or email is initiated. Weve found that people who get the most out of our programs spend about 3-4 hours a week completing the homework tasks and applying the new skills theyre learning on a daily basis. The treatment materials are based on cognitive behavioural techniques. Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practising skills</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>We would expect pre-post improvement of ES 1.0 for the iCBT group on the primary MDD measure. We also expect the iCBT group to improve more than the waitlist group by an ES of 0.8. Sample size is powered to have an 80% chance of detecting differences at p&lt;.05. All analyses will be undertaken using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) ANOVA with measurement occasion as a within-groups factor and intervention as a between-groups factor. Relationships between observations at different occasions will be modelled with an unstructured covariance matrix. For each experimental group, planned contrasts will be used to compare changes from baseline to post-test, 3- and 6-month follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are the two leading causes of disease burden in developed countries. Both conditions are highly prevalent amongst older Australians, and frequently co-occur. In patients with comorbid CVD and depression, treatment for depression is effective in improving depressive and cardiac symptoms, as well as reducing mortality risks. The current study aims to determine whether a novel internet-delivered treatment for major depression, which is cost-effective and amenable to widespread dissemination, is similarly effective. The current study will also be the first to explore the causal pathways underlying reductions in cardiac events and mortality risk following treatment for depression. 
In order to address these aims, older (&gt;50 years) individuals with comorbid CVD and depression will be recruited from the St Vincents Hospital Heart and Lung Outpatients Clinic. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive clinician-assisted internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression (n=50) or treatment as usual (n=50). Relative reductions in depressive and cardiac symptoms between the intervention group and control group will be compared immediately post-treatment, whilst 6 month follow up of the intervention group will establish longer term benefits of the intervention.
