  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as
      short-term prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in people who have close familial
      contact with the disease. The study is observational only. The primary measure used in this
      study will be the incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving
      prophylaxis. Seroconversion to pandemic influenza, the incidence of adverse events and the
      relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis will also be examined. This
      project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia, Hong Kong or
      Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the continued use of
      neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency response to
      pandemic influenza.</summary>
