  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ward-based Diversional Therapy program.
A Diversional Therapist will be employed 6 hours/day for 4 days/week to provide individual and group Diversional Therapy sessions, for a period of 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Normal ward care, no Diversional Therapy.
Data will be collected from interviews with patients' families, staff questionnaires and behavioural mapping, during a one month period prior to the commencement of the Diversional Therapist.</comparator>

    <interventioncode>Rehabilitation</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Interviews with families will be recorded, transcribed and the data analysed for themes.
Patient questionnaires contain Likert scales as well as open ended questions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline data will be collected in the month before the Diversional Therapist starts. 
'Post' data will be collected after the Diversional Therapy program has been operating for one month. There will be further data collection during the period of the Diversional Therapy program, and at its completion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Behavioural mapping of Huntington's Disease patients activities and interactions on a subacute neurological ward.
The behavioural mapping will generate data that can be collated into frequencies of observations in various categories.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline data will be collected in the month before the Diversional Therapist starts. 
'Post' data will be collected after the Diversional Therapy program has been operating for one month.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Staff attitudes to caring for patients with Huntington's Disease (HD) on a subacute neurological ward, using interviews and questionaires.
Interviews with staff will be recorded, transcribed and the data analysed for themes.
Staff questionnaires contain Likert scales as well as open ended questions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline data will be collected in the month before the Diversional Therapist starts. 
'Post' data will be collected after the Diversional Therapy program has been operating for one month. There will be further data collection during the period of the Diversional Therapy program, and at its completion.</timepoint>

    <summary>This study aims to investigate how the introduction of a Diversional Therapist effects patients with Huntington's Disease, in an inpatient neurological setting. In particular we are interested in how these patients do or do not engage with other people and with activities.</summary>
