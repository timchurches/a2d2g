  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program will have two arms: (1) risk reframing workshops to help parents and teachers distinguish manageable from unhealthy risk and recognise the benefits of manageable risktaking (e.g., becoming more responsible, vigilant) and (2) introducing materials with no obvious play value to the school playground to provide opportunities for adults and children to practice promoting and engaging in manageable risk-taking in the context of social, creative and active play.
Risk Reframing workshops: 3 workshops will be provided each lasting 2 hours in duration. The focus of the workshop is on helping parents and teachers distinguish manageable from unhealthy risk-taking and recognize the benefits of manageable risk-taking (e.g., becoming more responsible, vigilant). Our previous research findings indicated that parents and teachers would benefit from follow up workshops. Two sessions have been added to this intervention to allow for continued discussion among participants about their experiences of risk reframing.
Playground Materials:introducing materials with no obvious play value to the school playground to provide opportunities for adults and children to practice promoting and engaging in manageable risk-taking in the context of social, creative and active play. Play materials will meet 7 criteria: 1) are, or are made from, re-cycled materials; 2) have no obvious play value; 3) encourage cooperative, gross motor play; 4) have multiple uses; 5) promote challenging and creative play; 6) provide interesting sensory experiences (e.g., from touch or movement); and 7) any hazards inherent to the materials can easily be identified and managed by a child. New materials will be introduced periodically to replace broken items and complement existing materials. Maintenance of the materials will be the joint responsibility of the researchers and school staff.
Two groups (consisting of 3 schools in each group) will each receive both components of the intervention. Three schools will receive the intervention first and three schools will receive the intervention second. Each program will engage in 2 rounds of intervention over 2 years. In Round 1, interventions will be introduced after a 2-term delay or withdrawn for 2 terms (depending on group membership). In Round 2, each program will retain the materials uninterrupted for 3 terms.
Time frame: The study will take place over 3 years. Two schools will be involved in each year. Following a short (1-2 week) baseline when pretest measures will be taken, each of the schools will engage in both intervention and control phases; only the order (intervention first or control first) will be different. Schools that have intervention first will be involved in project activities for 2 terms followed by 2 terms when the research team collects data but no other project activities occur. For the other schools, it will be the opposite: 2 terms of data collection only followed by 2 terms of project activities. We will decide which schools are in which group by lottery. A school term is approximately 2.5  months in duration and two terms is approximately 5 months. Therefore intervention period is approx. 5 months + control period approx. 5 months. The risk reframing sessions with adults will take place at the outset of the intervention for each school (e.g., week 1) and follow-up sessions will occur at the mid-point (e.g., after two months of intervention, approximately week 10) and again near the end (e.g., approximately week 19). Scheduling the risk reframing sessions will require a degree of flexibility to ensure opportunity for participants to attend. </interventions>
    <comparator>We will employ a cluster randomised cross-over trial with each of 6 programs representing a cluster. Because programs for children with disabilities differ substantially, each will serve as its own control. On entry to the study each program will be assigned randomly to a Baseline First or Intervention First
group (3 programs/group). To examine sustainability of the intervention, each program will participate for 2 years.
Six Sydney-area primary-school-based programs for children with disabilities will participate. Administrators from several programs have expressed eagerness to participate: ASPECT
(multiple satellite schools for children with autism), Giant Steps School (children with autism), St Gabriels School (children with hearing impairments and other developmental disabilities), Madang Avenue Public (special unit; children with developmental disabilities) and Auburn Public (special unit; children with
developmental disabilities). The control arm of the research involves two terms of no intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adults promotion of manageable risk taking and childrens increasingly responsible actions on the playground
Hypothesis: significant increases in - Ratio of time spent in positive play transactions* to time spent in negative transactions** (primary measure derived from modified SOPLAY
described below as the Playground Observation System).
Playground Observation System. Implemented daily during recess across both intervention and no intervention phases. Following procedures from a modified version of the System for Observing Play and Leisure Activity in Youth (SOPLAY), a researcher will record (1x/min) on a specially designed tablet
(backed up by a surveillance camera), the nature and type of activities in which children and adults engage in the space during lunch/recess. SOPLAY has evidence for very good to excellent inter-observer reliabilities, ranging from 88% to 97% agreement (m = 94%) on each of 5 contextual variables. We will train raters and check reliability periodically to avoid rater drift. We will use these findings to calculate the primary outcome: ratio of time in positive play transactions to time in negative transactions</outcome>
      <timepoint>At regularly scheduled intervals on a weekly basis throughout the intervention phase a researcher will record (1x/min) on a specially designed tablet (backed up by a surveillance camera), the nature and type of activities in which children and adults engage in the space during lunch/recess.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child coping ability assessed by Mean scores on the Coping Inventory - An observation instrument used to assess the behaviour patterns and skills that are the resources a child uses to meet personal needs and to adapt to the demands of the environment. A 48-item scale completed by regular caregivers of children aged 3-16. Factor analysis revealed evidence for one factor accounting for 75% of the variance; high correlation with school achievement (California Achievement Tests; r = .71);
significant but low correlations with self concept (Piers Harris; r = .17); interrater reliability r = .90 to .92; internal consistency  alpha = .84 to .98; SEm  .03.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Completed by teachers at the beginning and end of each study phase.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parents and teachers comfort with children
taking manageable risks. Measured by Mean scores on the Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale (TRiPS) and a revised Willingness to Grant Autonomy Scale. 
TRiPs: A 32-item scale completed by parents for children aged 2 to 12. Rasch analysis revealed excellent evidence for
internal construct validity (goodness of fit within acceptable range for all items) and reliability (person separation 2.63; reliability index= 0.87) and near perfect correlation with child age.
Willingness to Grant Autonomy Scale: A 15-item questionnaire completed by parents regarding how much they want to share control with their adolescent. We will incorporate some age-appropriate questions from this scale into the TRiPs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Completed by parents and teachers at the beginning and end of each study phase.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceptions of parents and teachers regarding manageable risk taking and childrens abilities to assume responsibility
Qualitative Evidence: In-depth (~ 1 hour), semi-structured interviews with 36 parents and teachers (6 total/program) nominated by principals and purposely selected to represent a range of opinions about the value of the program or tolerance of risk. Qualitative interviewing is an optimal way to understand the
subjective experiences and world views of participants. We will adhere to accepted procedures to ensure trustworthiness of the data (e.g., triangulation. journalling).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Interview data. Interviews will be conducted approximately 2 months after the final risk reframing  intervention.</timepoint>

    <summary>We will examine the effect of innovative programs for changing the way parents and teachers view manageable risk-taking for children with disabilities and increasing the level of responsibility that children take for their own actions. The program will have two arms: (1) risk reframing workshops to help parents and teachers distinguish manageable from unhealthy risk and recognise the benefits of manageable risktaking (e.g., becoming more responsible, vigilant) and (2) introducing materials with no obvious play value to the school playground to provide opportunities for adults and children to practice promoting and engaging in manageable risk-taking in the context of social, creative and active play.</summary>
