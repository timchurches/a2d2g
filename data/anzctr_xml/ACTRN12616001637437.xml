  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study, escalating doses of single agent Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) will be administered for the treatment of melanoma, head &amp; neck cancer, sarcoma and renal cancer. Patients will be treated with a combination of intratumoural CFA and intravenous pembrolizumab to characterize the safety and anti-tumour activity of this combination. 
CFA will be administered at the start of a 42 day cycle. This cycle will be repeated every 42 days at discretion of the investigator.
 
One cohort (3 patients) will start at a dose level of 0.5ml of CFA, one will start at 1ml of CFA and the third will start at 2ml of CFA. At any dose level if no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) are observed, the dose will be escalated. Patients must complete 1 cycle of treatment with the minimum safety evaluation and drug exposure, or have had a DLT within the first cycle of treatment to be considered evaluable for dose escalation decisions. CFA dose can be escalated at discretion of the investigator if the patient is deriving benefit and has not experienced DLT or a serious adverse event. Intermediate or additional dose levels of CFA may also be considered depending upon the safety and tolerability of this agent. If a DLT is observed in 1 out of 3 patients at a given dose level, up to an additional 3 patients will be enrolled and treated at that dose level. If patients at that dose level have DLTs, the dose will be decreased to the previous dose level and 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level. When up to 3 additional patients are added to a given dose level, if 1 of the 6 patients has a DLT, that dose will be declared as maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase II dose. If 2 of the first 3 or 2 of the total 6 patients experience DLTs at the initial dose level of 0.5 ml CFA, further enrollment will be halted and the study terminated or amended to evaluate lower doses. Dose escalation will continue until identification of the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose or a suitable lower dose for expansion. 

Pembrolizumab will be administered every three weeks.

    <summary>This study will investigate the safety of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) in Patients with Refractory and Relapsed Solid Tumours. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have a histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor (melanoma, head &amp; neck, sarcoma, renal and other cancers) for which no curable therapy exists.

Study details
This study involves the use of an investigational drug called CFA. "Investigational" means that the drug has not yet been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for treatment of cancer. CFA consists of three ingredients: mineral oil, surfactant, and heat-killed mycobacterium. Injection of CFA into tumour creates a localised depot of killed bacteria, which are slowly released over weeks. This causes an influx of immune cells to the site on injection, and initiates a powerful immune response. The other drug (pembrolizumab) is an approved novel agent for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Participants in the study will receive CFA in combination with pembrolizumab. 

CFA will be administered in 42 day cycles starting at a dose of 0.5 ml for the first cohort of three patients. These patients will be monitored closely and provided there are no safety concerns additional patients will be enrolled and treated with 1.0 ml of CFA and subsequently a third cohort will be enrolled with a starting dose of 2.0 ml of CFA. Once a participant experiences an adverse event as a result of the CFA dose, this dose level will be expanded with three additional patients enrolled. If two of the six participants experience a reaction the dose will be decreased to the previous level and three additional patients will be added. If one of the six patients experience a reaction that dose will be declared the maximum tolerated dose for CFA. Pembrolizumab will be administered following approved guidelines (2mg/kg) on day 2 of the first cycle and then every three weeks. 

Safety of CFA will be assessed at Day 1 of each 42 day cycle. Participants will be followed for up to 30 days after removal from treatment to determine therapeutic benefit and anti-tumour effect of CFA. Patients removed from treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed up until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.</summary>
