  <trial_design>

    <purpose>Diagnosis</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At risk subjects will be self-referred (recruited directly by advertising in the community) and identified by general practitioners. We plan to compare 400 subjects with HF screening and therapy vs 400 controls. 

Clinical evaluation: All subjects will undertake a clinical history and answer questionnaires on general health status (EQ5D), activity (DASI) and heart failure symptoms (MLHFQ). All will undergo a screening echo for overt LV dysfunction (EF &lt;40%) or valvular disease. If these results are abnormal, subjects will be excluded.

Study protocol: A central (web-based) randomization program will be used to allocate patients to advanced vs conventional imaging only after the patient is enrolled. This allocation concealment will prevent the person performing recruitment from knowing the allocated group at the time of inclusion. Subsequent management decisions are not based on randomization and will occur as a "usual care' response to data provided from imaging.

Conventional imaging: Limited to evaluation of EF and valve disease.

Advanced cardiac imaging: Inclusion of global longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction evaluation. Presence of a global strain &lt;16% or raised filling pressure at diastolic function evaluation will provoke GP referral for initiation of treatment (see below).
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation). Randomization is stratified on the basis of diabetes status.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Those with an abnormal test will be identified as having Stage B heart failure, and sent to their GP for treatment targeted at better blood pressure and glucose control. Additional protective therapy (ACE inhibitors and beta blockers) will be added and titrated to target dose by the GP.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Outcomes of patients will be compared with a t-test (change in 6-minute walk test) or survival analysis (heart failure). Multivariable models (respectively linear and Cox regression) will be developed to identify effect size, and will be extremely important if groups are mismatched despite randomization. All analyses will be performed on an intention to treat basis.

Power calculations - Assuming subclinical cardiac dysfunction in 30%, we would expect 120 patients suitable for treatment (which we would expect to reduce heart failure to 5%) and 280 to screen negative, in whom heart failure would be expected in 10%. 
Assuming a similar 6-minute walk to previous work in patients with a similar risk profile to be 525+/-113m, so a 5% change could be identified with 297 patients per group at a power of 80%, at a p&lt;0.05. Both calculations were performed using SPSS Sample Power 2.0, using respectively survival and t-test modules.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to reduce the deaths caused by Heart Failure in Tasmania. This will be achieved through implementation of a screening program for cardiac dysfunction and the use of protective therapy that will limit the development of heart failure. We plan to show the benefit of testing by recruitment of "at risk" subjects from the community and randomising them to a screening program based on echocardiography. Patients with abnormalities will be entered into a program of cardio-protective therapy, supervised by their general practitioner.
Endpoints: 6-minute walk at a minimum of 24 months and comparison of the rate of heart failure among groups.
