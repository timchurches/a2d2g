  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with clinically and histologically diagnosed autoimmune bullous disease will participate in the development of a disease specific quality of life instrument. They will express the ways in which their blistering diseases affects their quality of life. Based on these responses, a pilot questionnaire will be developed. Patients will then be asked to complete the pilot questionnaire once. Statistical analyses will be completed on the responses to determine whether the questionnaire is a statistically sound.</interventions>

      <outcome>The development of a quality of life instrument specific to autoimmune bullous disease. Once this instrument has been developed and if it is found to be statistically sound, it will be used by other researchers when evaluating quality of life in patients with blistering diseases.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient recruitment will cease once approximately 70 patients have been recruited and have completed the pilot questionnaire. This will mark the end of the patient recruitment process and occur at the end of the trial period. Once this target has been reached, statistical review of the results will be completed</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to develop a quality of life instrument specific to autoimmune bullous disease. Patients with clinically and histologically diagnose autoimmune bullous disease will be recruited and interviewed regarding the ways their disease affects their quality of life. Based on these responses, a pilot questionnaire will be developed and given to 70 patients. Statistical analysis will then be performed based on the results of these questionnaires to determine whether the instrument is statistically sound or not. If it is validated, the instrument can then be used as a tool to measure quality of life in patients with autoimmune blistering skin diseases.</summary>
