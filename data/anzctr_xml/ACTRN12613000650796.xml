  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover over study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of asenapine sublingual (1 x 10 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of asenapine sublingual (1 x 10 mg) on two occasions with each dose seperated by a one week washout period.  The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of asenapine.

Each dose (1 x 10 mg) will be placed under the subjects tongue. Subjects will be instructed not to chew or swallow the tablet but to allow it to dissolve completely.  Investigators will complete a mouth check at frequent intervals to ensure that the medication has been taken as directed and is fully dissolved.

An allergy scratch test will be carried out the night prior to dosing. Subjects are required to consume 200ml of water one hour prior to dosing. At least 10 minutes prior to dosing subjects will be asked to void their bladder and the site of the scratch test will be checked to ensure that no drug sensitivity problems have been developed. Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance can be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the healthy of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing. An allergy scratch test to determine sensitivity will be carried out during medical screening and prior to receving each asenapine dose.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of asenapine (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the two formulations. If the within-subject variability is 30% or more then the referenced-scaled average bioequivalence approach will be used. All plasma samples will be assayed for asenapine using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) and the elimination half life (t1/2). Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. T1/2 = 0.693/Kel where kel is the terminal elimination rate constant. </outcome>
