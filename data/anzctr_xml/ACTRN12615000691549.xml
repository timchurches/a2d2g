  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects over 18 years of age, requiring elective or acute  Colorectal surgery with a defunctioning loop ileostomy
English speaking, if not then must have an interpreter
Subjects must be willing to participate in the study and to provide written informed consent
Entering  the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programme as per standard hospital policy
Patients with malignant and non-malignant disease will be included

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects with any intraoperative findings identified by the surgeon that may preclude conduct of the study procedure
Involved in another colorectal study
Subjects unable to maintain the ERAS programme post operatively
If Foley catheter falls out the investigators will only re-insert Foley 3 times with the patients permission. After that the patient will be excluded from study. This will be done by  the surgical registrar,consultant or research nurse.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each patient randomly allocated onto treatment arm. There are 6 Colorectal surgeons and 1 Colorectal fellow at North Shore Hospital. The random generated number will be created for each surgeon  i.e. each surgeon will be provided a random list  to account for inter surgeon variability and also differing number of ileostomies each surgeon performs. 
On the day of surgery patients who have given written informed consent are randomly allocated into either the treatment or standard of care group by the research nurse by opening the randomization envelope.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A post operative ileus is a common complication after bowel surgery. This study will examine the usefulness of placing a foley catheter into the stoma during surgery to help prevent this. The idea is that the catheter will prevent swelling and obstruction in the stoma keeping the stoma open. </summary>
