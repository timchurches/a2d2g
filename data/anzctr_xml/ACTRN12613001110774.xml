  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1:  Neurostimulation device (EMS 2000) - Lacrimal gland neurostimulation.  The current provided is approximately 1 milliamp with the patient controlling the amplitude with a knob.  The recommended duration of treatment is approximately 30 seconds and the recommended treatment frequency is four times per day or as needed.  The duration of the intervention period is 3 months.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by questioning of participants by study staff with responses recorded on case report forms.

    <statisticalmethods>Because this is a Phase 2 clinical study, no formal hypothesis testing will be performed.  Baseline and demographic characteristics will be presented.  Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics (sample size; mean; standard deviation; median; minimum and maximum).  Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  Adverse events will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of participants having any adverse event.  Any other information collected (such as severity or relationship to study device) will be listed as appropriate.  Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only to highlight any interesting comparisons that may warrant further consideration.</statisticalmethods>
