    <interventions>The aim of this research is to involve consumers, with a lived experience of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), in how sub-acute Services can best support and educate children about brain injury. Qualitative interviews with children and family members will be the first phase of research which will aim at eliciting information about their lived experience of brain injury, any perceived lack of support/information and how services could have best supported their children.  Experienced qualified social workers will undertake the interviews.  Interviews are likely to take 30 minutes to one hour. </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Two groups of individuals will be interviewed, 1. the children who have experienced the journey with an adult who has had an ABI, and 2. the parents of children who have experienced this journey.
1.   20 children, between the ages of 5 and 17 years old, who have a close relationship with a person with an acquired brain injury will be interviewed

2. 10 parents of children who are close to a person with an ABI will be interviewed.
The age range of these participants will be older than 18 years.

    <statisticalmethods>Qualitative thematic analysis will be undertaken with the assistance of NVivo 11 qualitative data analysis software package. Firstly, the summaries of each interview and focus group will undergo a preliminary analysis to identify the meaning in each unit of data for that person or group (open coding).  As patterns emerge across the interviews and groups, data will be pooled according to similar meanings, perceptions and feelings and the initial nodes developed.  In this way, subthemes will begin to emerge (axial coding).   Next the subthemes will be combined to arrive at the major themes (selective coding). At each phase of analysis the three researchers (MK, KD and AB) will discuss the categories and group them into subthemes and then major themes until consensus is reached.   </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study objectives: 1.To investigate children and families perspective on their experience when a family member has a brain injury 2.To understand if children perceive their needs were met as a significant other in the journey of a person with a brain injury. 3. To gain information on children and families perceptions of the optimum support system that should be offered including what, how, when and where.
The aim of this research is to involve consumers, with a lived experience of Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), in how sub-acute Services can best support and educate children about brain injury. Qualitative interviews with children and family members will be the first phase of research which will aim at eliciting information about their lived experience of brain injury, any perceived lack of support/information and how services could have best supported their children. The second phase of the research (not included in this stage of the trial another application/grant will be sought) is expected to thereafter develop an age-appropriate childrens brain injury education program or tool which will encapsulate the topics reported through the qualitative interview. 
The purpose of this research is to address the gaps in resources and tools that professionals can use when supporting and educating children after a parent or significant person in their lives has a brain injury. Children can be a forgotten component in someones rehabilitation as practitioners are often unsure of how to age-appropriately educate them as there are minimal resources available. This research will compile the information direct from consumers as to how brain injury in the family has affected them, how their lives have changed, how they feel, how they coped, how their relationships have been affected and what would have helped them understand brain injury better through their loved ones recovery/rehabilitation. 
With this information, not only will consumers have felt heard, they would have contributed essential information that will form the basis of the second phase of research which will be developing an education program or tool that can be used in any sub-acute brain injury rehabilitation setting across the world.
To ensure rigour of this research, 
1. Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed.
2. It will be important to ensure truth value, credibility and dependability by taking care that all descriptions reported are accurate. Each participant will be provided with a summary of their interview summary to check before coding begins (Krefting 1991). 
3. Any discrepancies following member checking by participants will be altered ready for analysis. 
4. Field notes consisting of observations during the audiotaped interviews need to be developed (Patton 1990). 
The three researchers will meet regularly to undertake coding (open, followed by axial, followed by selective) until all agree that all possible hypotheses have been considered and consensus has been reached. </summary>
