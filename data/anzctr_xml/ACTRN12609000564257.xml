  <interventions>
    <interventions>A researcher performs one to one, personalised activities (Montessori activities) with the resident for 30 min. for 2 weeks on two occasions during each week. Montessori activities derive from the principles espoused by Maria Montessori and subsequent educational theorists to promote engagement in learning, namely task breakdown, guided repetition, progression in difficulty from simple to complex, and the careful matching of demands to levels of competence and interests of the person involved.
Concerning the cross-over design: we will start the other condition in the week after we finish the first.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our pilot project explores the effect of personalised goal-directed activities (Montessori activities) on reducing physical agitation in persons with dementia residing in nursing homes. Many nursing homes organize activities to engage persons with dementia, but due to limited means most activities are group-based and thus can not take an individuals personal interests or needs into account. Montessori activities are attuned to both a persons needs and capabilities and will be administered in a one-to-one interaction. So far, little scientific research has been conducted to look at the effect of such individualized interventions. We hypothesize that individual Montessori activities will reduce the frequency of behavioural symptoms of dementia more than a plausible attention control condition. Our study will test this hypothesis using a randomised, repeated-measures design with cross-over between conditions. If our results show that use of Montessori activities is effective in treating challenging behaviours in individuals with dementia, it will potentially provide a safer and more enjoyable intervention rather than reliance on pharmacology alone.</summary>
