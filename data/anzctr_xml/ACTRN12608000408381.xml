  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and determine the types of complications and benefits from the transthoracic pneumonostomy procedure in patients with severe emphysema (homogeneous).  The results from this study will provide the profile for safety and feasibility of use of the pneumonostomy device system and support subsequnt trials with larger number of patients.</summary>
