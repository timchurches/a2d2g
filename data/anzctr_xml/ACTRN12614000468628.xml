  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of cryoablation in the nasal passageway using a new cryosurgical device called the ClariFix Device. The ClariFix Device circulates liquid nitrous oxide through a closed-tip cryoprobe, where it is allowed to expand through a fine annular space. The transformation of the liquid into gas extracts heat from the surrounding areas by the Joule-Thompson effect. Either one or two treatments are delivered in each nasal cavity under endoscopic visualization, for a total of two to four treatments per patient. The treatment is delivered under local anesthesia. The total procedure time is approximately 30 minutes. The study procedure is performed only once per patient; there are no repeat procedures.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prior studies have shown that cryoablation in the nose improves nasal symptoms in patients with chronic rhinitis. This study is a prospective, non-randomized clinical study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the ClariFix Cryoablation Device when used to ablate unwanted tissue in the nose of patients with chronic rhinitis. </summary>
