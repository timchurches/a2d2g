  <interventions>
    <interventions>Examine intervention will be our original nordic walking training program. Examine program will be realised for 8 weeks with frequency of twice per week. Each session will last 1 hour and it will took place outside in a city park. The training will consist of walking and a large amount of exercises with poles as a useful gym equipment. The sequence parts of the training: 1.warming up (10 minutes), 2. nordic walking (10 minutes), 3. central part (20 minutes), 4. nordic walking (10 minutes), 5. cooling down (10 minutes). Exercises with poles will be conducted during the warming up, in the central part of session and finally cooling down. During warming up and cooling down it will be only individual exercises with poles, but central part of session will be consist of a large amount of exercises with poles. It will be individual exercises, exercises in pairs and exercises on the obstacle course. It will be strengthening, stretching, breathing and balance exercises. In addition it will be exercises improve reaction time. We designed these all exercises especially for elderly to improve their physical fitness and daily functioning. The intensity of these sessions will be between 14-16/20 RPE scale. Trainings will be conducted in groups up to 10 people. Training will be conducted by a qualified Instructor Nordic Walking, who is also Master of Physiotherapy. In addition during trainings will always be at least 2 extra person (from the reaserch group) to assist in the safe conduct of trainings and monitoring of participants  We will register of attendance at session. Regarding to recruting to 3 groups, we first will recruite people to experimental group, then to comparator group and finally to control group. Each subject will be examined two times: at baseline - prior to training program and immediately after 8 weeks program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control intervention will be standard nordic walking training program.  It will be realised for 8 weeks with frequency of twice per week. Each session will last 1 hour and it will took place outside in a city park. The training will consist only of nordic walking and short warming up and cooling down phases. The sequence parts of the training: 1 warming up (5 minutes), 2. nordic walking (50 minutes), 3. cooling down (5 minutes). Trainings will be conducted in groups up to 10 people. The intensity of these sessions will be between 14-16/20 RPE scale. Trainings will be conducted by a qualified Instructor Nordic Walking who is also Master of Physiotherapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the new challenges in modern medicine and rehabilitation is providing care for the elderly. Many of them have multiple diseases which lead to reduction of physical fitness. Particurarly important in daily activity are walking efforts to support and develop all component of physical fitness. Nordic walking is kind of walking with the use of specially designed poles. In addiction we think that pole are very useful gym equipment for elderly exercises. It can be individual exercises, exercises in pairs and exercises on the obstacle course. These kind of exercises with use poles can improves strength and flexibility of the upper and lower body, coordination complex, balance, gait, performance of activitiesof daily living, independence and quality of life. We believe that elderly can achieve greater effect on functional fitness from exercises with use poles as a useful gym equipment than only from walking with poles. Besides, these exercises are very safe for elderly. The aim of this study is evaluate the impact of various form of nordic walking training program on functional fitness and quality of life in the women over 60 years old. Especially we want to check if training with a large amount of exercises with use poles as a gym eqipment is better than a standar training based only on the walking with poles.</summary>
