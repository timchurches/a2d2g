  <interventions>
    <interventions>Before starting the training program, subjects completed two familiarization sessions that consisted of a review of safety guidelines, adjusting a harness to each participants leg length, and practice with the squat training device (kBox 3, Exxentric AB TM, Bromma, Sweden) equipped with one flywheel with a moment inertia of 0.025 kg m-2 (after week 4 a flywheel with a moment inertia of 0.05 kg m-2 was used). Similar to procedures reported elsewhere, participants then underwent six weeks of flywheel resistance training two (week 1, 3, 5) or three (week 2, 4, 6) times a week with at least 48 h of rest between sessions. Participants performed four sets of nine repetitions: two repetitions at the beginning of each set to initiate the flywheel movement and then seven maximal bilateral repetitions accelerating the wheel in the concentric action and, upon completion (when the flywheel strap winds back due to inertial forces), decelerating the wheel by means of an eccentric action. The rest interval between sets was 3 min. Mean Propulsive Velocity (MPV) and average power output were measured during each concentric action (SmartCoachTM Power Encoder, SmartCoach Europe AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and real-time feedback was provided on a computer monitor with the associated software. Research personnel gave verbal encouragement during all repetitions performed. Attendance at training sessions will also be registered.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic variables and dependent measures. All data were first log-transformed to reduce bias and then, the standardised difference or effect size (ES, 90% confidence limit) of the selected variables was calculated using the pooled pretraining SD. The threshold values used for ES were &gt;0.2 (small), &gt;0.6 (moderate) and &gt;1.2 (large). For within/between-groups comparisons, the chances that the differences in performance were better/greater, similar, or worse/smaller as well as the quantitative chances (beneficial/better or detrimental/poorer effect) were calculated as follows: &lt;1%, almost certainly not; 1% to 5%, very unlikely; 5% to 25%, unlikely; 25% to 75%, possibly; 75% to 95%, likely; 95% to 99%, very likely and &gt;99%, almost certainly. If the chances of having beneficial/better and detrimental/poorer performances were both &gt;5% then the true difference was considered to be unclear. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The efficacy of strength training using inertial devices on balance in older adults is largely unknown. This study aimed to assess the effects of flywheel resistance exercise training (FRET) on postural stability and mobility in older adults and to investigate whether changes in leg power are related to improvements in balance. Study Design: RCT. Methods: Thirty-six individuals will be randomly allocated to either a FRET group (ETG) who will underwent 6-weeks of training (4x9 reps on a squat device, 2-3 times/week) or usual-care control group (CON; n = 18). Measures: During each repetition, the average power and Mean Propulsive Velocity (MPV) will be computed. The Timed up-and-go test (TUG) and postural balance (anteriorposterior (AP) and mediallateral (ML) center of pressure (COP) excursions) in different tasks and  muscle strength will be assessed. </summary>
