  <interventions>
    <interventions>The duration of the intervention is 3 months. The intervention involves fathers attending eight 90 minute face to face information sessions (including 3 interactive sessions with their children). Sessions focus on i) activity and eating behaviours to support and achieve weight loss goals ii) identification of healthy and unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and explanation of the use of role modelling and positive reinforcement iii) Father and child engagement in a variety of physical activities to develop child's confidence and ability in performing various fundamental movement skills. iv) problem solving and post program goal setting v) Revision and consolidation of new knowledge and skills.
Fathers will also receive behavioural procedures over the course of the program via use of the online website www.calorieking.com.au to support the key strategies of self monitoring and social support relating to weight loss. Instruction and orientation to the website will be provided. The website allows submission of self-monitored energy expenditure and intake, weight and online group support.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control group for 6 months. The wait-list control group will be offered the intervention immediately following the 6-month follow-up assessment.</comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects completed a phone eligibility screen with a research assistant and also a pre-exercise screening questionnaire. Participants over 40 years were required to receive doctor's clearance prior to commencement of the study.

To ensure concealment, the random allocation sequence was generated by a statistician and given to the project manager. Randomization was completed by a research assistant who was not involved in the assessment of participants and the allocation sequence was concealed when enrolling participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random allocation sequence was generated by a computer-based random number-producing algorithm in block lengths of six to ensure an equal chance of allocation to each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well established that parents of primary school aged children substantially influence the food and physical activity home environment through behaviours, attitudes, feeding styles and role modelling. However, the contribution of fathers influence on childrens physical activity and eating behaviour is often overlooked.The Healthy Dads, Healthy Kids (HDHK) program was designed to engage overweight fathers to role model and promote positive behaviours relating to physical activity and healthy eating. Major aims of HDHK were (i) to help overweight/obese fathers achieve a healthy weight, and (ii) to improve the activity and eating behaviours of their children (using fathers as the key agents of behaviour change).</summary>
