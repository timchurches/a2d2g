  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The replacement of dietary carbohydrate with protein, combined with a low intake of fat, has been shown to induce larger weight loss in overweight participants when compared with conventional high carbohydrate/low fat diets and is an increasingly popular method for weight loss among the general public, suggesting this is a favourable weight loss regime for overweight people.  There are concerns over the safety of the use of high protein-red meat diets, as red meat, although controversial, is proposed to increase the risk of colon cancer.  Although a high protein-red meat diet may be associated with increasing the risk of colon cancer due to the higher content of meat, such a diet is also associated with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity, which reduce colon cancer risk.  From this it can be suggested that a higher protein dietary pattern used for weight loss that remains low in fat and high in fibre rich foods, in association with moderate exercise may not increase the risk of colon cancer.  The impact of long term use of high protein-red meat diets on colon cancer risk has not been assessed.  This study will assess the safety of high protein-red meat diets as a method for weight loss in overweight participants. It will also investigate a series of secondary outcomes that impact on total health status.</summary>
