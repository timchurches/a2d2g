  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the study will receive an early CT instead of the usual 10 days in plaster. Patients will be treated based on the results of the CT scan.
If the CT shows a fracture, the patient would be treated for 6 weeks in plaster for a scaphoid fracture and 4 weeks in plaster for other carpal fractures. All patients with proven fractures will be reviewed by the orthopaedic registrar in the Fracture Clinic.
Patients with no evidence of fracture on CT would be treated as a soft tissue injury and discharged home. These patients would be followed up via a phone call 10-14 days post injury. Those with ongoing pain or disability would be asked to present for review by the Emergency Consultant with in the next 48 hours for clinical examination and repeat CT or MRI if indicated.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture, initial x-rays are unreliable. Current local practice is immobilization in plaster for 10 days with repeat x-rays, in order to not miss fractures.  In retrospect, up to 90% of patients do not need the plaster.
Advanced imaging (early MRI and Day 4 Bone scans) are proven as an alternate best practice, but are expensive and difficult to access, and thus not often used.
A research project at BHS has demonstrated that early CT scans are a reliable, accessible, cost effective alternative.
Our aim is to confirm the use of early CT and to implement early CT scans into a best practice clinical pathway for suspected scaphoid fractures.</summary>
