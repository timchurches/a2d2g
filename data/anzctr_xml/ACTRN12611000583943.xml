  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomised cross-over design, participants will consume a test meal containing 65mmol of sodium or a low salt control meal containing 5mmol sodium on 2 separate study days with a 7 day washout period in between treatments.

The test meal will comprise of 100ml of Reduced Salt tomato soup made up with 150mL water with 3.8g of added salt (65mmol NaCl sodium chloride). Participants are asked to consume the test meal over a 5 minute period.</interventions>
    <comparator>A control meal containing 5mmol sodium. This will comprise 100mL of Reduced Salt tomato soup made up with 150mL water with no added salt. Participants are asked to consume the test meal over a 5 minute period. Participants will act as their own controls as it is a cross-over</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to see whether a salty meal (equivalent to about 3/4 teaspoon of table salt, the same amount found in a ham sandwich or a meal of bacon and eggs) causes levels of sodium (salt) in the blood to rise. We want to know this because high salt meals may have adverse effects on blood vessel function.</summary>
