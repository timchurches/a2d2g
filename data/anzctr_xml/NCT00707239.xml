  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the safety and efficacy of a tigecycline regimen versus an
      imipenem/cilastatin regimen for the treatment of subjects who are hospitalized with
      hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). At least 70% of enrolled subjects will have
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Two dose levels of tigecycline will be assessed and
      compared to imipenem/cilastatin in parallel. Subjects will receive intravenous therapy from a
      minimum of 7 &amp; up to 14 consecutive days, the exact duration will be at the decision of the
      investigator based on the subject's condition. Additional protocol specified antibiotics may
      be given to ensure appropriate coverage. A final assessment at test-of-cure (TOC) visit will
      be done 10 to 21 days after the last day of therapy. The total duration of subject
      participation will be between 17 and 44 days, including a follow up period of 30 days after
      the last day of therapy for SAEs.

      Subjects will be followed for safety and efficacy. The safety assessment will include:
      physical examinations, vital signs, assessment of the clinical signs and symptoms of
      pneumonia, collection of adverse events, 12-lead ECG, collection of samples for hematology,
      serum chemistries, and coagulation parameters, &amp; a serum or urine pregnancy test before study
      entry for women of childbearing potential. The clinical and microbiological efficacy will
      both be evaluated.</summary>
