  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be given 2 tablets of 200mg ibuprofen in office prior to treatment. 2 drops of 0.4% preservative-free oxybuprocaine will be placed in the lower lid of both eyes prior to treatment. This is followed by 5 drops of 5% povidone-iodine in both eyes. 0.9% sterile sodium chloride wil be used to completely irrigate both eyes for 60 seconds after povidone-iodine application. 

Preservative-free Blink Intensive tears (active ingredient: polyethylene glycol 0.25%) will be given and the participant will be instructed to place 1 drop in both eyes every 2 hours until the first review the next day, and as required thereafter. Participants will be asked on the frequency of using the drops at follow-up examinations.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients presenting to the University of New South Wales Red Eye clinic diagnosed with adenoviral conjunctivitis will be offered to participate in the study. 

Once the patientâ€™s diagnosis of adenoviral conjunctivitis is confirmed, a Participant Information Statement and Consent form will be given for the patient to read through by the student clinician. If consent is given to participate in the study, further eligibility for the study will be determined by questionnaires that will indicate any contraindications the patient may have in participating in the study. There must also be a positive result using the RPS Adeno Detector for the patient to be eligible for the study. 

Once deemed eligible for the study, a computer pre-generated randomization table will determine which treatment kit will be used for the patient. Each treatment kit has a unique numerical identifier and has been randomised to contain treatment solution (povidone-iodine) or placebo (fluorescein-saline mix).  </concealment>
    <sequence>Pre-determined table to determine which kit number the patient will be treated with. The kit numbers will be randomised to either '0' or '1' (where '0' indicates treatment group and '1' indicates placebo group) using a computer generated randomization table. This will be carried out by the investigators prior to commencing the study, and will be masked to the clinicians carrying out the treatment and assessing the outcomes. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size for the study has been calculated with a power of 0.8 and a difference of 7 days in the time of resolution of infection between the treatment and placebo groups. A standard deviation of 4 days is chosen. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be used. 

A t-test will be carried out to compare the mean time of recovery between groups, and Fischers test will be used to compare resolution of signs and symptoms between placebo and treatment. The Bonferroni correction for multiple corrections will also be employed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this pilot study aims to determine the effectiveness of treating this particular viral eye infection (adenoviral conjunctivitis) with a one-time in-office irrigation of the eye with 5% povidone-iodine.

We aim to determine whether this treatment reduced the period of infection as well as improving patients symptoms'.
