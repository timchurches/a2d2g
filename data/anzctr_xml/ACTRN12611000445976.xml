  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is highly prevalent and affects the lives of millions of people worldwide. Although antimuscarinics are the pharmacological treatment of choice for OAB, the effectiveness is limited. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective, well-tolerated therapeutic alternatives. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is an established treatment for OAB in children and may also be a valuable option in adults. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of TENS for treating adult patients with refractory OAB.</summary>
