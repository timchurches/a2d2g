Approximately 30mL of antiseptic solution will be applied over skin surface at the site of the planned excision using a soaked gauze so as to cover an area 1cm greater at all borders than the area of skin exposed by the sterile drape which will be placed over the site of the incision.

Practice nurses at each participating practice are the principal data collectors for this trial, and will also be responsible for assuring that for each excision, the correct surgical protocol is adhered to, and if it is not, that this is documented in the data collection sheets they are responsible for filling out about each patient.</interventions>

Our sample size calculation has been based upon data from previous trials investigating SSI in the Mackay region. Based upon pooled analyses of these trials, the weighted mean SSI rate following minor skin excisions in general practice in the Mackay region is 9.35%, which we have rounded up to 10% for the purposes of the sample size calculation. As the skin antiseptic preparation in these trials was predominantly aqueous chlorhexidine, this number has been used to represent the baseline SSI rate.
 
It has been decided through group discussion between GPs in the area in the past that an absolute decrease in SSI rate of 5% would be considered clinically significant; i.e. that if alcoholic chlorhexidine was to reduce SSI rate by 5% with respect to aqueous chlorhexidine, this would be considered clinically significant. Using these numbers, based upon calculations carried out by the statistician for this trial, it has been discovered that to assert that  there is a clinically significant difference between the aqueous and alcoholic chlorhexidine preparations used in this trial insofar as their efficacy in reducing SSI with statistical confidence, a power in excess of 80% and a significance level of 0.05, a total of 435 patients would be required in the intervention group and 435 patients in the control group; thus 870 in total.
 
However, as is standard practice, we will aim to enrol slightly more patents than this to account for drop out. As the drop-out rate in the other aforementioned similar trials investigating SSI in general practice in Mackay has never exceeded 5%, we estimate that an extra 50 patients will be sufficient. Therefore, we will aim to enrol 920 patients for this study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preoperative cleansing of the skin with antiseptic preparations at the site of surgical excisions (preoperative skin antisepsis) is common practice before every surgery worldwide, and aims to reduce surgical site infection. However, in most contexts, no definitive scientific consensus exists regarding which preoperative skin antiseptic preparations are most effective. This randomised controlled trial aims to close an existing gap in the evidence base surrounding optimal preoperative skin antisepsis before clean surgery - a practice most general practitioners carry out several times per week when they perform skin excisions. It is currently suspected on the basis of incomplete and methodologically inconsistent evidence that alcoholic antiseptic preparations are likely to be more effective than aqueous preparations for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) after clean surgery. This study aims to find definitive proof for this theory by determining whether there is a difference in the incidence of SSI after minor skin excisions in general practice when alcoholic chlorhexidine is used for preoperative skin antisepsis by comparison to when aqueous chlorhexidine is used. It is hypothesised that use of alcoholic chlorhexidine will reduce SSI by comparison to aqueous chlorhexidine. 

To implement this study, multiple general practices in the Mackay region which perform large numbers of skin excisions each year will be recruited. Consecutive patients over the age of 18 presenting to participating practices will be asked to participate in the trial and those that agree to partake will be randomised by a computer-generated random number table to receive preoperative skin antisepsis with either 0.5% chlorhexidine dissolved in 70% alcohol or 0.5% chlorhexidine dissolved in water. All other techniques and materials used for both preoperative skin antisepsis and the skin excision itself, as well as all aspects of post-operative care, will be kept constant between the two groups, and will align with a pre-specified surgical and wound protocol. Following their excision, patients will be assessed for the presence or absence of SSI by their treating doctor or nurse when they present for removal of sutures, or at any other time if they re-present due to suspicion of SSI or for any other reason. Rates of SSI will then be recorded, calculated and compared between the two groups using the statistical analysis software SPSS to determine if there is a significant difference in effectiveness between aqueous and alcoholic chlorhexidine. 

Hopefully the results of this study will help to provide direction to doctors regularly carrying out clean surgery, who at present have little definitive evidence to guide their choice of preoperative skin antiseptic preparations. Looking further, if a difference is found between aqueous and alcoholic chlorhexidine, we would aim for this research to impact current guidelines on preoperative skin antisepsis and evoke behaviour change from doctors and nurses which leads to a reduction in SSI rates in general practice.</summary>
