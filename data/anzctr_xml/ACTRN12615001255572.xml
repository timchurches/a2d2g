  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>The study will be conducted in healthy male and female subjects. CMX-020 is indicated for the treatment of chronic pain.</healthcondition>
    <conditioncode>
      <conditioncode1>Other</conditioncode1>
      <conditioncode2>Conditions of unknown or disputed aetiology (such as chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis)</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each subject who meets eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive CMX-020 or placebo.
The study will consist of Screening (Day -28 to Day -1), Baseline/Check-in Period (Day 1), Treatment Period (Day 1) and Post Treatment/Study Exit (Day 4).

Following randomization, on Treatment Day 1 subjects will be administered a single 15-minute infusion of CMX-020 or placebo according to the computer-generated randomization schedule. All doses will be administered after subjects have fasted for at least six hours. Access to all fluids, including water, will be denied beginning 1 hour prior to dosing.
The dose levels of CMX-020 (mg/kg) for the six cohorts are 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.24 and 0.32.

All medications will be administered by the Investigator or appropriately trained healthcare professional in the clinical study unit.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator/ control for this trial is diluent/placebo which will constitute the inactive ingredients - 20 mL of 20% hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin in 35% phosphate buffered saline-65% water solution.
The placebo will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes on Day 1 only.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single doses of CMX-020 administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion to healthy male and female subjects; 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be assessed for AEs and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, tympanic temperature and oxygen saturation) during the day of dosing and on Day 4 (out-patient visit).
Laboratory assessments (blood and urine) will be assessed on the day of dosing (pre-dose) and on Day 4 (72 hours post-dose) 
ECG will be assessed on Day 4 
Physical examination will be performed on Day 1 and Day 4

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of CMX-020 administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion to healthy male and female subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety assessments will be carried out for MTD analysis which include assessments for AEs and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, tympanic temperature and oxygen saturation) during the day of dosing and on Day 4 (out-patient visit).
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the single-dose pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of CMX-020 administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion to healthy male and female subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood assessments will be carried out for PK analysis.  Measurements will be taken 16 times throughout the course of the study per subject which include -30 minutes pre-infusion start, and 2, 5, 10, 15, 17, 20, 25, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 hours after the start of the infusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
