  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Brown Fat, unlike ordinary 'white fat', functions like generators, burning fat to produce heat and dissipate energy. Brown fat protects animals against cold and from developing obesity. In humans, it was previously believed
that brown fat disappears after infancy. However, research including our own has shown that brown fat is present in most if not all adult humans and is located mainly around the neck. Brown fat activity in humans is detected by a PET scan based on uptake of glucose that is tagged with a
small amount of radioactivity. This is a widely used diagnostic method in medicine.
Brown fat is more abundant in lean than in obese individuals. Stimulating its activity may be a simple way of controlling body weight in humans. Apart from the cold exposure, very little is known about what regulates
brown fat in humans. Our research aims to identify factors that regulate brown fat in humans.
Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone produced from the adrenal glands. In animals, it was found that aldosterone suppresses the activity of brown fat and blocking aldosterone action by a medication called spironolactone increases brown fat activity.
In this study, we will study in humans whether spironolactone reactivates brown fat activity in subjects with primary aldosteronism and whether the changes in brown fat activity is associated with changes in energy expenditures.</summary>
