  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of patients with treatment-emergent averse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) - An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to 28 days after last dose of study treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response - Number of patients with objective response (complete response or partial response)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and per routine clinical practice to time of last dose of study treatment, up to 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from Baseline in Dimension Health State EuroQol (EQ-5D) Score - EQ-5D is a standard, participant-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care,, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a single index value characterizing current health status using a 100-point visual analog scale (0=worst, 100=best). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weighs each level of the dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).
