    <interventions>Brief name: Treatment of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) with intense pulsed light (IPL)
Description: Eligible participants with various severities of symptomatic MGD will be recruited for the interventional study, and provided with a Participant Information Sheet. Volunteers have the opportunity to discuss any concerns with the researchers prior to signing a written consent form. Eligible participants will be required to attend at least five visits over 105 days. All products involved in the study are commercially available, and all tests performed are standard clinical procedures and will be carried out by New Zealand registered therapeutic optometrists. Research procedures will be performed at the Ocular Surface Laboratory, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Auckland, New Zealand.
In this prospective, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial, four adjacent, but overlapping IPL pulses (E-Eye IPL device, E-Swin, France) will be administered to the skin area immediately below the lower eyelid at an intensity level related to the individuals Fitzpatrick Skin Type (ranging from 9 - 13 J/cm2). IPL therapy will be administered on Day 1, Day 15, Day 45 and Day 75 as per manufacturers recommendations. The treatment duration is approximately 20 seconds per eye and this is followed by 40 minutes of standard clinical ophthalmic testing. A fifth follow-up visit is arranged on Day 105 to measure clinical outcomes only (no IPL treatment at this visit). Visits on Day 15, 45 and 75 will each take up to 45 minutes; the remaining two visits will each take approximately 80-90 minutes. The IPL therapy will be applied to both eyes of each participant, however, half the participants will be randomly assigned to receive a mock treatment. Neither the researcher collecting clinical data, nor the participant will be privy to the treatment group assignment.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo treatment (neither the participant, nor the researcher collecting clinical data will have knowledge of participants assigned treatment group until study completion). For the placebo treatment, the E-Eye IPL device will be administered to the skin area immediately below the lower eyelid but no pulses will be directly applied to the area.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Up to 100 participants will be recruited to achieve a completed sample of at least 72 (allowing for drop out). The sample size is based on results collected from previous pilot study (Craig et al, 2015).  Power calculations show that a minimum of 36 subjects is required, to detect a clinically significant difference of 1 lipid layer grade, in pairwise comparisons, with 80% power (beta = 0.2), and at a two-sided statistical significance level of 5% (a = 0.05). The SD of normal values was estimated at 1 lipid layer grade. Sample size estimates were determined using a uniform non-parametric adjustment, with PASS 2002 (NCSS Statistical Software LLC, Utah, USA).. Post IPL scores at Day 1, 15, 45, and 75 will be compared to pre-IPL scores at baseline. Repeated measures analysis will be utilised to compare data across the various time points and paired analyses to compare pre- and post-IPL data at individual time points. Variables will be tested for normality using the Kolmogarav-Smirnoff test. Ordinal variables and those with non-normal distributions will be analysed with Friedman two-way analysis of variance, with pairwise Wilcoxon (paired) or Mann-Whitney (non-paired) post-hoc testing as required. Normally distributed continuous data will be assessed with a repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Tukeys HSD post-hoc testing. Differences between treated and non-treated participant data will be compared with the paired samples t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively. Correlations between parametric and nonparametric data will be assessed with Pearsons product-moment correlation or Spearmans rank order correction, respectively. Outcomes will be considered significant if p&lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dry eye is a widespread disease that can affect individuals of any age. People who suffer from this condition frequently complain of irritated, burning and gritty eyes. A common reason for this is a reduction of the tear film lipid layer due to the eyelid glands malfunctioning (meibomian gland dysfunction). Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy conventionally used to treat facial pigmentation has been found serendipitously to provide dry eye relief in meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). A prospective trial of IPL for the treatment of MGD by the lead investigators team confirmed significant improvements. On account of our previous research in this area, we are conducting an evaluation on the effectiveness of IPL for the relief of evaporative dry eye. The study aims to provide more information about the management of MGD, so that optometrists and ophthalmologists can improve clinical decisions in practice. We are recruiting up to 100 participants with symptoms of dry eye; the study will be carried out by New Zealand registered optometrists in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Auckland. Participants will attend at least five visits, over a period of 105 days (15 weeks). Three of the visits will each take up to 45 minutes, and the remaining two will each take approximately 80-90 minutes. The E-Eye IPL device used in this study will be applied to the skin area below the eyes; it is a commercially available and medically certified product, applied according to manufacturer's instructions. The procedures performed are all standard clinical tests.</summary>
