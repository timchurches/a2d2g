  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of hospitalisation and premature death in many countries globally.  One of the most hotly debated issues in clinical research is whether a polypill (a new combination medication containing aspirin and agents to lower blood pressure and cholesterol) can really reduce cardiovascular disease by three-quarters or more. This clinical trial will assess the safety and tolerability of a polypill, and its effects on blood pressure and cholesterol in people at increased risk of CVD.</summary>
