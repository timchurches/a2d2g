    <interventions>This prospective observational pilot study was designed to investigate if the intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery can be reduced to lower values with a continuous deep neuromuscular block with Rocuronium compared to no ongoing neuromuscular block under a standardized anaesthetic technique. This will enable us to estimate (i) the difference (delta) between IAP before and after NMB and (ii) the variance or standard deviation of this difference. Both outcomes are important in designing a future RCT. Please note that both before and after deep neuromuscular block measurements are done in same patient.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Laparoscopic surgery continues to cause specific pathophysiological changes particularly due to intraabdominal pressure (IAP) and positioning. Cardiovascular changes include hyperand
hypotension, prolonged QT dispersion, arrhythmias and rarely cardiac arrest. Splanchnic perfusion changes with changes in organ function are mainly due to the increased intraabdominal pressures and the resultant reduction in abdominal perfusion pressure. Pulmonary changes like hypercarbia, hypoxemia and barotraumas are usually avoided through adaptations in ventilation settings.
Although other causes like CO2 absorption, ventilation strategy, surgical technique, the nature and duration of the
procedure, and intrinsic patient factors (intravascular volume, preexisting cardiopulmonary status and neurohormonal status) have been identified, the intraabdominal pressure caused by the CO2 pneumoperitoneum combined with the patients position remain the main drivers behind these pathophysiological change. Commonly IAP is around 12 mm Hg for most laparoscopic procedures. Pressures above 15 mm Hg lead to
increased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and a reduction in cardiac index. Lowering insufflation
pressures even more leads to a further reduction in postoperative pain and a better quality of life 5 days after
surgery. The primary reason for insufflation is to create good view of the surgical field and enough room to manoeuvre with the surgical instrumentation. Determining factors will be the proceduretype dependent extent of the relevant surgical field, the patient habitus, and the abdominal wall elasticity. One would assume that a neuromuscular block (NMB) would facilitate the extension of the abdominal wall and produce more space at lower insufflation pressures. However, only very limited evidence exists, both suggesting that ongoing NMB may or may not provide any benefit. Clinical practice varies between ongoing NMB, intermittent NMB or no NMB at all after induction. With the advent of the reliable NMB reversal agent Sugammadex, we are now in a position to offer continuous deep NMB (CDNMB) until the end of the procedure without compromising our ability to timely and fully reverse the NMB. This enabled us to design this prospective observational pilot study to investigate if the IAP can be reduced to lower values with a CDNMB with Rocuronium compared to no ongoing neuromuscular block under a standardized anaesthetic technique.
The outcome of this study will help us determine the power and study size requirements for a randomized controlled
trial looking at the lowest IAP in patients with and without continuous deep NMB.</summary>
