  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study that has involved in eight years 3700 subjects, we have evaluated  the effectiveness of the Neuro Postural Optimization (NPO) therapy with Conveyer of modulating radiance (CMR) to treat Functional Dysmetria
The Functional Dysmetria (FD) determined by a neuropsychomotor attitude deriving from the adaptation at environmental stress.
The NPO is a protocol  with CMR finalized to correct FD. Involves the application of a probe of the CMR on one specific point of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The CMR is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument.
The intervention comprises three phases:
Observation of FD carried out with subject in supine position, in sitting position, during the passage from supine to sitting position and vice versa. So as to quantify misalignment and then FD, we employed a not invasive calibre that we have specifically devised, with 1-mm-resolution.
Treatment NPO with CMR therapy. 
Observation of the effect of NPO on FD carried out with subject in supine position, in sitting position, during the passage from supine to sitting position and vice versa. Assessment, at baseline and immediately at the end of treatment,  after a two months, after one year.
Each observation takes about three minutes, the NPO treatment with CMR therapy takes about one minute.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Slight somatic differences, when not due to specific causes, prove the existence of Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA). FAs are defined as a casual loss of perfect symmetry, highlighted at level of symmetrical body segments and caused by environmental stressors.  In this study that has involved in eight years 3700 subjects, we have highlighted the presence of asymmetry both in tonic and phasic activation of symmetrical muscular groups and its stable disappearance after the Neuro Postural Optimization. This asymmetrical activation named Functional Dysmetria (FD). We might assume that FD is determined by a neuropsychomotor attitude deriving from the adaptation at environmental stress, as observed for FAs. 
The Neuro Postural Optimization is a protocol  with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance finalized to correct FD. Involves the application of a probe of the CMR on one specific point of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The CMR is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument.
The intervention comprises three phases:
Observation of FD carried out with subject in supine position, in sitting position, during the passage from supine to sitting position and vice versa. So as to quantify misalignment and then FD, we employed a not invasive calibre that we have specifically devised, with 1-mm-resolution.
Treatment NPO with CMR therapy. 
Observation of the effect of NPO on FD carried out with subject in supine position, in sitting position, during the passage from supine to sitting position and vice versa. Assessment, at baseline and immediately at the end of treatment,  after a two months, after one year.
In all subjects studied we have observed the stable disappearance of the functional Dysmetria.</summary>
