  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of repeating dTpa booster in
      adults 10 years after previous booster vaccination with dTpa in a previous clinical study.
      Only subjects who received the booster vaccination in a previous clinical study are eligible
      for participation in this study. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply
      with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

      No new recruitment will be performed in this booster phase (see inclusion criteria)</summary>
