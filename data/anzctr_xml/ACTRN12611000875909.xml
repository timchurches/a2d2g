  <interventions>
    <interventions>The amount of PLA2 enzymes prior to and after elective coronary stenting (measured from a blood sample approximately 30 minutes apart)</interventions>
    <comparator>Phospholipase A2 release will be measured in 50 patients prior to and after coronary angiography but who do not undergo any intervention</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To quantify S-PLA2 and LP-PLA2 mass and activity levels immediately prior to and following elective coronary intervention and to determine if a significant change has occurred and demonstrate a positive correlation of baseline and post PCI change in PLA2 levels with patient, biochemical, angiographic and invasive imaging characteristics to identify the best candidate assay.  PLA2 levels will be assessed using an ELISA assay on blood taken from the patient prior to and after coronary stenting (approximately 30 minutes apart).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Prior to and after coronary stenting (approx 30 mins apart - 2 samples taken only)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate that trauma caused during elective PCI and not the angiographic process is responsible for PLA2 release. This will be determined by comparing the blood levels of PLA2 after stenting in 200 patients undergoing coronary stenting, compared with PLA2 blood levels in 50 patients after coronary angiography only.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline prior to and after coronary stenting (approx 30 mins apart), or for the comparator group, prior to and after coronary angiography (approx 30 mins apart)</timepoint>
