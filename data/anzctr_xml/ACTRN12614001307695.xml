    <concealment>Patients diagnosed with persistent diabetic macualr oedema who have been previously treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy with a minimum of 4 consecutive injections within 6 months, will be invited to participate at Sydney Retina Clnic and Day Surgery, Australia. All subjects will receive 2.0mg intravitreal aflibercept </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A power calculation has been performed on 50 participants. When mean change in visual acuity in the population is estimated to be 55 letters, with a 20% standard deviation and a 5% significance, the power to detect a change of 5 letters is 88%. When the mean central macular thickness is estimated to be 400 microns, with a 20% standard deviation and a 5% significance level, the power to detect a change of 50 microns is 99%.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>This is an open label study in patients who have been previously treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF drug for DMO and have persisting DMO despite regular injections. The study will describe the effectiveness, safety of intravitreal aflibercept and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among these patients.</summary>
