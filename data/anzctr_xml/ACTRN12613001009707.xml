    <interventions>Online survey.

Each participant will do the survey once. The questionnaire will take approximately 15 minutes.

The first few questions are to check that the interview is right for the participant.

The rest of the questions will ask about:
* The participant's experience with aromatase inhibitors
* Management of side effects of aromatase inhibitors with prescription medication
* Management of side effects of aromatase inhibitors with over the counter medications
* Management of side effects of aromatase inhibitors with alternative/complementary therapies
* Chemotherapy treatment for their cancer
* Vitamin D testing</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to use an online survey to  gather information on the incidence and clinical impact of Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Musculoskeletal Syndrome (AIMSS) in Australian women.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are 18 years or older, female, have had a diagnosis of early breast cancer since 2007 and have been taking an aromatase inhibitor at any time since your diagnosis.

Trial details.
Many women with breast cancer are prescribed aromatase inhibitors as part of their breast cancer treatment. It is known that some women experience side effects from aromatase inhibitors which disrupt their quality of life. Some women may even choose to stop taking their medication before they have completed the recommended course (usually five years).

This survey will ask a number of questions about women's experiences with side effects from aromatase inhibitors. The survey focuses specifically on joint, muscle and tendon pain, stiffness and discomfort. Women who have not had joint or muscle symptoms are also welcome to take part.

The survey will assist the researchers to:
* Better understand how the side effects of aromatase inhibitors affect Australian women.
* Investigate possible ways of reducing these symptoms
* Look at ways of improving the way doctors and other health professionals measure womens symptoms and their impact on quality of life.</summary>
