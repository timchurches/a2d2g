    <interventions>Sunshine Heart Inc. is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center trial to assess the safety and provide indications for performance of the Sunshine Heart C-Pulse TM System. 

Sunshine Heart, Inc has proposed C-Pulse (TM), a novel ambulatory, non-obligatory, non-blood contacting extra-ascending aortic counterpulsation system. The C-Pulse (TM) System is designed to be implanted without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass or extensive dissection, to be able to be activated immediately, to augment heart function in a safe manner and to provide sustained relief from heart failure symptoms. It can be turned off safely, and similarly, in failure modes, is considered to have an associated low risk of death or disability, other than the recurrence of heart failure symptoms. C-Pulse (TM) is not an alternative to the heart, it is an augmentation device, and it does not preclude the use of therapies that provide full circulatory support such as heart transplantation or Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs).

The C-Pulse (TM) System consists of a counterpulsation Cuff secured around the outside of the ascending aorta, the main blood vessel out of the heart. The Cuff and a heart signal sensing wire are attached to an external driver. The external Driver inflates and deflates the Cuff in sequence with the Electrocardiography (ECG) signal to assist heart function and improve the pumping capacity of the heart. The Cuff deflects the aorta in a "thumb-printing" manner which has been optimized to minimize aortic wall strain and maximize blood volume displacement per beat. The C-Pulse (TM) System is non-blood contacting, simple to insert, and can be turned on and off as required; all natural blood pathways are maintained - there is no exposure of foreign material to the bloodstream. The surgical procedure for implanatation may take 2 -4 hours. For the study, patients are required to be connected to the C-Pulse System for approximately 20 hours a day. The patient can safely turn the device on and off as required to perform functions of daily living, such as personal hygiene. It is acceptable to switch the device off for up to 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the risks with regard to the performance of the device as defined by the serious adverse event rates, under normal conditions of use. Serious adverse event rates will be assessed through information on adverse events collected throughout the study. Information will be collected through data linkage to patient medical records and scheduled patient check-ups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From implantation to 5 years post implant</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the potential benefits of C-Pulse as defined by improvements in Peak Oxygen Consumption (VO2), hemodynamic measures, quality of life and Heart Failure (HF) symptoms. 

These outcomes will be assessed through maximal treadmill exercise testing, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire and the Kansas City Questionnaire, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification of HF, Echocardiogram (ECG), Computer Tomography (CT), and Right Heart Catheterisation (RHC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Peak VO2 will be assessed pre-implant and 6 months post implant. 
NYHA and Quality of life questionnaires will be done pre implant and 1,3,6, 12, 18 months post-implant and annually therafter until the 5th year. 

CT and RHC are conducted pre-implant and 6 months post-implant. ECG conducted pre implant and 1,3,6 months post-implant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Further assess the potential risks with regard to the performance of the device as defined by the device failure rate, adverse event rates, adverse event attribution, re hospitalization rates, duration of support, and length of time to hospital discharge. 

This will be assessed through data linkage to patient medical records and scheduled patient check-ups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From implantation to 5 years post implant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Further assess the potential benefits of C-Pulse as defined by improvements in quality of life, fatigue impact scales, hemodynamics, average distance walked in the 6 minute hall walk test, and blood tests. 

Quality of life will be assessed through specific patient questionnaires, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire and the Kansas City Questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The required data to assess the secondary outcomes will be taken pre-implant and  1, 3, 6, 12, 18 months and annually thereafter until the 5th year.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the device usage. This will assessed through reports produced by the device driver.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From implantation to 5 years post implant</timepoint>
