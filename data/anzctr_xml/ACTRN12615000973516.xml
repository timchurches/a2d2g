  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Pioneer Sternal Cabling system is used to approximate the cut edges of the sternum after median sternotomy. It uses braided titanium cables in figure-eight formation, tightened with a specifically-designed tool to tighten the cables and achieve equal distribution of forces and prevent over-tightening.</interventions>
    <comparator>Stainless steel wires have been used for 50 years in cardiac surgery. They are simply placed in simple loops, figure-eight formation or a variety of complex formations then tightened manualy to approximate the sternal plates after median sternotomy</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients were referred and worked up for cardiac surgery as per our institution’s usual practice. Consent for participation in the trial was obtained at the time consent for the planned operation was obtained. The patients were randomised, using block randomization, by a blinded research coordinator on the morning of surgery and the allocation was revealed to the surgical team just prior to commencement of sternal closure via a sealed envelope delivered to the operating theatre.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23. Means were compared using independent sample t tests. Proportions were compared using Chi squared tests (or Fishers exact test if observed counts &lt;5). P values of less than 0.05 were taken as statistically significant.
An a priori subgroup of patients at high risk for DSWI was selected for analysis. The patients in this subgroup were diabetic patients with a BMI &gt;30. They were analysed separately to assess the outcomes of wires compared to cables in this high-risk population.

Our study was designed for 80% power to demonstrate a reduction in DSWI from a baseline rate of 3% to 1% with an alpha value of 0.05. Our goal was to recruit 800 patients but difficulty with recruitment and the relocation of our surgical unit to a new institution at the beginning of 2015 limited our ability to achieve our target. We enrolled 273 patients by the end of our study period. As we realised the rate of recruitment was not going to enable us to enroll 800 patients in our time frame, we revised our target to 300.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Deep sternal wound infection is a devastating complication of cardiac surgery. In the current era of increasing patient co-morbidity, newer techniques must be evaluated in attempts to reduce the rates of deep sternal wound infection.
Methods
A randomised controlled trial comparing sternal closure with traditional sternal wires in figure-8 formation with the Pioneer cabling system [Registered Trademark] from Medigroup after adult cardiac surgery was performed.
Results
273 patients were enrolled with 137 and 135 patients randomised to sternal wires and cables group, respectively. Baseline characteristics between the two groups were well balanced.  Deep sternal wound infection occurred in 0.7% of patients in the wires group and 3.7% of patients in the cables group (absolute risk difference = -3.0%, 95% confidence interval: -7.7% to 0.9%; p=0.12). Patients in the cables group were extubated slightly earlier than the patients in the sternal wires group postoperatively (9.7 vs. 12.8 hours; p=0.03). There was, however, no significant difference in hospital and follow-up pain scores or analgaesia requirements.
Conclusions
The Pioneer sternal cabling system appears to facilitate early extubation after adult cardiac surgery, but it does not reduce the rate of deep sternal infection.
