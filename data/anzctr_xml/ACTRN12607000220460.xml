  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised within-subjects design will be used to determine the effect of regular passive movements on the ankle. One ankle of each subject will receive 20 minutes of passive movements, five days a week for 6 months. The other ankle will not receive passive movements. The primary outcome measure is passive ankle dorsiflexion with the application of 17Nm torque. All measurements will be taken by blinded assessors.</summary>
