  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) is the term commonly applied to a form of treatment for
      infertility that involves controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, egg maturation, egg
      collection, fertilisation, embryo culture and finally embryo transfer. The period after egg
      collection is called luteal phase. In Australia, vaginal progesterone is routinely used to
      support the lining of the uterus so that it is susceptible to implantation of the embryos.

      More recently, there has been some suggestion that additional supplementation of luteal phase
      with GnRH agonist increases clinical pregnancy and live birth rate. These studies are however
      heterogeneous and results were inconsistent.

      This study is a prospective randomised controlled trial of additional GnRH agonist in luteal
      phase of antagonist cycle. The primary hypothesis is that GnRH agonist increases the number
      of live birth . The secondary hypothesis is that this increases the clinical pregnancy rate,
      on-going pregnancy rate, without affecting the miscarriage rate, ovarian hyperstimulation
      rate and multiple pregnancy rate.</summary>
