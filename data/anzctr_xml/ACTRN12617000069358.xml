    <interventions>This is an ethnographic study involving the observation of new graduate nurses as they encounter the culture of mental health nursing during their first year of practice.. 
This study will involve two phases - phase I: non-participant observation of new graduate nurses in the staff-only areas of each acute inpatient unit chosen; and phase II: semi-structured interviews of new graduate nurses as well as a group of recently graduate nurses (nurses who have graduated in the last 5 years).

For phase I - up to 24 new graduate nurses will be invited to participate and will be asked to allow 6 hours of observation (in 2 hour blocks) by the researcher over a period of approximately 7 months. This will occur in staff-only areas of acute mental health inpatient units. No consumers of mental health care will be included in the study. The observation will largely focus on the interactions between new graduate nurses and their colleagues. 

For phase II - up to 30 participants will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The primary participants will include the new graduate nurses invited to participate in phase I, and an additional number of recent graduate nurses (those who have graduated in the last five years) to increase the depth of findings.
Participants in phase II will be asked questions around their experiences of transitioning into the culture and practice of mental health nursing.

    <inclusivecriteria>New graduate nurse - a nurse who satisfied the requirements to practice as a registered nurse in NSW Health and is currently enrolled in a new graduate nurse program within the field of mental health nursing, within the chosen NSW Health local health district.

** For the purposes of this study, phase I involves the observation of new graduate nurses within staff-only areas of each mental health inpatient unit. This may involve the indirect observation of other staff members. Whilst the colleagues of new-graduate nurses are not considered primary participants, their permission to observe will be sought and information about the study will be provided to them.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Ethnography requires the in-depth study of a small population or single unit. However in this study, the study focuses on the new graduate nurses who are not contained within a single site. This requires the researcher to observe this population over multiple sites. 
The total number of new graduate nurses recruited to the local health district mental health transition program is 24 new graduates per year. All new graduates will be invited to participate. however it is anticipated that not all participants invited will agree to participate. The data collection will occur until data saturation is reached. In this case, it is possible that not all participants that agree to participate will be observed.

This reasoning is applied to both phase I - non-participant observation, and phase II - semi-structured interviews.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to explore the experiences of graduate nurses during their first year of mental health nursing.
Research questions
Superordinate question:
1.What are the experiences of graduate nurses when encountering the culture of mental health nursing?
Secondary questions:
2.Are there links between the experiences of graduate nurses and their intention to remain in the field of mental health nursing?
3.What are the processes of assimilating new nurses into the workplace?
4.Where does the new graduate fit into the organisations hierarchy, and how is this perceived by the new graduate?
The research design is an ethnographic study utilising non-participant field observation; semi-structured interviews; analysis of cultural artefacts; and analysis of reflexive researcher notes as data collection methods. 
Data will be analysed using thematic analysis via NViVO software.
The theoretical lens guiding this research is viewing mental health services through the eyes of the new graduate nurse. It is based on the organisational of mental health services and the impact of the culture on those early experiences of new nurses.</summary>
