    <interventions>Half-dose Photodynamic therapy
The Photodynamic therapy (PDT)(intravenous infusion) will be performed using half-dose verteporfin (Visudyne; Novartis). For this, 3 mg/m2 of verteporfin will be infused over 10 minutes, and 15 minutes after beginning the infusion, the laser treatment will be begun. The total light energy delivered to the area of hyperpermeability is 50 J/cm2 over 83 seconds. The area of irradiation will be set to cover the hyperfluorescent area measured in the images recorded during the middle to late phases of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA).

If both eyes meet the inclusion criteria, only the right eye will be included in bilateral cases.

In photodynamic therapy, a light-sensitive medicine called verteporin (Visudyne)
is injected into the bloodstream. Laser light is then shone into the eye, which activates the medicine and the abnormal choroidal blood vessels is treated.  In micropulse laser, a continuous-wave laser beam is chopped into a train of tiny, repetitive, low energy pulses, to treat the areas of diseased retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), inducing resorption of the subretinal fluid.

Patients in the PDT group will be considered for retreatment every 6 months whereas patients in the micropulse laser group will be considered for retreatment every 3 months. Patients who have persistent subretinal fluid after 3 treatments of micropulse laser will receive half-dose photodynamic therapy as rescue therapy, 3 months after the third micropulse laser treatment. In the PDT group, patient who have persistent subretinal fluid 6 months after the initital treatment will receive second half-dose photodynamic therapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subthreshold  micropulse yellow laser

The focal leaking points and areas of hyperpermeability shown in pretreatment FA and ICGA will be used to guide the subthreshold micropulse laser therapy with 577nm yellow laser (IRIDEX IQ 577 laser, USA) delivered through the PDT laser lens (Volk Optical Inc, Mentor, OH, USA). Micropulse laser with spot size of 200 micro meter, 0.2 s exposure time, 400mW, a duty cycle of 5%, will be applied in 7x7 treatment grid pattern over areas of focal and diffuse RPE leak, using TxCellTM Scanning Laser Delivery System.

In the micropulse laser group, 30 ml normal saline will be infused instead of verteporfin, before application of micropulse laser. After treatment, you need to wear protective spectacles and avoid strong light for 2 days. You will need to attend clinic follow up visits at Hong Kong Eye Hospital or CUHK Eye Centre at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the treatment. All investigations will be performed during your routine follow-up visits. No extra visits are necessary. Upon follow up, you will you will receive microperimtery and imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT). Fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) will be performed for patients with persistent subretinal fluid after the treatment, as decided by the doctors.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose
This randomized controlled pilot clinical trial aims to compare the efficacy and safety of half-dose photodynamic therapy(PDT) and subthreshold micropulse yellow (577-nm) laser in central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR).

Methods
This will be a prospective, double-masked, randomized controlled study. Patients with CSCR attending at Hong Kong Eye Hospital between January 2016 and December 2016 will be recruited in the study. If both eyes meet the inclusion criteria, only the right eye will be included in bilateral cases. Patients will be randomized into the half-dose PDT group or the subthreshold micropulse yellow (577-nm) laser group at a ratio of 1:1.

All patients and investigators will be masked to the treatment allocation group. Assessors performing the follow-up assessments also will be masked to the patient allocation group. 

Half-dose Photodynamic therapy
The PDT will be performed using half-dose verteporfin (Visudyne; Novartis AG). For this, 3 mg/m2 of verteporfin will be infused over 10 minutes, and 15 minutes after beginning the infusion, the laser treatment will be begun. The total light energy delivered to the area of hyperpermeability is 50 J/cm2 over 83 seconds.

Subthreshold micropulse yellow laser
The focal leaking points and areas of hyperpermeability will be treated with the subthreshold micropulse laser therapy with 577nm yellow laser (IRIDEX IQ 577 laser, USA). In the micropulse laser group, 30 ml normal saline will be infused instead of verteporfin, before application of micropulse laser. 

Baseline and follow-up examinations
Patients will be assessed at baseline and followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the treatment. At the baseline and all post-treatment visits, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), will be measured. The optical coherence topography (OCT) (Topcon DRI OCT, Triton OCT, Japan; Spectralis OCT, Heidelberg Engineering Inc., Heidelberg, Germany) and microperimtery will be performed before the treatment as well as at each clinical visit. Patients with persistent subretinal fluid will have further fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) as decided by the assessors. 

Retreatment will be considered if the patients meet two of the three following criteria: decreased visual acuity of at least one line from baseline, presence of subretinal fluid on OCT, and significant leakage on angiography. Patients in the PDT group will be considered for retreatment every 6 months whereas patients in the micropulse laser group will be considered for retreatment every 3 months. Patients who have persistent SRF after 3 treatments of micropulse laser will receive half-dose photodynamic therapy as rescue therapy, 3 months after the third micropulse laser treatment.

The primary outcome of the study is the proportion of eyes with complete absorption of subretinal fluid (SRF) at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included serial changes in logMAR BCVA, central foveal th</summary>
