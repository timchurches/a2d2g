    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by General Approach (Participants With Curative Surgery Censored): Non-inferiority of XELOX Versus FOLFOX-4 - PFS was defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease or death. Participants with neither disease progression nor death were censored at the last date of the last tumor assessment that confirmed that their disease had not progressed. Participants with no tumor assessments after baseline who were alive at the time of clinical cutoff were censored at the date of randomization. Participants who underwent surgical resection with curative intent without prior progression were censored at the date of surgery. PFS was based on tumor assessments made by the investigators according to the RECIST criteria. Non-inferiority analysis that followed the general approach took into account all tumor assessments obtained during the primary study treatment phase, the post-study treatment phase and those obtained during the follow-up phase. Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4- containing arms was investigated.</outcome>

      <outcome>PFS (On-treatment Approach): Non-inferiority of XELOX Versus FOLFOX-4 - PFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. The on-treatment analysis included only tumor assessments and death events that occurred no later than 28 days after the last confirmed intake of any study medication in the primary study treatment phase. Participants who did not have an event during this interval were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment within this time window, or on day 1 if no tumor assessment was available after baseline. Participants who underwent surgical resection with curative intent without prior progression within 28 days after the last confirmed intake of any study medication in the primary study treatment phase were censored at the date of surgery.

    <summary>This 4 arm study assessed the efficacy and safety of oral capecitabine (Xeloda) or
      intravenous (iv) fluorouracil/leucovorin, in combination with iv oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) with
      or without iv bevacizumab (Avastin), as a first-line treatment in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Patients were randomized to receive 1) XELOX (Xeloda 1000 mg/m^2 orally
      [po] twice a day [bid] on Days 1-15 + oxaliplatin in 3 week cycles), 2) FOLFOX-4 (oxaliplatin
      + leucovorin + fluorouracil [5-FU] in 2 week cycles), 3) XELOX + bevacizumab (7.5 mg iv on
      Day 1 in 3 week cycles), or 4) FOLFOX-4 + bevacizumab (5 mg iv on Day 1 in 2 week cycles).</summary>
