Radiation:50.4 Gy given in split course - initial phase 36 Gy in 18 fractions to primary +/- perirectal nodes followed after 2 week gap with 14.4 Gy in 8 fractions to primary alone.

Chemotherapy: 5FU 800mg/m2/day (maximum 1.5gm a day) given by intravenous infusion (IV) Days 1-4 and Days 43-46 and Mitomycin C 10mg/m2 (maximum 15mg) by intravenous (IV) bolus Day 1 only.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To test the hypothesis that this chemoradiation schedule can acheive a 5 year colostomy free survival in 85% of patients with less than 10% Grade 3 and 4 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) late toxicity. 

Colostomy free survival is assessed by clinical assessment. Late toxicity is scored using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group /European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up schedule for clinical assessment  is 1,2,3, 6 months after completion of treatment and then 3 monthly for the rest of the first 2 years and subsequently 4 monthly during the 3rd year, 6 monthly during years 4 and 5.  

Late toxicity is scored by physician scored toxicity forms at 6 months post completion of treatment and and then 3 monthly for the rest of the first 2 years and subsequently 4 monthly during the 3rd year, 6 monthly during years 4 and 5</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>local control rate assessed clinically with inspection and digital rectal examination and with other investigations such as biopsy and radiological investigations if appropriate</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical follow up schedule is 1,2,3, 6 months after completion of treatment and then 3 monthly for the rest of the first 2 years and subsequently 4 monthly during the 3rd year, 6 monthly during years 4 and 5.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>relapse free and overall survival as assessed clinically and by radiological investigations if appropriate</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up schedule is 1,2,3, 6 months after completion of treatment and then 3 monthly for the rest of the first 2 years and subsequently 4 monthly during the 3rd year, 6 monthly during years 4 and 5.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute toxicity.
Acute toxicity is scored using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2.0 of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up schedule is 1,2 and 3 months after completion of treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anal canal cancer is generally sensitive to both radiation and chemotherapy and these two treatments given together is now the "gold standard treatment for most early anal canal cancers. Our study was designed to see if we could maintain the generally good cure rates using less extensive and lower doses of radiation and chemotherapy than have been given in some centres. We also looked to see if the less intensive treatment would result in a lower risk of serious side effects for the patient.</summary>
