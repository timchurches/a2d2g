  <interventions>
    <interventions>Malaria patients will be administered either Artequick (2.5 mg/kg artemisinin and 15 mg/kg piperaquine daily) for 2 days, Coarsucam (4 mg/kg artesunate plus 10 mg/kg amodiaquine daily) for 3 days or 4 mg/kg artesunate plus 30 mg/kg azithromycin daily for 3 days. The mode of administration is oral dosing.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of three artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs); artemisinin plus piperaquine (Artequick), artesunate plus amodiaquine (Coarsucam) and artesunate plus azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum in an area of central Vietnam. The efficacy of the three ACTs are compared by the number of patients cured of their infection over a 42-day follow-up period. Recrudescences of infection will be determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Parasitaemia clearance will be determined from blood smears collected 12 hourly after starting treatment by microscopic analysis until negative and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after commencement of treatment. Blood spots for PCR analysis will also be collected before treatment and at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 after starting treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the in vitro susceptibility and molecular genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum isolates collected from malaria patients at Phuoc Chien Commune, central Vietnam. In vitro drug susceptibility testing will be carried out on a blood samples collected from the patients before starting treatment using the field microtechnique candle-jar method and molecular genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum isolates will be carried out using Multiplex PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of several antimalarial drugs, Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistant transporter gene (Pfcrt) and Plasmodium falciparum multidrug-resistant 1 gene (Pfmdr1) will be assessed on a blood sample collected before starting treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over 80 countries worldwide use artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as first-line treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Debate continues as to the most effective ACT and how they will be deployed.  Which ACT is the best combination therapy for first-line treatment in Vietnam has not been adequately studied. In the present study, we propose to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of three ACTs (artemisinin plus piperaquine, artesunate plus amodiaquine and artesunate plus azithromycin) in central Vietnam.</summary>
