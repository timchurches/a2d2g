    <interventions>Patients entered into the trial will be randomized to receive either vigabatrin 500mg x 4 tablets (=2 gram total per dose) statim, and then vigabatrin 500mg x 4 tablets (=2 gram) each morning for 3 days, or placebo 4 tablets statim and then 4 tablets each morning for 3 days. The trial will examine the effect of vigabatrin versus placebo on the outcome of conventional treatment of alcohol withdrawal which all subjects will receive benzodiazepines prescribed as needed according to the severity of alcohol withdrawal as measured by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol - revised (CIWA-Ar) alcohol withdrawal scale</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to assess a new treatment for alcohol withdrawal in patients who are admitted to hospital. Alcohol withdrawal can be a severe condition.  Usually it is treated with benzodiazepines such as diazepam,  but these medications can have dangerous side-effects such as excessive sedation and depression of respiration.  The new treatment uses a medication called vigabatrin. Vigabatrin is usually used for treating epilepsy, but it has been found in preliminary studies to also be useful in treating alcohol withdrawal because it reduces the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, shortens the duration of alcohol withdrawal and may also prevent alcohol withdrawal seizures, without causing sedation or depressing respiration.</summary>
