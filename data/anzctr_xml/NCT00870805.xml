  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) remains essential to contemporary psychiatric practice and is
      one of the safest and most effective treatments available for depression. Despite modern
      advances in pharmacotherapy, about 15-20 per cent of all hospitalised patients receive
      treatment with ECT. Its use, however, is limited by concerns over associated cognitive side
      effects.

      Recent research has suggested that using an ultrabrief pulsewidth with ECT may greatly reduce
      cognitive side effects, while maintaining efficacy (Sackeim et al 2008). Preliminary results
      were positive for unilateral ECT, however, suggest that for bilateral ECT, dosing may need to
      be adjusted to preserve efficacy while reducing side effects. This study will examine the
      relative cognitive side effects and efficacy of right unilateral and bilateral ECT given with
      a standard pulsewidth or an ultrabrief pulsewidth. Some participants will also receive an MRI
      scan before and after ECT.</summary>
