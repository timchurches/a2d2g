    <statisticalmethods>Because this is a pilot trial, the sample size is not designed to achieve adequate power to observe statistically significant results. Rather, the aim is to assess feasibility issues such as participant accrual for the trial, drug safety, and provide effect size estimates for the effects of dexamethasone on POD incidence, severity and duration. A sample size of 120 participants is the largest sample size that is feasible to recruit from our hospital in a 12-18 month period. The largest feasible sample size has been chosen, as this will provide greater precision in the estimates of both efficacy and safety to inform a larger study.  

Quantitative data will be summarised using descriptive statistics with analyses primarily focused on confidence interval and effect size estimation, rather than formal hypothesis testing.
Participant eligibility and recruitment: A screening log will be kept documenting the number of patients screened, ineligible, eligible, consented and declined. We will describe 1) the proportion of screened patients who meet the inclusion criteria and 2) the consent rate of eligible patients.
Timing of the intervention: A log will be kept of the time the intervention is delivered. This will be compared to the hospital admission time and we will describe the time from hospital admission to delivery of the intervention.
Appropriate dosing: The change in serum inflammatory biomarkers from baseline (pre-intervention) to postoperative days 1, 2 and 3 will be described and compared between groups to estimate the magnitude and duration of the immune modulating effect of dexamethasone 20mg in this population. Where appropriate, inferential statistics may be utilised. The relationships between biomarker levels and POD incidence and severity will also be explored.
Drug safety: The number and type of adverse events will be described in the dexamethasone and placebo groups. Rates of adverse events in the dexamethasone and placebo groups will be compared. and expressed as relative risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals with a relative risk greater than 1.0 indicating a harmful effect of dexamethasone.
Effect size: The incidence of POD is considered a binary outcome (greater than or equal to 4 on 4AT on any postoperative day). The results will be expressed as relative risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the dexamethasone group relative to the placebo group, with a relative risk less than 1.0 indicating a beneficial effect. The duration of delirium will be taken as the number of consecutive days with a 4AT score greater than or equal to 4 from its earliest occurrence, described in each group and compared between the dexamethasone and placebo groups using effect size estimates. The severity of delirium will be characterized by the highest value of the MDAS during an episode with delirium, described in each group and compared between the dexamethasone and placebo groups using effect size estimates. Secondary outcomes (acute postoperative pain, mortality rates, length of stay) will be described and compared between the dexamethasone and placebo groups using effect size estimates.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative delirium (POD) is an important clinical problem commonly observed in elderly patients during the first few days following hip fracture surgery. POD is associated with increased length of hospital stay and significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates than those who do not get POD. The reported incidence of POD in patients following hip fracture surgeries varies between 16% and 62%. Studies suggest that inflammation related to the stress response from the initial trauma (the fracture itself) as well as from the surgical procedure (the operation), are important contributing factors that lead to neuro-inflammation, cognitive dysfunction and POD. Thus, it is possible that exogenous steroids, which reduce inflammation, can reduce the risk of developing POD. Dexamethasone (corticosteroid) has been shown to reduce the release of inflammatory markers after surgery. However, there have been no clinical studies to confirm the potential efficacy and safety of dexamethasone at preventing POD in this specific population. Furthermore, there are unique feasibility issues in conducting such a study in this population. 

The main aims with this feasibility study are to assess the safety and feasibility of systemic dexamethasone, administered as early as possible after arrival to hospital, in patients with hip fractures, to determine whether a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial should be conducted. Provided acceptable safety and feasibility can be demonstrated, results of the feasibility study will be used to estimate important parameters that are needed to inform the design of a larger multi-centre phase III clinical trial. The main aim of the full study is to investigate the effectiveness of dexamethasone on decreasing incidence, severity and duration of POD. Secondary outcomes include levels of inflammatory cytokines in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial will include 120 patients aged 65 and over admitted for hip fracture. Patients will be randomised to receive either dexamethasone 20 mg or placebo. To examine safety, drug related complications will be compared between the intervention and control group. Further feasibility issues (e.g. generating a robust estimate of the potential effect size, a sustainable recruitment rate, the real world incidence in our population etc.) will be assessed. POD incidence and duration will be assessed with the 4As test (4AT), on postoperative day 1, 2 and 3. Patients who develop POD during any of these days will be assessed daily until it resolves, or until discharged from the orthopaedic ward. Severity of POD will be assessed with the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). The inflammatory response will be assessed in a sub sample of patients by collecting blood samples and one cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample. These samples will be analysed for cytokines and biomarkers previously associated with delirium.
