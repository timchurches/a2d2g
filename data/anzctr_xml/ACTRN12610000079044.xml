  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clonidine infusion 0.25-2 mcg/kg/hr in addition to standard sedation -morphine/midazolam infusions

The 'study drug' (clonidine/control) is started at 0.25mcg/kg/hr and increased in hourly increments of 0.25mcg/kg/hr as per study protocol. These increments occur over a 12 hour period, after which time the study drug is maintained, and the patient is actively weaned from morphine and midazolam over the next five 24 hour periods (or until discharge, whichever is sooner).  This again follows a protocol which allows a 5% reduction in morphine and midazolam every 2 hours.  The study drug is continued for this time, and then weaned by 0.25-0.75mcg/kg/hr per hour, after six 24hour periods, or once ready for extubation (whichever is sooner).</interventions>
    <comparator>standard sedation - morphine/midazolam infusions + placebo (normal saline)

As described above, the patient is initially commenced on standard sedation with morphine and midazolam for a 12 hour period.  After this time, the 'study drug' is started, and incrementally increased for the next 12 hours to a maximum of 2mcg/kg/hr.  For the next five 24 hour periods(or until ready for extubation), the study drug remains at this rate, while the morphine and midazolam are actively weaned by 5% every 2 hours.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients can be enrolled any time from admission to 96 hours.  Eligible patients should be identified as soon as possible and parents consented after being given time to read the parent consent information.  Once enrolled, the nurse looking after the patient picks up a numbered pack/envelope with a study details.  Blinding allocation will be in a separate white envelope within the pack, to be opened by the unblinded staff member making up the infusion</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a trial aiming to assess how effective a drug called clonidine is in sedating children in intensive care.  Children are normally kept asleep with morphine and midazolam, both sedative drugs with side effects like tolerance and withdrawl.  Clonidine acts as a sparing agent, reducing the need for these drugs, and reducing the chance of side effects.  This trial aims to show that by using clonidine, we allow a significant reduction in use of morphine and midazolam, and therefore a reduction in side effects.  By showing this, we aim to encorporate Clonidine into normal sedation practice, improving our safe practice.</summary>
