  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a household latrine (BALatrine) plus health education/promotion on hygiene and sanitation. The BALatrine is a simple squat latrine, usually constructed by the villagers themselves, at the side of a house. It comprises a 2 metre pit (with optional bamboo/concrete pipe strengthening); a base cover with raised footsteps (which can be used during dry periods); and a flushable U-bend porcelain bowl that may be removable. All can be made from local materials. All householders in the intervention village will contruct one, with material support and advice from the researchers, if required. The intervention period is 18 months, after which the control villages will also receive the intervention. The Health education/health promotion intervention will be implemented through 1 two-hour village wide mobilization meeting; 4 one-hour small group workshops at months 2, 4, 6, and 8 with the villagers; and five individual one-hour face to face participatory action hygiene/sanitation educational inputs in months 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 for each intervention household. </interventions>
    <comparator>A community based cluster-RCT will be undertaken to determine the impact of the BALatrine on STH infection, in 2 neighbouring rural Districts of Semarang, Central Java. 16 villages (8 intervention; 8 control) with no latrines will be identified and matched as closely as possible, based on criteria related to transmission, into pairs. 1 village within each pair will be randomly assigned intervention status (installation of the BALatrine) leaving the other as the control (no latrine). A fixed cohort (n=500) of people (aged 5-60, including equal numbers of males and females) in each village will be selected and followed up over 18 months. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The main end-point for the study will be human soil-transmitted Helminth (STH) prevalence. A stool examination (with blinding of microscopists to intervention status) for infection status will be undertaken in all villages at baseline and at follow-up (month 15).  We will use the Kato-Katz method for human stool examination for the assessment of STH infection rates and intensities. Two stool samples will be collected from each person on consecutive days and 3 slides will be prepared per stool, to optimise diagnostic sensitivity. Microscopists will not be aware which village the slide was from and slides will be de-identified for reading so that they are read independently from each other. Quality control will be carried out by independent microscopists on 20% of the slides. </outcome>
      <timepoint>15 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second end-point for the study will be pollution of village wells. Well-water pollution will be assessed at baseline and follow-up using E.Coli counts, coprostanol and other faecal markers. Standard microbiological examination for faecal coliforms and also testing for faecal steroid markers (viz. coprostanol) as an index of soluble faecal components will be conducted. </outcome>
      <timepoint>18 Months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The third end-point for the study will be soil contamination with parasite eggs. Soil/dust samples will be collected at baseline and follow-up from a random selection of households (25%) and examined for helminth eggs (3 g each) from the grounds of latrines, homes and gardens. </outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved health knowledge, hygiene and sanitary behaviour. This will be measured at baseline and follow-up using a questionnaire (the Helminth, Education and Latrine Project (HELP) questionnaire)  consisting of questions relating to demographics, medical history, health knowledge and behaviour relating to worm morphology, transmission routes, prevention and control of worm infections, and on defecation and latrine use. The HELP questionnaire has been previously developed and piloted in 3 village populations around Semarang.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved child health. All children in the village samples will have their biometric (height, weight, skin-fold) data collected and BMI computed. This will be compared with Indonesian norms, urban samples and provide pre-post measurements between the experimental and the control villages.  The HELP questionnaire also collects data on gastrointestinal infection history including diarrhea, parasitic infections and treatment. School teachers will be interviewed to identify indicators of improved health on achievement. These will include attendance records, relevant formal school test/educational scores as well as qualitative teacher assessment of student health and wellbeing. </outcome>

    <designfeatures>16 villages without latrines will be identified and matched as closely as possible, based on criteria related to transmission (infection levels; transmission ecology) into pairs to reduce confounding and increase statistical efficiency. One village within each pair will be randomly assigned intervention status (installation of the BALatrine) leaving the other as the control (no latrine) </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A generalised linear model will be used for formal analyses and carried out using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Models will be fitted using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) and a log-binomial distribution used to estimate relative risks and therefore intervention efficacy against infection. Clustering will be accounted for by analysing the combined intervention effect within the matched pairs. Potential confounders such as age and sex will be incorporated. Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to estimate correlations among behaviour, knowledge, and incidence. Sample size calculations were performed according to Donner and Klar; with an STH incidence of 8% (typical of communities with ~24% STH prevalence), an intervention efficacy of 30%, and a design effect (relating to paired differences) of 1.5; the study will have 80% power (alpha = 0.05) with a sample size of 8 intervention clusters (16 in total) and 400 participants per cluster at the end of the trial following a predicted annual 10% loss to follow-up. Total study population is 6400. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to provide conclusive systematic and scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness, acceptability and cost effectiveness of the 'BALatrine'. This low cost, locally constructed latrine works in both wet and dry conditions and is designed for local people and materials in resource poor settings such as rural and refugee communities. Recent funded trials (UBS-OF) show the latrine, under development since the 1990s, produces key health benefits. A cluster randomised control trial across 16 villages in Central Java Province is proposed, with the primary outcome of proving the effectiveness and acceptability of the BALatrine in reducing STH infection and environmental/water pollution, and improved hygiene behaviour.</summary>
