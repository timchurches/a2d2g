(In moderate-severe OSAS patients main treatment is positive airway pressure (PAP) device. We have investigated the efficiancy of this device.) 
In obstructive sleep apnea patients the saturation of oxygen level are under normal level. In some patients we measure that about 30-40% PAP device positive pressure. Low oxygen levels are associated with chronic disease as myocardial infarction. When apnea appears in patients and saturation of the oxygen level decreases PAP device improve saturation of oxygen by positive pressure. Patients  should use the device every night. Patients who are using the device for more than 6 months (between 6-12months) will be observed.</interventions>

      <outcome>When evaluating the efficiancy of positive airway pressure treatment we used Epworth Sleepines Scale (ESS) and 2 other questionnaire which we prepared for Turkish patients. This kind of questionarre could be used  in these syudies.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficiency and compliance of positive airway pressure treatment. 

Materials&amp;Methods: This study was conducted on moderate-severe obstuctive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients who admitted to Ankara Numune Hospital Sleep Center between 2008 and 2012. Seventy five patients with moderate-severe OSAS who were using PAP treatment regularly were enrolled to study. Patients usage data, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) scores and the differences in complaints of OSAS were recorded.

Results: The overall complaints were improved when compared to pretreatment period. Particularly there was improvement in apnea, snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue and sleep quality.

Conclusion: PAP is effective in reducing symptoms in people with moderate and severe OSAS. To inform the patients in details and creation of strategies for close follow up are necessary for improving the compliance of the patients.
