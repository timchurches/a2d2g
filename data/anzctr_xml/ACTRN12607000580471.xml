    <concealment>After patients meet eligibility criteria, they will be centrally randomized by computer (1:1:1:1) to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo control group. Patients will be assigned a randomization number. The patient and study personnel will be blinded as to which treatment the patient is receiving. Thirty-five patients will be randomized to each study group for a total of 140 patients. Randomization will be stratified by gender.</concealment>
    <sequence>140 sequential patients numbered 001 to 140 will be randomised.  The randomization will be stratified by gender.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety (i.e. incidence and type of adverse events) and efficacy (i.e. as measured by complete clearance) of AS101 administered twice daily topically over a treatment period of up to 16 weeks, or until complete clearance of external genital warts in the treatment area.</summary>
