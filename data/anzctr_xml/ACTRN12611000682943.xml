    <interventions>We seek to determine BDNF and cytokine levels in the serum of 19 drug-naive subjects with psychosis, before and after three months of treatment with quetiapine (an antipsychotic), as markers of neurotrophin activity and autoimmunity respectively, and compare with 19 age and sex matched healthy controls. The serum samples are from 19 subjects recruited from a first-episode cohort treated for three months with quetiapine during a dose-finding study at Orygen Youth Health, Parkville, Vic (AU-SEA-0003/ NHMRC 209 062) between 2004 and 2009.</interventions>

      <outcome>There has been no exploration of VEGF in schizophrenia or other psychoses. VEGF is one of the cytokines we sought to measure:

      <timepoint>We hypothesised that baseline subjects would have lower VEGF levels than healthy controls, which would increase following quetiapine treatment. We also hypothesized that changes to VEGF levels would be negatively correlated to a number of outcome measures. Finally, we proposed that there would be a positive correlation between BDNF and VEGF levels.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psychosis in general and schizophrenia in particular are currently best understood as a group of illnesses whose symptoms are related to brain abnormalities that are the final common pathway from a multitude of aetiologies, due to the assorted interaction of specific genetic and environmental factors. The concept probably encompasses several primary disease processes (for example with a phospholipid, neurotrophin or autoimmune aetiology) that display a common endpoint in dopamine and other neurochemical abnormalities, and structural changes.  While there has been a lot of research concerning the phospholipid hypothesis, there has been little around the neurotrophin and autoimmune aetiologies. We seek to determine BDNF and cytokine levels in the serum of 19 drug-naive subjects with psychosis, before and after treatment with quetiapine (an antipsychotic), as markers of neurotrophin activity and autoimmunity respectively, and compare with 19 age and sex matched healthy controls.</summary>
