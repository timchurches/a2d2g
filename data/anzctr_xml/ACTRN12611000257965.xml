  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the one of three beverage tax conditions. 

During a telephone survey, participants will be read a list of beverages typically available from an Australian supermarket. The survey will be conducted once only.

For each beverage product type, participants will be provided with information about the price and container sizes (up to three) which the product can be purchased (for example, a 2 litre bottle, a 1.5 litre bottle and a 600ml bottle) based on data regarding the most frequently purchased container size for that beverage product.

For each beverage type, participants will be asked to report the number of products (in each container size), they would intend to purchase for the consumption of their household during a typical grocery shop. 

The price of beverages containing caloric sweetener will be  experimentally manipulated. 

For group 1: the price of such products will be increased by 10%

For group 2: the price of such products will be increased by 20%

For group 3: the price of such products will be increased by 30%</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group (group 4) procedure will be identical to those in the intervention conditions, however the price of beverages read to control group participants will not be inflated, and will be at current market price</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants, responsible for the grocery shopping of their household will be recruited via telephone and randomised to receive one of four groups. All participants will be read a list of beverages frequently purchased from Australian supermarkets and asked the quantity of each they would intend to purchase during a typical grocery shop. The price of caloric sweetened beverages read to participants will be 10%, 20% and 30% higher then the market price for groups randomly allocated to group 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The price of beverages for participants allocated to the comparison group (group 4) will be consistent with market price. All participants will provide data regarding their intended purchase of beverages during the telephone survey.</summary>
