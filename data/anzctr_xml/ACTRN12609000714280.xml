  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with complete quadriplegia commonly report sleep disturbances and have been found to lack melatonin production, a hormone that modulates our sleep cycle. It is unclear if their sleep problems are related to their lack of melatonin production. The aim of this study was to investigate whether nightly supplementation of 3mg melatonin would induce, shift the phase of and/or modify subjective sleep for people with complete quadriplegia. It is hypothesised that supplementation with melatonin will improve subjective sleep for people with complete quadriplegia along with their sleep phasing, quality of life and autonomic functioning.</summary>
