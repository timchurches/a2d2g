    <interventions>Double blind crossover trail
The surgical placement of a sacral nerve stimulator is a 1 hour operation under general anaesthetic performed in day surgery. A pacemaker is surgically placed in the buttock and a lead attached to the pacemaker is positioned along side S3 or S4.
After surgical placement of the sacral nerve stimulator . The electrical stimulation is turned on. The patient is placed on either a subsensory stimulation or a sham stimulation for a 3 week period
Setting 1- 3 weeks   sham v subsensory setting
Device is then turned off for a 2week wash out period
Wash Out (WO) 1 2weeks
Setting 2- 3 weeks   sham v subsensory setting
WO2 2weeks
Setting 3 - 3 weeks   sham v suprasensory setting
WO3 2weeks
Setting 4 - 3 weeks   sham v suprasensory setting

Both supasensory and subsensory stimulation from SNS for constipation
patients then enter a 2 year followup on patient preferred setting</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a crossover study where the patients act as their own control

All patients receive an active device but both sham and active stimulation settings will be tested

Patients are blinded to the setting changes and informed that some may work better than others and some may be felt and others not.

Patients are placed on a 0 stimulation setting during the sham stimulation periods.
only 1 research operator is unblinded and all those reviewing results are blinded until close of the study.
Sham settings go for 3 weeks and are followed by a 2week wash out period before the next setting change</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feeling of complete evacuation on 2 or more days per week

Patients complete a daily record of all bowel movements on a stool diary. These diaries are filled out for each day the patients are on a randomised control setting. the diary asks the patient to rate each daily movemnt if ther is one as accompanied by 'afeeling of complete evacuation or not. patients fillout a yes or no to this question for each recorded bowel movement at all stages of the trial</outcome>
      <timepoint>Feeling of complete evacuation is assessed at each changover point.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>the trial investigates whether the symptoms of chronic constipation can be relieved using the novel therapy of sacral nerve stimulation.
A pacemaker device is surgically implanted above the sacral nerve so that an electrical stimulation can be applied to either S3 or S4. This has been shown to normalise the colonic contractions in faecal incontinence. 
This study intends to test wether the same stimulation will have an effect on the symptoms of chronic constipation.</summary>
