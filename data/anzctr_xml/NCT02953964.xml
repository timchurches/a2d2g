Other interventions: Behavioral: perceptual-based memory encoding training
Participants are trained in the use of perceptual-based memory encoding strategies, inclusive of visual imagery and the method of loci. Visual imagery involves the creation and encoding of mental images, while the method of loci refers to linking these images with specific places to facilitate memory (Simon et al., 2012). Participants are taught to visualise performing each step of a task in a familiar environment, such as in their home (Liu et al., 2009). After participants can correctly visualise the entire task, they then progress to actually performing the task. During the intervention sessions, 2-3 tasks are covered each session, and these tasks become progressively difficult as the weeks progress. The intervention lasts for 10 weeks with one session every week. Each session runs for 90 minutes. A follow-up home training program is run once a week for 30 minutes with the participant and their care-giver.

Other interventions: Behavioral: semantic-based memory encoding training
Participants are asked to encode the steps of a task by forming an association of the steps and sequence. Participants are trained in the use of the chunking association method and honeycomb concept and perform different tasks each week, implementing this encoding strategy (Lim et al., 2012). The chunking association method breaks down information into smaller parts and helps with the encoding and retrieval of information. The honeycomb concept allows the steps to form a story in relation to place, time, characters, problem and solution and the story is verbalised. Participants then complete the task. During the intervention sessions, 2-3 tasks are covered each session, and these tasks become progressively difficult as the weeks progress. The intervention lasts for 10 weeks with one session every week. Each session runs for 90 minutes. A follow-up home training program is run once a week for 30 minutes with the participant and their care-giver.

Other interventions: Behavioral: Cognitive stimulation group (control group)
Participants receiving cognitive stimulation intervention. It consists of eight sessions that train participants' visual attention and memory, auditory attention and memory and their application in daily activities. Two sessions are also given which allow for participants to apply the training practically in their daily lives. The intervention lasts for 10 weeks with one session every week. Each session runs for 90 minutes. A follow-up home training program is run once a week for 30 minutes with the participant and their care-giver.
