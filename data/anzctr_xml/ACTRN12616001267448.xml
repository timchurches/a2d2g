  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a thoracic spinal manipulation (SM) to the mid thoracic spine (T3-T6). Briefly, the procedure involves the application of high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) thrust which will take approximately 2-3 minutes (from positioning to delivery of thrust). 
Depending on group allocation, participants will receive a SM during one of their two visits. The two visits are separated by a duration of one week.  
The experiment will take place in an environmental chamber where temperature (24 degrees Celsius) and humidity (40%) will be kept constant.
The intervention will be performed by a manual therapist with more than 5 years of experience.
The whole procedure in the environmental chamber ranging from pre-intervention data collection to post-intervention (5 and 30 minutes) data collection will take approximately 45 minutes. Participants will then collect salivary samples at home 6 hours post-intervention.  

</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the comparator group will receive sham intervention. This will involve manual contact and positioning of the participants similar to those in the intervention group, without the delivery of HVLA thrust. 
Depending on group allocation, participants will receive a sham intervention during one of their two visits (separated by one week).
The participants in this group will also spend approximately 45 minutes for data collection.Participants will then collect salivary samples at home 6 hours post-intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this trial is to determine whether there are immediate and short term changes in T/C ratio, calf and Achilles tendon blood flow following a thoracic spinal manipulation in people with Achilles tendinopathy. The hypothesis is that there will be changes in primary outcome measures of interest (T/C ratio and blood flow) which will be significantly different in the SM group compared to sham group. Findings from this trial will inform future larger RCTs planned in this area.
