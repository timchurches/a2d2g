  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Rheumatoid Arthritis for Physiotherapist eLearning package is a series of four web-based learning modules (disease and recognition; early stages; chronic stages and extra-articular features and co-morbid conditions) and two case studies. 

Each module consists of text content, videos of people with rheumatoid arthritis; practice points and clinical resources. The two case studies provide case histories and clinically related questions with answers. 

It is expected that each module and case study should take no more than 30 minutes to complete.  So in total the whole package could be completed in three hours.

During this study, physiotherapists will be give a period of four weeks in which to complete the modules and case studies. All learning modules will be made available at the one time so that the physiotherapist can work through it at his/her own pace.

The total time of intervention and follow up for the intervention group is 12 weeks while for the control group it is 17 weeks. This is because after the randomised controlled trial the study will continue as a cohort study to the eight week follow up period for each group. Because the control group will get access to the intervention at the end of week 5, the four weeks intervention for them plus the 8 week follow up period finishes at 17 weeks.</interventions>

    <concealment>A convenience sample of 160 physiotherapists who have expressed interest in undertaking professional development training in RA using the RAP-eL resource will be invited to participate in the study.

A computer-generated program will randomly assign respondents to either the intervention or control group. This process will be undertaken by a person independent of the study data analysis.

Participants will be aware of the group to which are allocated. After the four week trial, members of the control group will be given access to the intervention.

Assessors and data analysts will be blind to participant allocation

    <statisticalmethods>A convenience sample of 160 physiotherapists who have expressed interest in undertaking professional development training in RA using the RAP-eL resource will be invited to participate in the study. Analyses will be performed using SPSS version 19.0. A priori sample size calculations determined that a sample size of 128 would be sufficient to detect an effect size of 0.5 with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05. Estimating an attrition rate of approximately 25% we will collect expressions of interest from 160 physiotherapists. 

For the 4-week RCT, differences between groups at baseline will be analysed using the t-test. Between group changes from baseline to four weeks will be examined using ANCOVA to allow adjustment for any differences identified at baseline, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) will be provided.

For the cohort study paired t-tests will be performed to determine change in performance over time from immediate post RAP-eL to 8 weeks follow-up. p-values less than 0.05 will be considered significant. 

Secondary analysis will determine the proportion of participants who felt satisfied with their management of people with RA at baseline compared with at 8 weeks using chi-square.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the resource, Rheumatoid Arthritis for Physiotherapists  eLearning (RAP-eL), in improving confidence and knowledge of best-practice physiotherapy management of rheumatoid arthritis. 

The evaluation of the RAP-eL resource aims to answer two research questions:

1.	Is the RAP-eL resource effective in improving physiotherapists confidence and knowledge in the management of rheumatoid arthritis?

2.	Are changes in confidence and knowledge retained over time?</summary>
