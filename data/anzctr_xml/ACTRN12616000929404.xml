  <interventions>
    <interventions>To check the hypothesis related to differences in back pain, quality of life indices and sleep quality indices, three groups were created after an initial analysis of postural behaviors during sleep period. All participants (males and females, students and military) were separated into 3 groups, conveniently chosen according to the self-related level of back pain and quality of life indices to homogenize the sample. So, each group was linear at baseline with four male and four female in each group: i) Experimental Group (EG); ii) Placebo Group (PG) and; iii) Control Group (CG).
i) Experimental Group (EG)
Based on Gracovetsky (1987), Haex (2005) and Tetley (2000), individuals in the Experimental Group (EG) were instructed according to the method used in this study, which represents the recommendations of the ideal sleeping posture with the optimal quantity and place of use of pillows (using a pillow in mixed position) considering the pathological problems or the amount of back pain reported (Intervention program).
Firstly, the principal investigator gave to the participants initial instructions in a lecture for a small group with 30 minutes of duration. Second, weekly positive reinforcement with 15 minutes of duration plus sending the presented material and informal contact through e-mail and phone, as preferred by the participant, were given. Thus, participants in EG (Group I  Experimental), altered the initial body posture while sleeping to: 
a) Lateral decubitus right or left, for participants with neck and dorsal pain, the use of a pillow under the lateral head / neck with height of the distance between the shoulder and the neck of each participant, a pillow between the knees and a pillow between the arms or;
b) Supine, for participants with low back pain, with the use of a low pillow (5 cm) below the head / neck and a pillow or high roller (15cm height) below the knees. 
These positions have been indicated depending the pain area in order to keep a good balance and alignment of the spine and distribute the body's weight over the entire surface of the mattress (Haex, 2005; Desouzart, Matos, Melo, &amp; Filgueiras, 2016; Verhaert, et al., 2012; Gracovetsky, 1987).
These indications will be held every day for the duration of this study (3 month), which provided a continuous reinforcement of the method through informal contact via email and mobile phone for any questions and issues.
ii) Placebo Group (PG)
To prove the reliability of the method, an intervention was performed with a second experimental group (Placebo Group  PG) that received and perform the technique of progressive muscle relaxation Jacobson (Jacobson, 1938; Toledo &amp; Bara Filho, 2007). Later designated Group II - Placebo. Jacobson's relaxation technique, also known as progressive relaxation therapy, is a type of therapy that focuses on tightening and relaxing specific muscle groups in sequence. Again, the principal investigator conducted an initial lectures during 30 minutes with a small group, and weekly positive reinforcement for 15 minutes (with sending the material presented and informal contact through e-mail and phone, as preferred by the participant)
Progressive relaxation is a technique of fourteen groups of exercises in which 16 muscle groups (Head and face, anterior trunk, posterior, superior and inferior, upper and lower limbs) they are relaxed one after another. Each group is first placed in tension and then relaxed several times, achieving a relaxation ever-deeper muscle group. The following stress-relaxation of every muscle group is repeated to achieve relaxation in the muscles in question, equal to the relaxation in parts already relaxed, at least three repetitions in each group. 
These details were also held every day for the duration of the study for approximately 15 minutes per day immediately before bed throughout the intervention period. This relaxation technique was considered Placebo because the participants were informed that this intervention was shown for the relief of back pain. However, little or nothing is referenced in the literature on the effectiveness of the technique of progressive muscle relaxation approach recommendations for aspects such as back pain or improve quality of life (Toledo &amp; Bara Filho, 2007; Laloni, 1997; Davis, Eshelman, &amp; Mackay, 1996; Junqueira &amp; Ribeiro, 2006).
At the end of the 3rd month, all subjects (EG, PG) were re-filmed during 3 consecutive nights to analyze whether recommended changes were implemented. Participants were also asked to fulfill a questionnaire about the level of pain, quality of life and quality of sleep as well as a functional daily to see if there was any change in behavior or in the environment.</interventions>
    <comparator>With the third group (Control group-CG, subsequently appointed Group III - Control) we made an interview with the indication to the participants to maintain the usual sleeping posture that they already use. They were also informed that they would have to fulfill other questionnaires in the future with questions about their sleeping posture. All participants in CG were interviewed and received the indication to maintain the same habitual posture as well as information about future questionnaires. At the end of the 3rd month, all subjects were re-filmed during 3 consecutive nights and were asked to answer the questionnaire about daily and night activity to analyze if these group maintaining the same habitual sleep positions.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Qualitative research produces large amounts of textual data in the form of transcripts. High quality analysis of qualitative research can produce vast amounts of data (Pope, Ziebland, &amp; Mays, 2000). According Sterne, Egger, &amp; Smith (2001), the smaller a study the larger the treatment effect necessary for the results to be significant. 
Considering the university context, the research started with 89 students (23 male and 66 female) of healthcare domain (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nursing, dietary therapy and, sport and wellness), aged between 17 and 30 years, from the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria of Portugal. Of these, all students (n=89) residing in dormitories answered a questionnaire about the perception of quality of life according to the abbreviated questionnaire on quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), studying in the healthcare domain, but only 12 female (mean=19.75 years old +1.138) have volunteered to participate in this study. 
Regarding to military context, 134 soldiers (112 male and 22 female), aged between 18 and 25 years, from to the air base n.5 of the Portuguese air force were selected to participate in the study. These, 66 soldiers answered a questionnaire about the perception of quality of life according to the abbreviated questionnaire on quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), and only 12 male (mean=22.17 years old +1.749) have volunteered to participate in this study. 
For the present study, due to the low number of participants (n= 24) according to the statement several authors (Sterne, Egger, &amp; Smith, 2001; Pope, Ziebland, &amp; Mays, 2000; Patton, 2005), no formal power calculation was performed because only this number of participants were volunteer to complete all procedures, the researchers chose to conduct a qualitative analysis, in order to make the most effective results and capable of being reproduced in other populations with the same characteristics.
For the carrying out of this study, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure of back pain, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the Sleep quality and the abbreviated questionnaire on quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), was used to measure the intensity on the quality of life (Canavarro, et al., 2009) before (1st phase) and after (2nd phase) three consecutive month an Intervention ergonomics program.
All data were coded and computerized with statistical analysis performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.0. Baseline differences between the EG, PG and CG in primary and secondary outcome measures were assessed by the test of parametric statistics One-Way ANOVA (analysis of variance the different group at different times), setting the level of significance at p = .05. Training effects in these measures were determined by using an ANOVA to analyze differences between pretraining and posttraining score.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The behavioral and postural habits and sleep rhythm can be changed depending on the type of daily activity. The decreased time available for sleep and/or increased sleep disturbance is often associated with a demanding life style and other challenges imposed by modern society. This paper presents a study which aims: i) Verify the influence of the activity and gender on postural behavior during sleep and; ii) Check if an ergonomics recommendation can mean positive changes in the perception of quality of life, according to ecological and environmental approach. A sample of 21560 observations, which corresponds 595 hours of sleep hours of 24 young adults (12 male military and 12 female undergraduate). The individuals were equally separated in three groups: Experimental Group, Placebo Group and Control Group. The sleep behavior was classified into two Interaction Categories according to the iSEE observation, before and after an Intervention program. The abbreviated questionnaire of WHO on quality of life (WHOQOL-Breef) was used to measure the perception of quality of life. The first results showed no significant difference (p = .119) between the postures used during the sleep period between the two groups of participants (military men and women students) within the same age group (18 to 25 years old). The experimental group improved self-perception of quality of life (from regular to good - p=.000) and posture while sleeping (51.1% to 69.9%) using the ideal placement and amount of pillows (2.41% to 95.06%). Findings of this study allow us suggesting to health care professionals, in particular the rehabilitation professionals, new strategies and solutions for ergonomic change in posture in bed and improve the quality of life indices.</summary>
