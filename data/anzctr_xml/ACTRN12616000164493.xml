  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part one  OGTT
After a ten hour fast participants will report to the BASE facility at either 0730h (morning) or 1930h (evening). Anthropometric measures (height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and blood pressure) will be obtained by a researcher and two blood samples for fasting glucose (finger prick) will be taken at time -15 mins and time 0 mins. A glucose solution made from pure glucose powder (75g in 400 ml water) will be provided at 0800h or 2000 hrs and participants asked to consume this within five minutes. Blood sampling (finger prick) for glucose assessment will be collected at the following time points over a two hour period (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 mins). Washout between study days is a minimum of three days.

Part two  Low GI meal
Part two replicates part one except an Intravenous cannula will be inserted by an experienced nurse or phlebotomist thirty minutes before the start of the trial.  One baseline blood sample will be taken at time 0 mins followed by a low GI meal at 0800h or 2000h which participants will be asked to consume within 15 minutes. Blood sampling will be collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 9, 120 and 180 mins for glucose and insulin.  Participants are able to opt in to a third time point where they will consume the same GI meal at midnight.   The washout period between each of the meal occasions  is a minimum of three days.
The low glycaemic index meal is a vegetarian pasta dish which consists of of 3.28MJ, with 47% Energy (E) from carbohydrate, 40%E from fat and 11%E from protein.

Three hour glucose  iAUC will be calculated from venous blood samples at nine time points (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 mins) after the low GI meal  (part two) </timepoint>

    <designfeatures>The study is divided into two parts both of which involve undergoing an OGTT (part one) or consuming a low GI meal (part two) at two time points (8am and 8pm).
Part one is completed before part two
After completing part two (low GI meal), participants are given the opportunity to complete an additional time point at midnight.  If this option is taken up it would mean that there are three timepoints in the low GI meal part (8am, 8pm and 1200 midnight)

Part two has an opt in to undertaking a third postprandial meal challenge at midnight</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Incremental area under the curve for glucose response will be the primary outcome measure for both parts of the study but data will not be compared between parts one and two  as the starting carbohydrate load is not equivalent. Glucose response over the postprandial period will be estimated using incremental area under the response curve (iAUC). The iAUC will be calculated by the trapezoid rule, which ignores the area beneath the fasting level.. Insulin response (secondary outcome) will be assessed as iAUC as per glucose but only in part two if the study (not collected in part one). 
Due to the small sample size required for this study, all data will be reported as median (interquartile range), except for the postprandial glucose and insulin time course graphs which will be presented as mean +/- SEM. Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used used to determine the difference in 1) iAUC, 2) concentration at the end of postprandial period occasion and 3) fasting level, between morning and night occasions. Statistical significance was considered at p&lt;0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 21.0, IBM Corp., New York).  

Nine participants were required, to provide 80% power and detect a mean difference of 15% in glucose concentration (total area under response curve) at an alpha value of 0.05. Sample size calculations were based on data from a study (Al-Naimi et al, 2004) that administered meals at 1300h (day time point) and at 0100h (night time point).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is some evidence to suggest that the timing of a meal intake directly impacts postprandial insulin and glucose responses with meals consumed later during the day being more metabolically detrimental that the same meals consumed during the day.  This information is particularly pertinent to the 16% of people employed in shift-work professions in Australia who have little choice but to eat during the late evening and overnight.   The purpose of this study, therefore,  is twofold.  We propose to compare postprandial glucose and insulin responses following 1) an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the morning and in the evening followed by 2) a meal low in GI (glycaemic index) in the morning and the evening in healthy adults.   These studies will enable us to confirm differences in metabolic functioning after eating at different times during the day using a standard test (OGTT) and then whether  provision of a meal (low GI), thought to reduce postprandial insulin and glucose , will improve the unavoidable consequences of  of eating at night on postprandial insulin and glucose.  </summary>
