  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the introduction of the new, age appropriate observation charts on wards 4A and 4B with the ability to record an early warning score and an associated education package. 4 month trial in 2009.
The charts will be completed by nursing staff in the clinical inpatient areas when vital signs are done. The chart is different based on the age of the child, &lt; 3months, 3-11 months, 1-4 years, 5-11 years, 12-17 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>4 month control period retrospectively in 2008. This information will be collected retrospectively from medical records. It will compare the documentation on the old observation charts with the new charts as well as what actions were taken if there was a deterioration.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early warning scores may be used to identify an individuals deterioration by combining clinical parameters into a single score. Early warning scores compliment clinical decision making and assist in communication between health care professionals. 

The application of a Paediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) has the potential to identify the deteriorating child early and allow more time for intervention. This may make adverse outcomes less likely or reduce their severity.  In this study new, age appropriate observation charts will be introduced into wards 4A and 4B at The Canberra Hospital. These charts will be used to calculate and record a paediatric early warning score for each child. High scores will automatically prompt the bedside nurse to call an appropriately qualified practitioner for timely review of the patient. This is expected to initiate earlier management.</summary>
