  <interventions>
    <interventions>A double-blind placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial of a 96-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion of flumazenil 16 mg (approx. 167mcg/hr) for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. 
Arm 1: 96-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion of flumazenil 16 mg (approx. 167mcg/hr) plus oral diazepam 10-20 mg hourly as required. The requirement for diazepam will be determined by patient carers using the CIWA-Ar scale as follows; no diazepam to be given for a score less than or equal to 7, diazepam 10 mg for a score between 8 and 14 inclusive and diazepam 20 mg for a score of 15 or higher.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: 96-hour continuous subcutaneous infusion of flumazenil 16 mg (approx. 167mcg/hr) with oral placebo capsules as required
Arm 3: 96-hour continuous subcutaneous placebo infusion with oral diazepam 10-20 mg hourly as required
The requirement for diazepam will be determined by patient carers using the CIWA-Ar scale as follows; no diazepam to be given for a score less than or equal to 7, diazepam 10 mg for a score between 8 and 14 inclusive and diazepam 20 mg for a score of 15 or higher.
Placebo subcutaneous infusions contain 0.9% sodium chloride saline and placebo oral capsules contain microcrystalline cellulose.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined by power calculations which were based on  CIWA-Ar scores previously reported by studies of alcohol withdrawal treatment using diazepam and flumazenil. 

Data from the study will be analysed using SPSS. 1-way between-subjects ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis will be used to compare benzodiazepine/placebo consumption, CIWA-Ar scores, alcohol craving, sleep quality and anxiety between the three treatment groups at each time point and to compare differences across the duration of treatment and follow-up.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol detoxification is associated with a myriad of withdrawal symptoms ranging from headaches and nausea to anxiety and potential seizures. Typically relief for these withdrawal symptoms involves treatment with benzodiazepines, which come with their own set of associated risks. Benzodiazepines have a high potential for dependence as well as cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Flumazenil, conventionally viewed as a benzodiazepine antagonist with agonist actions having been observed at low doses, has demonstrated potential as a management tool to assist both alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose flumazenil infusion administered subcutaneously as an option for detoxification from alcohol. It will also explore the role of flumazenil-assisted alcohol withdrawal in maintaining abstinence post-withdrawal.</summary>
