  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cpn10 25 mg subcutaneous injection twice per week for 72 weeks
Cpn10 75 mg subcutaneous injection twice per week for 72 weeks
The dose of Cpn10 may be escalated from 25mg to 75mg twice per week, after the first 4 weeks of the study, if the participant shows a response.  The investigator may taper concurrent RA treatments after 3 months on study if hte participant is continuing with a good response to Cpn10</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of participants maintaining an ACR20 response (at least a 20% improvement in core disease measures according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria).  The ACR20 is a standard measure used in clinical trials in RA.  Outcomes measured to assess the improvement include tender and swollen joint counts assessed by physical examination by a health care professional, the participant's assessment  of disease activity and pain on a scale of 0 to 100, the health care professional's assessment of disease activity on a scale of 0 to 100, the participant's assessment of functional disability by a questionnaire and a laboratory test for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of participants maintaining an ACR50 response (at least a 50% improvement in core disease measures according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria).  Assessments and methods used to make the assessments are identical to the ACR20.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will provide ongoing supply of Cpn10 for people with RA who have participated in an earlier 6 month trial with Cpn10.  Many treatments for RA lose their effectiveness over time and are associated with side effects that limit their use.  The primary purpose of this study is to establish if Cpn10 is safe and effective in RA over a long period.</summary>
