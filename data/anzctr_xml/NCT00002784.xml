  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. It
      is not yet known if high-dose combination chemotherapy plus peripheral stem cell
      transplantation is more effective than standard combination chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare high-dose combination chemotherapy plus
      peripheral stem cell transplantation with standard combination chemotherapy in treating women
      with stage II or stage III breast cancer.</summary>
