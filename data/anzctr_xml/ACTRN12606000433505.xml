  <interventions>
    <interventions>Palifermin 60mcg/kg/day intravenous bolus, for 3 consecutive days before and 3 consecutive days after melphalan. Palifermin is given for 3 consecutive days prior to and 3 consecutive days after Stem Cell infusion. Take the stem cell infusion day as day 0, Palifermin is given on days -5, -4, -3. Melphalan is given on day -1, and Palifermin is given again on day +1, +2, +3. Melphalan dose escalating from starting dose of 220 mg/m2 given as an intravenous bolus. Each patient is given one dose of high dose Melphalan as conditioning prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplant. Stage 1 of this trial is to establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and so each cohort of patients will be given one dose each, and doses will be escalated cohort by cohort until MTD is reached. Pegfilgrastim 6mg by subcutaneous injection one day after stem cell infusion.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the maximum tolerated dose of intravenous melphalan when it is used in combination with palifermin for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who fail to achieve complete remission with pre-transplant induction therapy.  The occurrence of 2 grade 4 toxicities within a 4 or 8 person cohort will establish the MTD as the dose level below that cohort's dose level.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be observed for 4 weeks post transplant to identify any grade 4 non-haematological toxicity.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the complete response rate achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of intravenous melphalan when it is used in combination with palifermin for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who fail to achieve either 1) partial remission or 2) complete remission with pre-transplant induction therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the rate of neutrophil engraftment following high-dose melphalan conditioned autologous stem cell transplant in patients with multiple myeloma being treated with palifermin. </outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease response will be measured at 3months post transplant when a bone marrow, biochemistry and serum and urine paraprotein assessments will be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neutrophil engraftment will be monitored with daily blood counts, post transplant until engraftment (neutrophils greater than 0.5x10^9/L) is established.</outcome>
