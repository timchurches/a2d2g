  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this randomized prospective study, 20 evaluable patients  scheduled for hepatic resection at a university hospital, will be included. The treatment group receives continuous insulin infusion (1 U/ml) to obtain near normoglycemia (n=10)at the start of anesthesia, the control group receive intermittent insulin when needed (B-glu greater than 200 mg/l). The insulin infusion is stopped at the end of the surgery. A pre- and postoperative hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp with isoptope tracer infusion will be performed in addition with tissue samples from muscle and liver to evulate postoperative insulin resistance.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Continuous intravenous insulin infusion to receive near normoglycemia is compared to the standard treatment (i.e. intermittent intravenous infusion if B-glu&gt;200 g/l)

    <statisticalmethods>Previous similar study using same number of patients showed significant reduction of insulin resistance during surgery. 2 group powertest with difference between groups of 24,9%, SD 15,5 and 16,2% respectively, with p&lt;0,05 and a power of 80% gives a group size of 6 patients. Normality assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. 
Data normality distribution are given as means+/- SD. Non-parametric data values are given as median (IQR). When applicable Students t-test ,ANOVA, Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgery induces a form of diabetes, characterized by elevated blood glucose as a result of insulin resistance. A high glucose is a risk for postoperative infections and cardiovascular events. A normalisation of blood glucose  improves both morbidity and mortality. This has been demonstrated in critically ill patients and during operation, especially in cardiovascular surgery. Insulin resistance can be modulated for example by the size of surgery, normalisation of glucose and adequate pain management. The changes observed in deprived insulin sensitivity can derive from the liver where glucose is produced or from peripheral tissues where glucose is metabolised. To understand the metabolic changes during operation insulin resistance is measured, and to discriminate the localisation of insulin resistance, a tracer infusion is used in addition to a hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp. In this randomized prospective study patients scheduled for liver resection are treated to near normoglycemia using insulin infusion or standard treatment with intermittent insulin and differences between the groups in insulin resistance are measured.
