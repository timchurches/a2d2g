    <interventions>Aerobic Exercise and Consecutive Task-specific Training 

The intervention will be delivered 3 days per week for 10 weeks. 

Aerobic Exercise (30 minutes)
The aerobic exercise is performed on an upright or semi-recumbent cycle ergometer (depending on individual ability and impairment). Participants will perform 4Ã—4-minute intervals of high-intensity exercise (85% of HRpeak) with a 3-minute active recovery (70% of HRpeak) period between each interval per 30 minute session. In the last 15 seconds of each interval heart rate (via a polar heart rate monitor) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be recorded in the exercise logs by research assistants, along with watts, cadence and actual duration of exercise achieved. The aerobic exercise will be supervised by a physiotherapist. 

Task-specific Training (60 minutes, performed immediately after aerobic exercise)
The task-specific training comprises of breaking down everyday skills into functional components that maintain a strong resemblance to the original skill itself. Task prescription will consider individual goals and appropriate exercises are then selected from an upper limb rehabilitation manual containing 142 predefined activities and movements (Cunningham et al. 2015). The difficulty of each component exercise is graded, reviewed and progressed according to the individual ability of the participant, with the aim of completing between 100-300 repetitions per session. If necessary, participants initially train on component movements of a skill until each component is mastered, and then combined into their original sequence to perform the whole skill, or as much of the whole skill as possible. Participants are encouraged to use different objects that vary in terms of shape, size and texture to ensure variability of training. Task-specific training will be supervised by a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. Participants will also be provided with an individually-prescribed task-specific training programme to practice at home for 60 minutes, 3 times per week. 

Any variations to intervention protocol will be recorded in the participant training diaries by the researcher supervising the session and adherence to the home-based practice will be self-reported once a week. Compliance will be determined as the number of training sessions attended and time spent actively training relative to the total prescribed. Rate of retention will be measured as the per cent of participants who complete the intervention relative to the number randomised.

Adverse Events (AE) will be defined as any untoward or unfavourable medical occurrence including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research. An example of a possible serious adverse event would be a fall. 

Serious Adverse Event (SAE) will be defined as any adverse event that 1) results in death, 2) is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, 3) requires or prolongs hospitalisation, 4) causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 5) results in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or 6) is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards. An example of a possible serious adverse event would be a Cardiac Event. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimation was based on detecting the MCID (minimum clinically important difference) in the ARAT and was performed using G*Power and resulted in a group size of 20 participants per group, to detect a difference of 0.85 standard deviations at the significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.8. To account for possible loss to follow-up, an additional 20% will be recruited, resulting in a group size of 24 and a total number of participants of 48. 

As this is primarily a feasibility study to test the levels of recruitment and retention of participants, and completeness of data that can be expected within a definitive multi-centre trial, there will be no formal statistical testing, and results will instead be summarised using descriptive statistics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arm/hand dysfunction after stroke is a common (85% of stroke survivors), disabling and persistent problem which contributes to poor well-being and quality of life and is rated as a top ten research priority in stroke by both survivors and their carers. Neuroplasticity is the term used to describe the ability of our brain to change, make new connections and re-wire itself in response to internal and external demands and stimuli. Evidence suggests that aerobic exercise can facilitate neuroplasticity by increasing the number of and connections between brain cells, increasing the release of various neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in the brain) and nerve growth factors, and stimulating the formation of new blood vessels necessary for neuronal growth. Due to the positive effects of aerobic exercise on neuroplasticity, it has been suggested that it could be utilised to improve the efficacy of rehabilitation programs by priming the brain prior to the delivery of therapy. Our study explores the feasibility of using Aerobic Exercise and Consecutive Task-specific Training (AExaCTT) to investigate whether the addition of aerobic exercise enhances the efficacy of task-specific training to improve arm/hand motor function after stroke. </summary>
