  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Possible Drug-Related Adverse Events - Adverse Events reported by the Investigator and judged by the Investigator to be possibly related to study drug, categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA), were reported. ECG, electrocardiogram. QTc (corrected QT interval) and QT represent intervals on an ECG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment period (weeks 1-12) and Post Treatment (=1 day after last time study drug)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigator Evaluations of Electrocardiogram (ECG) Results - ECGs were transmitted to an independent cardiologist who was responsible for providing interpretation of the ECG as either normal or abnormal (based on personal assessment). The investigator was then responsible for determining the clinical significance of the abnormal ECG in the context of the participants' history and clinical presentation. An abnormal, clinically significant ECG included, but was not limited to: prolonged QT interval, ischemic changes, ventricular hypertrophy, intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and clinically significant arrhythmias. PD, premature discontinuation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Week 12</timepoint>

      <outcome>Clinically Significant Unfavorable ECGs at Week 12 - Post-randomization ECGs categorized by the primary investigator as no change, significant change (favorable), significant change (unfavorable) from the ECG performed at Visit 1 (Baseline) are presented. Significant change (favorable) includes any ECG that improved from baseline, whereas significant change (unfavorable) includes any ECG that worsened from baseline. Clinical significance is determined by the primary investigator.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular Adverse Events Reported During Treatment Period - Cardiovascular Adverse Events, as categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA), reported during Treatment Period.

      <timepoint>5 Days after Week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Asthma Exacerbations: Worsening of Asthma Requiring Emergency Intervention, Hospitalization, or Treatment With Asthma Medications Prohibited by the Protocols - The Primary Investigator determined the severity of the exacerbation based on the participant's clinical presentation and the investigator's understanding of the disease, the participant, and his or her clinical experiences. The severity of the exacerbation was not defined in the protocol. Mild: Usually treated at home. Prompt relief with inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Possible short course of oral systemic corticosteroids. Moderate: Usually requires office or emergency department visit. Relief with frequent inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Oral systemic corticosteroids; some symptoms last for 1-2 days after treatment begins. Severe: Usually requires emergency department visit and likely hospitalization. Partial relief with frequent inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist. Oral systemic corticosteroids; some symptoms last for more than 3 days after treatment begins. Adjunctive therapies are helpful.</outcome>
