  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) develops in one to ten per cent of
      transplant recipients and can be EBV-associated. To improve long-term efficacy after
      rituximab monotherapy and to avoid the toxicity of CHOP seen in first-line treatment, the
      investigators initiated an international multicentre phase II trial to test whether the
      subsequent application of rituximab and four courses of three-weekly CHOP would improve the
      outcome of patients with PTLD: PTLD-1, sequential treatment (ST).</summary>
