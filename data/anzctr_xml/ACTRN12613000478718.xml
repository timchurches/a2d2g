  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard physiotherapy (1.5 hours) and virtual reality(VR) balance games (0.5 hours), 2 sessions per week of for 6 continuous weeks). A group exercise therapy conducted by a physiotherapist. This session comprised of self stretching exercises, strengthening exercises using strap-on weights and therabands, coordination and balance exercises such as standing on a foam and ball passing in multi directions; functional exercises such as sit to stand; and endurance training such as walking. 
After this group therapy , the experimental group received 30 minutes of VR balance games in addition to 1.5 hours of standard group exercise therapy. The VR games performed were Balance Bubble using NintendoÂ® Wii Fit Plus with Balance board and Rally Ball using Xbox 360 Kinect for 15 minutes each. These games were selected as they resembled dynamic balance exercises performed in standard exercise therapy. Participants were allowed a practice session before the first therapy session for familiarisation. A therapy assistant supervised the participants performing the VR games on a one to one basis. Progression was based on the participants performance progressing to a more difficult and advanced levels on the Balance Bubble game. Participants who scored a gold medal on the Rally ball game were progressed to Reflex Ridge game on Xbox 360 Kinect. </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria  from 2 Stroke community rehabilitation centers (Center A and B). All participants who met the criteria were enrolled in the study after they provided consent to participate. The participants from one center (A) received standard physiotherapy and VR balance games. Participants from the other center (B) received only standard physiotherapy.  </concealment>
