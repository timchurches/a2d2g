  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive bias modification (CBM) delivered via the internet over 12 months: 3 sessions/week during first 4 weeks, 2/week up for an additional 4 weeks, then 1/week up to week 26, once per fortnight up to week 38, and once per month up to week 52. 

Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of 2 treatment arms: sham or active CBM. CBM sessions will be delivered over a period of 52 weeks (1 year): three times per week for the first 4 weeks, twice weekly for the next 4 weeks (up to week 8), once weekly for the next 18 weeks (up to week 26), once per fortnight for the next 12 weeks, and once per month for the remainder of the follow up period (up to week 52). This delivery schedule is designed to achieve rapid bias modification though initially intensive training, while also encouraging maintenance of the resulting cognitive change through sustained exposure to CBM across an extended period, and by phasing out rather than abruptly terminating the intervention. Each CBM session will be of 40-minute duration, and will be accessed through a password-protected internet site. They will deliver CBM designed to reduce attention to negative information (CBM-A, 20 minutes) and to reduce the negative interpretation of ambiguous stimuli (CBM-I, 20 minutes). On each session, participants will be presented with a pair of emotionally-toned facial images (sad vs neutral or happy) for 500 ms, which will then be replaced by a small white probe (vertical or horizontal line), appearing in the screen position previously occupied by one of these stimuli. Participants will be instructed to use their keyboards to indicate the orientation of this probe as quickly as possible ('V' for vertical, 'H' for horizontal). The probe will then disappear and will be replaced, after 1 second, by another stimulus pair that will commence the next trial. The time to discriminate probe identity will be recorded automatically. In the active CBM-A condition all probes will appear in the opposite screen area from that of the negative stimulus (avoid negativity), while in the control condition probes will appear equally often in the area of the negative and non-negative stimuli. The second half of each 40-minute session will deliver CBM-I using single words and short textual scenarios as ambiguous stimuli. On each trial this ambiguous stimulus will first be presented (e.g. word growth), followed, 500 ms later, by a fragment of a word that is semantically consistent with one or other meaning of the preceding ambiguity (e.g., t_mour or gr_ater). Participants will be instructed to complete this fragment to yield a word consistent with the meaning of the initial word or sentence, using their keyboard to enter the letter missing from the fragment. The time to solve the word fragments will be recorded automatically. In the active CBM-I condition all fragments will yield only words consistent with non-negative interpretations of the preceding ambiguity, while in the control CBM-I condition fragments will equally often yield words consistent with the negative and non-negative interpretation of this ambiguity. A large bank with thousands of faces, words and textual scenarios that have already been used in other studies is available, and the computer programs are ready for use.

Adherence will be monitored via CBM login log records and the number of completed sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each CBM session will last approximately 40 minutes (20 minutes CBM-A and 20 minutes CBM-I). They will be delivered via the internet over a period of 12 months: 3 sessions/week during first 4 weeks, 2 sessions/week up for an additional 4 weeks (up to week 8), then 1 session/week up to week 26, then 1 session per fortnight up to week 38, and finally 1 session/month up to week 52.

Control sessions will have exactly the same format, duration and sets of stimuli, but the activity will not be systematically avoid negative stimulus or interpretation.</comparator>

    <concealment>We will use the electoral roll of WA to approach a random sample of adults aged 45 years or over. They will be advised about the aims of the study and will be invited to complete a brief questionnaire to determine eligibility. Those who screen positive will undergo a subsequent interview over the phone to confirm eligibility, and those deemed eligible will receive a username and password to access the study website. A computer-generated table of random numbers derived from random blocks ranging in size will assign participants to the active or control interventions. The random list of numbers will be generated and maintained centrally by the Centre for Software Practice of the University of Western Australia. The allocation of participants to the active or control CBM will be done automatically by the computer, which will link study identification numbers (which users require to log into the study website) to either the active or control groups. Participants will not be advised of their group assignment, nor will any of the investigators. The study code will be broken only once all data points from the last participant in the study have been collected and the data analysed.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We will use means and standard deviations to describe continuous variables with normal distribution, medians and inter-quartile ranges for ranked variables, and frequency tables for categorical variables. We will evaluate the primary endpoint of the study by considering the proportion of participants showing evidence of clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 equal or greater than 15 or major depression) during follow up. We will analyse the data as panel data and will include all available information in the analysis (intention-to-treat). We will use mixed models (xtmixed) to estimate changes in PHQ-9 scores over time. We have not planned interim analyses because the intervention is safe and participation is limited in time. Alpha will be set at 5% or less and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for effect estimates. We will use xtlogit to analyses other secondary endpoints. 

Currently available data show that about 10% of adults with subsyndromal symptoms of depression will develop a major depressive episode over the following 12 months. We anticipate that CBM will be associated with an absolute risk reduction of major depression of 5% over this period of time and that 15% of participants will be lost during follow up. Consequently, we will aim to recruit 510 adults (255 in each treatment arm) with subsyndromal symptoms of depression into the study (80 of whom are expected to be lost at random during follow up). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has found that people with subsyndromal depression, (those who have symptoms of depression but do not meet criteria for clinical depression), are significantly more likely to develop clinical depression within one year compared to those without subsyndromal depression. Research has shown that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the most successful psychological intervention to treat depression to date. The theory behind CBT for depression suggests that depressed people have more difficulty than non-depressed people keeping their attention away from negative stimuli and are also more likely to interpret vague and unclear stimuli in a negative way. Research has shown that people at risk of developing depression, including those with subsyndromal depression, also seem to display this attentional bias to negative information.

Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) is a relatively new therapeutic technique that aims to shift dysfunctional biased beliefs through using a computer based program. Recent research using the CBM approach has been promising in reducing symptoms of depression. However it is unknown how effective CBM is in preventing clinical depression from developing in those with subsyndromal depression. 

Therefore this study aims to determine if CBM decreases the 1-year onset of a major depressive episode among adults with subsyndromal depression.
