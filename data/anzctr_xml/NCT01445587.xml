Experimental: GSK2110183 - The oral dose of GSK2110183 the subjects received will be dependent on when the subject is enrolled to the study. GSK2110183 will be provided in 25mg and 50mg capsules containing the hydrochloride salt form of the API, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose (optional). They are filled into hard gelatin capsules. The 25mg tablets are opaque, swedish orange, size 2 capsules with no external markings, filled with a white powder. The 50mg tablets are opaque, white, size 1 capsules with no external markings, filled with a white powder.

Other: Bortezomib - Bortezomib salvage therapy will be administered as a 3 to 5 second intravenous (IV) push at 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 in each 21-day cycle until one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria is met.


Treatment: drugs: Part 1; Cohort 1
On Cycle 0, Day -3, three subjects will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 125mg GSK2110183. After the 72 hour PK sampling is completed, the subjects will continue the 125mg GSK2110183 dose daily for 21 day cycles. If none of the 3 subjects experience one of the DLTs listed in the protocol during Cycle 1, the dose will be escalated to 150mg GSK2110183 for the subject enrolled to Cohort 2. Alternately, if 1 subject reports a DLT, then 3 more subjects will be enrolled at the same dose. If 2 of 6 subjects report a DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded. Subjects will remain on study until they meet one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria.

Treatment: drugs: Part 1; Cohort 2
For Cohort 2, on Cycle 0, Day -3, three subjects will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 150mg GSK2110183. After the 72 hour PK sampling is completed, the subjects will continue the 150mg GSK2110183 dose daily for 21 day cycles. If none of the 3 subjects experience one of the DLTs listed in the protocol during Cycle 1, the MTD will be determined unless the PK and Pharmacodynamic data indicates another dose level should be evaluated. Alternately, if 1 subject reports a DLT, then 3 more subjects will be enrolled at the same dose. If 2 of 6 subjects report a DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded. Subjects will remain on study until they meet one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria.

Treatment: drugs: Part 2; Stage 1
Following the completion of PK sampling and the determination of a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of GSK2110183 in Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will be enrolled into Part 2, Stage 1 of the study. Twenty subjects will be enrolled in Stage 1. If no subject responds, the study will be stopped; otherwise, the study will continue enrollment of Stage 2.

Treatment: drugs: Part 2, Stage 2
Twenty subjects will be enrolled in Part 2, Stage 2. If 4 or fewer of the 40 subjects (Stages 1 and 2) respond, the study will not be deemed as a success for GSK2110183 monotherapy. However, those subjects meeting the criteria for progression (as defined by IMWC Panel 1) who also meet the additional eligibility criteria for salvage therapy may proceed to GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy. GSK2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy will be continued until one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria is met

        equal to 200 mg/24 hours Serum free light chain (FLC) assay: involved FLC level greater
        than or equal to 10 mg/dL (greater than or equal to 100 mg/L) and a serum FLC ratio outside
        of normal range. Biopsy proven plasmacytoma

          -  Relapsed after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy including at least one proteasome
             inhibitor (i.e., bortezomib, carfilzomib) and at least one immunomodulatory agent
             (i.e., lenalidomide, pomalidomide) AND refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy.
             Subjects will be considered refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy if they
             experienced stable disease or progressive disease as the best response on their last
             proteasome inhibitor containing therapy OR progressed within 60 days following two or
             more cycles of proteasome inhibitor therapy. A line of therapy is generally separated
             by disease progression from a preceding line of therapy; therefore, the preparative
             regimen (with or without total body irradiation) and subsequent autologous stem cell
             rescue used for an autologous stem cell transplant are considered as one line of
             therapy.

          -  Subjects with a history of autologous stem cell transplant are eligible for study
             participation provided the following eligibility criteria are met:

        Transplant was more than 100 days prior to study enrolment No active infection Subject
        meets the remainder of the eligibility criteria

          -  Performance status score of 0 to 2 according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG).

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Fasting serum glucose less than126 mg/dL (&lt;7 mmol/L). Subjects diagnosed previously
             with diabetes mellitus type 2 must also meet the additional following criteria:

        Diagnosis of diabetes greater than 6 months prior to enrollment Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c
        (HbA1c) less than 8% at screening

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of the following:

        blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone greater than 40 MlU/ml and
        estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory. Females on hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use
        one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT
        during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
        post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4
        weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
        depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single arm, open-label, Phase Ib/II study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of the oral AKT inhibitor, GSK2110183, when administered to
      subjects with proteasome inhibitor refractory multiple myeloma (MM). During Part 1 of the
      study, GSK2110183 will be administered to subjects in sequential Pharmacokinetic (PK) Cohorts
      on a continuous daily dosing schedule in 21-day cycles until one of the Treatment
      Discontinuation Criteria is met. The PK Cohorts will characterize the PK of GSK2110183 in
      plasma and urine as well as determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of GSK2110183. The
      RP2D will be that dose that provides adequate PK exposure and biologic activity without
      exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in MM subjects as defined in the current study. In
      Part 2 of the study, the RP2D will be further evaluated using a flexible 2-stage design with
      a stopping rule to allow for early termination based on lack of efficacy at the end of Stage
      1. The first stage will accrue 20 subjects who will receive GSK2110183 at the RP2D. If a
      clinical response is observed in at least 1 subject in Stage 1, the study will proceed to
      Stage 2 and 20 additional subjects will be enrolled. GSK2110183 will be administered in Part
      2 (Stage 1 and Stage 2) on a continuous daily dosing schedule in 21 day cycles until
      International Myeloma Working Group criteria for progression are met, at which point the
      subject will proceed to GSK 2110183 + bortezomib salvage therapy provided they meet the
      additional eligibility criteria for this phase of the study. GSK2110183 and bortezomib will
      be continued until one of the Treatment Discontinuation Criteria is met.

      Exploratory PK/PD analyses may be performed to examine the potential relationships between
      GSK2110183 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.</summary>
