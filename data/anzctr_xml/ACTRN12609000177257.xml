  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>This trial will be available to all women planning confinement at the Launceston General Hospital (LGH) over a period of 18-24 months.  Pregnant women who are anaemic with Hb level &lt;116g/L  and 18 year old and above are eligible for this study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>It is proposed that pregnant women noted to be anaemic will be invited to participate in the study after the first trimester by the midwife, who will explain in details the aims and objectives of the study. If the patient agree to be enrolled in the study, a written consent form contain all information about the study will be given to the patients to sign and retain a copy for themselves as a reference. Patients can withdraw from the study at anytime without any adverse impact of any kind on their treatment at the Launceston General Hospital (LGH). Central randomisation by computer will follow thereafter.</concealment>
    <sequence>If the patients agree to participate in the trial, randomisation will follow in different department by the Pharmacy clinical trial personnel where a special computer programme will assign the treatment in random fashion without influence of treating team. This is usually conducted in blocks until full recruitment occurs.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date, limited data is available regarding the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) during pregnancy in Australia, or the comparative efficacy of intravenous (IV) iron versus oral iron therapy in pregnant women. 
 
Patients and Method: At the Launceston General Hospital we prospectively investigating pregnant women with full blood count (FBC) and iron studies at the first or second antenatal visit.  

Among those, patients with iron deficiency anaemia, will be recruited to a prospective randomised trial to determine whether intravenous iron therapy (iron polymaltose) is superior to oral iron (ferrous sulphate 250 mg) for the management of IDA associated with pregnancy. 

Our perliminary data indicate that iron deficiency is a common finding during pregnancy in the northern Tasmanian population, and intravenous iron therapy appears a safe and effective treatment in this cohort of patients.</summary>
