  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of a new drug called PI-88,
      when used in combination with an approved chemotherapy drug called dacarbazine, in the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma.

      PI-88 blocks new blood vessel growth in tumours (starves it of nutrients) and dacarbazine
      stops the cancer cells from growing. The results from this study will be analysed to see if
      it is worthwhile for the two drugs to be tested in future studies involving larger numbers of
      melanoma patients.</summary>
