  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional treatment used in the study is an intramedullary nail.  The implant is a short, interlocking intramedullary device that consists of a sliding lag screw, which passes through a short intramedullary nail.  The duration of the implant procedure is approximately 1 hour.  The implant is intended to remain in place permanently.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment used in the study is a sliding hip screw.  The screw consists of a lag screw passed up the femoral neck to the femoral head.  This lag screw is then attached to a plate on the side of the femur.  The duration of the implant procedure is approximately 1 hour.  The implant is intended to remain in place permanently.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.Adult men or women aged 18 years and older (with no upper age limit).

3.Low energy fracture (defined as a fall from standing height).
4.No other major trauma.
5.Patient was ambulatory prior to fracture, though they may have used an aid such as a cane or a walker.
6.Anticipated medical optimization of the patient for operative fixation of the proximal femur.
7.Operative treatment within 7 days after the trauma.(Operative treatment should take place as soon as possible as permitted by each institution's standard of care.)
8.Provision of informed consent by patient or proxy.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1.Associated major injuries of the lower extremity (i.e., ipsilateral and/or contralateral fractures of the foot, ankle, tibia, fibula, or knee; dislocations of the ankle, knee, or hip).
2.Retained hardware around the affected proximal femur.
3.Infection around the proximal femur (i.e., soft tissue or bone).
4.Patients with disorders of bone metabolism other than osteoporosis (i.e., Paget's disease, renal osteodystrophy, or osteomalacia).
5.Patients with Parkinson's disease severe enough to increase the likelihood of falling or severe enough to compromise rehabilitation.

9.Obesity in the judgment of the attending surgeon.

11.Patients with a previous history of frank dementia that would interfere with assessment of the primary outcome (i.e., EQ-5D at 1 year).
12.Likely problems, in the judgment of the Site Investigators, with maintaining follow-up. We will, for example, exclude patients with no fixed address, those who report a plan to move out of town in the next year, or intellectually challenged patients without adequate family support.
13.Patient is enrolled in another ongoing drug or surgical intervention trial.
14.If the attending surgeon believes that there is another reason to exclude this patient from INSITE. This reason will be documented on the case report forms (CRFs).</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients presenting to participating surgeons with a diagnosed trochanteric fracture
amenable to internal fixation will be screened. Such patients will be classified as:
1. Excluded (if they subsequently do not meet the eligibility criteria).
2. Missed (due to error).
3. Eligible and randomized (if applicable).
It is pertinent that all patients screened (including those who were missed or excluded) be
entered into the SmartManager Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System or reported to GRS.
The Clinical Site may enter an electronic Screening Form in the SmartManager EDC System for
each of these subjects, indicating that the subject has been missed or excluded. The Clinical
Site may also fax the paper Screening Form directly to GRS, or the monitor will work with the
Clinical Site to develop a method of regularly reporting this information via some mutually
agreeable reporting method.
If the participating Site Investigator identifies an eligible patient who consents to randomization,
the Site Investigator or delegate will use the online randomization system to randomize the
subject into one of two treatment arms. The Research Coordinator, or Site Investigator will
enter their unique subject prognostic variables for stratification. This procedure guarantees
concealed randomization.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will conceal allocation using a centralized 24-hour digital Internet randomization system
(EmPOWER Inc). To protect against prognostic imbalance between groups; we will use stratification
to ensure balance between intervention groups for several subject factors. We will stratify by the
following prognostic factors: 1) participating center; 2) fracture stability (stable versus unstable); and
3) age (18-50 years versus &gt;50 years).</sequence>
