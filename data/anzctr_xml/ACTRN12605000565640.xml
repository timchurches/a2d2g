  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is testing the efficacy of two blister prevention strategies on the Australian Army recruit population.  The first strategy is the use of a two-sock system using polyester and polypropelene socks. Recruits will be randomly assigned to one of four groups.  Group 1 will be given a polyester liner sock with the current army standard sock, Group 2 will be given the polyester liner with the polypropelene sock, Group 3 the  polyproplene sock alone.  The second intervention is tying off the army boots at the ankle height before continuing the lacing further up the boot.  Half the subjects in each group will be randomly selected to tie the laces below the ankle and the other half will lace as usual.  The study will continue until approximately 600 recruits have been recruited for the study.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the presence of blisters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured within 24 hours of a route march and at foot inspection times evenly spaced throughout training. The results of these will be compared between the four sock groups and two lacing systems to identify the combinations that best prevent blisters and minor skin irritations.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate blister severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured within 24 hours of a route march and at foot inspection times evenly spaced throughout training. The results of these will be compared between the four sock groups and two lacing systems to identify the combinations that best prevent blisters and minor skin irritations.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate other minor skin irritations</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured within 24 hours of a route march and at foot inspection times evenly spaced throughout training. The results of these will be compared between the four sock groups and two lacing systems to identify the combinations that best prevent blisters and minor skin irritations.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship between the blister rates and skin irritations and ambient temperature, humidity and subject body weight.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The temperature and humidity readings will be taken hourly during training time using a Wet Bulb Globe Temperature apparatus.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship between blister formation and the likelihood of injury.</outcome>
