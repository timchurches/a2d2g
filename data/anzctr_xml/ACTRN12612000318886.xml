  <interventions>
    <interventions>Problem solving treatment for primary care (PST-PC) is a manual driven psychological treatment that teaches problem-solving skills. It aims to help people with vision loss find practical solutions to vision-related problems, reduce avoidance behaviours and adopt a positive problem solving orientation. PST-PC will be delivered by PST specialists in eight weekly telephone sessions (30-45mins duration). Following the acute treatment sessions, monthly maintenance sessions with clients will be held over the phone (30-40mins duration) for 10 months following the acute treatment sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group are encouraged to accept a referral to their GP for more psychological assessment and intervention. 

All participants in each group will receive information about depression and have full access to all usual services and community-based services. A letter outlining the clients level of depressive symptoms and involvement in the study will be sent to the clients GP.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is very common in people with vision impairment and can lead to heightened levels of disability and functional decline. However only a minority of people with vision impairment gain access to psychological support services.  Together with Vision Australia and beyondblue we will examine the impact of different depression management options for people with vision loss.</summary>
