  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single-arm, multicenter, non-randomized open study that will include up to 100 study participants implanted with ACURATE neo Trademark and its Transfemoral Delivery
System. The study will collect data from study participants treated with the ACURATE neo Trademark and its Transfemoral Delivery System following standard TAVI practice at each participating center. All study participants will be followed to 12 months after the implant procedure. The study is divided into two periods:
1) Implantation procedure (immediately pre-implant to 24 hours post-procedure)
2) Follow-up period (discharge or 7 days, whichever occurs first, at 30 days and at 12
months)

Prior to implantation, the Bioprosthesis is carefully loaded onto the Delivery System using aspecially designed loading tool.
The Bioprosthesis is inserted into the femoral artery through a compatible introducer sheath and delivered retrograde to the implantation site using the Delivery System.
The Bioprosthesis is positioned and deployed over the stenotic, native aortic valve and the Delivery System is then removed. This minimally invasive transcatheter approach is intended to be performed under general or regional anesthesia as per the physicians standard of practice using sterile technique, with echocardiographic and fluoroscopic guidance for visualization.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to collect and monitor ongoing safety and performance data from commercial use of the ACURATE neo trademark Aortic Bioprosthesis, hereafter referred to as the ACURATE neo trademark, and ACURATE TF trademark Transfemoral Delivery System. 
The ACURATE neo trademark and its Transfemoral Delivery System are intended for use in minimally invasive, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using transfemoral access in study participants presenting with severe aortic valve stenosis.

Note, the ACURATE neo trademark and its Transfemoral Delivery System has been CE Marked and approved for sale in Europe. This study protocol is being implemented in Australia and is equivalent to the post market clinical follow-up plan study protocol developed by Symetis post European certification.
