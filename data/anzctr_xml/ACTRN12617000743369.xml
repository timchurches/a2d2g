    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be calculated for the total sample of the study and will be stratified by major grouping variables: organisation type, state, location, age, sex, ethnicity, diagnosis, functional status and outcomes.
Data collectors will judge ACP documentation to be present if they find any documentation of advance care planning (either statutory or non-statutory), or legal appointment of a substitute decision-maker. Presence of ACP documentation, such as ACDs and advance care plans will be described using the mode, frequency, and distribution of the respective categories. Comparisons will be made using t-tests for the continuous type variables and chi-square contingency table analysis for the categorical type variables.
Multivariate logistic regression will be performed, predicting the presence of ACP documentation while controlling for the type of organisation, jurisdictions, location, age, sex and ethnicity. In instances where data is missing, analysis will be performed using list-wise deletion. The level of significance will be set at 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Advance care planning (ACP) is a process between a person, their family/carer(s) and healthcare providers that supports adults at any age or stage of health in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding future medical care. The Australian government funds a number of national initiatives aimed at increasing ACP uptake, however there is currently no standardised Australian data regarding formal ACP documentation or self-reported uptake. This makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of ACP initiatives. This study aims to determine the prevalence of ACP and completion of Advance Care Directives (ACDs) in hospitals, aged care facilities and general practices. It will also explore peoples self-reported use of ACP, and views about the process.
Researchers will conduct a national multicentre cross-sectional prevalence study, consisting of a record audit and surveys of people over 65 years in three sectors, hospitals, general practices and aged care facilities. Up to 50 records from 48 participating Australian organisations will be audited (total of 2400 records). People whose records were audited, who speak English and have a decision-making capacity will be invited to complete a survey. Up to 50 people associated with each organisation (whose records have been audited) will be surveyed. The primary outcome measure will be the number of people who have formal or informal ACP documentation that can be located in records within 15 minutes. Other outcomes will include specific details of ACP documentation (including type and validity of document), and whether current clinical care plans are consistent with ACP documentation. People will be surveyed  to measure self-reported interest, uptake and use of ACP/ACDs.
