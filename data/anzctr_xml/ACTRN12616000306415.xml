  <interventions>
    <interventions>To evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of the Tempo 'Trademark' Temporary Pacing Lead to temporarily control cardiac rhythm. Temporary intracardiac (meaning "within the heart") pacing is when your heart rate or rhythm is regulated by an external pacing device that is attached to a pacing lead, which has been positioned within the heart. The pacing lead transmits information to the external pacing device about the heart's rate and rhythm. The pacing device can be programmed to deliver electrical impulses to the heart via the pacing lead in order to help regulate the rate or rhythm if required. A cardiologist places this device during a minimally invasive procedure lasting less than fifteen minutes in duration.

This type of temporary pacing is used on a short term basis only - usually for up to a few days only. For This device, it will not be used for more than 7 days. Should you need pacing for longer than 7 days, another commercially available pacing lead will be used.
