  <interventions>
    <interventions>Propofol and ketamine for sedation for Tranoesophageal Echocardiography followed by Cardioversion (TOE cardioversion).
1/ propofol 200mg and ketamine 40mg will be combined in the same syringe (propofol 10mg/ml, ketamine 2mg/ml).  After 25mcg of fentanyl intravenously (IV) 2-4mL boluses of the drug combination will be administered intravenously (IV) every 15-30 seconds according to clinical response.  Treatment in this method will be continued until sucessful cardioversion or abandoning of the procedure as decided by the treating cardiologist.
2/ Cardioversion will be external with pads placed by the cardiologist, usually antero-posterior (AP) positioning is used.  A single episode of care (with number of attempts at cardioversion determined by patient response) will be studied.</interventions>
