      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With SVR at 4 and 24 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR4 and SVR24) - SVR4 and SVR 24 were defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at 4 and 24 weeks after stopping study treatment, respectively.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Virologic Failure - Virologic failure was defined as:
On-treatment virologic failure:
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA = LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently = LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)
