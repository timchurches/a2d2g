  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were randomly assigned to an active stimulation group, or a placebo stimulation group. Mild, non-invasive, and not injurious manual stimulation was applied to an area of the limbs' surface (the skin), while patients lay on a clinic bed.Thereafter, the patients arose to rate pain level by means of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). 
To determine if the pain relief was durable, rating times varied from immediate to 60 minutes in various protocols. Patients in the Emergency Room test gave their evaluation, as soon as possible after the stimulation. The 10-min test protocol asked patients to determine pain relief at 0, 5 and 10 minutes, and the 60-min test protocol, at ten minutes intervals up to sixty minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the placebo stimulation, the manual stimulus was applied on the oppsite surface of the limbs, while patients lay on a clinic bed. Thereafter, the patients arose to rate pain level by means of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The allocation of patients was performed in each test center under the direction of the primary investigator using the method of Random Permuted Blocks for numberical designation to a placebo or treatment group. The random number designations were placed in envelopes. Following study enrollment by clinic staff, each patient blindly drew one. Then, the doctor or his assistant applied the treatment ascribed to the number the patient drew. The patients were blinded to the intervention's atribute as placebo or therapy.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine whether the manipulation will or will not significantly relieve clinical pain, and the durability of that relief. The study hypothesis was that a brief manual stimulation correctly applied to specific areas of skin (based on Traditional Chinese Medicine) could relief pain.</summary>
