          -  Pregnancy and women of child bearing potential who are not taking a medically accepted

          -  Breastfeeding.

          -  Known contra-indication or intolerance to the use of Escitalopram, Sertraline or
             Venlafaxine XR as defined in the product package insert for each drug (including
             previous treatment failure at the highest recommended dose).

          -  Use of any psychological or counselling therapy or antidepressant/CNS drug which
             cannot be washed out prior to participation and eliminated until after Week 8 or
             discontinuation.

          -  Use of any medication which is known to be contraindicated with Escitalopram,
             Sertraline, or Venlafaxine XR (refer to the product package insert for each drug).

          -  Known medical condition, disease or neurological disorder which might, in the opinion
             of investigator/s, interfere with the assessments to be made in the study or put
             subjects at increased risk when exposed to optimal doses of the drug treatment.

          -  History of head injury with loss of consciousness for at least 10 minutes.

          -  Recent/current substance dependence (as defined in Section K of the Mini Plus as per a
             6 months period and/or alcoholism) in the past six months.

          -  Participation in an investigational study within four months of the baseline visit in
             which subjects have received an experimental drug/device that could affect the primary
             end points of this study.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, have a severe impediment to vision,
             hearing and/or hand movement, which is likely to interfere with their ability to
             complete the test batteries.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are unable and/or unlikely to
             comprehend and follow the study procedures and instructions.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to identify genetic, physical (brain) and psychological (cognitive)
      markers (or combinations of them) that predict specific response to a range of
      antidepressants treatment (Escitalopram, Venlafaxine, Sertraline) in patients diagnosed with
      major depressive disorder. This study is focused on outcomes which may impact on how
      "personalised medicine" is implemented in depression.</summary>
