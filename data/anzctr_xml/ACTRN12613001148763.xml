  <interventions>
    <interventions>The subject will take Budesonide or Fluticasone intranasal spray, one spray each per nostril in a randomly allocated order in phase 1 of the study. They will be labelled as medication A and medication B. Budesonide spray to be used will be 32 micrograms per spray per nostril. Fluticasone spray to be used will be 27.5 micrograms per spray per nostril.
For phase 2, Medication A which will be one of the randomly allocated medications from phase 1, Budesonide or Fluticasone, will be used one spray per nostril daily for 4 weeks.
Wash- out periods between treatments will be in phase one. After taking Medication A, the participant will be instructed to have a sip of water, eat a biscuit, smell a swatch of wool and wait 20 minutes before taking Medication B, one of the randomly allocated medications, Budesonide or Fluticasone. The aim is to allow the senses to recover and start afresh for the second medication.  

</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two phases. In phase one it is a cross-over trial with subjects taking both medications, Budesonide or Fluticasone, in random order. The same participants will be involved in phase 2. Phase two is a randomised controlled trial comparing two medications, Budesonide and Fluticasone. In phase 2 the participant if willing will be asked to use Medication A, which will be randomly allocated Budesonide or Fluticasone as part of the treatment for their allergic rhinitis for 4 weeks. Medication B, again randomly allocated Budesonide or Fluticasone will be the comparator. If randomly allocated medication A is Budesonide then medication B will be Fluticasone and vice versa. All participants in phase 2 will take medication A, randomly allocated Budesonide or Fluticasone.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics (ENT, Respiratory clinics) at the Mater Childrenâ€™s Hospital. There will be posters about the study in these clinics. All participants will be required to provide informed written consent.

The subject and / or their parents (depending upon their age) will be asked to complete a basic demographic and clinical questionnaire . This includes a validated allergic rhinitis symptom severity score.

 For phase 1, the subject will take two medications in order, completing a questionnaire after each medication.

 A random number generator will be used to randomly allocate the order in which Budesonide or Fluticasone are taken. This allocation will be linked with a study number. The child and investigator will not be aware of the order until after informed consent is provided. After enrolment the investigator will open an opaque envelope to reveal the order in which the medications are to be given. 

In phase 2, the subject will take Medication A, which will be the randomly allocated Budesonide or Fluticasone from phase 1, for 4 weeks.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number generator will be used by a research assistant in random blocks which will be used for both phase 1 and 2 of the study.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measure of the study is overall preference of Medication 1 or 2. To detect a difference of 30% between the two medications, at a 5% significance value and 80% power, it has been calculated that a minimum of 98 subjects would be required. A total of 110 subjects will be recruited to allow for attrition. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allergic rhinitis (AR), or hayfever, is an allergic condition which is associated with inflammation of the lining of the nasal passages. It is associated with significant morbidity for a substantial proportion of children. 

International guidelines recommend intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) as first line treatment for persistent or moderate to severe intermittent allergic rhinitis.

From a childs point of view, nasal steroids may be associated with an unpleasant sensation without an obvious benefit. 

This study will compare fluticasone and budesonide inhaled corticosteroid in terms of taste, sensation, delivery and adherence in children aged 6-14 years.

Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics at the Mater Childrens Hospital. All participants will be required to provide informed written consent.

There are two parts to this study. 

The first part will see the sensory attributes and device preference. A random number generator will be used to randomly allocate the order in which Budesonide or Fluticasone are taken. 


The subject will spray Medication 1 into their nose as per the instructions provided and then complete Questionnaire for Medication 1.

The subject will be instructed to have a sip of water, eat a biscuit, smell a swatch of wool and wait 20 minutes before taking Medication 2 and then completing Questionnaire for medication 2.

The second part of the study will see short term adherence.

If the subject is willing to participate in Part 2 they will be asked to use Medication 1, for 4 weeks as part of the treatment for their allergic rhinitis. At the end of 4 weeks they will be asked to complete Questionnaire after 4 weeks of Medication 1 and send it and the Medication 1 bottle back to the investigators. The bottle will be weighed to estimate the amount of medication used.

The primary outcome measure of the study is overall preference of Medication 1 or 2.
