  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the relationship between weight and stress (cortisol metabolism). Specifically, in healthy and obese men and women we will firstly determine the optimum conditions for measuring cortisol, and compare and contrast differences between collection methods (ie. saliva, fasting blood and 24h urine). We will also obtain subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle biopsies to study cortisol metabolism in target tissues, and link these with differences in resting metabolic rate, body composition, stress, anxiety and depression and sleep quality, physical activity levels and previous weight history. We will also assess reproducibility between samples taken from each participant.  The duration of the study will be three weeks.  We will collect samples/ take each measurement up to three times during this period.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be expressed as means +/- standard error of the mean (SEM).  Results will be analysed using Students t test, paired t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedures where appropriate using GraphPad Prism software. Power is set to 80% and significance was accepted at P&lt; 0.05.   

Based on power calculations (Salivary cortisol Mean for Obese Women: 0.75 +/- 0.1, and Mean for Lean Women: 0.85 +/- 0.1; Mean for Obese Men: 0.85 +/-0.02, and Mean for Lean Men: 0.75 +/- 0.02) and clinical and experimental observation from pilot testing and experience the following participants will be required (N=22/group for Women and N=13/group for men) to achieve statistical significance between lean and obese subjects and assess reproducibility (inter and intra samples variation) for the parameters measured (in particular cortisol levels, tissue specific metabolism, resting  metabolic rate, which are the primary and secondary outcomes of the study).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dietary restriction (dieting) is the most popular method for weight loss and is commonly the first strategy prescribed for weight loss in treating obesity. However, dietary interventions are often ineffective because energy restriction triggers the so-called famine reaction, a survival mechanism used by the body in order to conserve energy in times of starvation. The famine reaction involves a series of metabolic and behavioural adaptations including compensatory changes in metabolic rate, appetite and neuroendocrine hormones as well as a loss in metabolically active lean tissue in order to reduce energy requirements. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms involved in the famine reaction or whether different dietary restriction interventions can alter this response leading to more efficient and sustained weight loss. Our research group has found that a novel intermittent diet approach results in greater weight loss, reduced levels of stress hormone cortisol in blood and attenuation of the famine reaction. 

It is well known that dieting is psychologically stressful, and there are strong connections between stress and weight control through elevations of cortisol. Cortisol promotes central adiposity (obesity) and muscle loss and may lead to reductions in metabolic rate. Cortisol also stimulates appetite and cravings for sweet and fatty foods.  For these reasons cortisol likely plays a major role in causing diet failure and resistance to weight loss. 

Therefore, one aspect of our study is to better understand the relationship between stress and weight loss. In order to investigate these, we firstly need to establish laboratory methods at Bond University and optimal conditions for measuring cortisol in lean healthy and obese humans.  These studies will then enable us to apply these skills and perform larger weight loss interventions. The information gained for these studies will provide a greater understanding on the underlying mechanisms involved in the famine reaction and why individuals with obesity struggle to achieve weight loss goals; thereby, leading to new therapeutic strategies to target obesity.
