    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Approximately 120 male and female subjects aged between 40-75 years of age will be recruited from databases and public media outlets. Following preliminary screening via telephone, potential subjects will attend the clinic for an information session and will be requested to provide their consent for inclusion in the trial. Consenting potential subjects will undergo a medical assessment including lifestyle, current medications, physical assessment and medical history; this data will be used for the comprehensive screening and to provide contextual data for the study.

The trial product is sent to already randomised and in numbered containers (001-120) so administering staff are blinded to allocation.

Once enrolled in the trial, participants will be randomly allocated to either the placebo comparator group (n=60) or the active intervention group (n=60). Enrolled participants will be allocated a sequential number from 0001 to 0100 determined by the order in which they are enrolled. Subjects will be allocated a (randomised) TPC that corresponds with their allocation number; for example, participant 0034 will receive TPC 0034.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation code used to identify TPCs is a sequential number (0001 to 00120) generated by the Random Allocation Software.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
Based on a 10mm improvement in pain (SD=15mm) compared to placebo as measured by the pain outcomes section on the WOMAC,  a total of 40 patients in each arm at final follow up is required for an 80% power.

Efficacy
The primary endpoint (WOMAC questionnaire responses at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks) will be analysed using an analysis of covariance, with baseline (pre-treatment) questionnaire scores as a covariate. Treatment arm will be represented by a factor n the analysis of covariance. Least squares means will be tabulated. Strict control of the family wise type one error rate for multiple time points will be maintained using Holms adjustment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), also known as N-(2-hydroxyethyl) hexadecanamide or N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-palmitamide is an endogenous saturated fatty acid derivative. 

This study aims to investigate the effects of PEA on pain and quality of life in subjects with mild to moderate osteoarthritis and is designed with two active group arms and one placebo arm.  The two active group dosages of 300mg and 600mg per day of PEA are similar to dosages used in other studies. The primary outcome measure is the WOMAC OA Index questionnaire.  The participant group includes otherwise healthy men and women aged between 40 and 65 years.</summary>
