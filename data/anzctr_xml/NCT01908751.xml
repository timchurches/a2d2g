    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Sliding Hip Screw
Treatment: surgery - Cancellous Screws
Treatment: drugs - Vitamin D
Treatment: drugs - Vitamin D Placebo

Experimental: Sliding Hip Screw and Vitamin D supplementation - Participants allocated to the vitamin D Group will be given a six-month supply of vitamin D3 supplementation. Participants in the vitamin D Group will receive a bottle of 2,000 International Units (IU) vitamin D3 drops (Ddrops®, Ddrops Company). Participants will be instructed to take two drops daily for six months, for a total daily dose of 4,000 IU.

Experimental: Sliding Hip Screw and Vitamin D placebo - Participants in the placebo group will receive an identical bottle of placebo drops with no active ingredient. Similarly, they will be instructed to take two drops daily for six months. The placebo supplement is also manufactured by the Ddrops Company.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A composite of patient important outcomes - Re-operation: any unplanned surgery related to the treatment of the femoral neck fracture;
Femoral head osteonecrosis: any evidence of osteonecrosis on any follow-up medical imaging study (i.e., radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or other advanced imaging study);
Severe femoral neck malunion: fracture healing with femoral neck shortening of &gt;10 mm in any plane on follow-up x-rays; or
Nonunion: failure of the fracture to progress towards healing defined as a Radiographic Union Score for Hip (RUSH) score below a pre-determined threshold specific for nonunion at 6 months or greater post-injury.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fracture healing complications - E.g. wound healing problems, infection (superficial and deep), hardware failure, hardware breakage, painful hardware, and peri-prosthetic fracture.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short Form-12 (SF-12) - The SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire that measures self-reported quality of life through an 8-domain profile of functional health and well-being, physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hip Outcome Score (HOS) - The HOS measures self-reported functional status through 28 items and two sub-scales that pertain to activities of daily living (ADLs) or higher level activities such as those necessary to participate in sports.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiographic fracture healing - The date of healing will be determined by the Central Adjudication Committee (CAC). They will consider a fracture as healed when there is obliteration of the fracture line by newly formed bone along the cortices and within the trabecular bone on anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post-surgery</timepoint>
