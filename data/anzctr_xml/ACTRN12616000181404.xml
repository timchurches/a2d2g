  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgery was performed under local anesthesia with 2 ml of 4% articaine with epinephrine 1:100,000 (Ultracain D-S Forte, Sanofi Aventis, Istanbul, Turkey) in two sessions separated by at least a month. A single maxillofacial surgeon performed all surgical procedures. A random side impacted tooth of the patients was extracted at the first appointment, and an extraoral laser was applied on the area of masseter muscle immediately after the surgical procedure and at the appointment 2 days after the surgical procedure. A galliumaluminumarsenide (GaAlAs) diode laser device (CHEESE Dental Laser System, Wuhan GigaaOptronics Technology Company, China) with a continuous wavelength of 810 nm was used, and the laser therapy was applied to treatment group at 300 mW (0.3 W) for a total of 40 second by using a 1Ã—3-cm hand piece. The other side impacted 3rd molar tooth was extracted after 1 month. Ice was applied for the first 48 h for 10 min every hour while awake.
. Then facial swelling was determined with 3dMD face system, pain level was determined visual analog scale and inter incisal opening was measured with caliper.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients were advised to apply ice to affected region of the face after surgery. Ice was applied for the first 48 h for 10 min every hour while awake.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we aimed to examine the effect of a LLLT on the pain, mouth opening and swelling of patients whose impacted 3rd molar tooth was extracted in addition measurement volumetrically to the edema with 3dMD face system. 
Fifteen patients with asymptomatic bilateral wisdom mandibular 3rd molar were operated under local anesthesia at separet sesion. Low Level Laser Therapy applied at one side randomly selected at immediatly after the operation and after two days. Maximum mouth opening was determined with caliper, pain level was assesed using Visual Analog Scale and Swelling of face evaluated with 3dMD Face (Registered Trademark) (3dMD, Atlanta, GA) Photogrammetric System.There was no statistically significant difference in the edema and interincisal opening between the groups and the pain level in the laser group was significantly lower than in the control group on the 7th postoperative day. </summary>
