    <concealment>Written informed consent will be required prior to any testing or randomisation. Assignments will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes and designated colours will be assigned for each group. The subject will open these envelopes after completion of all baseline testing.

    <sequence>Subjects are randomised after the baseline assessment has been completed to: 1. Vibration training or 2. Wait-list control. Randomisation is at the level of the individual patient, and will be stratified by age, currently taking calcium or vitamin D, current exercise status. The list will be generated and maintained by a research assistant not otherwise involved in the study. The sequential treatment assignments are based on a computer-generated randomisation scheme (by using the Web site www.randomization.com set up by Dr Gerard E. Dallal).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effect of vibration therapy on markers of bone turnover in prostate cancer survivors on androgen suppression therapy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a man currently taking an androgen suppression therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Trial details.
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will undergo whole body vibration therapy. This involves standing on a gently vibrating platform for 20 minutes, three times per week over a period of 12 weeks. The other group will be assigned to no treatment for the 12 week trial period. After this time participants in this group will be offered the vibration treatment.

Participants will give blood and urine samples at baseline and at 12 weeks to examine markers of bone metabolism. They will also complete some tests of physical function and questionnaires about fatigue, quality of life and physical activity levels at these time points. It is thought that vibration training will decrease the breakdown of bone compared to no training.</summary>
