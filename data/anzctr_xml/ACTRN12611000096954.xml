  <interventions>
    <interventions>The acupuncture therapy was performed twice a week, with an average of 30 minutes for five uninterrupted weeks in individuals with temporomandibular disorders. The subjects were evaluated before, immediately after and after 10 sessions by surface electromyography of the masticatory muscles.  The temporomandibular acupuncture points of needling were ST5, ST7, TH17, Taiyang, , Yntang, LI4 and GB43,  placed in the subject's face, hands and foot.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>There was significant reduction in the EMG activity of the left temporallis muscle (p= 0.0062) at rest mandibular position</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after the acupuncture session</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>There was significant reduction in the EMG activity of the left and right temporallis muscles  (p= 0.009 and p= 0.002, respectively), at rest mandibular position.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 10 sessions of the treatment (five weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>No difference were observed in the EMG activity of the evaluated muscles during maximal intercuspal position.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after each individual session, and then after ten sessions of acupuncture</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An improvement between the masseter and temporalis muscles balance, observed by means of the electromyographic analyzis, was obtained with the treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 10 sessions of acupuncture (five weeks)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since, temporomandibular is a prevalent condition which causes pain in orofacial region and masticatory muscles, the  acupuncture is a therapeutic method that can benefit these patients, yet this is not already enough demonstrated.The study aims to verify the effect of the acupuncture in the electrical activity of masticatory muscles.</summary>
