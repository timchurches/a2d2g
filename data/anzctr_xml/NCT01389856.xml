      <outcome>Maximum Whole Blood Concentration (Cmax) for Bosentan and Its Metabolites, Ro 47-8634, Ro 48-5033, and Ro 64-1056 on Day 1 - Concentrations were measured directly in dried blood spot samples scheduled to be taken immediately prior to first study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7.5 and 12 hours post-dose on Day 1. Cmax was obtained directly from the measured concentrations. Cmax was corrected to a dose of 2 mg/kg bosentan (Cmaxc). The target dose was 2 mg/kg.
