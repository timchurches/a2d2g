  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects were randomized to receive active preseasonal short-term grass pollen allergoid immunotherapy or placebo using a double-blind method. The immunotherapy product was a preparation of extracts of six-grass pollens treated with formaldehyde to produce an allergoid and adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide. It was supplied in two concentrations, 1000 therapeutic units (TU)/ml and 10000 TU/ml. Subcutaneous injections commenced before the onset of the pollen season with 0.1 ml of 1000 TU/ml in February 2010 and followed by an approximate doubling of the dose weekly up to 0.6 ml of 10000 TU/ml. The standard regimen comprised of seven injections, once weekly, for seven weeks. Dose adjustments were made according to individual tolerance. The highest grass pollen grains are recorded between April and August in Turkey. Due to different times of pollination of the members of the Gramineae family, Gramineae pollens are usually found in the air during the whole year except a few months in Turkey. We used 01 March - 01 September as the pollen period in this trial and followed up participants for six months after the administration of the last injection. </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo was used as the control treatment. Placebo solution contained physiological saline. Subcutaneous injections commenced with 0.1 ml in February 2010 and followed by an approximate doubling of the dose weekly up to 0.6 ml. The standard regimen comprised of seven injections. Dose adjustments were made according to individual tolerance.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average combined (symptom and medication) score during the grass pollen season using symptom and medication diaries. All patients recorded their symptoms and medications daily during the pollen season in 2010. Nasal symptoms (itching, sneezing, discharge, obstruction) and ocular symptoms (itching, watery eyes) were recorded on a scale of 4. The average rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score was calculated as the mean of the daily total symptom score. Patients were instructed to use a stepwise regimen for rescue medication (step-1 oral desloratadine 5 mg, step-2 fluticasone furoate nasal spray, step-3 oral metilprednisolone 4 mg). Medication scores were as follows: 0=no medication; 1=desloratadine; 2=nasal fluticasone furoate; 3=oral metilprednisolone taken. Average combined score was calculated as the mean of average rhinoconjunctivitis total symptom score and medication score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored on a daily basis for 6 months during the pollen period after intervention (1-7 months after intervention commencement)</timepoint>

Group-time comparisons were performed using a macro developed for F1-LD-F1 design. Anova-type statistics were used to evaluate the significancy of the factors. Pair-wise comparisons within the groups were performed by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The sample size was estimated according to the number of eligible patients in the relevant time period.</statisticalmethods>
