  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment group will receive a custom-made serially adjustable rigid wrist/hand orthosis (WHO) to maintain the flexor compartment (muscles of the wrist, fingers and thumb) in a lengthened position to avoid shortening of the musculo-tendinous unit and other soft tissue.  
Children will be asked to wear the splint overnight, or for a minimum of 6 hours during the night or day (nightly/daily), for the three years of the study, to achieve a prolonged positioning effect with the orthosis. Although night time wear is recommended, for some children it may be appropriate to wear the orthosis during the day. 
An App (iPhone and android compatible) will be used to monitor factors such as the use of orthoses and any adverse events, based on parent report. Parents will receive a weekly text-reminder to record therapy received in the past week using simple response formats. 
Data recorded on the App will be supplemented through a 6-monthly parent interview conducted by the site based research assistant to record additional details about the usual evidence-informed therapy their child received in the preceding period.
All children (regardless of group allocation) will receive care typically provided by their usual treating organisation. Possible treatments may include developmentally appropriate, goal focused and evidence-informed occupational therapy, the use of equipment or BoNT-A injections. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will not receive a rigid wrist/hand orthosis.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The treating clinical teams at each trial site will identify potential participants and provide written information about the study (Recruitment letter/ study advertisement /Participant Information Statements) and briefly discuss the study with the family. Families will also be advised of the study by site-specific newsletters, websites and social media with an invitation to contact study personnel or treating therapists for more information about the studies. Through discussion and clinical examination of the upper limb/s, eligibility will be determined and informed consent sought from the parent(s)/guardian of the child. 

Once consent has been obtained, and following baseline assessment, children will be randomised to either the treatment or comparison group with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The randomisation schedule and web-based service will be provided by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU) at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and concealed from the researchers.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence will be generated using a web-based procedure and will be in randomly permuted blocks of variable length, stratified by study centre, and by severity of passive wrist range. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were performed according to the primary dependent variable; passive range of movement of wrist extension (measured with fingers extended) at 3 years. Data obtained from prior splinting studies were used to provide some evidence of variability in the primary outcome. However, in the absence of clear evidence in the literature the variability has been estimated to approximate 22degrees. A sample size of 77 in each group is estimated to be sufficient to detect a 10degrees between-group difference with 80% power and a two-tailed level of significance of .05. A total of 194 participants is therefore required to allow for a 20% drop-out. 
Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised trials and the primary analysis will be by intention to treat (ITT), including all randomised participants where outcome data are available. Comparison between the intervention and the control groups in the difference from baseline in passive range of wrist extension will be presented as the mean difference at 36 months and its 95% confidence interval (CI), obtained using a linear regression model adjusted for the stratification factors of site, and severity of wrist range of movement used in the randomisation. The regression model will be fitted using generalised estimating equations (GEE) to allow for the clustering of observations within participants for those who have both limbs in the study.
To explore the effect of adherence to WHO wearing schedule (i.e. a dose response relationship), a linear regression model will be fitted with compliance to treatment as a predictor and difference in the passive range of wrist extension from baseline to 36 months as the outcome, applied to all study participants. Again this model will be fitted using GEEs to allow for the clustering of limbs within participants. Finally, we will explore evidence for an interaction between age and treatment as well as for an interaction between severity (Wilton Hand Deformity Classification) and treatment by the inclusion of interaction terms in the linear regression model (Again this model will be fitted using GEEs). Finally the effect of potential confounders will be examined using an adjusted GEE model.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>We will use a multicentre, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of the provision of a wrist immobilising orthosis on impairment, activity and participation outcomes for children with cerebral palsy. This trial aims to maintain and/or increase range of movement in the wrist thumb and fingers of children aged 5-15 years. </summary>
