  <interventions>
    <interventions>A proprietary  blend of probiotic bacteria capsules  (twice daily with food) and yeast capsules (twice daily with food)  or placebo will be given to elite team athletes for 7 months.  
At the end of the trial all remaining capsules will be returned and counted as a means of measuring compliance. In addition, the head trainer will provide reminders regarding taking the trial medicine to improve compliance
The details of the probiotic and yeasts  are commercial and in confidence and listed privately with the ANZCTR</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This is a composite primary outcome i.e.to identify if probiotics ingestion is effective in reducing the number and severity of upper respiratory tract infections.
The incidence of respiratory infections will be recorded by the team doctor and the severity recorded as mild moderate or severe.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>5 months prior to  baseline enrolment and again at 6 months after intervention has commenced.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>composite of number and severity of gastrointestinal infections assessed and  recorded by the team doctor. The team doctor will record the number of gastrointestinal infections and rate the severity of the symptoms, mild moderate or severe</outcome>
      <timepoint>from 5 months before  baseline enrolment to 6 months after intervention has commenced. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> 
Salivary biomarkers of immunity and stress - sIgA, cortisol, alpha-amylase and testosterone</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed twice weekly for six months from commencing intervention  for 7 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Daily Analysis of Life Demands for Athletes (DALDA)  on a weekly basis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weekly from commencement of intervention for 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A composite secondary outcome will include standard wellness information (sleep quality and quantity, muscle soreness). This will be measured through administering The Standard Wellness Questionnaire weekly</outcome>
      <timepoint>weekly from commencement of intervention for 6 months</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>No sample size calculations have been performed as the number of participants is entirely dependent on the number of players in the team. Salivary biomarkers results -  their 90% confidence limits will be estimated with a spreadsheet via the unequal-variances t statistic computed for change scores between baseline (pre) - and post-tests of the two groups. Each subjects change score will be expressed as a percentage of baseline score by analysis of log-transformed values, in order to reduce bias arising from non-uniformity of error. Comparison of the frequency of illness measures recorded during probiotic and placebo treatments will be conducted using X2 analysis, and illness severity scores will be compared using a MannWhitney U test for non-parametric measures. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Of interest to this study is the role specific species and strains of probiotics could play in reducing the incidence and/or severity of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms infections in elite team sport athletes who travel frequently. The impact of endurance exercise on immune function is well established with a body of research to support that in a significant number of athletes, the physical and mental stress endured by elite athletes can result in an increased susceptibility to gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. Furthermore, a number of trials have investigated the efficacy of supplementing with specific Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria in reducing respiratory infections.</summary>
