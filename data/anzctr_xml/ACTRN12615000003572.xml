  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This case-series report of an intervention into the efficacy of osteopathic manual therapy (OMT) is a substudy of a study aimed at describing sleep patterns of infants and their parents. The aim of this interventional study was to assess the effectiveness of osteopathic manual therapy (OMT) on infants between 4 - 12 months of age who were described by their parents as problematic sleepers. It is anecdotally reported that OMT may help improve problematic infant sleep. Sleep was measured using actigraphy, parentally completed sleep diaries and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Measures included the total amount of sleep time (over 24 hours, daytime and night-time), longest sleep period, longest self regulated sleep period, night time wakes and daytime naps. </summary>
