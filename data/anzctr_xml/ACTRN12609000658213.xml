  <interventions>
    <interventions>Invasive pulp therapy, or pulpotomy is a standard dental procedure carried out to remove infected/ and or inflammed dental pulp, followed by a pulp agent that is placed over the remaining healthy pulp.  

Indirect Pulp Therapy (IPT) is carried out for teeth with no pulp exposure, and the base of the cavity is lined with an agent.

This procedure can take approximately half an hour, depending on child co-operation.    

There are two pulp agents that will be evaluated against the control.  
1- MTA (Mineral Trioxide Aggregate) which is a repair/ regeneration agent 
2- Ledermix which is a mixture of antibiotic and steroid. 

Treatment options are:
1) Pulpotomy with MTA, in which MTA is placed on the pulp after pulpotomy
2) Pulpotomy with Ledermix, in which Ledermix is placed on the pulp after pulpotomy 
3) IPT (Indirect Pulp therapy) with MTA
4) IPT with Ledermix</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment 
Formocresol will be used for pulpotomy, with formocresol being used as the pulp agent as described above.  

Glass ionomer cement will be used as the control for IPT.  As mentioned above, it will be the agent lining the base of the tooth cavity with non-exposed pulps.

Treatment time is as described above, approximately half an hour.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Success rates of the pulp therapy.

This will be assessed by clinical and radiographic assessment where the absence of signs of infection and/or inflammation will be looked for.  These include pain, redness, swelling, abscess, non-physiologic mobility and pathologic radiolucency on radiographs.

Moreover, a subjective interrogation to the parent or guardian of the child will be carried out to determine any signs and/or symptoms experienced by the patient.

Moreover, any other signs and symptoms that may not be accounted for, and are experienced by the child due to pulp therapy will also be noted.</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>All subjects recruited in the study will be systemically healthy although they may have decayed teeth.

    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed.

Subjects requiring management of deep caries will be randomly allocated to a pulp agent using sequence method of allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>To establish a sequence, random draw technique will be used where the agent options are written on a piece of paper and an option drawn.  

If more than one tooth requires management, the second tooth will have another draw and if there is a third tooth, it will get the last agent.  If there are four teeth, the process will start all over again.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate pulp agents and techniques used for management of deep decay in children's primary molar teeth.  Previous investigations suggest that there should be no difference in outcomes among various techniques, provided that proper diagnosis and good coronal seal are achieved.  However, differences in chemicals may lead to different pulp responses.  The study will determine which materials are most suitable.</summary>
