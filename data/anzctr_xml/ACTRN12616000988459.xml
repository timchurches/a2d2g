  <interventions>
    <interventions>Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is an impaired ability to respond to sensory stimuli within the environment on the contralateral side of brain lesion location resulting from stroke. Currently USN is most commonly assessed using standard pen-and-paper tasks such as cancellations tasks, figure copying and line bisection. Despite these assessments being widely used, results have been found to often be inconsistent in detection of USN. This trial uses Tobii Pro eye-tracking glasses in the observation of inpatients with and without USN in a 10-15 minute functional task (making a hot beverage). The glasses  record where the participant is looking, what they see and the patterns of their eye-tracking during the task. This will be a single 10-15 session wearing the glasses whilst making  a hot beverage in a standardised therapy kitchen in a rehabilitation hospital. Additionally pen and paper tests of USN will be completed by all participants and will  take a further 10-15 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Cohort is divided into two groups of USN and non-USN so results can be compared, however both groups have similar characteristics and are observed in the exact same assessment.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This study aims to recruit 40 participants. Participants will be categorised into two groups (USN and non-USN) with twenty participants in each. This sample size was selected following statistician advice recommending seventeen participants for an adequately powered study. The extra three participants in each group allows for possible withdrawals. Group sample sizes of 17 and 17 achieve 80.704% power to reject the null hypothesis of equalmeans when the population mean difference is 3.0 with a standard deviation for both groups of3.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.050 using a two-sided two-sample equal-variance t-test.
