    <studytitle>Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus in Recipients of Heart Transplants to Prevent Acute and Chronic Rejection</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A 24-month, Multi-center, Randomized, Open-label, Non-inferiority Study of Efficacy and Safety Comparing Two Exposures of Concentration-controlled Everolimus With Reduced Cyclosporine Versus 3.0 g Mycophenolate Mofetil With Standard Dose Cyclosporine in de Novo Heart Transplant Recipients</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - everolimus
Treatment: drugs - mycophenolate mofetil
Treatment: drugs - cyclosporine
Treatment: drugs - corticosteroids

Experimental: everolimus 1.5 mg - Within 72 hours after transplantation participants received 0.75 mg everolimus tablets twice a day 12 hours apart for a total 1.5 mg daily dose in combination with reduced cyclosporine and standard dose corticosteroids for 24 months. The everolimus dose could be adjusted to maintain a target everolimus trough level of 3-8 ng/mL.

Experimental: everolimus 3.0 mg - Within 72 hours after transplantation participants received 1.5 mg everolimus tablets twice a day 12 hours apart for a total 3.0 mg daily dose in combination with reduced cyclosporine and standard dose corticosteroids for 24 months. The everolimus dose could be adjusted to maintain a target everolimus trough level of 6-12 ng/mL.
Randomization of new patients in this arm was prematurely stopped as of 27 March 2008 due to high mortality rate, as per Data Monitoring Committee.

Active Comparator: mycophenolate mofetil - Within 72 hours after transplantation participants received 3 tablets 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil twice a day 12 hours apart for a total daily dose of 3000 mg in combination with a standard cyclosporine dose and standard dose corticosteroids for 24 months.


Treatment: drugs: everolimus
Everolimus supplied as 0.75 mg tablets. Everolimus was also supplied in 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg tablets for dose adjustments.

Treatment: drugs: mycophenolate mofetil
Mycophenolate mofetil supplied as 500 mg tablets.

Treatment: drugs: cyclosporine
Cyclosporine reduced dose in the everolimus arms (approximately half of the standard dose) and standard dose in the mycophenolate mofetil arm.

Treatment: drugs: corticosteroids
Corticosteroids standard dose.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Composite Efficacy Failure at 12 Months - Composite efficacy failure was defined as Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection(BPAR) of International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation(ISHLT) grade =3A, Acute Rejection associated with Hemodynamic Compromise, Graft loss/Retransplant, Death or Loss to follow-up.
Identification of acute rejection was based on the local pathologist's evaluation of endomyocardial biopsy slides.
Hemodynamic compromise was present if 1 or more of the following were met: Ejection fraction =30% or 25% lower than Baseline or Fractional shortening =20% or 25% lower than Baseline and/or use of inotropic treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 Months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Graft Loss/Re-transplant, Death or Loss to Follow-up at 12 Months - Loss to follow-up for this composite endpoint included participants who did not experience graft loss/re-transplant or death and whose last day of contact was prior to Day 316 (start day of the Month 12 visit window).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Renal Function Measured by Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) at 12 Months - GFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) formula:
GFR [mL/min/1.73m^2] = 186.3*(C^-1.154)*(A^-0.203)*G*R where C is the serum concentration of creatinine [mg/dL] A is age [years] G=0.742 when gender is female, otherwise G=1 R=1.21 when race is black, otherwise R=1</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Average Maximum Intimal Thickness at Month 12 - Maximum intimal thickness was assessed using Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS is a technique for taking ultrasound pictures of the wall of an artery from inside the artery itself. It shows the thickness of the artery wall and any narrowing of the artery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV) at Month 12 - Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is defined as a 0.5 mm increase in maximum intimal thickness as measured by Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) in at least one matched slice between baseline and Month 12.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 Months</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Biopsy-proven Acute Rejection (BPAR of ISHLT Grade = 3A), Acute Rejection Associated With Hemodynamic Compromise (HDC), Graft Loss/Re-transplant and Death at Month 12 - Identification of acute rejections was based on the local pathologist's evaluation of endomyocardial biopsy slides.
Hemodynamic compromise was present if 1 or more of the following were met: Ejection fraction = 30% or 25% lower than Baseline or Fractional shortening = 20% or 25% lower than Baseline, and/or use of inotropic treatment.</outcome>
