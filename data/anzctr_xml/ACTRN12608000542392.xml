    <concealment>Participants were recruited through the antenatal clinics of the hospital through direct approach while the women waited for their antenatal appointment and through advertising in the clinic room. Eligible nulliparous women were those with a singleton cephalic presentation and planning a vaginal birth.'Once consented the women were randomly allocated, using envelope randomisation to intervention or control group' to this field.</concealment>
