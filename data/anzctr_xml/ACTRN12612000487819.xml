  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, open label clinical trial with two parallel groups of 40 participants each, randomised to ACUVUE [Registered trade mark] OASYS [Trademark] or ACUVUE [Registered trade mark]  2 lenses worn bilaterally for one month on a daily-wear basis (n=80 in total). Each lens-group will be, randomised to COMPLETE [Registered trade mark]  Multi-Purpose Solution Easy Rub [Trademark] Formula or renu [Registered trade mark]  fresh [Trademark] for the first month of the trial only (n=20 in each solution / lens combination). After the first month of lens wear, all participants will be crossed over into Topaz multipurpose solution, whilst continuing wear of the same lens type. Lenses will be worn on a daily-wear basis for a further three months. There will be four scheduled visits: baseline, 1-month visit, 2-month visit, 4-month visit. 
These visits will involve assessment of visual acuity, assessment of ocular comfort using questionnaires employing a 1-10 numeric rating scale and ocular response by examination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialised microscope for viewing the eye) . Lenses will be worn
a minimum of 5 days per week, 6 hours per day.
All solutions will be used after lens removal and as per manufacturers recommendation: Rub lenses with solution (5 seconds), rinse lenses with solution (5seconds) and store in solutionfor at least 6 hours. Solution is not to be reused.
Contact lenses will be replaced 2x/month.</interventions>
    <comparator>The two commercially available solutions will serve as controls and Topaz will be the test.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective Participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a Participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 
NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Neophytes (potential Participants who have not previously worn contact lenses).
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 48 hours between in-house studies.
Pregnancy*.
The Investigator may, at his / her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be able to fulfil the clinical trial requirements or it is believed to be in the Participants best interests.
*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A Participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Participants who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria are enrolled in the trial and are given a sequential participant number. A randomisation plan (see below) is used to allocate contact lens type (and solution) to each participant, based on their unique participant number. A randomisation list will be generated by the biostatistician and applied through the Clinic Data Management system.</concealment>
