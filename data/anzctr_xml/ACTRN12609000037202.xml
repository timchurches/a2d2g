  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following cardiac surgery, patients who are already receiving Nasal High Flow (NHF) as part of their usual care will be approached to participate in this study (NHF = blended air and oxygen which has been warmed and humidified and delivered via nasal cannula at flows of up to 50L/min. Patients may receive this therapy for a few hours or a few days depending on their clinical condition). 
The research procedure is as follows:
1	Informed consent
2	Insert pressure measuring catheter into the patients nasopharynx. 
3	Attach belt of electrodes around patients chest. 
4	Change from NHF to face mask oxygen therapy
5	10 -15 min wash out period
6	Arterial blood gas taken if Arterial line is in situ
7	Simultaneous pressure measurements and electrical readings recorded for a 2 min period. 
8	Change from face mask oxygen therapy to NHF
9	10 - 15 min wash out period
10	Arterial blood gas taken if arterial line is in situ
11	Simultaneous pressure measurements and electrical readings recorded for a 2 min period
12	Remove pressure measuring catheter
13	Remove belt of electrodes
14	Continue with usual care
Patients will receive the same concentration of oxygen with either therapy and this will be dictated by the patients clinical requirements. Physiological and demographic data from the patients medical chart will also be recorded.</interventions>

      <outcome>Nasopharyngeal pressure. Measured via a size 8 French nasogastric tube inserted into the nasopharynx and connected to a pressure transducer. The pressure transducer connects to a laptop computer where recordings are downloaded.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After cardiac surgery the lungs may suffer from a small amount of collapse and may require extra assistance to re-expand. If this occurs nasal high flow therapy may be applied (delivery of warmed and humidified medical gas via the nose at flow rates up to 50 L/min). It is believed that this flow generates a degree of positive pressure in the lungs which is beneficial to patients with some degree of lung collapse. Assessment of the physiological effect by two different methods (pressure measurement in the upper airway and by a lung imaging technique called electrical impedence tomography) will help doctors understand the effects of this therapy better and will form the basis for future research in this area.</summary>
