  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will commence treatment with oral panobinostat 45mg three times per week every other week as part of a 4-week (28 day) treatment cycle. Patients will be treated for 6 cycles and then assessed for response. If after 6 cycles patients have not achieved a very good partial response (VGPR) or CR they will cease panobinostat. Patients achieving the required response will continue on panobinostat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</interventions>

    <concealment>All patients will be registered on-study within 4 weeks prior to undergoing ASCT. Each patient will be assigned a unique trial number made up of a two digit site number and a three digit patient number.
At 6-8 weeks post-ASCT eligibility will be confirmed and panobinostat maintenance treatment should be commenced within 10 days </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Patient entry in the trial will continue until 10 patients have been enrolled and completed 6 cycles of treatment in stage 1. If less than or equal to two patients respond, the trial will be terminated (achieve CR or VGPR).  If two or more patients respond then the trial will proceed to stage 2 and a further 25 patients will be enrolled. 
The first major analysis of results will take place after the 10 patients in stage 1 have all completed 6 cycles of therapy. If the study is to continue (i.e. not terminated) the next analysis will take place after all patients have either come off trial (due to failure to respond, death, progression, intolerance or patient choice) or received 12 months of protocol treatment. A further analysis will take place after all patients have had a minimum of 2.5 years follow-up.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine if panobinostat maintenance in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have failed to achieve complete remission (CR) following high-dose chemotherapy conditioned autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) will lead to an increased/improved rate of conversion to CR or very good partial response (VGPR). 
You may be eligible to join this study if you have previously been treated with a thalidomide, and/or lenalidomide and/or bortezomib containing induction regimen pre-ASCT. Participants in this trial will receive the oral drug panobinostat at a dose of 45mg three times per week every other week as part of a 4-week (28 day) treatment cycle. You will be treated for 6 cycles and then assessed for response. If after 6 cycles you have not achieved a very good partial response (VGPR) or CR, your panobinostat treatment will cease. If, however, you have achieved the required response, you will continue on panobinostat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. </summary>
