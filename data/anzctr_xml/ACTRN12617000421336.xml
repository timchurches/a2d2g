  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a dietary one. In a three-armed, controlled trial, participants will be provided a dietary plan to match their habitual calorie intake (as determined by a one-week lead in period), but modified to one of three reduced carbohydrate diets; 5% calories from carbohydrate, 15% calories from carbohydrate, and 25% calories from carbohydrate. Guidelines will be provided for protein intake which will be standardised to 1.4g of protein per kilogram of bodyweight for each participant, with fat making up the remainder of the calories allotted. The diet plan will be provided as a written plan, prepared by Cliff Harvey, a registered clinical nutritionist of 19 years experience and Caryn Zinn, a registered dietician of twenty years experience. The plan will include general nutritional guidelines for health, foods to be included and excluded in the diet and a menu plan tailored towards each participant and including three meals with portions determined by their calorie and macronutrient allotment.  Two workshops will also be provided (by C.H) to provide additional information and support and to ensure participants understand the diet. These workshops will be provided in-person at AUT University for those able to attend and will also be broadcast live via webstream for those unable to attend in person. The workshops will be one hour in duration and will be conducted before the commencement of the trial. Throughout the intervention, participants will have access to the aforementioned practitioners to ask questions. The diet will be prescribed once for a 12-week trial. Information will be provided at AUT Millennium, 17 Antares Place, Rosedale, Auckland, 0632, New Zealand. As a free-living study, participants will be undertaking the diet in their own life environment. Throughout the study participants will have access to the practititioners (C.H and C.Z) via email, and telephone during business hours. Adherence will be monitored via online and app-based food diary (Fat Secret Pro). </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>144 participants will be recruited. The calculation for participant numbers is based on the findings of the pilot study: The effect of medium chain triglycerides on time to nutritional ketosis and symptoms of keto-induction in healthy adults (manuscript submitted for publication). The primary outcome chosen for this power calculation is the change in POMS-TMDS from baseline. This measure was chosen as a validated questionnaire that is fit for our purpose of evaluating the effect of dietary induction on participants. In the pilot study, the mean POMS-TMDS was -11.4 in the control group (SD: 17.3) and -5.1 (SD: 7.2) in the experimental. We expect to see lowest mood disturbances in the non-ketogenic low carbohydrate diet (NKLCD) arm of the study compared to the very low carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD) arm. Assuming the ketogenic arm has a change from baseline of 11.4 (SD 17.4) and the minimum change in the NKLCD arm is +9.2 units higher with a restricted SD, as seen in the pilot (SD 7), then 36 participants per arm is required to detect this difference with a false positive (alpha) rate of 5% and false negative of (beta) 20%. We will allow for 48 per group to allow for dropouts based on the pilot. 

Subjects will be compared with regard to baseline variables by treatment allocation arm to check for balance. Exploratory data analysis will consider the variation in different facets of the symptom scores with time from commencing the diet, by treatment arm, and by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Correlation between individual items in the score and baseline characteristics will be undertaken using principal components and biplots. Similar analyses will be carried out for associations between. Daily symptoms scores will be aggregated and summarised into mean changes from baseline. These changes will then be analysed by treatment group using ANOVA. These analyses will be compared with multiple linear regression, with baseline characteristics included in the regression model. Similarly, for secondary outcomes, changes in biomarker concentrations and anthropometry will be analysed using ANOVA and multiple linear regression. All tests will be two-tailed and the type-1 (false positive) error rate of 5% will be used to judge statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reduced carbohydrate diets offer benefits for the prevention and adjunct treatment of health conditions including; neurological disorders, cancer, obesity, diabetes and other conditions on the spectrum of metabolic syndrome. They are increasingly popular for mainstream and athletic use for weight-loss and maintenance and have been demonstrated to improve satiety and reduce hunger. But adaptation from a standard diet to one low in carbohydrates can cause various unpleasant symptoms, referred to in common parlance as keto-flu. These symptoms of carbohydrate restriction are assumed to provide a barrier to the use of, and compliance with low carbohydrate diets. However, these early-induction symptoms have not been well described in the scientific literature. So, at this time, it is not clear whether symptoms are related solely to keto-induction (i.e. in very low carbohydrate ketogenic diets) or are more generally, symptoms of carbohydrate withdrawal. Outcomes from ketogenic and non-ketogenic lower carbohydrate diets are likely to be similar and the degree to which people experience symptoms of carbohydrate withdrawal is also likely to influence compliance. For many, it may not be necessary to restrict carbohydrate to the degree necessary to achieve ketosis, especially if the symptoms resulting from extreme carbohydrate restriction are disproportionate to the beneficial outcomes from the diet. This has not been investigated and this study will seek to address this important clinical topic
Study Hypothesis:
A moderate restriction of carbohydrate results in fewer symptoms of dietary induction and greater tolerance and adherence to diet, with comparable results for cardiometabolic outcomes when compared to more extreme carbohydrate restriction. </summary>
