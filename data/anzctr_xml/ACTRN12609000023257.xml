  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will be required to consume three doses of resveratrol (30, 90 or 270mg on one occasion per dose). 
There will be four separate visits (of one hour duration each) to the research centre which will occur with a one week washout between visits. At each visit the participant will consume one dose of resveratrol (or placebo) per visit.
Measurements of endothelial vasodilator function and blood pressure responses to exercise will begin one hour after consumption of each single dose of resveratrol. These measures will be repeated at each visit. 
Resveratrol will be administered orally in capsules. Each of the three doses of resveratrol consists of multiple capsules; all capsules that make up a single dose will be consumed at once.
Doses will be made up of combinations of 15 and 75 mg resveratrol capsules as follows:

1) 30 mg: 2 capsules of 15 mg + 4 placebo capsules 
2) 90 mg: 1 capsule of 75 mg + 1 capsule of 15 mg + 4 placebo 
3) 270 mg: 3 capsules of 75 mg + 3 of 15 mg</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsules are identical in appearance to the active capsules but contain an inert filler consisting of Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) of various particle sizes including Prosolv 50 and talcum powder (hydrated magnesium silicate).
There are a total of four testing visits for this trial. Three will include the consumption of a single dose of resveratrol and one will be the placebo and each visit will be one week apart.
Volunteers will take an oral dose of six placebo capsules all at once on a single occasion. 
Measurements of endothelial vasodilator function and blood pressure responses to exercise will begin one hour after consumption of the placebo.</comparator>

    <concealment>Volunteers will be recruited via letter from database of previous participants in trial at the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre who have been identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Volunteers will be requested to attend the research centre for a screening to assess their eligibility for the trial and enrolled based on body mass index and blood pressure values obtained at that visit. 
Eligibility will be determined by the study coordinator. Volunteers will be required to consume each dose once, the order of which will be determined by a random number generator. Doses will be allocated a letter A-D for identification. The identity of the supplement will be held by an individual separate to the study which will not be decoded until all data has been analysed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well established that obesity and elevated blood pressure can lead to impaired vascular function. However, it is less clear how impaired blood vessel function affects cardiovascular and, consequently, blood pressure responses during exercise. Exaggerated blood pressure responses to exercise can be an early risk factor for the development of future hypertension.
The aim of this study is to establish a dose/response relationship for the effect of resveratrol on endothelial vasodilator function as measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD) and blood pressure (BP), both at rest and during exercise, in volunteers who are overweight/obese with elevated BP.
The results of this study will inform the design of future trials which will explore the effect of combinations of resveratrol and other vasoactive nutrients on cardiovascular and mental health.</summary>
