  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental drug treatments are not part of this study. Patients will receive chemotherapy that is standard of care at their hospital. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics will be collected immediately prior to cycle 1 doxorubicin administration and at 0.5, 1, 3, &amp; 6 hours after the end of the infusion, then at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Pharmacodynamics will be assessed using body composition assessments before patients commence chemotherapy. Body composition will be assessed by height and weight; bioelectric impedance analysis; X-ray of the wrist to estimate bone age and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of gender and pubertal stage on the pharmacokinetics  of doxorubicin in children and Adolescent and Young Adult  (collectively) with newly diagnosed osteosarcoma and Ewing family of tumours by comparing doxorubicin concentration-time curve area under the curve (AUC) against gender.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cycle 1 first infusion of doxorubicin treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the relationship between doxorubicin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics where pharmacodynamics  is measured by worst toxicity grade and tumour response</outcome>
      <timepoint>Toxicity assessment at end of Cycle 1; response assessment at end of chemotherapy</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the relationship between toxicity and tumour response. Toxicity is measured using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3. Tumour response will be assessed using the hospital's standard response assessment measures, which depending on the disease may include post-resection tumour necrosis evaluation or radiological and nuclear imaging.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently the doses of medication given to treat cancer are generally determined by a simple body surface area (BSA) calculation based on weight and height.  However, physiological differences between individuals may affect the way cancer drugs are processed by the body, potentially leading to variable dose levels in the body, and differences in toxicity and efficacy between individuals. This study is looking at the way the body processes the drug doxorubicin (this is called pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), to see if gender, stage of puberty, or body composition may impact the effectiveness or toxicity of doxorubicin. 

The study focuses on osteosarcoma, Ewing family of tumours and Hodgkin lymphoma because there is some evidence that there may be a difference between males and females in the response to chemotherapy for these cancers. These cancers mainly affect young people, many of whom are undergoing the physical changes of puberty, which are different for males and females.</summary>
