  <interventions>
    <interventions>Overweight  men aged between 20 and 70 yrs and  post-menopausal women less than 70yrs will be screened for two genetic polymorphisms called CYP4F2 G1347A and CYP4A11 T8590C that affect 20-HETE levels. The screening visit will take approximately 1 hour and requires donation of a small blood sample (10ml).  Genetic material (DNA) will be isolated from this blood sample in for identification of the two polymorphisms. Two groups will be studied. A group that are carriers of the A allele of the CYP4F2 G1347A polymorphism but who do not have the CYP4A11 T8590C polymorphism and a control group that has  neither polymorphism. Both groups will receive one on one 1 hour sessions with a dietitian every 2 weeks to assist them to  reduced their weight (by ~4-8kg) over a 12 week period. At the end of 12 weeks, volunteers will be counselled  every 2 weeks by the dietitain about how to maintain their weight  for a 4 week period of weight stabilisation.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>Volunteers will undergo a medical examination conducted by a physician to assess their suitability for the study. Overweight  men with waist circumference greater than or equal to 102cm  and overweight  post-menopausal women with with waist circumference greater than or equal to 88cm  who have a systolic blood pressure greater or equal to 120mmHg and body mass index  between 25 and 40. They will  be screened for two genetic polymorphisms called CYP4F2 G1347A and CYP4A11 T8590C that affect 20-HETE levels. Two groups will be studied.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effectiveness of treatments to reduce heart disease risk can vary a great deal between individuals. This is partly due to an individuals genetic makeup. Fatty acid metabolites called cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (CYP450-AAM) can act on blood vessels and the kidney to regulate blood pressure.  One of these metabolites (20-HETE) is known to be affected by body weight. We will study volunteers with two different genetic make-ups that have different effects on the levels of 20-HETE, to see if they affect blood pressure and heart disease risk. We will assess whether having either genetic make-up causes a different blood pressure  and plasma and urinary 20-HETE response when volunteers reduce their weight.</summary>
