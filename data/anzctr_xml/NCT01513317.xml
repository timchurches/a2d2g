  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Confirmed diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), according to World Heath
             Organization or the French-American-British Cooperative Group pathologic
             classification, with an International Prognostic Scoring System score 0, 0.5, or 1.0,
             indicating Low- or INT-1-risk disease.

          -  Documented RBC transfusion of at least 2 units of RBC for the treatment of the anemia
             of MDS in the 8 weeks preceding the start of the Screening Period.

          -  Adequate iron stores, demonstrated by either the presence of stainable iron in the
             bone marrow or a serum ferritin of &gt; 100 ng/mL.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0 to 2.
