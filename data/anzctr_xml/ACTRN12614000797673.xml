  <interventions>
    <interventions>We have developed a Toolkit and care partnership strategy  Ways of Thinking and Ways of Doing (WoTWoD) to assist Australian general practices to provide culturally and clinically appropriate health care to Aboriginal people. Intervention practices will use WoTWoD for 12 months and we will then examine whether the WoTWoD improves cultural respect and delivery of culturally and clinically appropriate care to Aboriginal Australians.

In brief, the Toolkit is a whole-of-practice clinical re-design process to embed cultural respect in general practice. It includes ten case-scenarios describing management of Aboriginal patients at general practice setting and each scenario is followed by a narrative about whether the patient was managed in a culturally and clinically appropriate manner. It describes both aspects of the patient management  proper and improper  providing an explanation and guidance to the general practice staff how the patient could have provided high quality health care (both clinically and culturally). The Toolkit also includes a Cultural Respect Framework and also explains the importance of it. The other components of the Toolkit includes a Self-Assessment template for the practice staff to use to assess what are being done at the practices to accommodate the needs of the Aboriginal patients and an Action Plan template for practice staff to use to address their shortcomings (if any). The other two components of the Toolkit include a list of resources and recommended readings that practice staff can utilize. 

For the intervention practice staff a 4-hour workshop will be organized to train them how the Toolkit should be used. The workshop will be face-to-face and presentation will be made by experts both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, but all expert in Aboriginal Health. After the workshop all the intervention practices will be visited by 1-2 trained Aboriginal Cultural Mentors who will assist practices to implement the Toolkit over the next 12 months.

At each Primary Health Network (PHN) area a Local Care Partnership (LCP) will be formed which will include representative from the Close the Gap staff from the PHN, representative from the local Aboriginal communities and also the Aboriginal Cultural Mentor(s). The LCP and members from the research will be in regular touch with the practices to monitor adherence to the intervention by the practices.</interventions>

    <concealment>Randomisation will be conducted at practice level. The practices that will be randomized into the intervention group will attend a cultural respect workshop followed by an Aboriginal cultural mentor visit who will assist them to implement WoTWoD Program Toolkit. "STATA statistical package will be used to generate the randomisation sequence. Practices will be stratified by size and whether they take 1st year or 2nd year GP registrar and randomised in blocks. Stratified random allocation will be conducted to obtain an equal distribution of these 2 attributes. Randomisation will be carried out using a computer-generated randomization program with a minimisation algorithm to ensure a balance of practice characteristics that could potentially affect practice’s ability to implement the WoTWoD Program and Toolkit. Allocation will be concealed and the method that will be used is contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is “off-site” (a senior research staff from the Sydney University). </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Nationally, 81,093 MBS item#715 were claimed in 2011; using the ABS 2011 census figures of 548,368 Aboriginal people as the denominator, the proportion of uptake is 14.8%. The Marumali Brokerage Service in SW Sydney claimed 330 MBS item#715 in the first quarter of 2011. Using the approximately 11,000 Aboriginal people in its catchment, the projected proportion of uptake for 2011 is estimated at 13.6%. Uptake in our pilot was about 20%. We estimate that the baseline uptake of MBS item#715 is between 10-15% of the estimated Aboriginal population. We aim to achieve a change from 15% to 40% in the amount of MBS item#715 claimed. This is reasonable because the intervention is quite intensive. The sample size can be calculated based on whether we use the patient or the practice as the unit of analysis:
1) Patients as unit of analysis: If we assume a difference of 30% in the proportion of patients in the intervention group (45%) and control group (15%) receiving a health check, for a beta of 0.8, a of 0.05 and a 2-sided test to detect a change, we need to recruit 36 people in each arm of the study. Conservatively assuming a design effect of 4 due to clustering of this outcome by practice the required sample size is 144. We estimate that we will recruit 5 patients per practice. Thus we will need 29 practices in each arm or 58 practices in total in Sydney and Melbourne combined.
2) Practice and practice staff as unit of analysis: The above sample size is adequate to detect an increase in the Cultural Quotient score from a mean of 80 (50%) to 114 (70%) or 130 (80%).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The majority (60%) of Aboriginal people live in urban Australia. Despite various strategies to close the gap in access to care and social services, health inequities and culturally inappropriate care persist. The Ways of Thinking, Ways of Doing (WoTWoD) program and toolkit, implemented through partnerships of general practice and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHs), was developed to guide and effect a whole-of-practice clinical re-design process to embed cultural respect in general practice. Following promising pilot studies, this randomized control trial will test the effectiveness of WoTWoD to improve cultural respect, health checks and cardiovascular risk factors of Aboriginal people in Sydney and Melbourne. The study will be implemented through Medicare Locals in collaboration with local ACCHS. Our hypothesis is that the WoTWoD and care partnerships will improve culturally and clinically appropriate care for Aboriginal people in Australian general practice. </summary>
