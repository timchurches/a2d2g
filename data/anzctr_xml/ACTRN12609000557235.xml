  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects received a 90 minute intraduodenal infusion of fat (C18:1) delivered at 0.78kcal per minute (70Kj total) and saline, at a rate of 2ml/ min (180ml total). Treatments were separated by 3-14 days, and all subjects received both treatments.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>During the 90 minute infusion antropyloduodenal motility was assessed via changes in the pressures within specific portion of the gastrointestinal tract (antrum, pylorus and duodenum) which was captured by  sensors on the catheter, and connected to a computer-based system, running commercially available hardware (Oakdale Flexisoft)</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite and hunger</outcome>
      <timepoint>-10, 0, 15,30,45,60,75, 90 and 120 minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hormone release cholecystokinin (CCK) and Peptide YY (PYY). Blood samples were drawn from subjects every 15 minutes until t=90, and then once more at t=120. Radioimmuno assays were used to determine the concentration of these hormones in plasma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>-10, 0, 15,30,45,60,75, 90 and 120 minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Taste sensitivity to fat</outcome>
      <timepoint>Taste thresholds were determined by 3 ascending forced choice procedure, during a third test day, ie it was on a separate day than either the fat or saline infusion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Habitual energy and fat intake</outcome>
      <timepoint>A 2 day diet recall and fat intake questionnaire were recorded on the same day as threshold testing.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>lipase activity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Saliva was collected from all subjects on the same day as threshold testing. Lipase activity was quantified using a colorometric lipase assay.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>taste sensitivity to n-6-propylthiouracil</outcome>
      <timepoint>Filter papers containing n-6-propylthiouracil (PROP) were provided to all subjects on the same day as threshold testing.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects had to be males between the ages of 18 -55 years, with a body mass index (BMI) between 18 -35 kg/m2). Subjects were required to be unrestrained eaters, consume less than 20g of alcohol per week, be non-smokers, free of gastrointestinal or chronic disease and not currently taking medication whicfunction.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Restrained eaters, smokers, sufferers of gastrointestinal or chronic disease, individuals currently on medication known to affect appetite or gastrointestinal function. Subjects completed factor 1 of the 3 factor eating questionnaire (restrained eaters are defined as those who score higher than 12), subjects were asked about their personal and familial medical history relating to chronic illness (heart disease and cancer) as well as gastrointestinal disease, ie Crohns, Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Subjects were asked if they were smokers, and how much alcohol they consumed on a weekly basis.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was to investigate gastrointestinal and taste sensitivity to fats, and determine if 1) obese and lean individuals differed in their responses to an intraduodenal infusion of fat or saline and if their taste sensitivity to fats were also different, and 2) determine if taste and gastrointestinal fat sensitivity were related.</summary>
