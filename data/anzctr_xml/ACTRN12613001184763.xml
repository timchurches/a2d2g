  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individuals with Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (MdDS) will receive eight treatments of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, twice per week for four weeks. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation will be administered using a Magstim Rapidstim system with a 70 mm figure of eight air-cooled coil applied to the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex. To identify the correct region, patients will wear a snug fitted cap, fitted to individual anatomical landmarks (anteriorly at the glabella, posteriorly at the occipital protuberance and laterally at the external auditory meatus). The cap is pre-marked areas from the accepted 10-20 electroencephalography system with the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at region F3. The repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment will be at a frequency of 10 Hz, of 45 sets of 40 pulses per set (4 seconds duration per set) and a rest period per set of 26 seconds. Overall the duration of each visit will be 30 minutes (which includes patient set up).</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex. Sham treatment will be administered using a Magstim 70 mm figure of eight air-cooled sham coil that is identical in look, sound and percussion to a real 70 mm coil. However, the sham coil does not have any conducting material and does not induce any current.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mal de Debarquement Syndrome is a rare condition whereby the person has continued perception of rocking and imbalance, usually occurring after a cruise, aircraft flight, or other sustained motion event. In many cases this continued perception of motion recedes after several hours or days. However in some cases persistent Mal de Debarquement Syndrome will last for years and decades. It has only recently received attention and very little scientific research has been conducted. However, the limited research to date has suggested that this condition is due to changes in excitability within the brain. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of repetitive brain stimulation on people with Mal de Debarquement Syndrome. Individuals with this condition will receive eight sessions of repetitive brain stimulation, an established and safe technique, versus sham. Tests of brain excitability, balance testing, and self-reported perception of balance in daily activities will be undertaken prior to and at the end of the brain stimulation intervention, with self-reported perception of balance in daily activities followed up at six and eight weeks post intervention. It is hypothesised that those who received the real brain stimulation treatment will reduce symptoms in imbalance compared to those receiving sham. It is also hypothesised that brain excitability will reduce in those receiving the real treatment compared to sham treatment.</summary>
