  <interventions>
    <interventions>Balanced resection: This is a method whereby the surgeon uses a tensor balancer device to distract the joint to be able to produce an equal and rectangular flexion/extension gap through ligament balancing before the femoral cuts are made. The duration is usually no longer than 15 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Measured resection: This is a method whereby the surgeon makes all his bony cuts then proceeds to produce an equal and rectangular flexion/extension gap through ligament balancing once trial components are in place. The duration is usually no longer than 90 minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional - improvement in knee score using the International Knee Society Score (IKS), SF-12 survey and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) short-form survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Prior to the procedure at pre-admissions then 6 weeks, 3, 6,12 and 24 months, 5 and 10 years after the procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiological:
Alignment measured using long-leg standing films using lines of the anatomical axis and the knee joint line.
Rotation through Perth Protocol CT-Scan</outcome>
      <timepoint>Alignment measured at baseline prior to procedure, and both alignment and rotation measured at 6 weeks post procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Range of motion using a goniometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline prior to procedure and 6 weeks, 3, 6,12 and 24 months, 5 and 10 years post procedure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infection rate: assessed by clinical presentation deemed to be an infected joint by the treating surgeon, requiring washout. Will be classified as deep if involving joint capsule and superficial if not involving joint capsule, as deemed by operative notes during washout.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks, 3, 6,12 and 24 months, 5 and 10 years post procedure the records will be checked for any notes regarding an infection.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to identify which of the two most commonly used techniques for ligament balancing results in better functional and radiological outcomes in total knee replacements. The difference between the two techniques is mainly regarding the order things are done. In one technique (balanced resection), the tibial bone cut is made and the joint is opened up using a distracter device and the ligaments balanced before the femoral bone cuts are made. In the other method (measured resection) all the bone cuts are made prior to ligament balancing. Ligament balancing is described simply as a way of obtaining a rectangular and even flexion/extension gap by modifying the ligaments around the knee.</summary>
