    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Fampridine

Experimental: (BIIB041) Fampridine - All participants take 10 mg fampridine twice daily for the first 4 weeks. If deemed a treatment responder, a participant continues 10 mg fampridine twice daily for 44 weeks. Treatment non-responders can continue without treatment by completing quality of life questionnaires.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Physical Component Scale (PCS) of the Short Form 36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36) At Months 3, 6, 9, and 12: Responders - The SF-36 determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the PCS score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary (MCS) score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range: 0=worst to 100=best). Increases from baseline indicate improvement. Within-group least squares means are presented.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the PCS of the SF-36 at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12: Responders Versus Non-responders - The SF-36 determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Items 1-4 primarily contribute to the PCS score of the SF-36. Items 5-8 primarily contribute to the MCS score of the SF-36. Scores on each item are summed and averaged (range: 0=worst to 100=best). Increases from baseline indicate improvement. The 'overall' estimate is the average change from baseline over the whole time period (through Month 12). In contrast to the primary endpoint, this analysis was done using data from both responder and non-responder groups; therefore, 'responder group' and 'visit by responder group interaction' were included as fixed effects.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) Physical Score at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 - The MSIS-29 is a disease specific patient-reported outcome measure that has been developed and validated to examine the physical and psychological impact of MS from a patient's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. Sum of 20 physical condition items converted into a 0-100 score range, where missing items are imputed by average of total of non-missing items when no more than 50% are missing (otherwise the total score is missing). A lower total score indicates less physically-related impact while a higher total score indicates greater physically-related impact on a participant's functioning. Decreases from Baseline indicate improvement. A mixed effect model for repeated measures was used for this analysis. An unstructured covariance was used to model within-participant error. The 'overall' estimate is the average change from baseline over the whole time period (through Month 12).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Percent Work Time Missed Due to MS, by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) Questionnaire at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 - WPAI-SHP is a 6-question participant-rated questionnaire to determine degree to which a specific health problem affected work productivity while at work and outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism (percentage of work time missed) and presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), overall work impairment score combining absenteeism and presenteeism, and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Score range: 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 100 (completely affected/impaired). WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. A decrease from Baseline indicates improvement.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Activities Limitation Scale of the PRIMUS at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 by Whether Taking Additional MS Therapy - The PRIMUS activity measure is a 15-item assessment of patient-reported activities of daily living. The total score was calculated as sum of all 15 items converted into a 0-30 range, where missing items were imputed by average of non-missing total when no more than 50% of items were missing (otherwise, the total score is missing). Higher score indicates worse condition. A decrease from Baseline indicates improvement. A mixed effect model for repeated measures was used for this analysis. An unstructured covariance was used to model within-participant error. The 'overall' estimate is the average change from baseline over the whole time period (through Month 12).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Current Health State of EQ-5D VAS at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 by Whether Taking Additional MS Therapy - EQ-5D is a participant-answered questionnaire containing a descriptive system of 5 dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and a VAS on health state. The EQ-5D VAS ranges from 0 (worst health state) to 100 (best health state). An increase from baseline indicates improvement. A mixed effect model for repeated measures was used for this analysis.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Index Scores of EQ-5D at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 by Whether Taking Additional MS Therapy - EQ-5D is a participant-answered questionnaire containing a descriptive system on 5 dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and a VAS on health state. The scores on the 5 dimensions of descriptive system can be converted into an index score by applying UK weights. EQ-5D index score ranges from 1 to -0.59, and 1 reflects the best outcome. An increase from baseline indicates improvement. A mixed effect model for repeated measures was used for this analysis. An unstructured covariance was used to model within-participant error.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Percent Work Time Missed Due to MS on the WPAI-SHP Questionnaire at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12 by Whether Taking Additional MS Therapy - WPAI-SHP is a 6-question participant-rated questionnaire to determine degree to which a specific health problem affected work productivity while at work and outside of work. Four scores are derived: percentage of absenteeism (percentage of work time missed) and presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), overall work impairment score combining absenteeism and presenteeism, and percentage of impairment in activities performed outside of work. Score range: 0 (not affected/no impairment) to 100 (completely affected/impaired). WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. A decrease from Baseline indicates improvement. A mixed effect model for repeated measures was used for this analysis. An unstructured covariance was used to model within-participant error. The 'overall' estimate is the average change from baseline over the whole time period (through Month 12).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the effect of long-term treatment with
      prolonged-release fampridine (BIIB041) 10 mg twice daily on the physical component scale
      (PCS) of the Short Form 36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36) as reported by treatment
      responders. The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the change in the PCS of
      the SF-36 between treatment responders and non-responders, to evaluate change from baseline
      in additional quality of life measures among treatment responders as well as changes from
      baseline in treatment responders versus non-responders and to assess the safety and
      tolerability of prolonged-release fampridine 10 mg twice daily.</summary>
