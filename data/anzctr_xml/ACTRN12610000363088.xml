      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of F-627 at 30ug/kg, 60ug/kg,120ug/kg &amp; 240ug/kg will be assessed on the basis of adverse events reported (such as spenomegaly, bone pain) , vital signs , routine safety blood samples (clinical chemistry, haematology) and abdominal ultrasound for the assessment of splenomegaly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be continuously monitored whilst they are on study as an inpatient for 3 days following dose administration, and then via a series of clinic visits at Days 4,5,6,7,9,11,13 and 15 post study drug administration.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neutropenia is a complex haematological disorder charactarised by a abnormally low level of neutrophils in the blood. F-627 is being developed to treat neutropenia especially for the management of neutropenia in patients with cancer.

F-627 is being developed by Generon (Shanghai) Corporation to provide additional benefits to cancer patients by shortening the duration and lessening the severity of neutropenia after chemotherapy.

The purpose of this study is to researech the safety of the use of F-627 in Healthy Male Volunteers. There will be no benefits from participating in this trial, Patients will receive only one dose of study drug.</summary>
