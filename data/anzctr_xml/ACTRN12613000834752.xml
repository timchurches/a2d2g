    <interventions>Traditional medicine (four plant extracts prepared in two capsules) plus standard category II regime (4 FDC - Rifampicin plus Isoniazid plus Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol plus Injection Streptomycin) for 150 category II pulmonary TB patients.
The trial drugs contain alkaloids, flavonoids and tannins. One dose contains plant 1 extract 233 mg, plant 2 extract 96 mg, plant 3 extract 34 mg and plant 4 extract 10.4 mg.plant 1 is Azardichata indica , plant 2 is Desmodium triquetrium plant 3 is Alpinia galaca, and plant 4 is Acorus calamus. All drugs will be given once a day at evening for 8 months duration. The monitoring will be done by counting of capsules returned and family member/voluntary health workers will observe regular taking of trial drugs by subjects.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>-	After obtaining informed consent from the eligible Cat II patients, screening form will be used for history taking, physical examination and laboratory investigations for recruitment. 
-	Eligible patients will then be asked to participate in the lottery system in the block randomization procedure.

Subject will be screened only after explaining the purpose and the schedule of the study and obtaining a written informed consent from him/her. 
Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory investigations will be done at the start of patient recruitment and will be recorded. Subjects will be recruited randomly into two groups. One group will receive 3 capsules of traditional medicine with Cat II regime and another group will be received 3 capsules of placebo with Cat II regime for 8 months.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomization will be used with three trial drug and three placebo in each block.

Preparation will be made to conceal allocation on type of treatment received. The capsules and the bottle containing capsules will be prepared to have the same appearance for treatment group and placebo group. Identification number (id) will be prepared for these bottles by the investigator so that no one except the investigator knows the type of treatment received among patients. Computer generated  block randomization method will be used and each block will have an equal number of treatment and placebo 

Envelopes will be used to put the pieces of papers. Each envelope will consist of a piece of paper on which the number is indicated to select coded bottle of trial drug or placebo.
Eight envelopes containing eight serial numbers will be packed together so that each packet will consist of eight numbers and there will be 38 packets of envelopes for total 300 patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The general objective of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of four Myanmar medicinal plants on tuberculosis patients, both in terms of therapeutics (sputum conversion and chest X-ray improvement, etc.). A double-blind randomized controlled trial will be carried out on 300 Category II pulmonary tuberculosis patients to deliver standard anti-TB drugs for CAT II therapy plus capsule containing traditional medicine for 150 patients in one group. Another group will receive CAT II therapy with placebo capsule containing 500 mg starch. The capsules of placebo will look similar to the capsule of traditional medicine. 

Subjects will be recruited from the Outpatient Departments/National TB Program areas. Baseline demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory investigations will be done at the start of patient recruitment and will be recorded in all 11 visits (screening visit, day of initiation of the trial, follow-up visits in weeks from initiation of treatment - 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32). 
They will be instructed to consume 3 capsules once a day (evening). Medication compliance will be documented by pill counting at all visits. Unused medication will be checked and taken back.


Treatment evaluation will be assessed by sputum clearance time, radiographic improvement, weight gain, incidence of adverse events by each visit. The efficacy and safety data will be analysed using Intention to Treat analysis. Statistical analysis will be done using Chi-squared test. The level of significance for all analysis will be taken as p&lt;0.05. Interim analysis of recruited patients will be carried out at three monthly intervals. Multivariable logistic regression analysis will be performed. The research findings will provide national TB programme to support treatment of TB by traditional medicine and help in prevention of MDR-TB.
