  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the treatment group, each participant will be given a single dose of 8 mg Dexamethasone diluted with 0.9% NaCl solution to 10ml total via intravenous route. They will be admitted for routine care in the observation ward of the emergency department until they meet discharge criteria. Routine care consists of a standardized regimen of regular analgesia (paracetamol+codeine, iburprofen, PRN Oxycodone) and physiotherapy referral/education. Discharge criteria include: mobilizing safely without assistance, tolerable pain levels, self-caring</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control group, each participant will be given a dose of 10mL of 0.9% NaCl solution via intravenous route as placebo. The patient will then be admitted for routine care in the observation ward of the emergency department. Routine care consists of regular analgesia (paracetamol+codeine, ibuprofen, PRN endone) and physiotherapy referral/education.</comparator>

  <trial_design>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At triage, potential participants will be flagged and an assessment of the patient will be conducted by a consultant, registrar, senior house officer or research assistant to determine their eligibility for the study. Consent will then be taken from the participants prior to randomization into test or control groups.

Patients are allocated to either treatment or control group using sequentially-numbered opaque sealed envelopes. Each SNOSE will have an allocation sequence printed on a 6x10cm paper, folded half three times, then placed in each  SNOSE. Each included patient will receive a sequence number which corresponds with SNOSE allocation sequence. 

The SNOSE are to be opened only by an independent nurse after a patient has been consented and ready for allocation to either control or treatment group to maintain allocation concealment.

The research assistant / treating doctor / bedside nurse will hand over the SNOSE to a nurse, independent of the study, who will be the only person allowed to read the instructions to either draw up the control drug (10ml of 0.9% NaCl) or experimental drug (8mg IV Dexamethasone diluted with 0.9% NaCl to 10ml total) in a syringe labelled with the corresponding sequence number. This syringe will then be given to the RA who will give the syringe to treating nurse or doctor who will administer the medication to the patient.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation is done by independent statistician using 6 sets of blocks of 10, stratified for each hospital. The randomisation sequence will be transferred to sequentially-numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE). The code sequence is to be kept by an independent person. The allocation sequence is printed on a 6x10cm paper, folded half three times, then placed in individual SNOSE. Each included patient will receive a sequence number which corresponds with SNOSE allocation sequence.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based on current medical literature, there are some suggestions that a single dose of steroid treatment may help improve back pain due to low back pain with radiculopathy. However, the research this has been based on has not been performed in the Emergency Department (ED), or do not necessarily measure important factors such as return to normal functioning, visual analogue pain scores or improvement in straight leg raise.

The aim of project is to measure and compare the effect of a single dose of intravenous steroid treatment (8 mg of Dexamethasone) versus a placebo (normal saline) on visual analogue pain scores. We are also trying to measure the time to return to normal functional level, improvement in straight leg raising and improvement in Oswestry Disability Index symptom scores. The overall aim is to make a recommendation regarding management of patients with acute back pain and radiculopathy.</summary>
