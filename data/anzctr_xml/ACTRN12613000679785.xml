  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for tracheal intubation (MACTI); Patients responses to tracheal intubation were classified as no movement or movement. No movement was defined as the absence of purposeful movement of the extremities, movement of the vocal cords preventing intubation, and coughing or bucking during or immediately after intubation. The values of MACTI were obtained by calculating the midpoint concentration of all independent response cross-overs in which a positive response was followed by a negative response.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sevoflurane is generally employed for inhalation induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation in children without muscle relaxant.Clinical trials have demonstrated that intranasal dexmedetomidine is an effective sedative for premedication in children.The ability of dexmedetomidine to reduce both the inhalation anesthetic and opioid analgesic requirements has been confirmed previously. However, to date, the effects of dexmedetomidine premedication on the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane for tracheal intubation (MACTI) in pediatric patients is still undetermined. </summary>
