  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the bone ingrowth after implantation of the study
      device. This study will also document any device-related surgical complications or adverse
      radiographic observations. Improvement in pain, function, and health economic data will be
      compared with improvements documented with other joint systems.</summary>
