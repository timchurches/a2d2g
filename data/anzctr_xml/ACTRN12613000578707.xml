  <interventions>
    <interventions>Negative suggestion - prior to inserting an intra-venous cannula, the patient will have local anaesthetic injected at the site of insertion subcutaneously and will be told that this will be painful in itself. This negative suggestion will be repeated prior to insertion of the IV cannula, and prior to the subsequent insertion of local anaesthetic at the insertion site of the combined spinal epidural (CSE), and prior to the insertion of the CSE itself. Pain and anxiety scores will be assessed after injections of local anaesthetic, and after the subsequent intravenous cannulation or insertion of combined spinal epidural. </interventions>
    <comparator>Positive suggestion - prior to inserting an intra-venous cannula, the patient will have local anaesthetic injected at the site of insertion subcutaneously and will be told this will numb the area and make intravenous cannulation comfortable. This positive suggestion will be repeated prior to insertion of the IV cannula, prior to insertion of local anaesthetic at the insertion site of the combined spinal epidural (CSE), and prior to insertion of the CSE itself. Pain and anxiety scores will be assessed after injections of local anaesthetic, and after the subsequent intravenous cannulation or insertion of combined spinal epidural.</comparator>

    <concealment>Enrollment of eligible patients will take place either in the elective Caesarian section pre-admission clinic or on the ward / theatre holding bay prior to any intervention. The patient will be given a description of the study verbally and on an information sheet, all questions will be answered and informed consent will be gained from the patient.
Consenting women will be randomised by computer-generated random number sequence into either:
- Placebo group (positive suggestion)
- nocebo group (negative suggestion)
Group assignments will be kept in sealed opaque envelopes numbered sequentially. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The intention-to-treat principle will govern all analyses.
Univariate data will be expressed as mean (+/- standard deviation (SD)) for parametric data, and median (range) for non-parametric data. Analysis will be done using Student's unpaired t-test, Mann-Whitney sum rank test and Fisher Exact test as appropriate. All hypothesis tests will be two-tailed, and P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data will be analysed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows statistical software.
A sample size of 90 , with 45 per treatment group, achieves &gt;80% power with alpha 0.05, to detect a 30% difference in VAS pain and anxiety scores. This is based on a median pain score of 5 (IQR: 3-6) in the group receiving standard negative language prior to a painful procedure (nocebo group). To account for withdrawals the total sample will be increased to 100. This has been calculated using Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) statistical software, NCSS, Kaysville, UT, 2005).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We intend to assess the effects of negative suggestion / communication styles on the patient's perception of pain and anxiety during subsequent multiple painful procedures (Local anaesthetic injection, IV cannulation and combined spinal epidural insertion). We will compare these outcomes with the effects that positive suggestion / communication styles has on perception of pain and anxiety during subsequent multiple painful procedures (local anaesthetic injection, IV cannulation and epidural insertion).

Null hypothesis = negative or positive styles of communication before painful procedures will have no effect on patient's perception of pain and anxiety during subsequent multiple painful procedures.    </summary>
