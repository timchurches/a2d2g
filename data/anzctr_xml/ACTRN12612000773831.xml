  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 intervention arms to this RCT:
1) Control - infants who have been prescribed and commence medications for suspected reflux
2) Maternal elimination diet (food allergy), which involves eliminating 2 food proteins from the maternal diet for a period of 2 weeks only, the eliminated foods will be re-introduced in the week following dietary elimination, food frequency questionnaires will be completed by participants to test for compliance to the elimination diet.
3) Maternal elimination diet (food intolerance), which involves eliminating highly fermentable carbohydrate foods for a period of 2 weeks only, the eliminated foods will be re-introduced in the week following dietary elimination, food frequency questionnaires will be completed by participants to test for compliance to the elimination diet.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will now comprise mothers of infants prescribed and commencing a medication for suspected reflux
The intervention groups (2 &amp; 3) will receive maternal dietary modification only</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1): changes in crying duration and intensity in infants aged 0-4 months. Mothers are required to complete a series of paper based tools for recording their infant's crying, fussiness. The crying diaries are a modified Barr Baby Diary, this has been extensively validated in research. Crying diaries are kept for 3 consecutive days in weeks 1-3 and daily in week 4.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline (pre intervention) 3 consecutive days in week 0
Measured again in weeks 1 &amp; 2 (1st &amp; 2nd weeks of intervention) on 3 consecutive days
Measured again in week 3 (reintroduction of eliminated foods) on 7 consecutive days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2): Changes in bowel motions of infants aged 0-4 months. Mothers are required to track thier infant's toileting habits daily for the duration of their involvement with this project, a total of 4 weeks. This chart is based on the Amsterdam Infant Stool Chart, which has been extensively validated through research.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily by mothers/carers completing toileting charts, daily until the end of this study, a total of 4 weeks duration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Prevalence of food allergy among this cohort</outcome>
      <timepoint>Allergy status of mothers and their infants will be assessed through blood sampling and analysis, at the beginning of their particiaption in this study; and through Atopy Patch Testing at the end of their participation in this study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) Prevalence of food intolerance among this cohort, as assessed by the effects on the infant (toileting and crying) of the reintroduction of the eliminated foods in the maternal diet.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is assessed in the dietary intervention groups through the reintroduction of foods in week 3</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Mothers must be exclusively feeding their infant aged 0-4 months

    <exclusivecriteria>The following exclusion criteria have been developed to ensure that both mother and infant participating in this study are otherwise well and healthy. Mothers who are experiencing post natal deperession will be ineligible to participate, a pre-screening process is insitu for the assessment of PND. 

In addition, infants that are unwell or under medical investigation for underlying pathology associated with their 'colic' will be deemed ineligible to participate. This is assessed through a 'medical clearance to participate' visit to their family GP for the infant. Infants without medical clearance will be ineligible to participate in this project. Infants whose crying is assessed as not 'colicky' through the pre-screening process will also be deemed ineligible to participate. this pre-screening process has been developed to ensure that participating infants fulfill the medical criteria for infant colic.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will self-refer. Randomisation will occur after the consent and pre-screening processes are completed. 

The allocation concealment was acheived by central randomisation by computer. The primary invesitgator is blinded to the randomisation process. The enrolled participants will be blinded to the details of the other treatment groups, this is imperative as it reduces the effect of bias in this study.

Randomisation is achieved through 'Block Randomisation', which is done by the investigator's primary supervisor. The participants continue to be blinded to the details of the other treatment group</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation is achieved through 'Block Randomisation', which is done by the investigator's primary supervisor. The participants continue to be blinded to the details of the other treatment group. A total of 69 participants is required for this new protocol</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The researcher will be blinded to the randomisation process, however, the researcher (an accredited practising dietitian) is required to educate the participants on theri specific dietary intervention, so she will not be blinded to the participants in each group. The Participants will be blinded to other participants in other treatment groups. This research involves maternal dietary manipulation to determine its effects on the gastrointestinal/immune system of their exclusively breastfed infants aged 0-4 months.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to investigate the association between maternal diet and colic, irritability, reflux, atopy and gastrointestinal dysfunction in exclusively breast-fed infants aged zero to four months; and to develop an evidenced based treatment algorithm for the non-invasive treatment of colic and associated symptoms in infants. 

A series of hypotheses have been developed for this study, these include. 

H1: Food allergy contributes significantly to persistent infant colic and other symptoms of allergic disease in exclusively breast fed infants. Thereby, eliminating major contributors to food allergy, specifically CMP and hens egg from the maternal diet significantly reduces persistent infant colic and other symptoms suggestive of protein specific food allergies in exclusively breast fed infants aged birth to four months.
H2: Food intolerance contributes significantly to persistent infant colic in infants aged birth to four months. Eliminating major contributors to food intolerance, specifically, high FODMAP foods from the maternal diet significantly reduces persistent infant colic and other symptoms suggestive of food intolerance in exclusively breast fed babies.
H3: The Vitamin D status of the mother and infant affects the predisposition to food allergy/intolerance in exclusively breast-fed infants aged birth to four months.
H4: Breast milk composition with regard to microbiota profile is associated with allergy in infants aged birth to four months.
H5: Sensory processing disorders (sensory hypersensitivity) contributes to infant colic.
