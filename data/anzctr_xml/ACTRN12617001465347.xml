  <interventions>
    <interventions>The maternal diet rich in eggs and peanuts intervention group: Regular maternal consumption of 6 eggs and 60 peanuts (= 2 handfuls) per week from birth until 6 months infant age.
Participating women will be able to include all forms of egg and peanut, and egg and peanut containing foods, towards their weekly target of egg and peanut ingestion. They will be provided with a conversion table showing the amount present in common egg or peanut foods, for example peanut butter, or egg in quiche, or in baked goods.
Both groups of women will be provided with a supply of both peanuts and peanut butter to reduce costs of participation in this trial and to assist with intervention compliance. Due to the reduced shelf-life of eggs these will need to be purchased by the participants themselves.
Compliance: Participants will be in contact with the research team each month during the intervention period, either via a telephone call (at 1, 2 and 5 months of infant age) or in person at an appointment (at 3-4 and 6 months of infant age). During these contact time points the participants will be asked to recall their dietary intake of egg and peanut containing foods over the preceding week and this information will be used to assess intervention compliance. Comprehensive breastfeeding data will also be collected during these contact time points. The intervention group dietary advice will be given by the recruitment research assistant who will also collect dietary compliance data, but not collect any outcome assessment data. Our experience has found that monthly participant contact throughout the intervention period maximises compliance and follow-up.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis Plan:  For outcome measurements with detection thresholds, for example IgG4 concentrations, Tobit regression models will be used, with treatment effects described using ratios of means and 95% confidence intervals. The secondary binary outcomes food allergy, eczema and wheeze will be analysed using log binomial regression models, with treatment effects described using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. 

Sample size calculations: The primary outcome for this study will be egg and peanut-specific IgG4 antibody levels. The expected prevalence of detectable egg and peanut-specific IgG4 concentrations in the intervention group is 88% compared to the control group 22%. For 90% power and 95% confidence (alpha-value 0.05), we require 22 mother-infant pairs per group. To allow for up to 30% ceasing breastfeeding prior to 6 months of age, we will recruit a total of 64 participants (mother-infant pairs).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Regular consumption of traditionally allergenic foods, like egg and peanut, in solid foods can reduce food allergies, however this is too late for some infants.  We have discovered that infant immune responses to egg can be beneficially enhanced during the first six weeks of breastfeeding when mothers eat more eggs. We now propose to investigate the effects of breastfeeding mothers eating higher dietary intakes of both egg and peanut for an extended period of the first six months of life. The key translatable message from this project will be to answer the question of whether higher maternal dietary intakes of eggs and peanuts during breastfeeding are needed to reduce the risk of food allergy development.</summary>
