  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Potency and Continence before and after EERPE. These parameters are going to be assessed by a single question for each:
For Potency ''Do you have normal erections without the use of PDE-5 inhibitors?'' If the answer is YES we consider the patient potent and via versa.
For Continence ''Is there any urinary incontinence?'' If the answer is NO and there is not leakage at all we consider the patient continent and via versa.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 3 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical complications after the operation using the modified Clavien System.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All the complications are going to be recorded during the early and late postoperatively day. On dishcarge day and on 3 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oncologic outcome. This is going to be assessed by means of PSM (Positive Surgical Margins) and PSA.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>EERPE is an alternative surgical method in the treatment of localised prostate cancer, but all surgeons are not yet familiar with laparoscopic skillis. This study is initiating to evaluate this procedure with regard to continence, erectile function and oncologic outcome in a single centre without previous experience.</summary>
