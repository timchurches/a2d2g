    <interventions>Methylphenidate hydrochloride.
Oral administration of compounded product in opaque gelatin capsules identical to comparator.
Dose 0.3 mg/kg twice daily (8am &amp; 12pm).
There are 6 trial days (Mon, Wed, Fri) over a two week period. The 6 sessions are divided into three blocks: Days 1 &amp; 2, Days 3 &amp; 4, Days 5 &amp; 6. One session of each block is randomly assigned as a methylphenidate session and the other as a placebo session.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Consecutive admissions to the ABI ward at Epworth Rehabilitation were screened for suitability to participate in the study. Those eligible were asked if they wished to participate in the trial by their treating physician. Once patients had given informed written consent the investigator was contacted and provided with patient details. The trial investigator then contacted the holder of the allocation schedule for methylphenidate/placebo randomisation who was based in the hospital pharmacy (not part of the rehabilitation team), and the patient's trial randomisation was allocated.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in disabling impairments of attention and speed of information processing, which prevent patients from returning to previous life roles. Methylphenidate primarily acts upon dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems which mediate attentional processes, and are disrupted by TBI. Previous treatment study findings with methylphenidate have been mixed, and many have recruited patients many years post-injury. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of methylphenidate in the amelioration of attention deficits during the acute rehabilitation phase. Forty participants with TBI and 40 healthy controls were seen for a one-off two hour baseline assessment session in order to identify the nature of attentional impairment following TBI. The TBI group were then recruited into the randomised, crossover, placebo controlled drug trial of two weeks duration.</summary>
