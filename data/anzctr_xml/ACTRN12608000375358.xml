  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 months (3 times per week, 1 hour per session) progressive resistance training exercise using a multistation hydraulic resistance training system (Hydra-Gym), leg cycling ergometers and a set of 5 stairs. The Hydra-Gym has 6 resistance settings for each movement. All participants started on setting 2 and progression to the next resistance setting was determined by the number of repetitions achieved within a given work interval in the two previous training sessions.  When a patient remained symptom-free and recorded an increase of 25% in the number of repetitions achieved in a work interval during two consecutive training sessions, the resistance of that particular resistance activity was increased to the next setting.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to identify whether resistance (weight) training results in improvements in fitness and well being for patients with stable chronic systolic heart failure. Systolic heart failure is a condition where the heart muscle cannot pump blood as vigorously as usual. Resistance exercise training involves the use of muscle groups to push and pull against a smooth hydraulic force. In this study participants are randomly allocated to 3 months of either resistance exercise training or no exercise training. Tests are carried out before, during and after the 3-month period to determine differences between the 2 groups in a number of measures of fitness and well being.</summary>
