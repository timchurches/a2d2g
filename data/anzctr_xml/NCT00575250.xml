  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We wish to investigate whether a weekly, 2½ hour group-based osteoporosis education
      intervention (the Osteoporosis Prevention and Self-Management Course), is different to one
      session course (1x 2½ hours) on osteoporosis knowledge, confidence to eat calcium-containing
      foods, confidence to exercise, and amount of exercise undertaken after three and nine months
      of follow-up in people aged over 50 years who have already had a bone fracture.</summary>
