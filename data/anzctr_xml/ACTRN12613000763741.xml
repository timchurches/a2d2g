  <interventions>
    <interventions>A trained medical scribe will assist an emergency physician during emergency consultations. They will take notes as directed and will assist with clerical tasks as directed. The intervention will take place for four consecutive weeks commencing September 9th 2013. </interventions>
    <comparator>An emergency physician will carry out their usual work without the assistance of a medical scribe which includes their usual note taking and clerical duties. Emergency physician shifts matched in advance for physician, day, time and work area will be selected from July and August shifts in 2013.  </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All scribed shifts and scribed patient encounters during the trial period including any where the scribe was supposed to be present but wasn't. If the scribe was asked to leave an encounter by the patient or physician the encounter will be included in the analysis.

The physicians enrolled to participate will be a convenience sample of physicians available during the specified time period. They will be voluntarily consenting to participate.

The scribe used will be one trained scribe identified in advance. This scribe will work with all the physicians.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The scribed shifts will be allocated to selected willing participant physicians a month preceeding the trial intervention. 
The physicians will be regular cabrini physicians who are agreable to participate in the trial. These physicians will be aware of the trial aims.
The scribe will attend for a month and will work preallocated shifts with the physicians.
The patient encounters within each shift will not be able to be chosen as these are defined by rules surrounding patient allocation that are always the same. 
There is computer generated allocation of the next patient to be seen and there are shift rules around regional allocation of emergency department physician allocation of work duties. 
These are closely enforced and only interrupted by a patient requiring resuscitation or immediate medical attention.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The minimal clinical effect size that would be useful to pursue would be an efficiency gain from 1.0 patient per hour to 1.2 patients per hour (a 20% increase). 
A sample size of 100 in each period would allow this difference to be detected at a 5% significance level and 80% power (two-sided) assuming a relatively conservative estimate of the SD of the number of patients seen per hour of 0.5.
The mean number of encounters per hour will be compared for the two groups using t-tests. Similarly, the mean billing rates, staff satisfaction and patient waiting times will be compared for the groups using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a rising medical cost base in emergency medicine. There is a rising seniority of medical staff required to safely perform the role of physician in an emergency department. The currently accepted productivity of a FACEM is one patient per hour. Much of this time is spent writing and printing notes, faxing documents and contacting physicians. None of this work requires the skill set of an emergency physician and could be performed by a well-trained medical scribe or secretary. 

To date scribes have not been used in Australian Emergency Departments and offer a novel way of addressing emergency physician productivity without compromising the quality of emergency physician work.

The degree that a medical scribe increases emergency physician productivity in emergency medicine in Australia has not been determined.

This is a pilot trial to investigate whether a medical scribe would increase emergency physician efficiency</summary>
