  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: DBT Group program (MHREC: 2015/006): 
* The program will run for 12 weeks.  Each group will meet each week for approximately 1 hr (50 minutes).
* The program will be run by DBT qualified clinical Masters students (Psychology)
* The following timeline will be used:
1. Week 1-2 - Baseline measures
2. Week 3-110 - Deliver program
3. Week 11-12 - Post measures
    * Week 1 - Activities on setting up the group rules/          outlining the group program. It will be explained to participants that no personal disclosures will be allowed. 
    * Week 2 - Core Mindfulness
    * Week 3-4 - Distress Tolerance
    * Week 5-6 - Emotion Regulation
    * Week 7-8 - Interpersonal Effectiveness
    * Week 9-10 - Walking the Middle Path
    * Week 11 - Review
    * Week 12 - Closing session
3. Week 11-12 - Review and Conclusion
4. After group concludes - Collect measures
* Participants have the right to pass, to sit and observe, or to leave. Everyone in the group will be given the right to speak and to be treated with respect. 
* Participants will also be able to withdraw at any time without any repercussions and will be referred to a psychologist/support agency should they decide to withdraw.
* Students in the DBT group will be sent a short, online survey, once a week, in place of a manual diary entry.  This survey will be the same survey sent to participants in the ESM condition and will be sent to participants on a randomised schedule. 
Group 2: Online DBT skills program (MHREC: 2015/006): 
Participants will follow the same program outlined above, facilitated via online delivery.
</interventions>
    <comparator>ESM condition: Students participating in the ESM condition will be asked to download a survey application onto their personal mobile phone for the duration of the study (12 weeks)
* The survey will be a short 10-15 item questionnaire that will ask about the participant's current state.  It is expected that the questionnaire will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.
* All participants in the ESM component will be trained to use the survey application by the primary researcher and given detailed instructions regarding how and when to complete the survey.  
* As the purpose of this study is to observe real time events rather than apply an intervention, the participants will be instructed to follow their normal pattern of behaviour for the duration of the study.  
* Participants in the ESM only condition will receive daily requests to complete the survey on a semi-randomised schedule.

    <statisticalmethods>* The number of participants (n=48) to be recruited was based on the minimum number of participants required to evaluate the effectiveness of the DBT condition. 
* The number of participants is limited to 8 in each DBT group to ensure the groups are manageable. 
* Considering the power needed, in conjunction with the feasibility of group size and time taken to run the program (12 weeks), a minimum sample size of 48 participants was deemed adequate to evaluate the effectiveness of this pilot program. To achieve a change of .6 to .7 in the average value of each test from pre-test to post-test, with a standard deviation of 1.0 , the size of the sample being would need to be 32 (DBT) to achieve a statistical power of 80%, with an alpha level at 5%. 
* The dependent variables will be depression, anxiety, coping, emotional dysregulation and self-esteem. 
* Data will be collapsed across the DBT groups and the  ESM groups for statistical analyses. 
* To measure the effectiveness of the program, a repeated measures analysis will be conducted on the dependent variables between measurement at the initial baseline, and any changes throughout the program. 
* Attention will also be paid to clinically relevant indicators of change.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study aims to significantly add to existing research regarding the effectiveness of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) group-based programs and Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) interventions with young people (18-24 years). Research has found DBT to be an effective treatment model for adolescents who have a variety of mental health concerns, have trouble coping with their emotions or engage in risk behaviours (e.g. self-harm). Further, smart phone applications (ESM) designed to capture snapshots of daily experience and emotion have been used in mental health settings and found to reduce emotional distress and suicidal thinking.  The current study will evaluate both interventions to investigate whether there is an increase in participants positive coping behaviours, and whether they could be translated to other settings (e.g. health settings, gatekeeper organisations). Understanding the complex interaction between experiences, emotional vulnerabilities and risk factors, which influence poor coping behaviours such as self-harm, would greatly benefit clinical practice and further inform prevention and intervention policies.</summary>
