  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multinational, randomized, double-mask study comparing the efficacy and safety of peramivir administered intramuscularly versus placebo in adults with uncomplicated acute influenza.  Subjects will be stratified according to their current smoking behavior and centrally randomized to receive one of three treatments:
Treatment Group 1:  Peramivir 150mg
Treatment Group 2:  Peramivir 300mg

All treatment arms are a single once of intra-muscular injection. </interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment Group 3:  Placebo
Placebo will also be administred IM and is identical in colour, viscosity and pH.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of peramivir administered intramuscularly compared to placebo in adult subjects with uncomplicated acute influenza. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability will be examined at baseline, days 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, &amp; 14 by the Prinicapl Investiagor and daily by the patient using a safety diary.</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>2. Presence of fever at time of screening of =38.0 ºC (=100.4 ºF) taken orally, or =38.5 ºC (=101.2 ºF) taken rectally.  However, this requirement is waived if the subject has a history of fever within the 24 hours prior to screening and has been administered antipyretic(s) in the 6 hours prior to screening.3. Presence of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, or nasal symptoms) of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe)4. Presence of at least one constitutional symptom (headache, malaise, myalgia, sweats and/or chills, or fatigue) of any severity (mild, moderate, or severe)5. Onset of illness no more than 48 hours before presentation.  Note:  Time of onset of illness is defined as either (1) the time when the temperature (either oral or rectal) was first measured as elevated (at least one ºC of elevation-oral temperature), OR (2) the time when the subject experienced the presence of at least one respiratory symptom AND the presence of at least one constitutional symptom.6. Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) performed on an adequate specimen collected from an anterior nasal swab is positive.  A negative initial RAT may be repeated within one hour of obtaining a negative result. A second negative RAT result will exclude the subject from evaluation for enrollment.7. Females of childbearing potential must report one of the following: Be surgically sterile Have been sexually abstinent 4 weeks prior to date of screening evaluation and be willing to remain abstinent through 4 weeks after study drug administration Use oral contraceptives or other form of hormonal birth control including hormonal vaginal rings or transdermal patches and have been using these for 3 months prior through 4 weeks after study drug administration Use an intra-uterine device (IUD), or adequate barrier contraception (or double-barrier method such as condom or diaphragm with spermicidal gel or foam) as birth control 4 weeks prior to date of screening evaluation through 4 weeks after study drug administration.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective a single intra-venously administered dose of Peramivir will be at reducing the symptoms assoicated with uncomplicated Influenza. The success of the medication will be assessed through a patient diary, evaluating influenza symptoms. 
The Sponsor's of this study hypothesize that Peramivir as a single intra-venous injection will be effective at reducing the duration of influenza symptoms from 7 days to 5 days.</summary>
