  <interventions>
    <interventions>PB01 solution for oral inhalation is administered using a nebuliser and consists of PB01 in 20mM sodium phosphate buffer and 500mM sodium chloride, pH7. 

A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, two period crossover study in healthy male participants.  Over the two Treatment Periods, all participants will be randomised to receive a single orally inhaled dose of either 30mg PB01 or Placebo (in either sequence) at each Treatment Period. Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be administered by an Aerogen Aeroneb Go vibrating mesh nebuliser for a duration of 15 minutes. Participants will be trained on the use of the Aeroneb Go nebuliser. An inhaled lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (30 microgram) will be administered 1 hour post commencement of the IMP dose administration. The total dose of 30 microgram LPS (from Escherichia coli 026:B6 (Sigma)) will be delivered by a total of 5 inhalations using a calibrated breath activated nebuliser.

Following Screening, eligible participants will be admitted to the study unit on Treatment Period 1 Day 1 and will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PB01 followed by Placebo or Placebo followed by PB01 in a two period crossover design. IMP will be administered on Treatment Period 1 Day 1 followed by the LPS challenge. Administration of the IMP and LPS will be performed at the study unit under the supervision of the clinical site personnel and participants will be confined to the study unit overnight (i.e. 24 hours) and discharged from the study unit after completion of all study procedures on Treatment Period 1 Day 2.

There will be a minimum of 24 days and a maximum of 65 days wash-out between dosing on Treatment Period 1 Day 1 and Treatment Period 2 Day 1. 

At least 72 hrs and no more than 10 days prior to Treatment Period 2 Day 1 participants will attend a Baseline Visit which will include sputum sampling to determine eligibility to continue to Treatment Period 2.

On Treatment Period 2 Day 1, participants will be admitted to the study unit for IMP administration followed by the LPS challenge under the supervision of the clinical site personnel and participants will be confined to the study unit overnight (i.e. 24 hours) and discharged from the study unit after completion of all study procedures on Treatment Period 2 Day 2. 

An End of Study visit will be performed 7 days (+ 5 days) after the last dose of IMP (i.e on Day 8 (+5)). 

The maximum planned study duration will be 99 days per participant.

The investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate IMP accountability records throughout the study. Drug accountability will be performed by the monitor during monitoring visits to reconcile the number of IMP vials dispensed with that used/returned.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo solution for oral inhalation contains vehicle only, which consists of 20mM sodium phosphate buffer and 500mM sodium chloride, pH 7.

Participants will be randomised in a ratio of 1:1 to either PB01 followed by Placebo or Placebo followed by PB01 in a two period crossover design. Over the two treatment periods, all participants will receive a single orally inhaled dose of either 30mg PB01 or Placebo (in either sequence) at each Treatment Period.</comparator>
