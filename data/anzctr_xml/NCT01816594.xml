  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - BKM120
Treatment: drugs - Trastuzumab
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Trastuzumab + BKM120 + paclitaxel - BKM120 (oral, pan-class I PI3K inhibitor) in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.

Placebo Comparator: Trastuzumab + BKM120 placebo + paclitaxel - BKM120 placebo in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel


Treatment: drugs: BKM120
Neo-adjuvant BKM120 (oral pan-class I PI3K inhibitor, continuous daily dosing). BKM120 will be administered orally 100 mg/day.

Treatment: drugs: Trastuzumab
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular juxtamembrane domain of the HER2 receptor. Administered 4mg/kg i.v. load followed by 2mg/kg i.v. weekly.

Treatment: drugs: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic agent with proven antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors. The antitumor activity of paclitaxel is based on tubulin-binding and stabilization of non-functional microtubule bundles, thereby blocking normal mitotic spindle development and subsequent cell division. Administered weekly 80mg/m2 i.v.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Neoadjuvant BKM120 placebo Administered orally 100 mg/day.
