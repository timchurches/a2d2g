  <interventions>
    <interventions>6-minute walk test, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, NYHA classification, Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, Echocardiogram and CMR will all be performed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.  To complete all these investigations would take approximately 2 hours, at each time point.  We will examine the relationship between these parameters and response to conventional heart failure therapy.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart Failure (HF) is a leading cause of heart disease and mortality in developed countries. It is the leading reason for hospital admission among patients over 65 years and the most costly cardiovascular disorder in Western countries. A first hospital admission for HF has been shown to confer a worse prognosis than a first admission for bowel or breast cancer. The burden of HF is expected to increase in Australia due to the ageing population and improved survival from acute cardiac events. New cardiac imaging tools, such as cardiac MRI and novel applications of echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart), now permit an insight into some of the fundamental processes that underlie why some individuals dont respond to conventional HF treatment. In particular, our research will focus on the scarring within the heart muscle, and the loss of coordination of the heart as it pumps, in perpetuating the vicious HF cycle.  Furthermore, we will explore the role of a simple blood test, to measure markers of scarring from the heart, in predicting patient outcomes in the setting of a new diagnosis of HF. An understanding of these elements in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy will help clarify the mechanistic cascade of HF, and may thus lead to novel therapies to interrupt such an adverse process. This research may thus change the way cardiomyopathy is viewed and treated.</summary>
