  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Licensed 4CMenB vaccine

Active Comparator: Group A - Students within schools randomised to group A will receive two doses of licensed 4CMenB vaccine after baseline oropharyngeal swab with an interval of 1 to 2 months between doses, with the first dose given at the baseline visit in 2017.

No Intervention: Group B - Students within schools randomised to group B will receive the licensed 4CMenB vaccine following completion of baseline and 12 month oropharyngeal swab in 2018.


Other interventions: Licensed 4CMenB vaccine
Two doses (0.5 mL each) of Bexsero Â® vaccine at least 1 month to &lt;3 months apart in adolescents.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To estimate the effect on carriage, approximately 60,000 year 10, 11, and 12 students will be
      offered 4CMenB vaccination in South Australia through schools over the study period with 50%
      receiving the vaccine in 2017 and 50% in 2018. In year 10 and 11 students, posterior
      pharyngeal swabs will be obtained at baseline and 12 months post baseline to estimate the
      difference in carriage prevalence of all serogroups of N. meningitidis and serogroup B
      between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants.</summary>
