  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgical extraction of lower third molars under local anesthesia with  bupivacaine were performed. 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine were administered subcutaneously before the surgical extraction. Between 2 and 4 carpules of bupivacaine were administered (2 ml per carpule). The number of carpules depended on the quaility of the intraoperative anesthesia achieved (If patient felt discomfort/pain and additional carpule were administered and recorded in the history)

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated using the Sample Sizer Release statistical program (Microsoft Office Excel 2011), with an alpha value of 0.05, statistical power of 80 %, and assumed loss to the follow-up of 15 %. According to this calculation, the number of patients required per group was 24, and we finally included 25 patients in each group.
SPSS v 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for data analysis. Variable normality was verified with the Anderson-Darling test. The association between types of anesthesia and different variables was analyzed using the Fisher or Chi-square test.
Bupivacaine and articaine group data were compared at each time-point using the Mann-Whitney U test. The proportions of individuals requiring rescue medication in each group were compared with a proportion test based on binomial distribution. P&lt; 0.05 was considered significant in all tests.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) was to compare the effect of bupivacaine and articaine at habitual doses on pain intensity and the need for analgesics after lower third molar extraction.
Materials and Methods The final study sample comprised 50 Caucasian volunteers (26 males and 24 females; age range, 18-30 yrs) undergoing scheduled surgical extraction of impacted lower third molar. A computer-generated random sequence was used to allocate participants to the articaine (4%) or bupivacaine (0.5%) group. Measurements were conducted of postoperative pain intensity, using a visual analogue scale (VAS), rescue medication requirement and its timing, and the quality of intraoperative anesthesia.
Results VAS-measured pain intensity was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the articaine group than in the bupivacaine group at all time-points except for 8 h post-surgery (p = 0.052). Rescue medication was required by 13 (52%) patients in the articaine group and 8 (32%) patients in the bupivacaine group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.252). The groups did not significantly differ (p=0.391) in the quality of the intraoperative anesthesia.
Conclusions Bupivacaine is a valid alternative to articaine in third molar surgery and may offer residual anesthesia as a means of reducing postoperative pain. However, further well-designed RCTs are required in larger study populations to verify the effectiveness of bupivacaine to achieve residual analgesia after oral surgery.
Clinical relevance. These findings suggest that bupivacaine may be useful as coadjuvant to control acute postoperative pain.
