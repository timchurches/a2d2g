  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Injection Free Interval - The injection free interval was defined as the number of days between receiving the second ranibizumab injection (day 7 to 14) to the investigator's determination of eligibility to receive a third ranibizumab injection in the study eye.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 1 to Week 25</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Week 25 - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 25</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Mean Central Retinal Subfield Thickness at Week 25 as Assessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) in the Study Eye - Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a laser based non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina, was performed in the study eye after pupil dilation at baseline and Month 25.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 25</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Screening in the Area of Leakage From Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) at Week 25 as Assessed by Fluorescein Angiography in the Study Eye - Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina (and detecting any leakage) using a dye-tracing method. Photographs are taken with a specialized low-power microscope with an attached camera designed to photograph the interior of the eye, including the retina and optic disc. FA was performed on the study eye after dilation at Screening and Week 25.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening (-Week 28), Week 25</timepoint>
