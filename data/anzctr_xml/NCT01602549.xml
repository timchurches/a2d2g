      <outcome>Gastric Half Emptying Time (GE t1/2) at Baseline (BL), Day 1, and Day 8 - Gastric half emptying time is the time taken for half the contents of the stomach to empty. Gastric emptying was measured using the 13C-oral breath test, which is a tracer method that utilizes 13C, a non-radioactive isotope. Basal breath samples were obtained after an overnight fast or otherwise after 4 hours of fasting following a light meal. On Day 1 and Day 8, participants were then dosed with GSK962040 and additional breath test samples were taken prior to administration of a 13C-labelled test meal. The test meal was consumed approximately 80 minutes later. After consumption of the test meal, breath samples were collected at pre-specified time points over an approximately 4 hour period following the test meal. For the duration of the breath test, no food or drink were allowed. The 13C breath content was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. GE t1/2 was determined by using the cumulative percentage of the administered dose of 13C excreted in breath over 4 hours.</outcome>

      <outcome>Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Scores at Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8 (Pre-levodopa Dose) - The MDS-UPDRS is used to assess the status of Parkinson's Disease. It has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living), Part III (motor examination), and Part IV (motor complications). Each part is made up of several questions, with each question given a score ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Part I and Part II consist of 13 items each, and have a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 52 (severe). Part III consists of 33 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 132 (severe). Part IV consists of 6 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 24 (severe). The total score is the summed score of all four parts and ranges between 0 (normal) and 260 (severe). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</outcome>

    <summary>Gastric emptying is the end-result of a complex and carefully regulated series of events
      which follow the ingestion of a meal, each of which is dependent on the other and subject to
      neurohormonal control. Motilin is an endogenous peptide, produced mainly in the duodenum,
      whose physiological action is mediated by motilin receptors located on enteric neurons,
      peripheral terminals of the vagus, and on the smooth muscle of the gut. Motilin and
      non-peptide agonists at motilin receptors increases the gastric emptying rate and therefore
      provide a potential approach to the treatment of a range of clinical conditions in which
      delayed gastric emptying is thought to be part of the physiopathology and may be contributory
      to symptoms. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
      characterized by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones. It affects 1.5% of the
      global population over 65 years of age. Cardinal symptoms comprise bradykinesia, rigidity,
      resting tremors and postural instability. Gastrointestinal dysfunction, including
      gastroparesis, is a frequent feature of PD affecting approximately 90% of patients, and is
      caused by autonomic dysfunction as well as an adverse effect of antiparkinsonian drug
      therapy. The therapeutic mainstay for PD treatment is the neutral amino acid
      L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a dopamine prodrug, as it provides the most rapid and
      effective symptomatic control of motor impairment in PD. The primary determinant of L-DOPA
      bioavailability is gastric emptying (GE); delays in GE slow delivery of L-DOPA to its
      proximal small intestinal absorption sites, increasing the extent of presystemic metabolism,
      and leading to slowed and diminished absorption.</summary>
