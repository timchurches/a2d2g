  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a documented episode of severe hypoglycaemia will be randomised to the Flash Libre subcutaneous glucose sensing system or usual care over a 6-month follow-up period. The Flash Libre device is an adhesive sensor disc with a thin needle that is placed on the upper arm and which can be read as required. Each sensor lasts 2 weeks before it has to be replaced (patients allocated to this arm will be using the device continuously for 6 months) and is precalibrated so that the patient does not need to do any finger prick blood glucose readings. The readings can be downloaded to a PC which will also be access by the Study Nurse to assess compliance. Training on use of the Flash Libre system will be implemented by the Study Nurse but the patients themselves will insert each sensor, and perform data collection at least 4 times per day and when a hypoglycaemic episode is suspected. The Research Nurse will also co-ordinate usual care for those randomised to this arm. Both intervention (Flash Libre) and usual care patients will have a 30-minute face-to-face session with the Research Nurse as soon as possible after the index severe hypoglycaemic episode. The Nurse will perform a review of medication and self blood glucose monitoring, re-educate patients as to avoidance measures and ensure that the patient's usual health care professionals are aware of the hypoglycaemic episode so that they can take over care in the community. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>We hypothesise that 40% of the patients in the usual care group will experience an episode of severe hypoglycaemia during six months of follow-up and that this will be reduced to 10% in the Flash Libre group. The sample size necessary to show this difference with 80% power and a one-tailed level of significance of 5% is 29 in each group or n=58 total. We will increase this by 10% to 64 total to allow for attrition, Kaplan Meier analysis with log rank test will determine whether there are intervention-related differences in time to primary and secondary endpoints.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether a new relatively non-invasive glucose monitoring system (Flash Libre) helps adults with diabetes who have a severe glucose reaction to avoid further such episodes. The hypothesis is that the non-invasive system will be superior to usual care in preventing both severe and non-severe hypoglycaemia after the index severe hypoglcyaemic event.</summary>
