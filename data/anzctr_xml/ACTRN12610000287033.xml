  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multiple ascending doses of a novel iL-10 agonist administered to healthy subjects. In the multiple ascending dose 8 subjects in cohort 1 and 2, will receive twice daily doses of test medication (or placebo) for 14 days as a oral solution in a double-blind manner.In cohort 3 a daily dose of test medication (or placebo) in a double-blind manner  under fed and fasted conditions for 14 days.
Cohort 1: 200 mg twice daily
Cohort2: 300mg twice daily
Cohort3: 600mg daily.
The duration of each cohort is 14 days postdose.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo is citric acid solution. Both the interventional drug and placebo are admistered orally as a solution.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of multiple doses of HMPL-011 at 200mg twice daily, 300mg twice daily and 600mg daily will be assessed on the basis of adverse events reported, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature(oral), electrocardiograms(ECGs), clinical laboratory tests and physical examination. These methods used will be medical equipment and questioning.
No specific adverse events are expected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be continuously monitored for adverse events, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests and physical examination whilst on study (from baseline to Day 15).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the Pharmacokinetic profile of HMPL-011 at 200mg twice daily, 300mg twice daily and 600mg by blood analysis</outcome>
      <timepoint>The pharmacokinetics of HMPL-011 will be collected at predetermined timepoints throughout the study and measured after each cohort. These time points are: pre-dose, 30 mins, 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,12.5,13,14,16, and 24hrs after administration of drug/placebo on Day 1 and 14.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>HMPL-011, the Hutchison MediPharma study drug, is an experimental compound being investigated for its potential to control how the body responds to certain inflammatory processes found in a number of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. It is hoped that this information will lead to an improved anti-inflammatory drug which could reduce the inflammation responsible for the damage to the bodys organs caused by these diseases (such as the joint destruction seen in rheumatoid arthritis).</summary>
