  <interventions>
    <interventions>MobileMums begins with a one-on-one face-to-face goal-setting session with an exercise counsellor (lasting approximately 45 minutes), and is then followed by a 12-week personalised SMS program (4 to 6 SMS per week) with a brief follow-up telephone consultation with her assigned counsellor at 6 weeks.  The text messages emphasise cognitive-behavioural skills such as self-efficacy, use of social support networks, and self-reward.  The SMS are tailored based on the woman's exercise goal, outcome expectancies, rewards, and also promote mum-friendly exercise opportunities in her neighbourhood.  A support person nominated by the participant during the goal-setting session also receives 3 SMS per week for the duration of the program with tips on how to support the participant to reach her exercise goal.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care control participants receive print materials on physical activity at baseline only, and access to the program website which includes information on physical activity for mums, a forum and an exercise directory.  The website will be available to participants until the end of the trial.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weekly duration of moderate to vigorous physical activity as measured by the Actigraph GT1M activity monitor and walking for exercise (minutes per week) as measured by the Australian Women's Activity Survey</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediately post intervention and 6 months post-intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Program viability and fidelity: All participants recall, use and satisfaction with the program will be assessed using self-report items developed and used previously by the investigators. Responses to program SMS will also be monitored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately post-intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost-effectiveness:  Costs incurred through program delivery, text messages, and staff costs will be monitored.  Participants will also answer questions relating to use of health care services  and any other costs associated with taking up physical activity.  Participants will also complete the SF-12 Health Survey.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitoring of spending throughout program delivery.

Interview and self-complete data will be collected at baseline, immediately post-intervention and 6 months post-intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Because the intervention targets constructs of Social Cognitive Theory, the following constructs will be measured: physical activity self-efficacy; social support; outcome expectancy; goal setting skills;and perceived environmental opportunity for physical activity.  These constructs will be measured via self-report items as a part of a self-complete questionnaire which have been developed and used previously by the research team, and have shown good measurement properties.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediately post intervention and 6 months post-intervention</timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following a telephone screening, consenting and eligible participants are allocated a participant ID and complete their baseline assessment.  Participant IDs are linked to treatment allocation in a separate spreadsheet, which is not revealed until completion of the baseline assessment when participants are either assigned to an exercise counsellor or are sent an information pack if they are in the control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Particpants will be randomised to one of two groups: control or intervention. Stratified allocation will be employed based on participants' baseline physical activity levels.  Participants will be classified into one of three groups: no physical activity, some physical activity, or sufficient physical activity.  For these three groups a randomisation list will be created using the R software package using random permuted blocks.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of "MobileMums": an intervention delivered predominantly by mobile telephone text messaging.  The aim of this study is to determine the effects of the program on physical activity levels of women with young children, relative to a control group.  We hypothesise that MobileMums will increase the amount of time women spend doing moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity each week.</summary>
