    <interventions>This is a prospective, open-label, dose escalation safety trial. Patients who present with symptoms consistent with pneumonia along with CPE/empyema will be initially treated by standard of care, including placement of chest tube and initiation of antibiotics, and will be evaluated for participation in this study. Eligible subjects will be appropriately consented to the study and will begin treatment with intrapleural LTI-01 within 24 hr of enrolment.

Subjects will be treated according to their assigned dose level daily for up to 3 days. First treatment will begin within 24 hours from initial consent. The study treatment will be administered as a bolus dose through the chest tube into the pleural space and allowed to stay in the space for 3 hours. This treatment will occur once per day for up to 3 consecutive days.

Study treatment will occur in a dose escalation format, with up to 5 dose level cohorts.  The first 3 subjects enrolled will be given an initial dose of 50,000 IU LTI-01 daily for up to three days. Assuming there are no safety issues in these 3 subjects after review of safety data by the Safety Review Committee (SRC), comprising of the Medical Monitor, Study Investigators and the Sponsor, the dose level will be escalated (doubled) in each consecutive group of three subjects with dosing for up to three days at all dose levels. If complete resolution of the pleural process occurs after one or two doses of LTI-01 in any subject, no further LTI-01 will be administered. This escalation (three per dose level) will continue to a maximum dose level of 800,000 IU unless a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed, 

Clinical activity will be defined as pleural density improvement of 25%, (determined by the reduction of the percentage of pleural density versus the area of the ipsilateral hemithorax) or &gt;50% reduction of pleural density at Day 4 versus baseline randomization radiographic analysis, as confirmed by chest X-ray and via estimation of the volume of the pleural collection by chest CT scanning. Improvement by chest ultrasonographic scoring will also be used to assess efficacy.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of intrapleural LTI01.
This will be assessed as follows;
vital signs at 3, 5, 12, 18, 21 hours post dose, chest ultrasonography at 23 hours post each of the 3 doses, haematology, blood chemistry and plural fluid will be assessed at 3, and 23 hours post dose, assessment of PF drainage at 3 and 23 hours post dose and assessment of AE's and concomitant meds daily.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be assessed on Day 1 (dosing) to day 28 or hospital discharge. Which ever comes first. 
Patient safety will be monitored continuously as above and MTD will be reached when two or more patients at a given cohort experience a dose limiting toxicity defined as either an acute bleeding event with more than 2mg per dL drop on blood Hgb with or without haemodynamic instability, or development of melena or overt bleeding from the chest tube including development of haemothorax with a pleural fluid Hct more than 50% that of blood Hct or a grade 3 non-haematological adverse event.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>LTI-01, the study drug being researched in this project, is an experimental treatment being developed by Lung Therapeutics, Inc. This means that it is not an approved treatment in Australia, and is not yet approved anywhere else in the world. 


LTI-01 is a treatment that is intended to either prevent or remove the build-up in the pleural space around the lungs (called loculation) and so promoting drainage of the fluid with the goal of avoiding the need for surgery.

Study participants will be given 1 dose of LTI-01 a day for up to 3 days in a row. LTI-01 will be administered directly into the pleural or lung cavity through a chest tube. During and after treatment, participants will be assessed for the following: 
*	how safe and well tolerated the LTI-01 is at the dose they are given
*	how much of the LTI-01 drug is in your blood at specific times to measure the way the body is processes it 
*	the effect of the LTI-01 drug has on your body
