    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and a parent/guardian consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatments will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate + amodiaquine  for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection in the new epidemiological context of low malaria transmission in Zanzibar. 

Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Zanzibar to assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The study will be conducted in 20 primary health facilities of Zanzibar.

The participants will be febrile people equal to or above 6 months , inclusive. Patients will be treated with artesunate-amodiaquine daily for 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Tanzania,  in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum.</summary>
