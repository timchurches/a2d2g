  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will measure serial B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP)concentrations in 600 patients presenting to the Emergency Department within 4 hours of symptom onset of possible Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). 

Clinical history and physical examination will be undertaken. Venous blood samples for cardiac biomarkers will be obtained on admission and again at 1, 2 then 12-24 hours post admission.
Patients will be followed up for 30 day and 6 month events for the composite end-point of: All cause mortality and/or new ACS and/or readmission to hospital with arrhythmia or heart failure.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this proposal will be the identification of B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP) as a novel, specific biomarker of acute cardiac injury. For each blood sample, we will measure plasma BNP-SP as well as the standard serial biomarker concentrations of troponin, creatine kinase and myoglobin.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome will be the potential identification of a new class of circulating biomarkers that may have diagnostic potential in pathophysiology. For each blood sample, we will measure plasma BNP-SP as well as the standard serial biomarker concentrations of troponin, creatine kinase and myoglobin</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early clinical detection of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) can be difficult. In particular, distinction between cardiac and non-cardiac events may entail 12-36 hours of delay whilst serial biomarker results are awaited and/or subsequent tests (such as exercise electrocardiography) are performed. We have achieved the first ever identification of a signal peptide in the circulation (B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP)) and show that it has potential to specifically and rapidly identify cardiac ischemia.. 

We will measure serial BNP-SP concentrations in 600 patients presenting to the Emergency Department within 4 hours of symptom onset of possible Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). 

Clinical history and physical examination will be undertaken according to standard care . Venous blood samples for cardiac biomarkers will be obtained on admission, and at 1,2 and 12-24 post-admission. 

Patients will be followed up for 30 day and 6 month events for the composite end-point of: All cause mortality and/or new ACS and/or readmission to hospital with arrhythmia or heart failure. This research has the potential to speed up diagnosis and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with ACS.</summary>
