  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CD-ROM treatment entitled Face Your Problems involves a cognitive-behavioural treatment for reducing aggression in children over approximately 10-13 sessions (one per week of approximately 50 minutes duration) with a qualified therapist. The number of sessions will be addressed on a case-by-case basis by the therapist, with as many sessions as needed to achieve the session goals (i.e. parts of the session may be repeated if needed). The first two to three appointments will guide the child through a structured psycho-educational program on the CD ROM which focuses on teaching the child about: (i) perception and the need to look for clues in social situations (ii) the need for a 'thinking plan' to learn to cope (iii) the evaluation of different scenes with social problems. The last five to seven appointments utilizes the second part of the CD ROM which guides the child through a more intensive structured form of pro-social problem solving. The aim of the program is to over train the subject in the self-talk required for social problem solving with increasing practice in real world situations.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as Usual (standard treatment) will be conducted by the Child and Youth Mental Health Service and can involve various talking therapies or drug therapies</comparator>

    <concealment>The presenting parent of children who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the research by their clinician. Once they express interest in the project details will be forwarded to the Research Officers (ROs). On receipt of referral details the RO will contact the parent and mail the pre-assessment questionnaire booklet. Following completion of pre-assessment measures, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (treatment or 'treatment as usual' control). Both the clinician who refers a participant to the study, and the research officers involved in the referral and later collection of data, will be unaware of which group the participant will be allocated to. . Concealment will be done using participant numbers sealed in opaque envelopes to be opened when full consent is obtained.</concealment>
    <sequence>A varying-block randomisation protocol will be used: varying block sizes of 4 and 6 (where there are even numbers of each treatment group represented every cycle of 4 or 6 participants) will be used to ensure that randomisation outcome cannot be predicted</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a therapist assisted CD-ROM based intervention for children and adolescents with aggressive behaviour, and compare it to treatment as usual. The CD-ROM called Face Your Problems is already developed and in occasional use. The participants will be 60 children between the ages of 7 and 14 years who present to Mater Child and Youth Mental Health and Child and Youth Mental Health, Children's Health Service District, Queensland Health community clinics for the treatment of aggressive behaviours. Treatment will last between 10-13 sessions and consist of teaching strategies to reduce anger and come up with better solutions to problematic social situations.</summary>
