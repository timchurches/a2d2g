    <concealment>Randomisation will occur within 120 days of completion of standard therapy. After informed consent is signed and participant eligibility is confirmed, the participant can be randomised in a 1:1 allocation ratio, to receive either Aspirin (oral tablet) or a matched placebo for 3 years.

Randomisation will be done via central randomisation website: Authorized study centre personnel will randomise the patient via a password-protected internet web site. The randomisation system will then allocate the treatment arm and provide the subject number to be used for the patient. The treatment arm will not be disclosed. The Clinical Trial Centre will be informed immediately in the event that the web randomisation is not successful. 

The patient, the study team including the investigator(s) and the sponsor will be blinded. Sealed Code break envelopes will be provided for emergency unblinding. </concealment>
    <sequence>Stratification factors include,

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analyses will be carried out on an intention to treat basis.
In the analysis of disease free survival, an event of interest is a patient relapses or dies during the study period. The starting point is the date of randomisation and the end point is the date of first disease recurrence or date of death, whichever occurs first. Patients with no evidence of disease after treatment are censored at the date of last follow-up. Similarly, the overall survival time is censored at the date when the patient is last known to be alive. 
Each primary endpoint will be analysed as follows. Survival curves will be constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Life table estimates of 3 and 5 year survival rates will be calculated. The efficacy of Aspirin will be evaluated by the Hazard Ratio (HR) and its corresponding 95% CI. A Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate HRs adjusting for the trial stratification factors (site, type of tumour and type of adjuvant chemotherapy). Stratified analysis and other non-proportional hazard models (which allow for the effects of covariates to vary over time) would be considered when proportional hazards assumption is not valid. 
The secondary endpoint of overall survival will be analysed in a similar manner to the primary endpoints. For the subgroup analyses, tests for interaction for the colon cancer subgroups and other subgroups will be conducted first. Similar analyses of DFS and OS as presented above will be repeated within the subgroups respectively defined by ethnicity, tumour type, and patients compliance and according to patients PIK3CA mutational status. The percentage of patients with different PIK3CA mutational status will be compared by Chi-square test in the Aspirin and Placebo groups.
Total international trial size will be 2660 patients with 1330 randomised to each group. It is assumed that 3 years disease free survival rate for Dukes B colon cancer, Dukes C colon cancer and rectal cancer are 65% after standard adjuvant chemotherapy with an attrition rate of 5%. Then, the total trial size of(2660) will be sufficient to detect a 6% absolute difference of disease free survival rate for all subjects between the two treatments, with a two sided logrank test of 5% type I error and 90% power. For the main sub-group analysis, the 3-year DFS rate for colon cancer patients is assumed to be 65% under standard care, which is similar to the entire group as a whole, the size of colon cancer (n=2000) will be sufficient to detect a 6% absolute difference of disease free survival rate for colon cancer between the two treatments, with a two sided logrank test of 5% type I error and 80% power.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant Aspirin 200mg versus Placebo 200mg for patients with Dukes C colon cancer, high risk Dukes B colon cancer, Dukes B rectal cancer or Dukes C rectal cancer patients.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have confirmed Dukes C colon cancer, high risk Dukes B rectal cancer or Dukes C rectal cancer for which you have had surgery to remove the primary tumour and completed at least 3 months of chemotherapy.

Study details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will be provided with Aspirin 200mg daily for 3 years and the other group will be provided with a matching Placebo 200mg daily for 3 years. Participants will be asked to attend clinic visits every 3 months for a period of 3 years and thereafter every 6 months for 2 years to determine disease free survival, overall survival and quality of life.
