  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) Treatment with clinician-assisted Internet based treatment for GAD, or; 2) Treatment with self-guided Internet based treatment for GAD, or; 3) Waitlist control. All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for GAD. All group 1 and group 2 participants will complete 6 lessons of Internet based treatment about the management of symptoms of GAD. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Group 1 participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, will contribute to an online forum moderated by a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, and will receive weekly reminder emails. Group 2 participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, and will receive weekly reminder emails. The duration of the program is up to 10 weeks, but participants will be contacted 3 months post program and asked to complete follow-up questionnaires. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month post-treatment. These will take about 20 minutes to complete. The treatment materials are based on cognitive behavioural techniques.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist control group. These participants remain on the waitlist until the treatment groups have completed their treatment (10 weeks). At that time (10 weeks) the waitlist group will receive the same treatment as Treatment Group 1.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our previous research indicates that the Worry Program, an Internet-based treatment program for people with GAD, is effective at helping people to learn to manage their symptoms of GAD.

The study described here aims to find out whether therapist support is required for people to successfully complete the Worry Program.

We expect that people completing the Worry Program without therapist support will still benefit, but not as much as those receiving the usual levels of therapist support.</summary>
