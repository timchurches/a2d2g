    <interventions>Community pharmacies play a significant role with supporting palliative patients through timely access to medicines. This survey seeks to map the current situation with regards to what services and medicines are available through the community pharmacy network, for palliative patients and their families. 
This de-identified information along information on costs and clinical evidence will guide the development of a priority medicines list for palliative patients across South Australia.
This is a one-off survey to identify further projects to connect pharmacy services for this patient group. Data is expected to be returned with a month of receiving the survey</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish which medicines are commonly held in community pharmacies around South Australia that could be prescribed for palliative patients.
A percentage of pharmacies across South Australia that currently hold stock of each specific medication will be calculated. This figure will provide us with a measure of likihood that that specific medication will be held in a pharmacy across the state.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish any gaps where medications cannot readily be accessed within the community setting. In comparing data between pharmacies it may be identified that there are particular geographical locations or factors that are linked with reduced capacity to hold specific medications. This will guide us to the development of the priority medicines list as well as a education programme with which priority medications that community pharmacies should hold for our patient population.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective of this survey is to identify the capacity any pharmacy throughout South Australia has to be able to respond rapidly to the symptom control of palliative patients in the last few days or hours of life. This information will provide us with an objective overview as to how community pharmacies across South Australia currently are able to respond to palliative patients. It will also provide a basis to build approaches which support community pharmacy to respond to meet the needs of palliative care patients access to medicines.

De-identified information will be used to:

Guide the development of a priority medicines list for palliative patients across South Australia. This list will be chosen using three factors: clinical evidence, cost and medication accessibility. Where two or more medicines are clinically/cost equivalent we will need to identify which one has greater community accessibility. 
Provide feedback to the broader pharmacy community (Australian and overseas) in the form of a report published in a peer reviewed Journal; 
Flag factors that limit access to palliative medicines within the community to inform future quality improvement activities 
Create a baseline dataset from which to measure changes resulting from the implementation of quality improvement activities 
 
We would like to identify the general spread of responses of pharmacies across the state as well as differences between regions.</summary>
