  <interventions>
    <interventions>Active intervention is a whole of service guidelines-based treatment based on a relationship model, and will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The approach emphasises good clinical care grounded in developed treatment guidelines (Project Air Strategy for Personality Disorders 2011) derived from the NICE (2009) and Gunderson and Links Clinical Guide for treating people with Personality Disorders (2008). Specialised individual, group and family interventions are delivered weekly by mental health professionals for up to 12 months. Service sections are randomly divided into practice sites receiving the intervention or treatment as usual. After a 12-month delay, the TAU sites receive the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual standard care. Standard care involves medical care and case management by health care professionals for up to 12 months and will vary on a case-by-case basis.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatment for personality disorder is effective but only specialist long-term approaches have been studied on specific subsets of patients with highly trained staff. This study aims to evaluate a whole of service approach in a large public mental health service. The treatment is guidelines-based approach based on a relationship model (Project Air Strategy for Personality Disorders 2011). A delayed randomised controlled trial compares this approach to standard care.</summary>
