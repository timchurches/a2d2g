  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation in muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life
      and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue trauma, vaccinations, or influenza
      infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict movement by locking joints leading to
      cumulative loss of function and disability. This 3-year, non-interventional, two-part,
      natural history study is designed to gain insight into total body HO, FOP disease
      progression, the impact of FOP on subjects' physical functioning, and clinical features and
      biomarkers that may be useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. This
      natural history study will also provide important information to inform the design of
      subsequent interventional trials.</summary>
