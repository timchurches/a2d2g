  <interventions>
    <interventions>Over160 patients between 20 and 70 yr old who had to receive general anesthesia for various surgeries that required nasogastric (NG) tube insertion were enrolled in the study.
Patients were divided into four groups. First, the control group where patients had NG tube inserted directly through a nostril with head in the neutral position. In the second group NG tube was tied to an intubating stylet by a slipknot before insertion. The third group patients had their neck flexed and a lateral pressure was applied over neck while NG tube placing. In the last group NG tube insertion was facilitated by simply lifting-forward displacement- of the larynx. Number of attempts, success rate, duration of insertion, and different complications were observed and recorded.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful NG tube insertion was confirmed if the tube passed smoothly and a gurgling sound was heard on auscultation over the epigastrium when injecting of air through the NG tube. In Group C, successful NG tube insertion at first attempt was achieved in 9 (22.5%) patients. The success rates of NG insertion were greater in Groups F, L, and S: 24 patients (60.0%), 34 patients (85.0%), 37 patients(92.5%) respectively.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>If the first attempt failed, the NG tube was withdrawn fully and the procedure was repeated using the same technique. If both attempts at insertion using the selected technique were unsuccessful, then the technique was considered a failure. In Group C overall success was recorded in 17 patients (42.5%), while overall success rates for group F, L, and S were 31 patients (77.5%), 38 patients (95.0%), and 39 patients (97.5%) respectively.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total NG tube insertion time was 46.2 +/-26.4s in Group C, and this time was significantly shorter in Group L ( 25.3+/- 22.2), but not so different from the time required in Group F (39.1 +/- 25.5) and S (42.6 +/-25.7).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The most common complication was kinking which occurred in 19 patients (47.5%) of Group C, 13 patients of Group F (32.5), and 6 patients of group L (15%). Kinking was not a problem in Group S where intubating stylet provided enough stiffness to the NGT preventing  kinking of the tube as much as possible.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>NG tube insertion was told to be difficult in anesthetized patients, but actually it is alot more easier than we think. 
We used some of the most available and easy to learn methods for facilitating the insertion of a nasogastric tube, and the number of attempts, success rate, duration of insertion, and different complications were observed and recorded.</summary>
