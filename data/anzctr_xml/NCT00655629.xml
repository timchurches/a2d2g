  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a new dosage form of Vardenafil, an
      orodispersible tablet (ODT), and compares it to the safety and efficacy of a placebo
      (inactive) tablet in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. After a 4-week unmedicated phase,
      patients will receive Vardenafil ODT or matching placebo for 12 weeks. Safety will be
      determined by laboratory and other evaluations. Efficacy will be determined by the results of
      different questionnaires and the patient diary that will be used.</summary>
