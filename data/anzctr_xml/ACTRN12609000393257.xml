  <interventions>
    <interventions>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will be performed with a Magstim Rapid2 stimulator using a 70 mm figure of 8 coil over the right motor cortex and will involve stimulation at frequencies of 1, 0.2 or 0.05 Hz and at amplitude of 80% or 110% of resting motor threshold (RMT) lasting 10 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) will be used at 3 frequencies (1, 0.2 and 0.05 Hz) and two amplitudes (Low - 80% of RMT and High - 110% of RMT.
There will be a cross over design with at least one week between treatments.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Healthy volunteers will be treated with 10 minutes of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex using 3 different (low) frequencies and 2 different amplitudes. Simple motor reaction times and motor evoked potentials will be studied immediately before and after, and after 30 minutes. The aim is to ascertain the optimal protocol for modifying the excitability of the motor cortex in neurological disorders.</summary>
