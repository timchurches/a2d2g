    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All those involved in the study (participants, investigators, and the statistician) will be blinded to allocations until all analyses have been completed. To conceal allocation, consecutively numbered, sealed envelopes will be used and maintained centrally. The statistician will prepare the envelopes kept in a locked location. An envelope will be opened in sequence once the participant has completed all baseline measurements and been accepted into the study, revealing a “batch code” (one of ten possible) which will instruct the research nurse which batch of packages the participant should be provided with. Following data collection, the statistician will be provided with a list of five batch codes for each of the two groups but will otherwise remain blinded as to which is the active group.  Each package and its contents will be indistinguishable and identical in appearance, packaging and taste. The research nurse performing the reassessments, along with the participant, will be blinded to the intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation to groups will be performed in batches using minimisation by the statistician (who will have no contact with participants nor be involved in recruitment) using participant gender, arthritis severity and age (under 65 and 65+) and a small random component.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, degenerative joint condition, resulting from wear of the articular cartilage. Symptomatic treatment typically involves the use of high dose paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or opiate analgesics; however, these may produce adverse effects. A variety of products derived from the New Zealand Green Lipped Mussel (NZGLM; Perna canaliculus) have been advocated as a treatment for OA on the basis of their reputed anti-inflammatory activity. BioLex (Registered Trademark) contains a novel NZGLM lipid extract and a vegetable oil carrier. The aim of the proposed study is to compare the effects of BioLex (Registered Trademark) with placebo on the signs, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe OA of the hip and/or knee, along with their use of pain relief medication. Specifically the study hypotheses are:

H1: A 12-week course of BioLex (Registered Trademark) will result in significantly greater improvements in pain, physical function, quality of life measures, and physical measures of function than placebo in individuals with OA of the hip and/or knee.

H2: A 12-week course of BioLex (Registered Trademark) will result in reductions in pain and anti-inflammatory medication use compared to placebo in individuals with OA of the hip and/or knee.

H3: BioLex (Registered Trademark) will be associated with fewer adverse effects than standard analgesic regimens.</summary>
