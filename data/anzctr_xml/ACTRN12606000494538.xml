  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1 (Treatment with acupuncture): women will receive a series of acupuncture treatment over a 1 hour period prior to their planned induction. Classical acupuncture points Hegu LI4, Sanyinjiao SP6, Shangliao UB31 and Ciliao UB2, Zusanli ST36, Taichong LR3 or alternative combinations will be used.  Any underlying pathology such as deficiency of Blood or Qi, or stagnation of Qi and Blood will be examined, and treated, if appropriate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2 sham acupuncture points (body points which are not acupuncture points and away from classical acupuncture points) will be selected on the sacral area, hand, foot, a point below the knee and lower leg.</comparator>
