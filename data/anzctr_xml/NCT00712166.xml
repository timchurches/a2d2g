  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Symptoms Scale (RSS) Score at Day 28 - The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing, congestion, wheezing) from Day 0 (baseline), assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms, higher health-related quality of life, or better functioning). Baseline CFQ-R RSS and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in CFQ-R RSS Score at Day 14 - The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms (e.g., coughing, congestion, wheezing) from Day 0 (baseline), assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms, higher health-related quality of life, or better functioning). Baseline CFQ-R RSS and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in CFQ-R RSS Score at Day 42 - The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0, 14, 28, and 42.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in CFQ-R Physical Functioning Domain Score - The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Days 0 (baseline), 14, 28, and 42 (the last study visit). The endpoint was change from baseline in the physical functioning domain (e.g., ability to walk and engage in physical activities) of the CFQ-R at Day 28 (range of scores: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms, higher health-related quality of life, or better functioning). Baseline CFQ-R physical functioning domain score and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Using Additional (Nonprotocol-specified) Antipseudomonal Antibiotics During Study - The number of participants requiring additional antipseudomonal antibiotics (oral, intravenous [IV], or by inhalation), the time to use of these antibiotics, and the reasons for use was recorded. A binary variable was defined to indicate whether the participants needed any antipseudomonal antibiotics that were non-study drug via the oral, IV, or inhalation route between Day 0 (Baseline Visit) and Day 42 (Visit 5). Fisher's Exact Test was implemented on the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol analysis sets to detect treatment effects on need for additional antipseudomonal antibiotics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 42</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Hospitalized During Study - Hospitalization was defined as any hospital admission lasting for more than 1 calendar day that had been recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE) on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Binary variables were defined to indicate whether participants experienced any hospitalization. Number of hospitalizations was summarized by treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 42</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Log10 Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) Colony Forming Units (CFUs) in Sputum at Day 28 - Sputum samples were collected at all study visits for quantitative and qualitative culture for PA. Sputum PA density was quantified by logarithm transformation of the CFU value with base 10. Change from baseline in sputum PA density was calculated as the difference between the log10 CFU values at Day 28 (Visit 4) and the baseline value. Missing data was not imputed. Baseline log10 CFU and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relative Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Percent Predicted - Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines at each visit. Treatment effect on the relative change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted at Day 28 (Visit 4) was tested by the ANCOVA model using the ITT analysis set. Baseline FEV1 percent predicted and age group (&lt;18 vs. &gt;=18 years) were included as covariates in the analysis.</outcome>
