PENAO will be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, using a centrally placed infusion line and a portable pump.  Patients will be enrolled and assessed in groups of 3 patients per cohort.  If no defined severe toxicity is observed, then 3 new patients will be treated at the next higher dose level.  If some defined severe toxicity is observed, the cohort may be expanded to 6 patients or recognised as the Maximum Active Drug Level.  The starting dose of PENAO will be 2.0 mg/m2/day over 4 days (96 hours) in every 21 day cycle.  Subsequent cohorts/groups of patients will receive the same daily dose over periods of 7 days, 14 days and 21 days.  Once the feasibility of a 21 day infusion is determined, this schedule will be maintained and the daily dose will then be increased between cohorts.  Subsequently daily dose increases are predefined in the protocol, and range between 30-40% of the previous safe dose.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To define the recommended Phase II dose (RPTD) of PENAO as a 21 day continuous intravenous infusion, in patients with advanced solid tumours.

Dose escalation will occur through the defined dose levels, until the Maximum Active Dose Level (MADL) is defined.  The dose level to be evaluated as the first candidate RPTD will be determined by which dose level has been designated the MADL. 
The candidate RPTD will be expanded to assess and assure its tolerability over 2 cycles before it is declared the final RPTD.</outcome>

Restaging will occur every two (2) cycles.  FDG-PET scans will be performed for patients enrolled at Dose Levels 3 and above, at baseline, on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Cycle 3 Day 8.  FLT-PET scans will be performed for eligible patients enrolled in the RPTD expanded cohort within 3 days of the FDG-PET scans.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of the study is to work out the safest dose of PENAO to give to patients.  PENAO is an organoarsenic which means it is related to arsenic. There are other drugs in this class which are used to treat different forms of cancer. In this research study patients will be given a new drug, PENAO, for the first time.  This drug has been previously safely tested in animals but has not been tested before in humans. Because of this, it is unknown what the most effective and safe dosage level should be. Secondly, the study aims to monitor patients to collect more information about how the drug is broken down by the body and do scans to observe whether the drug has an effect on tumours. 
To date, this drug has been shown to slow or stop the growth of many different types of tumours when grown in mice.  

PENAO is an experimental drug. This means that it is not an approved treatment for cancer in Australia or other parts of the world. This study drug was developed by a group of researchers at the University of NSW as an anti-cancer agent.  This research and the clinical study are funded by the Cancer Institute of NSW.</summary>
