  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be divided into three groups according to age: group(A) 0-2 months ,group (B) 2 to 12 months, group(c) more than 12 months but less than 20 kg. Each group will be divided into three groups according to the tranexamic acid dose.
 Group (A) will be divided into three subgroups: 
A1( low dose group): loading dose given as intravenous bolus 15 mg/kg with induction of anesthesia before skin incision. Intravenous infusion dose given  2.5 mg/kg/hr will be started after the loading dose and stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 20ug/ml tranexamic acid added to the priming fluid. 
A2 ( Intermediate dose group): intravenous loading dose 50 mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia. Intravenous infusion dose: 7 mg/kg/hr started after loading dose and given through the whole procedure will be stopped by the end of skin closure. priming fluid 60ug/ml.
A3 ( high dose group): intravenous loading dose: 100 mg/kg with induction of anesthesia before skin incision.  Intravenous infusion dose will be given with anesthesia induction before skin incision 10 mg/kg/hr given through the procedure and stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 100ug/ ml
Group (B) will be divided in three groups:
B1 ( low dose group): intravenous loading dose 9 mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia before skin incision . Intravenous infusion dose: 2 mg/kg/hr given through the procedure and will be stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 20 ug/ml.
B2 ( intermediate dose): intravenous loading dose 26 mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia before skin incision. Intravenous infusion dose 6 mg/kg/hr given through the procedure and to be stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 60 ug/ml. 
B3 (high dose):  intravenous loading dose 65mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia before skin incision .  Intravenous infusion dose 14 mg/kg/hr given through the whole procedure and to be stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 150ug/ml. 
Group c will be divided in three subgroups 
C1 ( low dose):  intravenous loading dose 4 mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia before skin incision . Intravenous infusion dose 2mg/kg/hr given through the whole procedure and to be stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 20ug/ml  
C2 ( Intermediate dose): intravenous loading dose 13 mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia before skin incision. intravenous infusion dose: 5.5 mg/kg/hr given through the whole procedure and to be stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 60ug/ml.
C3 ( high dose):  intravenous loading dose: 31 mg/kg given with induction of anesthesia before skin incision. Intravenous Infusion dose: 14 mg/kg/hr given through the whole procedure and to be stopped by end of skin closure. priming fluid 100 ug/ml.
Designated control laboratory tests are thromboelestometry machine and D-dimer will be measured 3 times:
First sample just after induction of anesthesia and after tranexamic loading dose.
Second measurement 15 minutes after start of cardiopulmonary bypass with ongoing tranexamic acid infusion dose.
Third measurement 5 minute after protamine full dose given post bypass.

Statistical analysis was done on a personal computer using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Categorical data were presented as ratio or as number and percentage and between-group differences were compared using the Pearson chi square test or the chi square test for trends for nominal or ordinal data, respectively. Data gathering from patient laboratory tests on his flowsheet on ICIS system of the hospital, and total 24 hours drainage from patient ICU chart on the first 24 hours postoperative

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tranexamic acid inhibits fibrinolysis and decreases bleeding in surgical patients especially in cardiac surgeries. There is no consensus over its dose. Different centers use different doses during cardiac surgeries. Even in the same hospital different physicians give different doses of tranexamic acid during adult and pediatric cardiac surgeries. Recently, a pharmacokinetic model has been made by Wesley et al that has depicted three different doses to achieve the optimum plasma level. These doses have not been validated clinically or by the laboratory tests to find the optimum dose that inhibits fibrinolysis and decreases bleeding. We would like to find out the optimum dose of tranexamic acid by using the doses of the Wesleys pharmacokinetics model. We will measure the extent of fibrinolysis done by these doses through clinical observations and laboratory tests.     </summary>
