  <interventions>
    <interventions>intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR) has well recognized and long term consequences.because not all fetuses found to be small in utero have true growth restriction, the distinction of true growth restriction from constitutional smallness has been one of the goals of the fetal medicine over the last 20 years. doppler ultrasound has been one   of the most valuable techniques to distinguish sick IUGR from the well IUGR.Recently 3D ultrasound has been gradually introduced as valuable complementary tool for fetal evaluation offering the possibility of calculating fetal organ volumes and providing extra information on growth and maturation. the objective of our study is to analyze the possible existance of differences in the fetal brain volume between growth restricted fetuses with brain sparing , small for gestational age fetuses (SGA) with normal Doppler, and average for gestational age fetuses(AGA) and if it is possible to predict postnatal outcome depending on brain volume. in our study all   patients will be subjected to conventional abdominal ultrasonography for measurments of BPD,HC, FL, AC ,of their fetuses between 32-36 weeks  gestation with estimation of expected fetal weight (Hadlock 1990), Doppler ultrasonography of middle cerebral artery and umbilical artery to measure pulsatility index and resistance index and detailed 3D ULtrasound to detect brain volume  . fetal biometry and 3d measurments of brain volume is done every 2 weeks for all patients. Doppler velocimetry is done every 2 weeks in AGA group, every week in SGA  group, twice weekly or even daily in IUGR group.  all measurments are done from enrolment till delivery </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>the primary purpose of the study is to determine is there a difference in brain volume between growth restricted, average for gestational age and small for gestational age fetuses. the study hypothesis is that growth restricted feuses have smaller brain volumes that may be related to their adverse perinatal outcomes.</summary>
