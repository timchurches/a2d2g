  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two arms in this study. Randomise to Placebo/Ivabradine 5mg-7.5mg bd (double-blind methodology).

Treatment A: placebo/Ivabradine 5mg orally twice daily. Continue therapy over a 2-week period prior to a titration visit to assess efficacy and tolerability. 
At 2-week follow-up period, if angina symptoms persist, up-titrate to placebo/ivabradine 7.5mg bd, and continue therapy for 4 weeks until assessment of endpoints.

A drug washout period of 2 weeks will then ensue followed by cross-over to alternate study phase and repeat of the above protocol over a 6-week period.

Treatment B: One placebo/ivabradine capsule orally twice daily, same as treatment arm A</interventions>
    <comparator>Primary component of the placebo capsules is microcrystalline cellulose.

Treatment B: One placebo capsule orally twice daily for 6 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In patients with chronic refractory angina, ivabradine 5mg to 7.5mg twice-daily will reduce the Angina Frequency score, as measured on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) by a mean of 10 points compared to placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>SAQ's will be administered at baseline, week 6 and week 14.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduce sublingual nitrate consumption as compared with placebo. This will be assessed by reviewing the angina diary that the patient completes</outcome>
      <timepoint>sublingual nitrate consumption use will be assessed at each study visit over the 14 week trial (week 0, week 2, week 6, week 8, week 10 and week 14).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improve the Seattle Angina Questionnaire domain components (physical limitation, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, angina stability and frequency).</outcome>
      <timepoint>SAQ's will be administered at baseline, week 6 and week 14.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduce the frequency of spontaneous anginal episodes over a 4-week period. This will be assessed by reviewing the angina diary that the patient completes</outcome>
      <timepoint>Anginal episodes will be evaluated at each trial visit over the 14 week trial (week 0, week 2, week 6, week 8, week 10 and week 14).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improve 6-minute walk distances.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6-minute walk distances will be assessed at weeks 6 and 14.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ivabradine is an anti anginal agent, approved by the TGA for use in chronic stable angina. It reduces the heart rate by inhibiting the If current within the SA node. 
Ivabradine has been shown to increase exercise time and time to ischemic ECG changes. This study will evaluate its efficacy in reducing spontaneous episodes of angina amongst patients with chronic refractory angina.</summary>
