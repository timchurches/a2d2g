  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Virological Response 4 Weeks After the End of Treatment With BI 201335 or Placebo - An achieved virological response is defined as the plasma Hepatitis C Virus RiboNucleic Acid (HCV RNA) level below the lower limit of detection (BLD).
This data was only collected for patients, who stopped trial participation at Week 24 and did not continue with PegIFN/RBV until Week 48.
The lower limit of quantification (BLQ) of this assay was 25 IU/mL and the lower limit of detection (BLD) was 10 IU/mL at the time of the protocol finalisation. During the course of the trial, the manufacturer defined BLD as '&lt; 25 IU/mL, not detectable' and BLQ as '&lt; 25 IU/mL, detectable'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sustained Virological Response 24 Weeks (SVR24) After Completion of All Therapy - Virological (VL) response was defined as the plasma HCV RNA level below the lower limit of detection.
The first VL measurement that occurred in the time window = Day 155 (from End Of Treatment on) was selected for the determination of SVR24.
Therefore, patients with virological load BLD 24 weeks after completion of therapy, who had a rebound after this time point (outside the defined time window of 155 days after end of all treatments) were identified as SVR24 achieved.</outcome>

    <summary>The objective was to investigate the antiviral effect, safety, and pharmacokinetics of BI
      201335 (Faldaprevir), given as a soft gelatine capsule, in patients with hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) genotype 1 infection. Combination therapy of BI 201335 (Faldaprevir) with pegylated
      interferon a-2a (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV), with or without a 3-day lead-in, was assessed
      in treatment-naïve (TN) and treatment experienced (TE) patients.</summary>
