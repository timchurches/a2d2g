  <interventions>
    <interventions>A very low Kilojoule (kJ) diet (VLCD) of 3,000 kJ, using meal replacements, will be followed for 4 weeks.  The meal replacements  will be supplied to participants as part of the study.  Participants will also consume, by mouth, 6 x 1g/day fish oil capsules composed of 270mg Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and 70mg Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) /capsule.  Participants then progress to weight maintenance for 10 weeks and continue to take the 6 x 1g/day fish oil capsules. 

Participants receive 1 x 20 minutes per week individual education sessions on dietary modification and behaviour change for the four weeks of weight loss.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group follow identical VLCD with nutrition education and then weight maintenance with 6 x 1g/day capsules monounsaturated oil (placebo), to be taken by mouth.</comparator>
