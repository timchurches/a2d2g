  <interventions>
    <interventions>TENS treatment with four silicone-carbon electrodes will placed on the skin next to the episiotomy, i.e. in the puerperae(mothers who have just given birth), thigh and gluteal muscles region. Puerperae were randomly set into three groups: TENS high-frequency (THF); TENS low-frequency (TLF) and TENS placebo (TP).TENS high-frequency is applied with 100Hz frequency and 100 microseconds pulse. TENS low-frequency is applied with 100Hz frequency and 5 microseconds. The placebo group is identical to the treatment group, but the unit do not provide current. This is a one off intervention with 2 hours the duration.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo group that will submitted the identical to the treatment group, but the TENS unit do not provide current. Pain assessment through numerical rating scale (NRS) will be performe in at the beginning of the study, after TENS and 30 and 60 minutes later.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effectiveness of TENS low and high-frequency as a pain relief resource applied in puerperal women that present episiotomy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain assessment through numerical rating scale (NRS) will be performed in groups at the beginning of the study, after TENS, 30 and 60 minutes later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate if the pain in the episiotomy to interfere on the development of the daily activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>To check functional capacity, at the beginning of the study, before the TENS, puerperae will be asked about their limite, or not daily activities and about the activities they had not yet performed. These activities will be: sitting, ambulating, urinating, bowel movement, personal hygiene, eating, sleeping and breast-feeding.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study that compares three study groups; TENS high-frequency, TENS low-frequency and TENS pacebo. The method in which allocation concealment was performed, i.e. the person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation was concealed and it was done by central randomization by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomization by using a randomization table created by a computer software. Randomization was programmed in order to generated a location sequences to endure balance for the number of subjects in each group throughout the study.</sequence>
