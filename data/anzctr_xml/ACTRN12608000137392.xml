  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study evaluated the efficacy of a universal prevention program for adolescent depression implemented by school teachers in Mauritius. We predicted that adolescents who completed the intervention would report less depressive symptoms, better coping skills and higher self-esteem than chilldren who did not receive the intervention. We also predicted that the program would be acceptable to both teachers and students in Mauritius.</summary>
