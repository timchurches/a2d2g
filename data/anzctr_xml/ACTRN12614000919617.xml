  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following confirmation of peanut allergy by a positive open food challenge test, patients aged 6 - 16 will be treated with increasing dosage of boiled peanuts starting with 1/4 of a boiled peanut per day for week 1;  1/4 of a boiled peanut twice a day for week 2 and 1/4 of a boiled peanut 3 times per day for week 3. For subsequent weeks, doses will be increased weekly up to target dose of 10 boiled peanuts in 3 divided doses per day at week 18.   This dosage will be maintained for 3.5 months and then patients will return for their first dose of raw peanut, which will be 1/4 of a raw peanut and will be escalated using the same regime as for boiled peanuts until the patients can ingest 10 raw peanuts  per day at 18 weeks from the first dose of raw peanut.  The dosage will be gradually increased to 10 raw peanuts per day when this dosage will be maintained indefinitely. Treatment compliance and adverse events will be monitored by use of a diary.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants that are able to ingest 10 or more raw/roasted peanuts per day on completion of Phase 2 treatment without any ongoing adverse effects.  Examples of adverse effects are (in ascending order of severity): skin itchiness, urticaria and angioedema, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pains, vomiting or diarrhoea, respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheeze, or breathing problems, fainting and anaphylaxis, based on clinical history and physical examination.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of adverse events more serious than cutaneous manifestations as a consequence of immunotherapy.  Examples of such adverse events are: allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pains, vomiting or diarrhoea, respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheeze, or breathing problems, fainting and anaphylaxis, based on clinical history and physical examination</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peanut allergy affects more than 1% of the Australian population and the prevalence is increasing. To date, there is no effective treatment.  This pilot study will test the safety and effectiveness in peanut allergic children of a biphasic oral immunotherapy using increasing doses of boiled peanuts followed by increasing doses of raw/roasted peanuts.  Results from this pilot study will be used to design a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial.</summary>
