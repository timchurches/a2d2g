  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to consume a high dairy diet (&gt;4 serves/day, low fat dairy &lt;2% fat) for 12 months. A serve of dairy is based on Australian standardised serves, for example 1 serve of milk is 250mL or 1 cup.   Foods will be provided for the volunteers for the duration of the trial. Compliance will be measured using weekly dairy consumption logs and weighed food records (at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of our research is to evaluate the health benefits of regular low fat dairy consumption by determining the relationship between consumption of low fat dairy and markers of cardiovascular and metabolic (cardiometabolic) health which include body composition (waist circumference, % body fat, body weight), blood lipids, insulin sensitivity, C-reactive protein, bone mineral density, arterial compliance, blood pressure and resting metabolic rate. 

Hypothesis:
Daily consumption of 4+ serves of low fat dairy over 12 months will improve indices of body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors.

Subjects will be recruited at two sites, Adelaide, Australia (n=50) and Winnepeg, Canada (n=50). If eligible volunteers will be randomly allocated to either a high dairy diet (consume 4+ low fat dairy serves daily) or a low dairy diet (consume &lt;1 serve of dairy daily) for 12 months. Outcomes measures including body composition (% body fat, BMI, waist circumference), blood pressure and arterial compliance, insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, C-reactive protein, bone mineral density and resting metabolic rate will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months.</summary>
