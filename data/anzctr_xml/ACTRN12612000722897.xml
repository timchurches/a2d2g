  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both the intervention (Balance Group) and active control (Upper Limb Group) will undertake sessions using the Nintendo Wii(TM) gaming system in addition to their standard inpatient therapy regime. Sessions for both groups will be 45 minutes in length, three times per week, for a minimum of two and a maximum of four weeks. The length of intervention will be determined by the length of stay and discharge date of the participant, established by the rehabilitation team.

The Balance Group will perform a range of activities using the 'Wii Fit Plus' package, which involves standing on a force plate (the Wii Balance Board(TM)). The investigators have developed guidelines for activity selection which provides a hierarchy of difficulty and offers a range of activities to challenge balance. Activities will include stationary stance with a decreasing base of support (e.g. Yoga Deep Breathing and Standing Knee Pose), movement over a fixed base of support (e.g. Table Tilt and Penguin Slide), and movement with a changing base of support (e.g. Free Jogging and Free Step). The activity selection will also be based on participant preferences and functional ability. Sessions will be conducted on an individual basis and supervised by a trained physiotherapist.

All participants will continue their standard inpatient therapy during the course of the study. This involves participation in allied health sessions (e.g. physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech pathology) on an individual basis or in a group setting. The amount of standard therapy is typically between two to four sessions per day, each up to one hour in length, five days per week. Standard therapy is established on a case by case basis by the rehabilitation team and will be independent of the researchers. A therapy log will be used to document the amount and type of standard treatment received.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control (Upper Limb Group) will participate in an equivalent number of sessions as the Balance Group, however this group will be using the 'Wii Sports' and/or 'Sports Resort' packages. The Upper Limb Group participants will perform activities in a seated position, using one or two motion-sensitive controllers, and be encouraged to use their affected upper limb where possible. The sports-themed activities will involve the use of whole or part of the upper limb and include activities such as boxing, table tennis and bowling. Activity selection will take into consideration individual participant preferences and functional capacity of the upper limb. Sessions will be conducted on an individual basis and supervised by a trained physiotherapist.</comparator>

      <outcome>Feasibility. This will include evaluation of recruitment and attrition (screening log and participant flow), activity time, participant acceptability (5-point Likert scale rating of enjoyment, ease-of-use and perceived benefit), and safety (11-point VAS rating of pain and fatigue, BORG rating of perceived exertion and monitoring of adverse events).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recruitment and attrition will be monitored continuously throughout the study. Activity time, acceptability and safety will be monitored during each intervention session.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be consecutively sampled by screening all stroke admissions to the inpatient rehabilitation ward. Screening will be undertaken by the ward physiotherapists and a screening registry kept. The Principal Investigator will confirm eligibility of potential participants and obtain informed consent.

Following enrolment and initial assessment, a minimisation procedure will be used to generate group allocation. Minimisation will be based on the participant's Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM) score, a test of motor function. 

The Principal Investigator will be unaware of group allocation until the STREAM score is entered into the Excel-based program and allocation obtained. The allocation is therefore concealed prior to the participant completing their baseline assessment.

An audit of the screening registry and minimisation program will be performed at the end of the study to verify adherence to the allocation process.</concealment>
    <sequence>Minimisation, based on the STREAM score, will be used to generate the allocation sequence. The Excel-based program attempts to minimise the variance within groups with respect to the STREAM score.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Deficits in balance are common and debilitating following stroke. Active gaming systems, such as the Nintendo Wii(TM), may provide a means of promoting physical activity to improve recovery post-stroke. We hypothesise that the Nintendo Wii(TM) gaming system, when used in addition to standard inpatient rehabilitation therapy will result in improved balance outcomes in a sub-acute stroke population. We also hypothesise that this system will be a feasible tool for use in an inpatient rehabilitation setting.</summary>
