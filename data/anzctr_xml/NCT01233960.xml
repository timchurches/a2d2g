  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - adult human mesenchymal stem cells

Experimental: Prochymal - Infusions of Prochyaml on days 42-45, 84-87, and 126-129 after first infusion in Protocol 603. Each infusion of PROCHYMAL (remestemcel-L) will contain 200 million cells.


Treatment: drugs: adult human mesenchymal stem cells
PROCHYMAL will be administered IV in a total volume of 300 ml (200 million cells) at a rate of 4-6 ml/minute. Treatments will be administered on Days 42-45, Days 84-87, and Days 126-129 following first infusion in Protocol 603.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infusional toxicity as a measure of safety and tolerability - Infusional toxicity will be evaluated by continuously monitoring the subject's vital signs and O2 saturation by pulse oximetry from the time of PROCHYMAL administration until two hours after infusion is complete.</outcome>
