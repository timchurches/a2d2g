  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be made to do pelvic stretching, pelvic rocking and abdominal strengthening exercises for 15 minutes followed by aerobic training on treadmill at an intensity of 70-85% of their maximum heart rate for 30 minutes. Maximum heart rate will be calculated by subtracting the participants age from 220. The training protocol will include a 3 week exercise and treadmill training and the training sessions will be administered and supervised by a trained physiotherapist on a one-on-one participant basis. Frequency of  intervention will be for 3 days a week for a maximum of 45 minutes each session. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, of a promising intervention (exercise) that never became a standard treatment but with widespread acceptance with the evidence being mainly anecdotal. This study has been designed to optimise the training, content, and delivery of exercises to participants with menstrual pain.
The specific objectives for this study are to:

1.To assess recruitment processes and study uptake to inform the feasibility of running a full study
2. To evaluate the retention rate of participants
3. To evaluate the study protocol
4. To determine the feasibility of the proposed outcome measures
5. To estimate the effect size of the intervention

The experimental hypothesis is that a treatment program consisting of aerobic training, strengthening and stretching exercises would be effective in reducing the menstrual pain and severity among women with Primary dysmenorrhea</summary>
