  <interventions>
    <interventions>Trans abdominal electrical stimulation via an interferential current is applied using 4 electrodes placed on the stomach and back.  A supposedly therapeutic current passes diagonally from right front to left back and vice versa. The device has 4kHz carrier frequency, 80-160 Hz beat frequency, intensity &lt;33mA.  This is applied for an hour a day for 6 weeks throughout the study period</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham transabdominal electrical stimulation where an interferential current is used via 4 electrodes, but the current passes from right front to right back, and left front to left back, not providing any therapeutic stimulation. This is applied for an hour a day throughout the study period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is investigating the ability of a means of gentle electrical stimulation to the abdomen in improving bowel function in patients with constipation.   This is called trans abdominal electrical stimulation (TES).  It is used successfully in the treatment of urinary incontinence, but a side effect is diarrhoea.  It has been used in a study on children with constipation where it improved bowel function and quality of life.   We believe it will also improve bowel function in adults with constipation. This stimulation is administered through 4 sticky electrodes where 2 are on the front of the abdomen and 2 on the back. The current passes diagonally through from front to back on both sides.   We will split participants into two groups where one receives the stimulation the correct way, and the other where the current does not go diagonally, but from right front to right back, the same on the left. It is believed this is not therapeutic.  Participants will not know which way is the correct way, so we hope that those who do receive it the correct way will show an improvement over those that dont.  The study will run for 6 weeks for each participant.  Participants will keep a diary and answer a questionnaire before, halfway through and at the end of the study.  Further contact for this information will also be at 3 months and one year after the study.  Before and after the study tests on the function of the rectum and anus will be done, as will a colon transit time study, which looks at how quickly the colon works. </summary>
