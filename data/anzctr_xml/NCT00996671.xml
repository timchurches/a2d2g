             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new drug and to look at how the drug is
      handled by your body. This is the first time the drug will be given to people, the drug has
      been safely given to animals over many days at higher doses than will be given in the study.
      The study will be done in healthy men and woman to determine what effects, good or bad, it
      has on thier health. This study will find out:

      If the drug has any side effects after one dose of the drug is given? How much of the drug
      gets into the bloodstream, and how long does the body take to get rid of it? If the drug
      causes any changes to a substance that is in skin, hair or blood.</summary>
