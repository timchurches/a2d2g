Placebo Comparator: Group 1: Placebo - Placebo Subcutaneous (SC) injections every 4 weeks (wks) thru Wk 20 (unless early escape at Wk 16); Golimumab - if early escape, 50 mg SC injections from Wk 16 up to 5 yrs; Golimumab - 50 mg SC injections beginning Wk 24 up to 5 yrs (unless early escape); Golimumab - Dr's discretion after unblinding, dose adjusted from 50 to 100 mg and from 100 to 50mg.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response at Week 14. - ACR 20 response is an improvement of &gt;= 20% from baseline in both the tender and swollen joint count and in at least 3 of the 5 assessments ( patient's assessment of pain visual analog scale (VAS), patient's global assessment of disease activity VAS scale, Physician's global assessment of disease activity VAS scale, Health Assessment Questionnaire and C-reactive protein)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 14</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 Response at Week 14 - Number of patients who achieved an ACR 50 response at Week (Wk) 14. ACR 50 response is an improvement of &gt;= 50% from baseline in both the tender and swollen joint count and in at least 3 of the 5 assessments ( patient's assessment of pain visual analog scale (VAS), patient's global assessemnt of disease activity VAS scale, Physician's global assessment of disease activity VAS scale, Health Assessment Questionnaire and C-reactive protein).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS 28) (Using C-reactive Protein) Response at Week 14 - DAS 28 using C-reactive protein (CRP) is an index to measure disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis which combines tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP value, and participant's global assessment of disease activity (using a Visual Analog Scale of 0 to 100 mm). The DAS 28 score ranges from 0 (best) to 10 (worst).</outcome>

      <outcome>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 at Week 24 - Number of patients who achieved ACR 20 response at Week (Wk) 24. ACR 20 response is an improvement of &gt;= 20% from baseline in both the tender and swollen joint count and in at least 3 of the 5 assessments ( patient's assessment of pain visual analog scale (VAS), patient's global assessemnt of disease activity VAS scale, Physician's global assessment of disease activity VAS scale,HAQ and CRP)</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score at Week 24 - Improvement from baseline in HAQ score at Week 24. This 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area based on the worst score from the questions that pertain to that task. The HAQ score is determined by the average of the 8 scores; HAQ ranges from 0 to 3.</outcome>
