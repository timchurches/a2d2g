    <interventions>UniSA Run Free is an eight week beginners running program that has been created in collaboration with experts in the field, Dr Grant Tomkinsion and professor Kevin Norton, to ensure that the program progresses safely and in an achievable and realistic manner for beginner runners. The running program and  the Facebook group is being monitored  by an Occupational Therapy honours student, who is being supervised by two senior Occupational Therapists and a senior Physiotherapist. The running program itself, consists of three sessions per week, where each session includes a 5 min walk warm up and cool down.  The three sessions for each of the 8 weeks is described below
Week 1: 5 sets of run 1 minute, walk 1 minute; 6 sets of run 1 minute walk 1 minute; 5 sets of run 90 seconds and walk 90 seconds
Week 2: 6 sets of run 90 seconds and walk 90 seconds; 5 sets of run 2 minutes and walk 2 minutes; 3 sets of run 3 minutes and walk 3 minutes
Week 3: 6 sets of run 2 minutes and walk 2 minutes; 6 sets of run 2 minutes and walk 1 minute, 6 sets of run 3 minutes and walk 90 seconds
Week 4: 5 sets of run 4 minutes and walk 2 minutes; 7 sets of run 3 minutes and walk 1 minute; Run 12 minutes continuously
Week 5: 6 sets of run 4 minutes and walk 2 minutes; 10 sets of run 3 minutes and walk 1 minute; 4 sets of run 6 minutes and walk 2 minutes
Week 6: Run 15 minutes continuously; 3 sets of run 8 minutes and walk 3 minutes; Run 18 minutes continuously
Week 7: 5 sets of run 6 minutes and walk 2 minutes; Run 22 minutes continuously; 3 sets of run 10 minutes and walk 2 minutes
Week 8: Run 26 minutes continuously; Run 16 minutes and walk 2 minutes, run 16 minutes; Run 30 minutes continuously
The running program is designed to begin gently and gradually increases in intensity as the sessions progress and as the participants improve. The end goal of the running program is for the participants to run continuously for thirty minutes, which equates to approximately five kilometres.  A fridge magnet with the running program on it will also be sent out to participants, so that they can tick off sessions once they have completed them. At the end of the intervention, participants will take a photo of their completed fridge magnet and send it back to researchers through email. 

As well as the running program, the intervention group will have access to a variety of different motivational posts through the private Facebook group to keep them engaged. Previous research has identified that the most engaging type of Facebook post is an opinion poll, followed by posts requesting participants to share helpful tips related to their intervention, for example healthy eating tips (Hales et al. 2014, p. 355). Posts that include links to related materials and posts that contain humorous content have also been shown to increase engagement and interactivity (Luarn et al. 2015, p. 508). In this study, a different type of motivational post will be posted to the intervention group each day over the eight week intervention period. The post type and its content will be varied from day to day to increase participants engagement and motivate them to continue participating in the program. These posts will also encourage social support and interaction amongst the participants, which will further increase their engagement with the program. An electronic log of Facebook posts and interaction will be kept to monitor engagement with the intervention</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardio-respiratory fitness will be measured via the YMCA step test (Santo &amp; Golding 2003, p. 111), which asks participants to step on a 30cm step for 3 minutes continuously, and then record their heart rate at the end. Participants are able to follow along with a Youtube clip that was purposefully created for this particular running program to ensure accurate performance of the test and to make this assessment as rigorous as possible. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, twelve weeks (coinciding with the last week of the running program) and twenty weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity
Physical activity will be measured via the Active Australia physical activity survey (Hacker et al. 2003). This survey is comprised of nine questions that measure the amount of time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity within the past seven days</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, twelve weeks (coinciding with the last week of the running program) and twenty weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity attitudes
Physical activity attitudes will be measured via The Exercise Attitude Questionnaire (EAQ-18)( Manigandan et al. 2004, p. 231), which is comprised of 18 statements where participants rate their attitude towards the statement on a 1-5 Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, twelve weeks (coinciding with the last week of the running program) and twenty weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy 
The Barriers Self Efficacy survey will be used to measure the participants self-efficacy or their belief in their own ability to succeed in specific situations (McAuley 1992, p. 66). This survey consists of 13 statements, where participants must rank how confident they are to continue exercising when particular issues arise for example, if there is bad weather (McAuley 1992, p. 70)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, twelve weeks (coinciding with the last week of the running program) and twenty weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Social support
The Social Support and Exercise survey will be used to evaluate the amount of support participants receive from their family and friends in regards to their physical activity (Sallis et al. 1987, p. 825), this survey is comprised of twelve questions where participants rank their social experiences  on a likert scale from one to five (none to very often) (Sallis et al. 1987, p. 830) </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, twelve weeks (coinciding with the last week of the running program) and twenty weeks.</timepoint>

Analyse will be conducted on an intention to treat basis so that all participants enrolled in the study are retained in the analyses regardless of compliance with the intervention or assessments (Akobeng 2005, p. 842). Changes in the primary and secondary outcomes between the intervention and control groups will be analysed  using random effects mixed modelling. 

Compliance with the UniSA Run Free program will be analysed descriptively in terms of percentage of intended exercise sessions actually completed. Engagement with the intervention Facebook group will be analysed using data from Facebook insights, in terms of the number of unique visitors to the intervention Facebook group per day and per week across the eight week intervention period. Finally, the number of posts to the intervention Facebook group per participant will be analysed descriptively. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We would like to see whether a running program delivered via a Facebook group is effective in assisting people to improve their fitness and change their attitudes and beliefs about exercise

UniSA Run Free is an 8 week running program, targeted at 18-50 year olds, currently not undertaking any running with no health conditions that may prevent participation in a graded exercise program. A Facebook group will be set up to provide a weekly running program, it will also encourage social interaction and provide motivational advice.

Participants will be asked to complete an online survey giving details of their physical activity over the last 7 days and answer questions about attitudes to exercise and opinions about social support when exercising. Participants will also be asked to follow an online instructional video and complete a 3 minute step test, which assesses fitness. This test can be completed at home at a time of convenience. The surveys and step test are likely to take less than 30 minutes in total. 

After  baseline assessments are completed, participants will be randomly allocated to the UniSA Facebook group, or will receive a hard copy of the Running Program.  

Twelve and 20 weeks after participants complete the baseline assessment they will be asked to repeat the online surveys and self-administered step test.
