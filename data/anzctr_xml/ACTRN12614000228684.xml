    <interventions>Volunteers will be inoculated on Day 0 of the study with human red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 and attenuated with Tafuramycin-A. Three different groups will be compared.

Group A: 3 x 10^7 Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 infected red blood cells attenuated with 50nM of Tafuramycin-A, administered intravenously
Group B: 3 x 10^7 Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 infected red blood cells attenuated with 200nM of Tafuramycin-A, administered intravenously
Group C: 3 x 10^7 Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 infected red blood cells attenuated with 200nM of Tafuramycin-A, administered intravenously
Duration of inoculum: one dose at day 0.

Participants will be actively monitored up to Day 28 post injection and parasite levels in the blood will be monitored during this time period. 

At Day 28, scheduled anti-malarial drug treatment (Riamet, also known as Artemether-Lumefantrine) will be administered. If however, there is evidence of a developing malaria infection prior to Day 28 (ie indicating attenuation of the parasites was incomplete), then participants will immediately commence anti-malarial treatment with Riamet. 
Duration and dosage of anti-malarial treatment: Artemether (20mg) and Lumefantrine (120mg): 4 tablets orally as a single dose under direct supervision by clinical staff at the following times: 0, 8hrs, 24hrs, 36hrs, 47hrs and 60hrs making a total dose of 24 tablets in 6 doses.</interventions>
    <comparator>Volunteers will be inoculated on Day 0 of the study with human red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 and attenuated with Tafuramycin-A. Three different groups will be compared.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is examining the safety, tolerability, persistence and immunogenicity of chemically attenuated P. falciparum 7G8 infected red blood cells.  Participants will receive a single inoculum of malaria parasites attenuated with either 50nM, 100nM or 200nM of Tafuramycin-A.  Following administration of the inoculum, we will measure the level of malaria parasites in the blood-stream and then administer anti-malarial treatment (Riamet) at D28.  We will also be assessing the safety of the inoculum and the way the immune system responds to it.  Determining the safety, persistence and immunogenicity of the Tafuramycin-A malaria parasites is important as they form the basis of a novel malaria vaccine approach.</summary>
