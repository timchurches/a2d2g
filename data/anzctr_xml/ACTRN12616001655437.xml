  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will undergo gluteal tendon reconstruction, augmented with a synthetic ligament, as outlined in detail below. This is the preferred operative technique of the orthopaedic surgeon involved in this research, and this surgical intervention is being undertaken regardless of whether patients choose to participate in the prospective clinical follow-up or not. As part of this prospective follow-up, patients will be evaluated pre-surgery and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-surgery. 

The surgical procedure is performed using general anesthesia, prophylactic antibiotics and an indwelling urinary catheter. In the lateral decubitus position, a 10cm longitudinal incision is made over the lateral aspect of the greater trochanter. The tensor fascia lata (TFL) is divided longitudinally, the same length as the skin incision. A 1-2 cm V-Y lengthening of the TFL investing fascia is performed. The thickened trochanteric bursa is excised to expose the insertion of the gluteus medius tendon into the lateral facet of the anterior greater trochanter. Subsequent evaluation of the tendon is performed for the extent of the tear and the presence or otherwise of an associated enthesiophyte. The involved portions of the tendon is elevated from the anterior greater trochanter. Any intact, generally posterior, fibres of the gluteus medius are not dissected from bone. The underlying bone on the footprint of the tendon insertion is decorticated with an osteotome to remove sclerotic reactive bone and enthesiophytes, exposing a bleeding bone surface ready to receive the prepared tendon. Tendinopathic tissue is excised from the tendon end. Any de-laminations of the tendons are then repaired. The repair in all cases is augmented with a LARS (ACTOR 10, Corin Group, Cirencester, UK) ligament which is cut longitudinally along the seam allowing the tube to fan. The flattened portion is sutured onto the under-surface of medius, or reflected minimus. Stay sutures in the reflected tendon ends aided retraction during LARS attachment. The LARS ligament is secured using 2-Ethibond sutures (Ethicon Inc., Johnson and Johnson, USA).

A 4.5 mm bone tunnel is drilled from the foot-print of gluteus minimus on the anterior facet of the greater trochanter, which exits postero-distal to the lateral prominence of the greater trochanter. A flexible looped wire passed through the bone tunnel permits passing of the draw-string on the free end of the LARS ligament through from antero-medial (deep) to lateral (superficial), and the deep surface of the tendon is drawn onto the footprint. A 5.2 mm interference screw (Corin, Cirencester, UK) is placed into the bone tunnel to secure the tension in the ligament/bone interface. The excess tail of the LARS ligament is trimmed. Subsequently, formal repair of the gluteal tendons to the anterior greater trochanter is performed with interosseous suture and bone anchors as indicated. The wound is closed in layers excluding the proximal fascia lata decompression. Patients are discharged from hospital 3-5 days after surgery, and two weeks of subcutaneous DVT prophylaxis is administered in all patients.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All patients deemed candidates for gluteal tendon reconstruction surgery by the orthopaedic surgeon, will be asked to participate in this clinical pre- and post-operative follow-up.

Therefore, key inclusion criteria for surgery include:

1. clinical diagnosis of tendon tearing confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which includes partial or full thickness tears of gluteus minimus and/or gluteus medius.

2. All patients had previously failed a course of non-operative treatment including corticosteroid injections and physical therapy. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>With the Oxford Hip Score (OHS) as the primary outcome variable, a previous study reported that a sample size of 22 patients would have over 99% power to detect a mean change of 5 points, which has been suggested as the minimal clinically important difference for the OHS, assuming a standard deviation of the change score of 10, corresponding to a moderate effect size of 0.5. 

Means (SD and range) will be presented for all measures. To investigate the progression of clinical (patient-reported outcome scores) and functional (hip range of motion, six-minute walk capacity, 30-second single leg stance capacity, hip abductor strength) outcomes over time, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be employed. Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software (SPSS, Version 17.0, SPSS Inc., USA), while statistical significance will be determined at p&lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a non-randomized study that seeks to comprehensively evaluate the clinical and functional outcome of a consecutive series of patients undergoing gluteal tendon repair surgery augmented with a synthetic ligament. We hypothesize that symptomatic patients failing prior conservative treatment and with evidence of gluteal tendon tearing diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will demonstrate significant clinical improvement up until 24 months post-surgery.</summary>
