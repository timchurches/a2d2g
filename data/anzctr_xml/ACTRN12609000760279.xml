  <interventions>
    <interventions>The NeoTract Anchor System is a mechanical device that is designed to hold back the lobes of the prostate and relieve symptoms associated with urinary obstruction.  The device is delivered transurethrally under endoscopic guidance.

The procedure duration is usually 90 minutes or less. Once implanted, the device remains permanently in place.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The aim of this study is to determine whether the transurethral placement of the NeoTract Anchor is feasible.  This will be determined by the successful delivery of one or more devices and procedure completion.  Successful device delivery can be visually confirmed via real-time camera images.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Luminal restoration of the prostatic urethra involves implanting the NeoTract Anchor System, which is designed to hold back the lobes of the prostate, and open the urethra (the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body) to relieve symptoms associated with urinary obstruction.

This study is a prospective, open-label feasibility study enrolling up to 70 participants.  Safety and feasibility are the primary endpoints while patient questionnaires and therapeutic effectiveness is assessed as a secondary endpoint.  Follow-up visits are at 24 hours, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter for the 7 year duration</summary>
