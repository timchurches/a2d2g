  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the incidence of augmented renal clearance (ARC) in patients admitted to the ICU.  Daily 8-hour creatinine clearance measures will be used to identify this, with figures &gt; 160ml/min/1.73m2 and &gt; 150ml/min/1.73m2 in young men and women respectively indicating ARC.  

These measures are obtained by collecting the patients urine (by means of an indwelling urinary catheter) over an 8-hour period.  A blood sample is drawn during this period, and the creatinine concentration is then estimated in both urine and blood.

The creatinine clearance is then calculated as: urinary creatinine concentration x urinary volume / plasma creatinine concentration, giving a figure in ml/min.  This is then adjusted using the patients body surface area to a standard figure of 1.73m2 (to allow comparison between patients).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Haemodynamic variables - such as mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, heart rate and cardiac output.  These will be obtained from bed-side monitors routinely used in the ICU.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily (at 0800hrs) until ICU discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fluid Balance (measure of the net input and output of fluids in a given patient).  This will be obtained from bedside records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily (at 0800hrs) until ICU discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inotrope use and dose.  These are medications that are routinely prescribed to patients in order to improve cardiovascular performance.  The dose and record of administration will be obtained from the bed-side medication chart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily (at 0800hrs) until ICU discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICU and Hosptial Outcome - This will involve determining whether the patient survived to ICU and hospital discharge or died.  This will be obtained from the medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At ICU and hospital discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>APACHE II Scores on admission (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score) - This is an illness severity score based on the patients pre-morbid conditions and physiological variables in the first 24hours of admission.  This data will obtained from the medical chart and observation record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the first 24hours of ICU admission</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>SOFA scores - Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Scores.  This score quantifies organ dysfunction in 6 key domains - Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Neurological, Haemopoietic, Hepatic and Renal.  The scores are used to follow changes with treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The kidneys have a range of essential functions in the body. Central to their role in the excretion of waste products and pharmaceuticals is the filtration of plasma (the non-cellular component of blood). During this process, substances (such as glucose, amino acids, electrolytes, waste products and some drugs) leave the circulation and
enter the renal tubule. Subsequently, drugs / metabolites can be added to or reabsorbed from the filtrate as it passes along the tubule prior to excretion in the urine. In this manner the kidney is responsible for the elimination of a wide range of drugs and toxins.
The rate at which plasma is filtered by the kidneys is referred to as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is largely determined by renal blood blow (RBF). Ideal filtration markers (substances that are only filtered and neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the kidneys) are used to accurately measure GFR (eg Sinistrin), although are not routinely
available in a clinical setting. Creatinine is a small molecular weight amino acid derivative that is freely filtered and secreted (10%) by the kidneys. A clinically useful measure of GFR involves calculating a timed creatinine clearance, which reflects the rate at which plasma is cleared of creatinine over a given period of time. 

Although research has largely focused on patients with declining renal function, there has been little attention on those with augmented renal clearances (ARC). We believe this phenomenon is likely to be common in patients on admission to the intensive care unit, and to date, has been largely under appreciated, although the implications are significant.

For example, more rapid excretion of antibiotics may result in sub therapeutic levels, treatment failure or the selection of resistant micro-organisms. These complications in turn could significantly impact on morbidity and mortality associated with the patients ICU stay. This study will investigate this phenomenon in a population considered at risk, and define the role of commonly employed therapeutic inventions in promoting augmented clearances. This research will lead to further prospective work on tailoring dosage regimens in patients admitted to the ICU.</summary>
