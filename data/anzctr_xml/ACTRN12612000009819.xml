  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Valet Micro Catheter is intended as a single use device during the interventional procedure as a conduit for the exchange/ support of guide wires in the peripheral and coronary vasculatures. Valet micro catheters are indicated to infuse and deliver saline and/or contrast agents. The device is expected to be in the body for less than 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Performance: The ability of the Volcano Valet Micro Catheter to track over the guide wire to the target segment and the ability to exchange guide wires through the catheter . The capability to provide guide wire support when in contact with highly stenosed lesions. The ability to torque the catheter within the vascular space to reorient a guide wire.

This composite primary outcome will be assessed by an experienced operator and reported as clinically acceptable on the case report forms and data (number and percent) will be included in the final study report.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuously during treatment session, up to 15 minutes and captured on the case report forms.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: The assessment and reporting of acute Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)/Major Adverse Events (MAEs) and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADEs) and their relationship to the study device.

An acute Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) is defined as cardiac death; Non-fatal Target Vessel related Myocardial Infarction (TV-MI), and Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR).  An acute Major Adverse Event (MAE) is defined as any acute death and/or major/minor amputation of the study extremity, planned or unplanned.  And an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence.

All MACE, MAEs and UADEs observed during the course of this study and the relationship to the Volcano Valet Micro Catheter will be recorded and reported.  All events will be evaluated and reported by the investigator and a final report will be given to the local governing body (IRB or EC), study sponsor and other investigators.  The evaluation will include a determination of the severity of the event and the relationship between the event and the Volcano Valet Micro Catheter as unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, and/or highly probable.</outcome>
