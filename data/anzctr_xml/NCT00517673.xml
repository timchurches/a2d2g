  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GSK945237 is the first molecule of a new chemical class that is being developed for treatment
      of respiratory tract and other infections such as skin and soft tissue. This study drug has
      been tested in animals but has never been given to humans. This is a two part study. The
      purpose of the first part is to study the side effects of this drug in humans, and to study
      how much of the drug gets absorbed in the blood stream The second part of this study will
      compare absorption of the study drug in the blood stream when given with food and when given
      under fasting conditions</summary>
