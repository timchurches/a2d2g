  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Maxon full closure of dermis with fixomull epidermal closure.
Involves closure of all dermal layers with a buried interrupted Maxon suture. Epidermal closure effected with fixomull. Sutures are absorbable and are left in place. Fixomull removed after three weeks.

OR

2. Nylon interrupted closure of all layers.
All skin layers closed with simple interrupted nylon sutures, removed day 7 for wounds on the face, and day 14 for wounds on other areas. After this, fixomull is applied over the wound for three weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Maxon deep dermal closure with nylon closure superficial skin layers. Involves standard deep dermal interrupted, buried Maxon suture, followed by simple interrupted nylon suture closure of superficial dermal and epidermal layers. Nylon sutures removed day 7 for facial lesions, and day 14 for wounds on other areas. After this, fixomull is applied over the wound for three weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>Enrolment from all eligible patients attending a skin cancer clinic that have elected to undergo surgical excision of a skin lesion (benign or malignant).
After enrolment, allocation to each group and allocation to intervention procedure is made. Allocation is provided by contacting on-site reception staff who have control of the randomisation list. Access to this list is password protected and not able to be accessed by the investigator.
Each half of the wound is randomly allocated a procedure or control.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Each patient has intervention and control suturing technique in the one wound. Each wound has one half that is a control - ie no wounds were allocated to both intervention procedures.</designfeatures>
