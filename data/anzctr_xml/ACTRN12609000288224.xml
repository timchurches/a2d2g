  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acupuncture which will follow a protocol that will involve a traditional acupuncture diagnostic assessment. The treatment plan will incorporate the five element acupuncture points focussing on emotional well being. Acupuncture will be applied bilaterally, needles will be inserted to tissue level and stimulated manually to elicit the 'de qi' response. Acupuncture needles may be inserted in arms, legs and/or chest region.  A total of six treatments of 40 minutes duration will be administered approximately every week and a half over a two month period.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment: Wait list control.  The control group will be offered treatment after the 2 month intervention period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infertility can lead to emotional distress which may place some people at risk of developing a mental health problem. The use of complimentary and alternative therapies are growing in popularity and there is some evidence that acupuncture may increase pregnancy rates in women undergoing In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF). Research findings suggest acupuncture given to women when trying to get pregnant may also lead to an improvement in their emotional well being, and that women may cope better with their IVF treatment. We propose to undertake a pilot randomised controlled trial of acupuncture to explore these effects.</summary>
