  <interventions>
    <interventions>Urinary tract infection is a common bacterial infection in the paediatric population. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children under 2 years of age. Increasing antibiotic resistance trends have important clinical implications for the empirical use of antibiotics. It is know that antimicrobial resistance vary according to geographic region. Knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns locally may aid clinicians in prescribing accurate empirical antibiotics treatment. 

This is a retrospective observational study is to examine antimicrobial resistance patterns in paediatric urinary tract infections in a single centre over the period of 12 months (1st April 2013 to 31st March 2014). Antimicrobial resistance patterns of patients with renal tract abnormalities were compared to those patients with normal renal tracts. 

All paediatric urine samples from 1st April 2013 to 31st March 2014 were reviewed. These samples were obtained from children who presented to the outpatient or emergency department; or who were admitted as inpatients. Urine samples that were collected by Paedibag (pediatric urine collection bag) and cottonball collection method were excluded. Cultures with mixed growth, and common contaminants were excluded. To prevent duplication, repeat samples within 30 days of first positive urine culture were excluded.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To determine antimicrobial resistance patterns in urine isolates in paediatric patients
0 to 18 years old in a single centre.

Data of urine samples submitted to the Microbiology laboratory for microscopy, culture
and susceptibility testing were extracted from laboratory information system. Susceptibility testing was performed using disc diffusion method. Semi quantitative urine culture using a calibrated loop was used to inoculate blood agar and CHROM agar. The significant pathogens were identified by standard biochemical identification methods. Susceptibility testing was conducted by disc diffusion according to EUCAST methodology.




</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data of urine samples were extracted from laboratory information system for children under the age of 18 years between 1st April 2013 and 31st March 2014. These samples were obtained from children who presented to the outpatient or emergency department; or who were admitted as inpatients. To prevent duplication, repeat samples within 30 days of first positive urine culture were excluded. 

As this is a retrospective review of laboratory results, the exact time of when the samples were processed cannot be accurately determined. The results of culture and sensitivities were generally finalized at 48 hours post receiving urine samples. 

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2, To determine whether there is a difference in antibiotic resistance in urine isolates in patients with renal tract abnormalities    

Children with proven renal tract abnormalities (RTA) were identified from radiology reports and discharge summaries on the hospital electronic medical database.The influence of the presence of RTA on antimicrobial resistance was analysed using statistical software. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Children who had renal tract abnormalities (RTA) reported on radiology reports and/or discharge summaries at any time prior to the commencement of the study were categorized in the positive for RTA group. 

The urine samples were collected from children who presented to the to the outpatient or emergency department; or who were admitted as inpatients between 1st April 2013 to 31st March 2013. The timing of urine collection is different for every child, it may be on the first day of presentation to hospital (most Emergency Department cases) or after presentation (admitted or Outpatient cases).  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. To assess levels of bacteraemia in paediatric patients with confirmed UTI from ages 0-2yrs old by collating data of blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid culture (if available) 

Results of blood culture samples and cerebrospinal fluid samples (where available) were reviewed in children from ages 0 - 2 years who presented with UTI. Positive samples were defined as cultures positive with the same isolate as urine culture within 5 days of collection of urine sample.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Positive blood cultures were defined as a single blood culture positive with same isolate as urine culture within 5 days collection of urine sample. Positive cerebrospinal fluid was defined as a single cerebrospinal fluid culture positive with same isolate as urine culture within 5 days of positive urine culture. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. To evaluate whether current empiric antibiotic guidelines for paediatric urinary tract infections are adequate and whether a new antibiotic guideline is required for high risk patients/younger patients

The hospitals current paediatric antimicrobial guidelines for empirical treatment of paediatric UTI and results of antimicrobial resistance patterns were reviewed (to assess if recommendations made were compatible/supported by antimicrobial resistance results).  



</outcome>
      <timepoint>When antimicrobial resistance patterns were determined, recommendations based on these results were compared to current guidelines for empirical treatment of paediatric UTI. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Positive urine culture from patients ages 0 -18 years old. 
2. Samples collected by suprapubic aspiration, catheterization and non-invasive collection sample (midstream) were include.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is aimed at collating and analysing data of paediatric urinary tract infections, identifying antibiotic resistance patterns in different groups of children by age, gender, presence of renal tract abnormalities. It will also assessed the level of bacteraemia in younger children. The data will be used to evaluate whether current empiric antibiotics guidelines are adequate and suitable for all groups of patients and whether there is a need for new guidelines for high risk patients and younger patients.</summary>
