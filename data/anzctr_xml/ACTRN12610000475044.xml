  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients performed squatting exercises on a vibrating platform over a 12-week period (vibration group; n=12);
the approximate duration of each vibration session was 15 minutes; the frequency of sessions was 3 times per week; the intensity is increased over the 12 week program; the administered one-on-one by a physiotherapist.
the range frequency of the vibration platform was 35-40 Hz ; the training and rest time during the 15 minute sessions was range squats 20-45 seconds, followed by range of rest 20- 45 seconds;  the intensity is increased, weekly.</interventions>
    <comparator>in the second group, patients performed squatting exercises without vibration over the same 12-week time period (exercise group; n=11); the approximate duration of each vibration session was 15 minutes; the frequency of sessions was 3 times per week; the intensity is increased over the 12 week program; the administered one-on-one by a physiotherapist. the training and rest time during the 15 minute sessions was range squats 20-45 seconds, followed by range of rest 20- 45 seconds;  the intensity is increased, weekly. This group are also approximately 15 minutes in duration.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients were excluded from the study if they had any orthopedic, neurological, respiratory or acute cardiac diseases that would make it impossible to perform the proposed exercise; and if they had any cognitive deficit, as indicated by a score lower than that compatible with their education level in the Mini-Mental Status Examination.  In addition, patients with vestibular disorders, patients who reported being immunosuppressed or immunodeficient and those who had lost sphincter control (anal and bladder) were excluded from the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>to investigate the effects of whole body training on functional performance, evaluated directly and indirectly (self-reported disease status) in elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis.  The hypothesis was that vibration training in association with squatting exercises at a progressively increasing intensity would improve performance in functional tests compared to performing squatting exercises without vibration, reducing the individuals subjective perception of pain and stiffness and improving the perception of physical function in elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis.</summary>
