  <interventions>
    <interventions>A double blind randomised cross over study of amiloride or placebo on nephrogenic diabetes insipdus  in patients on long term lithium therapy.
Amiloride or placebo will be initially administered at 5mg tablet per day for the first week and then increased to 10mg (2 tablets) daily if tolerated. Amiloride will be administered for 6 weeks. This is then followed by a 6 week wash out period and the alternate tablet administered.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Modification of urinary concentrating ability and associated changes in urinary aquaporin excretion.
Urinary concentrating ability is assessed using a standard overnight water deprivation study with the morning urine collected and urine osmolaity measured. This is then followed by the adminstration of desmopressin (dDAVP - synthetic anti-diuretic hormone) intra-nasally and urine samples collected at 2,4, and 6hours to measure maximal urine osmolality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 weeks after each treatment. A total of 4 time points.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Urine aquaporin 2 (AQP2) concentration is measured at the same time points using an in house immunoassay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 weeks after each treatment. A total of 4 time points.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients taking lithium to control their mood disorder are frequently troubled with passing large quantities of urine. A previous study suggested this may be improved by taking amiloride but how this may work is unclear. This study will investigate the actions of amiloride, compared with placebo, to improve the urine concentrating ability, of individuals who are taking lithium.</summary>
