    <interventions>Fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided stenting vs. visual assessment stenting.
FFR will be measured with a coronary pressure wire (St Jude Medical) with maximum hyperaemia achieved using adenosine administered at a rate of 140ug per kilogram per minute over 3 minutes given via a central vein. The procedure takes approximately 15 minutes and the distal pressure beyond  a coronary stenosis is compared to a proximal pressure reflecting aortic pressure</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations estimate with 80% probability that a treatment difference will be detected with a two sided 0.05 significance if the true hazard is 0.6. Based on assumption that the accrual period will be 1.5 years and the follow-up will be 3 years and the event rate in the stent arm is 5% 122 primary events are requiredBaseline demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics of the two randomized groups will be listed with continuous variables  presented as medians (25th, 75th percentiles) and compared using ANOVA F test when assumption of normality was satisfied; otherwise, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used. Categorical variables will be presented as counts (proportions) and compared using the chi-square test when appropriate; otherwise, an exact test will be used. The relationship between randomised  groups and clinical outcomes will be assessed by fitting a Cox proportional hazards model for time-to-first event. Variables included in the adjusted model will include age, weight, sex, STEMI presentation, , time from presentation to randomization, family history of CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, current or recent smoker, previous MI, previousPCI, previous peripheral arterial disease, previous atrial fibrillation, previous heart failure, systolic blood pressure at baseline, heart rate at baseline, hemoglobin, creatinine, aspirin at baseline, P2Y12 inhibitor at baseline, beta blocker at baseline, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker at baseline, statin at baseline, study treatment (FFR vs visual stenting), 
All statistical tests will be performed at a significance level of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study hypothesis is that assessing the efficacy of stenting heart  arteries other than those that caused a heart attack, either by assessing the narrowings by visual assessment or by measuring blood flow across the narrowings, will result in different patient outcomes and costs.
 Both approaches are used in clinical practice but it not known which is better.
There will be 850 patients randomized to either of these approaches and patients will be followed for 2 years. Outcomes will be assessed by National records with names anonymised and will include heart related deaths, heart attacks and need for stenting or bypass surgery. The cost-effectiveness of each approach will also be compared by counting the costs of each procedure and outcomes.</summary>
