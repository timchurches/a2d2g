    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Healing Program. Arm 2: Healing Program/CBT. Therapy is administered once-weekly over 5 weeks in a 3-hour group format, augmented with 3-once weekly one-on-one 1-hour sessions with a counsellor. Healing Program includes education about traditional indigenous knowledge and rituals, awareness raising of problems in communities and the historical context in which they have developed, and traditional practices to address current problems. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</interventions>
