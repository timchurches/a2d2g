  <interventions>
    <interventions>Brief Mindfulness: A 10-15 minute mindfulness exercise will be delivered in a laboratory setting. The exercise will teach undergraduate students to focus on mindfulness of breath and body scanning. Hence, they will learn to focus on internal sensations non-judgementally immediately before completing two acute experimental pain tasks. 

Two water tanks manufactured by Thermoline Scientific Australia were used to conduct the cold pressor task. Each tank was comprised of a 20L circulating water bath chamber (model TLWB-30), immersion cooler (TIC-400) and a heat circulator (TU-3). In order to ensure participants initial arm temperature was controlled for, they were firstly asked to submerge their arm up to the elbow for 30 seconds in the warm tank, with a maintained temperature of 37degrees C ( plus or minus 0.5). Following this, they submerged the same arm up to the elbow into the tank of cold water, maintained at 5 degrees C(plus or minus 0.5).  Research in the past indicates the cold pressor task produces the Lewis Effect, whereby pain is produced by vasodilation of the blood vessels due to warm water, quickly followed by vasoconstriction due to cold water.

A series of shocks a 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 microamps will be administered and a pain rating will be recorded.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Distraction: Another group will be given an audiotape of a sound array and asked to focus their attention on the different sounds that they can hear. They will practice this for a matched period of time (10-15 minutes) as the mindfulness group. Their pain will be assessed immediately after receiving the intervention.

The audiotape will play when the pain tasks are undertaken.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the moderating impact of baseline attentional bias on the relative efficacy of two brief interventions: mindfulness vs distraction. Participants will have their attention biases towards painful stimuli assessed and will then be randomized to receive either distraction or mindfulness before completing two experimental pain tasks. </summary>
