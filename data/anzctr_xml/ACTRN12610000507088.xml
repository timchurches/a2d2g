Such stratification will  group changes in bone quality due in part to pubertal status- pre, peri and post pubertal.  .

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have an increased risk of long bone and vertebral fracture due to reduced bone mass (osteopenia). In DMD, osteopenia is due to both reduced mobility and glucocorticoid use. There is no recognised treatment for osteopenia in DMD. Bisphosphonates are a class of drug which act primarily by decreasing the activity of the bone resorbing cells, the osteoclast. In children with osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) bisphosphonates have been shown to improve bone strength and increase bone density (areal Bone Mineral Density (aBMD)) through a combination of increased cortical thickness and trabecular number. 
Bisphosphonates alter the course of corticosteroid induced bone loss and largely prevent this complication in the adult population. It is more difficult to provide such evidence in a paediatric population where linear growth and puberty both rapidly alter skeletal size and make interpretation of bone density more difficult. With techniques of volumetric bone density (BMAD) calculation available, more accurate data can now be observed. 
Study significance 
This study is powered to provide definitive data on the utility of 3-6 monthly intravenous zoledronic acid to improve bone density in boys with DMD. Results from this study will be used to develop a study to assess fracture reduction in this population. This in turn would have far reaching consequences in terms of potential reduction in morbidity, hospitalization and immobilization of affected boys.</summary>
