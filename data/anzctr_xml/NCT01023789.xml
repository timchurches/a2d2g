    <inclusivecriteria>-  Up to two de novo lesions can be treated, each located in a separate native epicardial
             vessel.

          -  Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery where target vessel(s)
             diameter is = 2.0 mm and = 3.3 mm and target lesion length is = 28 mm, both assessed
             by on-line QCA.

          -  Target lesion(s) must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated
             stenosis of = 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of = 1.

          -  If two treatable lesions meet the inclusion criteria they must be in separate major
             epicardial vessels (LAD with septal and diagonal branches, LCX with obtuse marginal
             and/or ramus intermedius branches and RCA and any of its branches).

          -  Percutaneous interventions for lesions in a non-target vessel are allowed if done = 30
             days prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the index procedure.

          -  Percutaneous intervention for lesions in the target vessel are allowed if done &gt; 6
             months prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the index procedure.</inclusivecriteria>

             estimation) arterial or saphenous vein graft.

          -  Lesion(s) involving a bifurcation with side branch vessel = 2 mm in diameter and/or
             ostial lesion &gt; 40% stenosed by visual estimation or side branch requiring
             predilatation.

          -  Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), prior to wire passing.

          -  Target vessel(s) contains visible thrombus.

          -  Another clinically significant lesion is located in the same epicardial vessel
             (including side branch) as the target lesion(s).
