  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effect of different varieties of sweetpotatoes and potatoes prepared by different methods on feeling of hunger/ fullness and other blood measurements related to health after consumption of a test meal. 

The significance of this study is to identify which types of potatoes and sweetpotatoes reduce hunger the most and lower blood glucose, insulin, ghrelin and oxidative stress biomarkers and thus may be recommended as part of a healthy diet in order to reduce the risk of obesity,  diabetes and heart disease.</summary>
