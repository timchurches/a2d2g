  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment A: Sitagliptin 100mg (oral tablet)
Treatment B: Losartan 100mg (oral tablet)
Treatment C: Sitagliptin 100mg (oral tablet) + Losartan 100mg (oral tablet)

Each participant receives each of the treatments (A, B, C) once as a single oral dose with a seven day wash-out period in between doses. The order in which they receive the treatments is randomized.

MK0431G (combination treatment) is being developed for treatment of patients for whom treatment with both Sitagliptin and Losartan is appropriate. However, this study is in healthy volunteers only.</interventions>
