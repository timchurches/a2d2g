  <interventions>
    <interventions>For those trial participants randomized to prophylactic intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC), an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) will be inserted prior to the commencement of surgery. The timing of the placement of the IABP will be left to the discretion of the treating surgical team and depending on local facilities, policies and expertise, may be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU), cardiac catheter lab, anaesthetic bay or operating theatre (after induction of anaesthesia, but prior to commencement of the surgery). Details of the location and timing of insertion will be recorded. After confirmation of correct placement, IABC will commence 1:1 throughout the surgery and for the first post-operative night in the ICU. Removal of the IABP after the first night in the ICU will be at the discretion of the treating team. General care of the IABP will be according to local institutional policies and protocols. </interventions>
    <comparator>For those trial participants randomized to standard care, all usual treatments, pre-operative, anaesthetic, surgical and post-operative will be as per the treating team. The use of IABC prior to surgery will be specifically discouraged and its use would be recorded as a protocol violation. The use of IABC as an adjunct to weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, or in the ICU post-operatively will be allowed and the incidence of this will be recorded. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to help determine whether, in high risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a device known as an intraaortic balloon pump placed prior to surgery to support the heart, reduces serious postoperative complications. The study will also help determine whether a large study to definitively answer this question is feasible. </summary>
