  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the past, nutritional management formed the cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM). More recently, this aspect of treatment has received less attention as drug therapy
      aimed not only to lower glucose, but also to treat raised blood pressure and blood fats
      (including cholesterol) has been more widespread. While there is evidence to suggest that
      blood pressure and blood fat levels have improved, overall diabetes control has not and
      people with diabetes appear to be becoming progressively more overweight, following trends in
      the general population. The proposed study involves a randomised controlled trial in which
      people with T2DM continuing with their regular drug treatment and surveillance, will be
      randomly allocated to additionally receive intensive advice regarding diet or remain on their
      usual treatment in this regard. The results will be judged principally in terms of body
      weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose control and blood fats.</summary>
