  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria: full-time enrolment at Curtin University of Technololgy, internal study mode at Bentley campus, recent hazardous drinking: scoring 8+ on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and drinking more than 4/6 (females/males) standard drinks on one or more occasions in previous 4 weeks. (Hazardous drinking status assessed via web-based screening questionnaire.)</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Not recent hazardous drinking: scoring 7 or below on the AUDIT and/or not drinking more than 4/6 (females/males) standard drinks on one or more occasions in previous 4 weeks.</exclusivecriteria>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants randomly selected from university enrolment database, sent postal and email invitations to complete baseline survey. Those screening positive for hazardous drinking via computer algorithms within the baseline survey were then automatically allocated to intervention or control group via computerised randomisation. Contacted by letter and email at 1 and 6 months to complete follow ups via web-based interface. In accordance with ethics approval, participants were not informed that the study was a RCT.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation conducted by programmer not involved in implementation of the trial on site (therefore not in contact with study participants) by using a randomisation table created by computer software. Sequence applied automatically by computer algorithms during completion of the baseline survey.</sequence>
