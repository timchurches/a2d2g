  <interventions>
    <interventions>For patients receiving propofol infusion, the dose will be adjusted according to sedation requirements by the anaesthetist (This may range fom 50-500 mg/hr via intravenous infusion). Patients will be spontaneously ventilating, with supplemental oxygen administered via a clear Hudson mask at 6 L /min. Supplemental midazolam (1-5 mg intravenous) is permitted.  A BIS target of &gt; 65 will be set for depth of sedation.

For patients receiving desflurane anesthesia they will receive intravenous induction of anesthesia with propofol (50-200 mg) followed by desflurane via inhalation. Ventilation will be via larangeal mask anesthesia and spontaneous ventilation unless the treating anaesthetist considers that endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is required for the particular patient.  The dose of desflurane will be adjusted according to the clinical requirement by the anaesthetist. A target BIS of 40-60 will be set for depth of anaesthesia.

The treating anaesthetist will then open the envelopes to reveal the allocation. A non-participant in any process of the study will perform preparation of the envelopes.

    <statisticalmethods>For the primary outcome, the proportion of patients recovered at day 3 in the cognitive domain will be analysed by Fishers exact test. For analysis of recovery between groups over time the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test on the proportions of recovery for each group with continuity correction over five measurement periods. Continuous data will be analyzed using independent samples t test, or RM ANOVA for repeated measurements.

Sample size estimates are based on the primary endpoint of cognitive recovery on day 3. In a previous study involving major joint replacement surgery, the incidence of cognitive recovery on day 3 was 61%.  In order to detect a difference with an odds ratio of 2.5 (indicating a moderate size clinical effect) using Fishers exact test, with alpha size 0.05 and power 0.8, a sample size of 100 patients per group is required.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to assess whether two different anaesthetic techniques can affect the postoperative quality of recovery in patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery. The two techniques are considered as sedation or light general anaesthesia as they supplement a spinal anaesthetic - which is the primary anaesthetic technique for these patients. 

The quality of recovery is measured using a scale called the PQRS, which measures recovery in a number of different domains and compares recovery to the patients pre-surgery values.
