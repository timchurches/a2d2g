    <exclusivecriteria>-  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

        an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater
        than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an
        average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). A standard unit is defined as 10g
        ethanol which is equivalent to 100mL wine, 250mL full strength beer, 470mL light beer, 30mL
        spirits

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the dosing day in the current study:
             30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the dosing
             day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive [serum or urine] human chorionic
             gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Subjects who have asthma or a history of asthma within the past 6 months.

          -  History of smoking or history of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing
             products within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice, pummelos,
             satsuma, ugli, tangerine, and tangelo, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or
