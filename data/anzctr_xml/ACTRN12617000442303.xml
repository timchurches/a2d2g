  <interventions>
    <interventions>A novel, evidence-informed, psycho-educational intervention: Learning Clubs for Women's Health and Infant Health and Development. The intervention comprises 20 educational modules, delivered in face-face groups at a community centre and in one  home visit. All content is drawn from interventions shown in RCTs in resource-constrained settings to be effective in addressing either maternal nutrition, mental health, parenting capabilities, infant health and development, or gender-based violence and empowerment. These include the Thinking Healthy, What Were We Thinking, Sisters for Life and Care for Child Development programs; and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on nutrition and breastfeeding. Nutritional messages will be based on WHO recommendations including e-Library of Evidence for Nutrition Actions and Essential Nutrition Action, and include dietary diversity, the use of supplements and fortified foods, and the importance of adequate nutritional intake. Messages about water, sanitation and hygiene will use materials from the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program. These will be adapted to be consistent with current national perinatal programs in Vietnam and to be culturally appropriate for Vietnamese women.

Each session will be facilitated by a member of the local Women's Union, who has had experience in conducting community programs and will also receive training specific to this trial. When required, a community health worker and/or a kindergarten teacher will also participate.

Each module will increase perinatal stage-specific essential knowledge and skills though structured learning activities that have been translated, culturally adapted and field-tested for salience and comprehensibility. The program will be implemented in facilitated small groups of women meeting every two to four weeks in community centres from early pregnancy until the end of the first postpartum year (a total of 19 facilitated sessions) and one home visit during the first eight postpartum weeks when mothers and infants in this setting usually do not go out of the house.

Each session will be from 60 to 90 minutes in duration, with shorter sessions scheduled for the first two postpartum meetings to accommodate infant feeding and sleeping requirements.  

A typical session would include greeting the participants, recording attendance by Learning Club participants and any accompanying family members, weighing the participants to record pregnancy weight gain, asking the participants if they have any questions or concerns they'd like to discuss, introducing the current session and delivering the module content. Educational information will be given to the participants through the use of videos, short talks and participatory learning activities. These will be varied to maintain interest and will include short quizzes, physical exercises for pregnancy, practising breathing techniques for birth, observation of their babies to understand child development, demonstrations of caregiving for optimal child development, discussing and solving scenario-based exercises to understand and promote gender empowerment and mental health and prevent gender-based violence. During each session, take-home materials will be distributed to each participant. These materials will provide a summary of the information the participants are given at each session, recommended activities they can do at home and two take-home messages, one of which is to promote mental health and the other is to promote healthy nutrition.

A household visit will be conducted by a trained commune health station staff member. The purpose of the visit is to screen for postnatal complications and newborn warning signs and to guide women and their family members on how to soothe and settle the baby effectively and to promote the babys development through play and communication. Materials with summarised information, recommended activities and main messages for promoting mental health and healthy nutrition will be provided. The visit is expected to take 45 to 60 minutes. 

As a whole the intervention will meet the 'five pillars' recommended by the World Health Organisation for programs to improve maternal and child health: family support, empathic listening, guided discovery using culturally appropriate images and text-based materials, behavioural activation and collaborative problem solving.

Intervention fidelity will be monitored by recording participants' attendance at each session. An attendance sheet will be distributed to each facilitator, who will record each participant's attendance at each session and whether there are any other family members joining her. In communes where the participation rate drops below 70%, facilitators in these communes will be contacted and participants' opinions will be sought to discuss if there are any problems or difficulties which may have led to a low participation rate that could be addressed.

      <outcome>Maternal urinary iodine concentration will be assessed in urine samples. A casual urine sample of approximately 10 ml will be obtained from each participant in late pregnancy. Urine samples will be frozen in a field freezer and transported in a cold chain to the laboratory of the National Hospital of Endocrinology in Hanoi, who have conducted urine iodine concentration (UIC) analyses for many national surveys in Viet Nam. At the laboratory, UIC will be determined by means of the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction, as recommended by WHO, UNCEF and The International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD). Iodine nutritional status is classified as adequate if UIC =150 µg/l) or deficient if UIC &lt;150 µg/l according to the WHO/UNCEF/ICCIDD guidelines.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed. This trial will be conducted in Ha Nam, a rural province that has sufficient infrastructure to conduct this trial, represents the geographic zones of the North of Vietnam and does not have conflicting studies taking place. In the province, districts that are accessible to the research team by car will be selected and lists of communes from the selected districts made. In total 84 communes (unit of clustering) will be randomly selected from the lists and 42 will be allocated randomly to each study arm by an independent statistician. 

In a process we have used successfully in prior studies, commune health centre staff and village health workers will identify and approach potential participants to inform them of the study and invite those who are interested to visit the commune health centre if they want to receive more information about the study. Those who are interested to participate will be recruited. The recruitment process will begin with 12 pregnant women per commune being randomly-selected from the list of eligible women. Each woman who declines the invitation to participate will be replaced by another randomly-selected woman until 12 are recruited per commune.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The number of clusters and sample size have been calculated using the clustersampsi module in Stata, Version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). A total of 1,008 pregnant women from 84 clusters (in each study arm: 504 women (12 women per commune (the cluster) recruited from 42 clusters) is necessary to detect a difference in the primary outcome (BSID cognitive development score &lt; 1 SD at 2 years of age) of 15% in the control arm and 8% in the Learning Club intervention arm (with 80% statistical power and a significance level of 0.05; intra-cluster correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.03). These assumptions are derived from previous studies in Vietnam and other resource-constrained settings. This sample size will give us = 85% power to detect differences between the two arms of the secondary outcomes. Sample size and power calculations take into account loss to follow-up from still births (0.2%), late abortions (1%), infant mortality (0.2%), relocation (5%) and withdrawal (13%), estimated together to be 20%. 

After descriptive analyses, data will be analysed in two steps. First, the differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the two arms will be estimated by individual-level analyses adjusting for clustering. Second, mixed-effect logistic regression for the main outcome and mixed-effect linear regression models for the secondary outcomes taking into account prognostic indicators and incorporating a random effect for commune (clustering) and a fixed effect for trial arm will be conducted to estimate the effects of the intervention on the outcomes. All analyses will follow intention-to-treat principles, applying multiple imputation for missing data, and be performed at individual level using Stata, Version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pregnant women in resource-constrained settings experience malnutrition, poverty, gender-based violence, depression and anxiety and inadequate access to health care and social protection, at much higher rates than women in high-income countries. We have shown in rural Vietnam that during pregnancy, women experience high rates of  food insecurity, iodine deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, intimate partner violence and common mental disorders. 

The goal of this project is to improve the physical and mental health of women and the health and development of their infants in this resource-constrained setting, by addressing multiple risks together. This research is a world-first cluster-randomised controlled trial of a complex intervention addressing womens physical and mental health, their parenting capabilities, infant health and development, and gender-based violence and empowerment in a resource-constrained setting. If shown to be effective it will provide robust evidence to inform national, regional and international policies and practices to optimise the health of the poorest women and the early development of their children in Vietnam and internationally.</summary>
