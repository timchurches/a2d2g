  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vacuum extraction is a common procedure for assisting vaginal delivery. Traditionally, negative pressure application was recommended to be increased stepwisely.
This trial aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of rapid versus stepwise negative pressure application for assisted vaginal delivery by vacuum extraction. This will be a hospital-based, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Women eligible for the study are those with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy of more than 34 weeks of gestation, with a cephalic presentation. 	Vacuum extraction procedure will be performed by application to the fetal head with a metal cup (Malmstrom, 50 mm) connected to an electric pump. The conventional stepwise method consists of four incremental steps of 0.2 kg/cm2 every two minutes to obtain a final negative pressure of 0.8 kg/cm2. In the rapid method the negative pressure of 0.8 kg/cm2 will be applied in one step in less than two minutes. When the final pressure has been achieved, traction will be undertaken during uterine contractions and maternal expulsive efforts. If there is detachment of the vacuum cup, it will be applied again, if clinically appropriate, to the fetal head in the manner indicated by the initial randomization. Thailand Research Fund by Senior Research Scholar will be responsible for funding and financial oversight of the centres. 	The trial will show whether rapid negative pressure application technique of vacuum extraction is as good as stepwise technique regarding effectiveness and safety.</summary>
