  <interventions>
    <interventions>Scribe trainees will be offered access over 3 weeks at trainees convenience, to a training program which is as follows:
1. web-based training program available on-line that will take the students between 25 and 30 hours to complete, modular, covering basic scribe training (language, skills, behavioural training)
2. text-book to be read as adjunct to the course and kept for future reference
The Ultimate Medical Scribe handbook and course, Emergency Department 4th edition, Aaron Thompson, Kyle Kinglsey

They are required to complete each module in the training program and pass an end-of-module exam successfully. If unsuccessful they may complete the module again and take the exam again. There is no upper limit to the number of exam attempts until successfully passed.
The scribe trainees are monitored on-line as they progress through the course and complete each module exam - the researchers have continual access to the number of modules accessed, the time spent on each and the exam scores.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is "readiness to work" measured as follows:

The scribe candidates will attend a simulation centre training day at the end of the course. There will be a 45 minute orientation lecture to the template to be used to capture Emergency Department patient histories.

This will be followed by 3 patient encounters. Three typical emergency department presentations have been chosen to be representative of a typical, varied, Emergency Department day. Each patient is an actor, previously educated on the patient demographics, illness history and symptoms, past medical history and other pertinent information (such as social history and allergies). An emergency physician will take a history, examine the patient and make investigation and management plans for them.

The candidates will be asked to transcribe the patient history in real time, whilst observing the interaction. These histories will then be taken from the candidates and candidate identification will be masked.

Examiners will score the histories as to the quality, content and accuracy of the transcription obtained. The examiners will have previously watched the patient encounters and have transcribed their own record of the history to compare to the scribe's history.

Each history will be marked according to a criterion based modified Anghoff scale. This will allocate a score as follows - completely inadequate, inadequate, barely adequate and competent. Each scribe candidate will therefore receive scores overall which will determine their "readiness to work"</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Applicants for a scribe role at Cabrini hospital Emergency Department who have respond to an advertisement in Melbourne, get selected for a first round job interview and then are amongst the top 10 candidates. These will then offered  pre-work training and exposure to the intervention as described above.
Advertisements target undergraduate students in health sciences who seek part-time work as a medical scribe and have a strong interest in a long-term career in the Health Industry - particularly those seeking a place in a post-graduate medical degree.</inclusivecriteria>
