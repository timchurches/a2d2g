    <interventions>NET treatment is a mind-body approach which uses applies physical stimulus whilst a participant thinks about a key emotional event. The physical stimulus in this case is a gentle percussion on the back in the thoracic region. In this trial participants will receive a single treatment session of approximately 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigates whether a new form of treatment (NET) has a beneficial effect on tender or painful trigger points. Trigger points are locations on a muscle surface which are abnormally tender and are a source of self-perpetuating and continuing pain. This study looks at trigger points in the neck region. Participants will be assessed for the presence of trigger points. They will be given one course of NET treatment. They will return after 3 days to have their trigger points assessed for any change in their tenderness and the degree of neck pain. The treatment group results will be compared to a control group who receive a sham treatment which has no therapeutic value.</summary>
