  <interventions>
    <interventions>Double blinded, randomized controlled trial. All subjects will be prescribed individualized diets. Energy requirements will assessed at baseline by measuring resting metabolic rate and using an activity factor of 1.5 for men/ 1.3 for women. Subjects will be prescribed 75% of their estimated energy requirements. Dietary composition will follow NHMRC dietary guidelines except for dairy products which will be restricted to 1 serve per day and meat intake that will prescribed at no more than 3 serves/week for men and 2 serves/ week for women. Participants will be provided with the two weeks menu with recipe cards so they can prepare their own meals at home.

Study duration:  8-week program. 
Study diets: All diets are restricted in energy intake. Daily Diet composition will be 65% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 15% Fat
Control group:  Control diet plus placebo (lactose) oral capsules (~3 grams/day)
Experimental group: Control diet plus leucine oral capsules(~3 grams/day)
Both placebo and leucine capsules made up by Pharmacy 777.

Each participant will be called for fortnightly visits to check their diet and capsule compliance. Diet Compliance will be checked in oral discussion and any issues will be sorted. Capsule compliance will be done by checking self reported capsule fill-in form. At the end of trial all will be asked to fill in food questionaire which can be compared with the prescribed intake. Capsule count will be done at each 4 weeks when they return empty container and self reported form.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This is a pilot trial of 8 weeks duration examining whether additional supplementation of  leucine (3 grams/day) during calorie restriction is better than weight loss alone in reducing fat loss and muscle loss. 
The hypothesis is that leucine will improve muscle mass retention and increase fat loss, hence improving insulin action. We envisage an improved body composition that will favour those at risk of metabolic syndrome to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.      </summary>
