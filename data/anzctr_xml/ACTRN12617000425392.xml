  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supplementation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the effects of supplementation on erythropoiesis, exercise-induced inflammation and performance during altitude training in athletes.

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) will be administered orally in tablet form, 1200 mg per day, daily for 2 weeks.

Supplementation will occur for a 6 day loading period prior to the first of 3 experimental trials, and for the duration of the exercise trials (1 week).

Double blind randomised placebo­ controlled crossover design. Well­ trained cyclists (n=12) will receive either NAC (1200mg/d) or a placebo supplement. Participants will complete 3, 2 h trials in each condition. Trials will be conducted in a hypoxic chamber located at the NSW Institute of Sport and administered/supervised by one of the researchers (exercise physiologist). On the days of the exercise trials, the daily dose of NAC/placebo will be taken 2 hours prior.
­ Control, seated in normoxia 
­ Hypoxia, seated in fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO2]=15% 
­ Exercise + hypoxia, FiO2=15%, 30 min seated, incremental cycle test to exhaustion (starting at a power output of 2 Watts per kg body mass, increase 50 watts every 3 minutes until exhaustion), 20 minutes recovery, repeat sprint protocol (3 sets of 12 x 5 s efforts with 30 s rest - interspersed with 5 min recovery)
Venous blood samples (pre, post and 2 h post) will be taken to assess hypoxic ­inducible factor 1­alpha, nuclear factor ­kappa B, EPO, gluthathione:reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG:GSH) and a full blood count. At least 36 h between each trial and a 3 wk washout between conditions. </interventions>

      <outcome>Athlete training status
Customised training questionnaire utilising the session rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method of training quantification. Briefly, for each training session, participants provide the duration in minutes, distance completed in kilometres (blank if strength training/cross training) and an RPE score (0-10) with 0 being no exertion and 10 being maximal exertion. Session load is calculated by multiplying duration and RPE.

      <outcome>Athlete health and wellbeing
Customised health and wellness questionnaire
Briefly, participants are asked to rate on a 1-10 Likert scale (1 not at all/poor/minimal, 10 extremely/excellent) perceptions of sleep quality, body soreness, fatigue, general health, mood, mental readiness to train, physical readiness to train. Additionally, participants will be ask yes/no whether they are sick, and if yes, to list any symptoms e.g. headache, upper respiratory, congestion etc.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Athletes regularly incorporate living and training at altitude into their programs to enhance physiological and performance adaptations. It can be logistically difficult and expensive for Australian athletes to gain the benefits of altitude training. Current options available in Australia are limited to relatively low levels of natural altitude or the use of artificial hypoxic environments. Preliminary data suggests that supplementation with the antioxidant n­acetylcysteine (NAC) may boost the erythropoeitic response (i.e. increase red blood cell production) to hypoxia and support the immune system during strenuous training blocks. However, to date, the efficacy of NAC to enhance these physiologic systems has not been determined in an applied sports setting. 
This investigation forms part of a series of studies will be the first to comprehensively examine the acute effects of NAC supplementation to augment the physiological adaptations to hypoxic exposure in elite athletes. It will also contribute to the existing knowledge regarding the ergogenic effect of NAC on repeat sprint cycle performance in well trained cyclists and add further real-­world data to the debate regarding the potential blunting of cellular adaptations with antioxidant supplementation. Importantly, it will also provide valuable information to physiologists, coaches and athletes regarding the prescription and periodisation of NAC supplementation and the optimal integration of hypoxic interventions to produce peak performance during targeted competitions.</summary>
