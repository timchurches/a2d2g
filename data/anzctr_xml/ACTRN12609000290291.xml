  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial is designed to test whether the three commonly used oral steroid treatment regimes for croup, are equally effective.  Children will receive one of the three treatments, decided by a random process, and their improvement and outcomes monitored by investigators who are blinded to the treatment received.</summary>
