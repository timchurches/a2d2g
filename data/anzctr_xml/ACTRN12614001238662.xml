    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Antifungal activity by culture of Nail clippings, and skin scraped from under a nail.
Culture identifies which organism is responsible for the infection.
Sabouraud-chloramphenicol and Sabouraud-chloramphenicol-actidione culture will perform. Species identification will base on microscopic characteristics of the fungus observe.</outcome>
