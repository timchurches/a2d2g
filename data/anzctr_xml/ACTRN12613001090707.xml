  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children will be repeatedly exposed to a small amount of vegetables in the home environment. Two intervention conditions are tested: 1) single target vegetable, and 2) multiple target vegetable. Trial staff will tell parents what vegetables to use. Both interventions will be conducted over a 5 week period, with exposure three times a week, providing a total of 15 exposure days. Exposure to vegetables means that the parent will present a small piece of vegetable to the child, and encourages their child to taste the vegetable. The vegetable will be presented at a time when the child is hungry (before a snack or dinner) which remains constant throughout the intervention. Children in the single vegetable exposure group will be exposed to the same (single) vegetable every time. Children in the multiple vegetable exposure group will be presented three vegetables in total, in a rotating schedule (provided by trial staff) whereby the child receives 2 of the 3 vegetables on every exposure day. The parent will deliver the intervention to the child, and they will receive the information on how to do this in a booklet, which will be explained by a trial staff member in a face to face session (approximate duration 15-20 min) with the parent also. The intervention information will include practical advice on how and when to prepare and present the vegetables for their child to eat, and information how they can effectively address negative reactions from their child when tasting vegetables. This information includes a flowchart with suggestions how to respond to a child who refuses to taste (specifically by 1) modelling tasting the vegetable, and 2) cut the vegetable in smaller pieces, and 3) stop after that). A follow up phone call (estimated duration 15 min) will be made to parents mid trial to discuss any queries they may have, and parents will also be provided with a phone number they can ring if they have questions or concerns. Parents will use a diary to record the outcome of every exposure day (i.e. child consumed vegetable wholly/partially/refused etc..). Stickers are provided as a small reward to the child for tasting the vegetable. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will not be exposed to any vegetables during the intervention phase, and parents will be instructed to keep using the same techniques /strategies  they are currently using at home to encourage their child to consume vegetables.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change (from pre to post test) in intake (g) of tasted and non-tasted vegetables in an experimental setting. Childrens will be provided with a meal in the research facilities before and after the intervention (weeks 0,6). The meal will consist of three vegetables, a non-vegetable staple and a protein component. Intake will be calculated by subtracting the leftover weight from the weight served for each food component. Intake in the post-session will be subtracted from intake in the pre-session for each vegetable separately, and for the total intake of vegetables.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 0 and 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change (from pre to post test, to 3 month follow up) in vegetable intake of child at home. Childrens intake of vegetables at home will be measured using multiple (3 day) weighed food records on 3 occasions (weeks 0, 6 and 18). Parents will record food intake for their child. Average vegetable intake in pre-test, post-test and three month follow up will be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 0,6 and 18</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change (from pre to post test, to 3 month follow up) in the childs vegetable acceptance. The childs acceptance for a range of vegetables will be provided by the parent using a nine-point hedonic scale (weeks 0, 6 and 18). Acceptance for vegetables will be compared in pre-test, post-test and three month follow up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 0, 6 and 18</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change (from pre to post test, to 3 month follow up) in vegetable offering by the parent to the child at home. Parent will provide information on type and quantity of vegetable offered to the child in the past month, and which and how much have been consumed by the child.</outcome>

      <outcome>Development of acceptance (as reported by the parent) for the vegetables the children are exposed to during the intervention. Nine-point scale will be used to measure the child's acceptance </outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by public advertisements and flyers in daycare centres, school newsletters etc. Participants may also be recruited from Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) staff in proximity to the research facilities, and through a qualified recruitment agency. Participants may need to be recruited in waves depending on the interest and response to advertisements. It is estimated that the majority of participant recruitment will be completed within a 5 month period. Interested participants will be invited to complete a screener questionnaire. Eligible participants will be sent an Information Sheet and Consent Form, and they will be invited to attend a group information session where full details of the study are provided. Participants that return the completed consent form will be included in the study, and participant numbers will be allocated in order of processing consent forms. Allocation to treatment of participants will be randomized by computer, and staff processing consent forms will be blinded to treatment. Staff conducting assessments will also be blinded to treatment.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A participant sample of 96 subjects is sought. Power was calculated for a repeated measures ANOVA design consisting of 3 groups, and allowing for within-subject (pre/post test comparisons) and between subject (group) comparisons of vegetable intake. Based on a power of 0.95, alpha of 0.05, an effect size of 0.25, and a correlation of 0.25 between measures, a sample size of 96 participants is needed (GPower v3.1.7, 2013). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two exposure-led interventions on children's vegetable acceptance and intake. Low acceptance is one of the key reasons for low consumption of vegetable in children. A randomized controlled design study will compare two  exposure-led interventions to a control group, in 4-6 year old children, whose parents would like their child to eat more vegetables. Both intervention groups will be exposed to small quantities of vegetables in the home environment. Effect on vegetable acceptance and dietary intake will be compared between groups, and with the control group, before and after an at home exposure intervention, as well as after a three month follow up. It is hypothesized that the interventions will lead to increased vegetable acceptance and intake in children.</summary>
