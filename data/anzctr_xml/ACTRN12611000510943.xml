  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention participants received the standard written information which consisted of the Australian Orthopaedic Association Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, A Guide for Patients (Edition No 2, May 2008 Mitec Medical Publishing) and a preparation for joint replacement surgery booklet collated by the researcher covering the hospital stay, the episode in hospital including pain management, physiotherapy and occupational therapy roles and home aid requirements.  In addition intervention participants attended a pre admission program which consisted of a two hour conference with presentations by nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy staff members.  One on one time with a physiotherapist for individual advice and learning how to use walking aids also occurred.  The intervention participants plus support person(s) also viewed a hip or knee replacement 3D multimedia patient education module.  The modules were included as an adjunct to the surgical informed consent process, to reinforce information provided by the surgeon and the education program.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The findings of this study have demonstrated that a comprehensive multi disciplinary patient education program with the multimedia patient education module, in line with adult learning principles, had a positive impact on informing and preparing patients for major joint surgery, the management of their post operative pain and their six week recovery period.
 The intervention participants reported a statistically significant greater level of preparedness for surgery than the control group.  The pre admission education group goals were to give the patient a consistent message from the multi disciplinary team, offer opportunities to ask questions, participate in discussions, to understand the role of nurses, allied health staff, surgeons and anaesthetists and engage the patient in their self efficacy, their pain management and to take an active role in their rehabilitation.  
A second statistically significant outcome was the intervention group patients reported the pre admission information also prepared them to a greater degree with the management of their post operative pain when compared to the control group.
Regarding the secondary outcome of in-patient length of stay, the intevention patients had a 0.4 day less than the control group, it was nor statistically significant and as many factors impact length of stay it is not possible to conclude that greater study numbers would have made it significant.
These findings illustrate the significance to the patient of a comprehensive pre admission program.  Establishing realistic expectations of patient surgical outcomes, promoting active involvement in pain management, rehabilitation and discharge can all contribute to a more positive experience in-hospital experience and recuperative episode.  This in turn may have benefits to the organisation through a decreased length of stay, the improved utilisation of staff expertise and the growth of their positive corporate image and reputation.</summary>
