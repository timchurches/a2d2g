  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the intervention arm will complete a survey containing a risk-benefit preference decision aiding tool: a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey. The DCE tool includes items about post-operative pain, stiffness, quality of life, complications and adverse events (health states) following knee replacement surgery. These items are organised into a number of scenarios and then organised into pairs, and patients are asked to choose between a number of these pairs of choices. The remainder of the survey includes  items about how much improvement in symptoms patients expect following knee surgery, the level of control over things in your life, and attitude towards taking risks, and the physical and emotional experiences associated with knee pain. 
Participants are required to complete the survey prior to total knee replacement (TKR) during their routine pre-admission appointment at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne. The survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Patients will also be required to complete a brief patient expectation survey 1-week prior to scheduled TKR, which will take approximately 5-minutes to complete. Surveys can be completed electronically or paper-based hardcopy. Electronic surveys will be completed using a portable computer with administrative assistance provided from the study coordinator</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control arm will complete a reduced survey that does not contain the DCE activity. The survey includes  items about how much improvement in symptoms patients expect following knee surgery, the level of control over things in your life, and attitude towards taking risks, and the physical and emotional experiences associated with knee pain. Participants are required to complete the survey prior to total knee replacement (TKR) during their routine pre-admission appointment at St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne. The survey will take approximately 25-minutes to complete. Surveys can be completed electronically or paper-based hardcopy.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A primary outcome will be changes in patient-reported knee pain between baseline and 1-year post TKR. Pain will be measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index (Bellamy et al., 1998). The WOMAC consists of 24 items, with knee pain measured using a 5-item subscale. The pain subscale will be transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater pain.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A primary outcome will be changes in patient-reported knee stiffness between baseline and 1-year post TKR. Knee stiffness will be measured on the WOMAC (Bellamy et al. 1998) using the two-item stiffness subscale. The stiffness subscale will be transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater stiffness. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A primary outcome will be changes in patient-reported knee function between baseline and 1-year post TKR. Knee function will be measured on the WOMAC (Bellamy et al. 1998) using the 17-item function subscale. The function subscale will be transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater stiffness. </outcome>

      <outcome>Recovery expectations following TKA: measured using the 19-item Hospital for Special Surgery: Knee Surgery Expectations Survey </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will complete this at baseline before total knee replacement surgery and before completing the DCE survey (or control survey); 1-week prior to scheduled TKR; and 12 months after surgery. In addition, orthopaedic surgeons will complete the same recovery expectations survey (Hospital for Special Surgery: Knee Surgery Expectations Survey) for patients consented for TKA immediately following the consult after consenting the patient.. This will allow for a matched surgeon/patient comparison of expectations for recovering following TKA.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be by intention to treat. Categorical variables will be analysed using chi-squared tests (or Fishers Exact test for small samples) while for continuous variables we will employ (parametric) t-tests and (non-parametric) Mann-Whitney tests for symmetrically and asymmetrically distributed data, respectively. The significance of differences in dichotomous data will be tested using generalised estimating equations or linear mixed model. If there are chance imbalances in baseline patient characteristics hypothesised to influence the main outcomes, then statistical techniques that allow adjustment for confounding variables will be used as secondary analyses. DCE data will be analysed based on extensions to logistic regression, including multinomial logit models, mixed logit models, and generalised multinomial logit models (Fiebig et al., 2010). If there are more than 5% missing data, sensitivity analysis allowing for different assumptions, such as the best or worst possible scenario, will also be reported for the main outcomes of the study. The sample size calculation for this study was based on the following parameters: (i) alpha value = 0.05, 2-sided; (ii) power = 80%; (iii) expected rates of satisfaction at 1 year post TKA of 77% for patients using a risk-benefit preference (DCE) tool prior to surgery compared to 51% for patients undergoing standard procedural consent. The expected rates of satisfaction are derived from a recent study which reported 49% of patients whose expectations were not met reported dissatisfaction with their TKA compared 6% of patients whose expectations were met (Bourne et al., 2010). Incomplete data were reported in 17% of the patient cohort and therefore these patients were not included in the analysis. We have therefore assumed a worst case scenario that these 17% would have reported dissatisfaction despite having their expectations met. Based on these rates the sample size required in each group is 60. To allow for a 10% drop-out of patients, we will recruit 132 patients in total (66 per arm).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in developed nations. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the mainstay of treatment for people with end-stage knee OA, and represents one of the highest volume medical interventions globally. Despite a high overall success rate with this operation, up to 1 in 3 patients remain dissatisfied following TKA. The reasons for this dissatisfaction include ongoing pain and functional limitation, which patients view as markers of poor outcome following surgery. Research indicates that the strongest predictor of patient dissatisfaction following TKA is unmet expectations. This is known to occur when patients and surgeons have different expectations of surgery. Decision making aids have been effective in aligning patient and surgeon expectations of surgery and improve health outcomes. This study will use a discrete choice experiment (DCE) as a type of decision making aid applied to patients prior to surgery to improve patient knowledge and realistic expectations of TKA. This study will test if this leads to greater health outcome and satisfaction amongst patients following TKA.
132 people with end stage OA on the waiting list for TKA will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of 2 groups using computer-generated block randomisation. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) adhering to CONSORT guidelines will evaluate the effect of applying a DCE prior to surgery on patient expectations, health outcomes and satisfaction following TKA. Patients in the intervention arm will complete a survey containing the DCE decision aiding tool, compared to the control group who will complete a modified survey that does not contain the DCE activity. Participants in both groups will be required to complete the survey prior to surgery during their routine pre-admission appointment at SVHM. Patients will also be required to complete a brief patient expectation survey 1-week prior to scheduled TKR. In addition, orthopaedic surgeons will complete a brief expectations survey for patients consented to TKA to compare matched surgeon and patient expectations for recovery following TKA. Primary outcomes will be evaluated by a blinded examiner at 12 months post-surgery using a validated self-reported pain and physical function scale. Secondary outcomes will include a range of validated measures of health and psychological wellbeing. All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis using linear regression models. 
This study is the first of its kind to use this approach to elicit risk-benefit tolerance in surgery and to evaluate if guiding patients through a decision making process in the form of a DCE-based survey prior to surgery will improve patient expectations, health outcomes and satisfaction following TKA. Reducing the rate of patient dissatisfaction commonly seen in patients following TKA will help to reduce the burden associated with poor outcomes on the health system.
