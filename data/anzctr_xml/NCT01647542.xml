             addition, if the patient is considered to need antiviral treatment, the patient should
             be excluded. (If the test results indicate only an hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
             carrier without any clinical manifestation of active infection, and no antiviral
             treatment is needed, then the patient could be enrolled provided all other criteria

         19. Has a history of hypersensitivity, allergies or has had an anaphylactic reaction(s) to

             intending to become pregnant before, during, or within 1 month after participating in
             this study; or intending to donate ova during such time period.
