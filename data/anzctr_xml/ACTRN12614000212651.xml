    <exclusivecriteria>Inadequate organ function for allogeneic stem cell transplantation as per Institutional guidelines.
Patients receiving any other investigational agents.
Patients with a past history of solid tumours within prior 2 years (excluding completely excised cutaneous BCC and SCC).
Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness / social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Known HIV, HCV or active HBV infection. Patients who are HepBcAb positive but HepBsAg negative (i.e. have had past HepB exposure) should receive lamivudine up to at least day 100 after HPCT.

Adequate contraception is defined as a double-barrier method, i.e. using at least 2 methods of contraception e.g. 2 actual barrier methods or 1 actual barrier method and 1 hormonal method. 
Patients with a past history of complicated diverticulitis, including fistulae, abscess formation or gastrointestinal (GI) perforation.
Donor is an identical twin (i.e. syngeneic)
History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition as TCZ, including known allergies to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other recombinant human or humanized antibodies.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether adding the drug, Tocilizumab, to standard transplant immunosuppression is safe and effective at preventing acute graft versus host disease (GVHD).
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 65 and are undertaking an HLA-mismatched allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (HPCT).
Trial details
all participants inthis trial will receive a single dose of 8mg/kg Tocilizumab by a 60 minute intravenous infusion (administered via the vein).  This will occur one day before your HPCT.
Participants will be assessed for up to 2 years to determine the incidence of GVHD.</summary>
