  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase Ib dose escalation / Phase II study in recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM HNSCC) patients considered to be
      resistant, ineligible or intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The first aim of the
      Phase Ib is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or the Recommended Phase
      II Dose(s) (RP2D(s)) for BYL719 in combination with cetuximab This part will include two
      different arms using two different administration methods of BYL719 tablets together with
      cetuximab as recommended by the label: Arm A - whole tablets will be administered to patients
      able to swallow the tablets vs. Arm B - a drinkable suspension prepared from crushed tablets
      will be administered to patients with swallowing dysfunction. The second aim of the Phase Ib
      is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the new dispersible tablet formulation of BYL719
      in combination with cetuximab. A third arm will be opened: Arm C, which will use a suspension
      from a dispersible tablet administered via gastric feeding tube (G tube). The safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy will be investigated separately in the Phase Ib arms. The
      MTD/RP2D will only be investigated independently for Arm A and B. The one of Arm B will be
      compared to that of Arm A. If the MTD/RP2D is the same, then both administration methods of
      BYL719 may be used in Phase II. If the MTD/RP2D is different, then only the administration of
      BYL719 whole tablets will be allowed in the Phase II. Arm C is an independent relative
      bioavailability study of the new dispersible tablet formulation of BYL719, which will begin
      at the starting dose/RP2D identified with a safety cohort followed by an expansion cohort.
      There will be no dose escalation or de-escalation in this Arm. If either the safety or
      pharmacokinetic profile of the RP2D of 300 mg QD in Arm C is not comparable with Arm A, then
      enrollment in Arm C will cease and the dispersible tablet will not be implemented in Phase
      II.

      The Phase Ib dose escalation part is expected to enroll approximately 12 patients for Arm A
      and B and will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM). The available
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy data, as well as the recommendations from the BLRM,
      are used to determine the dose combination for the next cohort(s). The Phase II part of the
      study will commence upon MTD/RP2D declaration of Arm A in Phase Ib, regardless of the
      progress of Arm B and C.

      The Phase II part will assess the clinical efficacy of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab
      in two patient populations: patients will be assigned to one of two schemes of enrollment
      based on prior therapy with cetuximab.

      Patients considered cetuximab naïve per protocol will be assigned to Scheme 1. The primary
      purpose of this scheme is to assess the anti-tumor activity of BYL719 in combination with
      cetuximab (Arm 1) vs. cetuximab as single-agent (Arm 2) in RM HNSCC patients' naïve to
      cetuximab. Patients in scheme 1 will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio via IRT in two Phase II
      arms: BYL719 in combination with cetuximab (Arm 1) vs. cetuximab as single-agent (Arm 2).
      Patients randomized to Arm 2 (cetuximab monotherapy) will have the opportunity to cross-over
      to combination treatment with BYL719 + cetuximab after experiencing disease progression. Arm
      1 will consist of approximately 66 patients and Arm 2 of approximately 33 patients.

      Patients having received prior cetuximab per protocol will be assigned to Scheme 2. The
      primary purpose of this scheme is to assess the anti-tumor activity of BYL719 in combination
      with cetuximab in RM HNSCC cetuximab resistant patients (Arm 3). Patients in this scheme will
      not be randomized. 40 patients will be enrolled. Phase II will further characterize the
      safety and PK of the drug combination.

      Patients will be treated until progression of disease (except for phase II Arm 2),
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first. Patients
      enrolled in Arm 2 experiencing disease progression will have the opportunity to crossover to
      the combination treatment (Arm 2B) and they will continue until they experience unacceptable
      toxicity that precludes any further treatment, until disease progression, and/or until
      treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or by patient refusal. In the
      follow-up period all patients must complete the safety follow-up assessments 30 days after
      the last dose of the study treatment. Patients who have not progressed at the time of
      discontinuation of study treatment should be radiologically followed for disease status until
      disease progression, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapies, or death, whichever
      occurs first. In addition, all patients enrolled in Phase II will be followed for survival.</summary>
