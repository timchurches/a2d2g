  <interventions>
    <interventions>Addition of oral valproate (dose is epilepsy dose titrated to plasma concentration so changes) or placebo to standard care.
start dose is 15-20mg/kg, titrated in 100-200mg amounts depending on clinical status. Once daily until completion of second scan after chemotherapy/radiotherapy scan (3-4 months). VPA commences 4-5 days pre surgery to enable CSF samples at time of surgery. Blood concentrations to monitor adherence.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>F-DOPA and F-MISO PET uptake using standard PET measurement tool</outcome>
      <timepoint>After treatment completed. this includes the chemotherapy (Temozolamide and the RT) and is usually 3-4 months. As the original (standard) pre-op scan is not being done (as too much brain shift to interpret PET volumes accurately post op), the second scan, at the completion of chemo and radiotherapy is the primary time point.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Possible side effects technically include any reported for VPA over the last 60 years. However we are recording any complaint as reported by the patient and assessing tolerability throughout study (ie any side effects post reporting or querying at any time point) including ECOG status.</outcome>
      <timepoint>over course of study - patient can call anytime. They also ha ve the appointments as part of their standard cancer care which are weekly while on chemo and radiation. There is no study  followup after the final scan when VPA stops.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> brain tissue for genetic markers known to be associated with survival in brain cancer (e.g. MGMT status and HDAC activity)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at time of surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood for measurements of valproate concentration, for HDAC activity in the PBMCs and tumor DNA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of surgery and then once during the VPA treatment (at the first bleed for VPA concentrations during the chemo/RT)</timepoint>

    <concealment>Allocation concealment
Patients approached by surgeon pre-surgery and they are consented by a member of the clinical team. The study nurses allocate the treatment randomly and advise the surgeon whether the patient will be having VPA. Allocation was concealed because it involved contacting Clinical trial staff Jacqui Keller or Jennifer Edmunds to provide the next number in the allocation schedule these people are “off-site” in a different building to the Hospital.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will measure the efficacy of valproic acid (VPA), a well established anti-seizure medication with known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor activity capable of restricting proliferation and inducing differentiation and apoptosis in cancer cells in patients with brain tumours. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with high grade glioblastoma and are having surgical therapy. Study details All participants will undergo their standard treatment of resection/ radiation therapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide as usual. Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive valproate in the standard dose used for epilepsy as well as standard care which includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy and surgery as usual. Whilst participants in the other group will receive usual care which includes chemotherapy and radiotherapy and surgery as usual. Participants will undergo diagnostic imaging using 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (FDOPA) PET post surgery and 4 weeks after radiation/chemotherapy has finished, which is the same time as the end of the valproate treatment. Changes on the PET scan which measures activity of the tumour will be measured. Effects of valproate on brain cancer biology will be measured by examining the brain tissue and by measuring cancer markers in the blood.</summary>
