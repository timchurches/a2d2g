    <interventions>This will be a single center, open-label, 4-period crossover study (meaning subjects will receive all treatments) to investigate:
1) The single dose pharmacokinetics of PRN1008 when administered as new tablet formulation compared to the current tablet formulation under fasted conditions (no food for at least 8 hours prior to dosing, water permissible until 1 hour pre-dose). 
2) The effect of a moderate fat meal on the single dose pharmacokinetics of PRN1008 when administered as a new tablet formulation.

Participants will be screened for participation within 28 days before dosing. Participants will be admitted to the study unit the day before dosing in Period 1 (Day -1).  

Following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, participants will receive a single oral 200 mg dose of the new tablet (Treatment 1)  formulation under fasting conditions and will remain in the clinic until the final PK and PD samples are collected on the morning of Day 2.  Participants will be contacted 7 days (+/- 2 days) following dosing in Period 1 to collect safety and adverse event information.

Following a washout of up to 28 days to facilitate Period 1 data review of the safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the new tablet formulation by the Sponsor in consultation with the Principal Investigator, the dose to be used in Periods 2-4 will be confirmed and participants will be re-admitted to the study unit the day before dosing in Period 2 (Day -1).  The dose of PRN1008 new tablet formulation selected for Periods 2-4 will not exceed 800 mg and will be chosen to approximate the expected exposure (AUC0-8) of a single 400 mg IR tablet dose. 

Treatments for Periods 2 to 4 are listed below.  Doses will be administered at least 48 hours apart.

* Treatment 2 (Test Formulation Fasted): 
A single oral dose [TBD] not to exceed 800 mg of PRN1008 administered following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours as new tablet formulation (100mg tablet) under fasted conditions
* Treatment 3 (Test Formulation Fed): 
A single oral dose [TBD] not to exceed 800 mg of PRN1008 administered as a new tablet formulation (100 mg tablet) under fed conditions following a moderate fat meal
* Treatment4 (Reference Formulation Fasted): 
A single oral 400 mg dose of PRN1008 administered as the current tablet formulation (300 mg tablet and/ or 100 mg tablet(s)) under fasted conditions following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours

All doses are administered and monitored by study staff to ensure compliance.

There are 6 possible sequences in which the listed treatments will be administered:
- 1, 2, 3, 4
- 1, 2, 4, 3
- 1, 4, 2, 3
- 1, 4, 3, 2
- 1, 3, 4, 2
- 1, 3, 2, 4

Following discharge from the study unit after Period 4, subjects will return for a Follow-Up visit and assessments on Day 7 +/- 2 days after the final study drug administration.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants cannot commence enrolment procedures until all entry criteria have been fulfilled. Where clinical significance of an abnormal screening test result (lab or any other test) is considered uncertain, the test may be repeated.
Participants will be recruited from the study site's internal database. Eligible subjects will be randomized to a treatment sequence, using a randomized block approach.

    <sequence>Participants will be numbered sequentially in the following format:

Brnn (where B is the study number, R is the replacement number should the participant be a replacement, nn being the sequential number into the study starting with 01).

Subjects will be randomised to a treatment via a simple randomisation table created by computer software (i.e computerised sequence generation) which will be provided to the site by the biostatistician.

    <statisticalmethods>Plasma concentrations and the computed PK parameters will be listed for PRN1008 by treatment period.  Individual and mean concentration versus time data will be plotted on linear and semi-logarithmic scales.  Summary statistics of PK parameters (primary and secondary) will be presented for each treatment period including means, geometric means, standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), medians and ranges, as appropriate.
Geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence limits of AUC and Cmax by formulation will be computed for PRN1008 to assess the relative bioavailability of the tablet formulations (test vs. reference), and to assess the impact of food on the new formulation tablet. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to the log-transformed primary PK parameters. Additional summaries or analyses may be applied to the data as appropriate.
BTK occupancy values will be listed for each subject by treatment.  Individual and mean occupancy versus time data will be plotted on linear scales. Summary statistics of occupancy results by time point will be presented for each treatment period including means, geometric means, standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), medians and ranges, as appropriate.

No sample size calculations were performed.  The sample size for this study was determined by practical considerations, and is typical for a study of this type. Based on past experience withPRN1008, 12 subjects are sufficient to characterize the PK of a single dose administration considering observed PK variability. To account for potential drop-outs, a total of 14 will be enrolled.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be a single-center, open-label, 4-period study to investigate the relative bioavailability of a single dose of PRN1008 when administered as a new tablet formulation compared to the current tablet formulation under fasted and fed conditions. Period 1 is intended to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the 100mg new formulation tablet at a 200mg dose, and to determine an appropriate dose for the new tablet formulation to be used in Periods 2 to 4, the relative bioavailability crossover portion of the study.
Participants will be screened for this study within 28 days before dosing.  Total length of participation in the study for participants is 76 days from screening through study completion.</summary>
