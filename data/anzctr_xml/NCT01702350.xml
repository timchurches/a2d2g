             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and

             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
             Subjects with coagulation, reticulocyte, or Hgb values outside the normal range should
             always be excluded from enrolment.

             stimulating hormone (FSH greater than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (&lt;147
             pmol/L) is confirmatory).

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from

             opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere
             with the study procedures or compromise subject safety. However, in elderly cohorts of
             Part C and Part D, use of concomitant medications may be considered on a case by case
             basis by the PI in consultation with the GSK Medical monitor.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.
