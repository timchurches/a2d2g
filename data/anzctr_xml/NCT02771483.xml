  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a medium to large vessel vasculitis with a predilection for the
      superficial cranial and intrathoracic arteries. Diagnosing the condition and predicting which
      patients will develop large vessel complications remains a challenge. There are limitations
      with temporal artery biopsy, magnetic resonance angiography and ultrasound of temporal
      arteries and American College of Rheumatology classification criteria.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown to be a useful modality in detecting
      inflammation in large intra-thoracic vessels but previously has not been able to accurately
      detect FDG uptake in the superficial cranial arteries due to poor spatial resolution. Newer
      scanners can perform finer cuts of the head and can detect uptake in these arteries.

      This study has three main components:

        1. Cross sectional study assessing the accuracy of PET uptake in the superficial cranial
           and intrathoracic arteries of suspected GCA patients for the diagnosis of GCA

        2. Cohort study assessing the prognostic implication of FDG aortic uptake on aortic
           diameter at 24 months

        3. Cohort study assessing the Th1 and Th17 cytokine profile in patients with and without
           FDG PET uptake at 0, 6 and 24 months</summary>
