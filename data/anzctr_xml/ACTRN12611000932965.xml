  <interventions>
    <interventions>All treatment in this trial forms part of routine clinical management. Patients in the "treatment" group receive ten 50 minute sessions with a Black Dog Institute Clinical Psychologist over a 12 week period. The first 8 sessions are weekly, and the last two sessions are fortnightly.There is no uniform psychological treatment used for all patients - rather, treatment type is tailored to the patients particular concerns (as it would be in the "real" world).</interventions>
    <comparator>An "external" group - comprised of those patients who (for whatever reason) are not able to attend the Black Dog Institute for twelve weeks of treatment - are also assessed over the twelve week period. Patients in this group will be compared with those in the treatment group but will fall into roughly twp categories: those who receive (external) psychological intervention, and those who do not.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current research aims to determine whether changing the treatment paradigm from a drug to a non-drug (i.e psychological) approach will result in improved outcomes for those with a unipolar non-melancholic depression. By altering the primary treatment approach, we hypothesise that more positive outcomes are likely to occur.</summary>
