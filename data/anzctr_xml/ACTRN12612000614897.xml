  <interventions>
    <interventions>MoodGroup is an online group intervention designed for to reduce depressive symptoms in Australian adults. It uses cognitive behavioural therapy. The intervention comprises 6-8 particpants and runs for 2 hours per week for 9 weeks. It is facilitated by provisional psychologists. The MoodGroup intervention is conducted in an online classroom hosted by Blackboard Collaborate. This secure classroom allows particpants to chat synchronously, view slide show presentations, participate in activities via a whiteboard feature and participate in small group activities. Participants will  receive preparatory reading material related to each week's session and will be required to be familiar with this material prior to each group. The online sessions will focus on activities and discussions designed to clarify and expand on the reading material. Participants will also be required to complete home activities to consolidate their learning.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of MoodGroup, an online group therapy intervention for the treatment of depression in Australian adults. The study will use a randomised controlled trial design (RCT). MoodGroup is a 9-week intervention that has been adapted from a face-to-face group therapy program for depression. Using cognitive behavioural therapy, participants will learn skills and techniques to reduce their depressive symptoms.</summary>
