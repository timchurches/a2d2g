If eligible, participants will be randomised to the order of interventions (21% oxygen and 50% oxygen). The unblinded investigator will make available the gas bottles and bags (containing either 21% or 50% oxygen) in the randomised order. The labels on the bottles will be covered to maintain the blinding of blinded investigator (who will record outcome data) and the participant. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study directly relates to the trial 
ACTRN12612000393853. As there is concern regarding the accuracy of the data collected by the specific transcutaneous probes used with that study (measuring carbon dioxide, oxygen levels and heart rate), the study is being repeated using a Sentec transcutaneous monitor. The Ethics approval number and UTN remain the same, however ANZCTR required a new trial registration number.  Two new outcome measures have been added (end tidal carbon dioxide, to further assess the mechanisms behind any change in carbon dioxide, and drift corrected carbon dioxide (a function of the Sentec monitor to improve accuracy)).


Oxygen therapy has been shown to increase carbon dioxide in the blood of patients with certain respiratory conditions. This study aims to find out if oxygen therapy increases carbon dioxide levels in patients with neuromuscular disease and, if so, how. </summary>
