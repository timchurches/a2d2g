  <interventions>
    <interventions>Stroke survivors will be assessed at least 3 months post stroke for clinical and imaging outcomes, then randomized into one of 3 treatment packages of 2X6-week intervention/no intervention phases. 
Arm 1: The first package involves 6 weeks of no training followed by 6 weeks of transfer enhanced training of body sensation. 
Arm 2: The second package involves 6 weeks of stimulus specific training of touch sensation followed by 6 weeks of transfer enhanced training of body sensation.  
Arm 3: The third package involves 6 weeks of transfer enhanced training of body sensation, followed by 6 weeks of no training.

Each training phase involves 15 training sessions at a rate of approximately 3 times per week and duration of 60 minutes per session. Training sessions are one on one with an experienced research therapist. Each participant has an individual training log, where the research therapist stores forms to record each session in order to monitor their progress.

Stimulus specific training involves graded and repeated learning-based discrimination training of specific sensory stimuli, ie. texture grids.
Transfer enhanced training involves learning-based discrimination training of a variety of sensory attributes, across a matrix of sensory tasks including common textures, limb positions and everyday objects. A variety of stimuli and learning conditions, tuition of training principles and feedback on the act of transfer to novel stimuli are used to facilitate transfer.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparisons will be made between stroke groups in the intervention and non-intervention phases. A control group of age and gender matched healthy volunteers will provide a comparison of typical sensory networks and processing before and after a 6 week interval.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients with a somatosensory impairment will be assessed at least 3 months post-stroke for clinical and imaging outcomes and randomized into one of 3 treatment packages of 2 x 6-week intervention/no intervention phases. 

They will be matched for lesion location (cortical vs subcortical), and severity of somatosensory impairment at baseline. The assessing therapist and data analyst will be blinded to group allocation and other identifying information.

Allocation to intervention is concealed with independent assignment managed centrally by a researcher who does not have any contact with stroke survivors and only remote contact with treating therapists to inform them of allocation via sealed opaque envelopes or electronic mail just prior to commencement of intervention.

Randomisation is computer generated with minimisation strategies to control for lesion location (cortical/subocrtical) and severity of somatosensory impairment at baseline (mild/moderate/severe).</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>POWER ANALYSIS OF SAMPLE SIZE (based on pilot data)

-Functional connectivity (FC): Our pilot studies revealed large differences in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (SI &amp; SII) FC (mean differences in T scores) over no intervention (n=9) and intervention (n=6) periods, with a Cohen's d of 1.5. Assuming a within-group SD for change scores of 1, the effect size index for this interaction contrast (Cohen's f), is 0.866. This effect would be readily detected with a total sample size of 48, with a power exceeding 0.99. Even with an effect size half of that estimated (f=0.433) a sample of 44 is required, for a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. Thus the study is well powered (n=72), for this comparison. The second hypothesis will involve exploratory analysis of functional connectivity maps involving 6 seeds. Inclusion of 24 in each of the treatment package groups will permit comparison between (Stimulus Specific Training) SST and (Transfer Enhanced Training) TET subgroups (n=48) as well as an interaction effect with lesion location.

- Structural connectivity: The anticipated effect size for the proportion of the overall variance predicted by the model,
i.e. R-squared, is based on a published model of fibre tract integrity in motor recovery that found an R-squared of 0.7, suggesting a power in excess of 0.95 with a total of 11 patients. We will employ two indexes of structural connectivity to predict change in the behavioural score. When n=48, alpha= 0.05, and power is 0.80, R-squared values of 0.177 (i.e. R=0.42) or more could be detected when fitting two-predictor variables. 

-Healthy controls (n=72) will permit characterization of functional and structural connectivity maps for interpretation and direct comparison with stroke groups.

DATA ANALYSES

Testing H1: Impact of lesion location on interhemispheric functional connectivity following sensory rehabilitation: 
Strength of interhemispheric FC between SI-SI and thalamic (Th) seed pairs will be compared pre-post intervention in subgroups with cortical or subcortical sensory lesions. The design, 2 lesion levels (cortical, subcortical) x 2 treatment conditions (training, no training) x 2 interhemispheric pathways (SI, thalamic) x 2 test occasions (pre, post), simplifies to four difference scores contrasting the pre-post change in SI-SI with the pre-post change in Th-Th for each of the four groups (2 lesion levels x 2 treatment conditions). Planned interaction comparisons will permit statistical investigation of two competing predictions: (i) that therapy facilitates the spared functional interhemispheric connections, i.e. results in increases in SI-SI, but not Th-Th after subcortical lesions, versus increases in Th-Th, but not SI-SI, after cortical lesions, or (ii) that therapy restores interhemispheric connections, when the reverse would be observed, i.e. increases in Th-Th after subcortical lesions and in SI-SI after cortical. We will also test independently for differences between no treatment and each treatment type (SST, TET) to verify the hypothesis for each. The extent of clinical improvement (change in tactile and sensory capacity score) will be analyzed for its correlation with interhemispheric FC of SI and thalamus.

Testing H2: Differential impact of rehabilitation approach on functional connectivity (FC) maps:
Change in FC maps over the initial intervention period (SST or TET) will be calculated as "difference maps", i.e. within-subject index of change. These maps, seeded in SI, SII and Th bilaterally, will permit exploratory investigation of connectivity from these regions of interest to distributed regions and networks. Differences in connectivity maps following SST and TET will be investigated using a 2 (SST/TET treatment group) x 2 (cortical/subcortical) ANOVA with longitudinal FC maps as the dependent variable. Between group differences will be tested using random effects analysis in SPM8 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Based on this analysis we will also determine whether the hypothesized change associated with treatment (SST vs TET) is qualified by the lesion location (eg. increase in FC to distributed regions following TET will be from spared Th seeds for cortical lesions while subcortical lesions will show increased FC from SI and SII seeds). FC maps will be thresholded at Z &gt; 3.1 and differences reported at a cluster corrected false discovery rate of P &lt; 0.05. Within-individual change in those receiving SST followed by TET will also be analysed.

Testing H3: Structural connectivity of interhemispheric SI-SI and ipsilesional SI-Th connections and ability to benefit from rehabilitation: 
Response to rehabilitation will be the change in tactile and sensory capacity scores pre-post intervention. Independent variables will be probability of fibre tracts between (i) SI-SI and (ii) ipsilesional Th-SI. Focus will be on connectivity of fibre tracts from seed regions not directly lesioned. Using the entire sample (n=72), multiple regression analysis will quantify the predictability of response to therapy based on the two indexes of spared connectivity.

Exploratory analyses: While our hypotheses are focused on strength of connectivity in inter-hemispheric SI and thalamo-cortical regions, we will also identify connectivity of other networks, such as visual and attention, in a whole brain, hypothesis generating exploratory analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One in two people experience loss in their ability to feel everyday objects through touch or know where their limbs are in space after a stroke. The loss impairs their ability to explore the environment, execute everyday tasks such as grasping and manipulating objects, and participate in previous activities.  Patients vary in their ability to benefit from rehabilitation. Yet we do not have effective means of identifying individuals who may benefit nor how to select the most optimal therapy.
This study will compare brain networks involved in recovery of touch sensation under two new training conditions, and in individuals with interruption to different parts of the network. Brain imaging will identify the functional and anatomical connections between regions involved in recovery. Knowledge of how brain networks adapt under these two training conditions is fundamental to guide individually tailored rehabilitation and to advance our understanding of core learning-based rehabilitation approaches. Our findings will guide therapists in choosing the best therapy for the right individual, based on knowledge of brain networks that have capacity to adapt.</summary>
