  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm A: Concurrent - Investigational treatment: Anastrozole commenced before and continued during radiotherapy.
Drug - Pre-radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole. Anastrozole: 1mg/day prescribed for 12 weeks, given orally. Commencing within 1 week of randomisation, to be administered from a minimum of 1 week before and a max of 4 weeks before commencement of radiotherapy and continued throughout radiotherapy. After 12 weeks administration of anastrozole according to trial regimen, anastrozole can be continued at the treating clinician's discretion and in accordance with the preference selected at the time of randomisation and stratification. The alternative options to long term anastrozole are tamoxifen or cessation of anti-oestrogen therapy.
Other: Radiotherapy. Radiotherapy must commence within 1 month of randomisation. Radiotherapy planning and treatment is as per the protocol.
- Ant. Chest wall/breast: 42.5 Gy in 16 Fractions, or 45Gy in 20 Fractions, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions.
- Nodal Volumes: 25 fractions not exceeding 2Gy/fraction.
- Supraclavicular Fossa: 45-50Gy in 25 fractions, 1.8-2Gy/fraction
- SClav/Axilla: 45Gy in 25 Fractions, 1.8Gy/fraction
- Internal Mammory Chain: 40Gy in 25 fractions; modified wide tangent technique: 50Gy in 25 Fractions; Seperate Int. Mammary Chain + tangent technique: 50Gy in 25 Fractions.
- Boost Treatment: 66Gy in 33 fractions (total) Breast/chestwall: 50Gy in 25 fractions; electron boost: 16Gy in 8 fractions

Duration of Radiotherapy will depend on extent of disease.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm B: Sequential - Standard treatment: Anastrozole and subsequent anti-oestrogen therapy delayed until after radiotherapy.
Other: Radiotherapy. Radiotherapy must commence within 1 month of randomistaion. Radiotherapy planning and treatment is as per the protocol.
-  Ant. Chest wall/breast: 42.5 Gy in 16 Fractions, or 45Gy in 20 Fractions, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions.
- Nodal Volumes: 25 fractions not exceeding 2Gy/fraction.
- Supraclavicular Fossa: 45-50Gy in 25 fractions, 1.8-2Gy/fraction
- SClav/Axilla: 45Gy in 25 Fractions, 1.8Gy/fraction
- Internal Mammory Chain: 40Gy in 25 fractions; modified wide tangent technique: 50Gy in 25 Fractions; Seperate Int. Mammary Chain + tangent technique: 50Gy in 25 Fractions.
- Boost Treatment: 66Gy in 33 fractions (total) Breast/chestwall: 50Gy in 25 fractions; electron boost: 16Gy in 8 fractions
Drug: Post radiotherapy commencement of anastrozole. Anastrozole 1mg/day prescribed for 12 weeks, given orally, after radiotherapy is completed. Anastrozole should commence within 1 week of the last fraction of radiotherapy and be continued for a total of 12 weeks. After 12 weeks administration according to the trial regimen, any subsequent hormone therapy is as for the concurrent arm.</comparator>

c) focal involvement (&lt;2mm front) if the margin is superficial (anterior part of the braest or subcutaneous) and the surgeon confirms that surgery extended to the subcutis. 
NB: In the case of focally involved deep or superficiail margins, the medical records or multidisciplinary meeting notes or correspondence from the surgeon must indicate that the surgeon confirms the surgery extended to the deep fascia or subcutis as appropriate. patients should routinely receive a lumpectomy bed boost in the conserved breast setting if there is focal superficial or focal deep involvement as defined above.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares the effectiveness of treatment with the drug anastrozole before and during adjuvant radiotherapy compared with anastrozole therapy delayed until after radiotherapy. Who is it for? You can join this study if you are a woman who has had a mastectomy or lumpectomy for breast cancer, and all planned surgery is now complete and radiotherapy is recommended. Trial details Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive anastrozole orally before and during radiotherapy. The other group will receive standard treatment, where anastrozole and subsequent anti-oestrogen therapy is delayed until after radiotherapy. Participants will be monitored for 10 years after radiotherapy. The study aims to determine if commencement of anastrozole before radiotherapy results in improved local control of the disease. </summary>
