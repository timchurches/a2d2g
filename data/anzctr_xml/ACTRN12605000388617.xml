    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The allocation to the randomly assigned treatment groups (as described below) was provided by a central telephone randomisation service.  The patient was randomised the day prior to surgery to enable set-up of the operating room.  The patient and family remained blinded to treatment assignment as did the psychologist performing the follow-up assessments.  Patients were reminded before each assessment that, even if they knew, the psychologist was to remian blinded to the surgical technique throughout the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The online program at http://www.randomization.com was used to randomly assign patient to two parallel treatment groups in permuted block randomisation with variable block sizes.  The block sequence was varied randomly.  Study staff was blind to the block size and sequence.</sequence>
