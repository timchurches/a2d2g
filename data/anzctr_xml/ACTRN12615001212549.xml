    <interventions>Intervention:  ALLEVYN Life dressing is a multi-layered design incorporating hydrocellular foam, hyper-absorber lock away core and masking layer. Indications for use: ALLEVYN 
Alleyvn Life dressings will be placed on participant sacrum, both heels, and the occiput (if the occiput has been shaved for the purpose of clinical care) at the next scheduled repositioning after recruitment and randomisation. 
To apply ALLEVYN Life follow the steps below:
1.	Cleanse the skin in accordance with local clinical protocol.
2.	Select an appropriate dressing size.
3.	Prepare and clean the skin. 
4.	Using a clean technique remove one of the protector films from ALLEVYN Life and anchor the adhesive side of the dressing to the skin. Smooth the dressing over the skin ensuring there are no creases. When positioning ALLEVYN Life Sacrum dressings, place the narrow end of the dressing a minimum of 2cm (3/4in.) above the anal sphincter, then smooth the dressing over the sacrum.
5.	Remove the remaining protector film and smooth the dressing over the remainder of the wound without stretching, ensuring no creases. 

Heel and occiput dressings can be left in place undisturbed for up to 7 days. Sacrum dressings can be  left in place for up to 5 days. All dressings will be changed more frequently if soiled.  
To remove ALLEVYN Life, lift the edge of the dressing and slowly peel back until completely removed from the skin. ALLEVYN Life Sacrum should be removed from the top edge down towards the anus to minimise the potential for faecal contamination.

The dressings are indicated for single use only.  Use of the dressings will continue for the participants stay in ICU and can be removed upon discharge from ICU, for example to a general ward. 

The dressings will be placed by Alfred Health staff working in the ICU. This includes ICU nurses and research officers employed for this trial as they will have honorary Alfred Health status. The dressing is applied in addition to standard care. Dressing changes will be monitored using a data collection log maintained by the research officers employed for the trial and informed by changes sighted by the research officers as well as the dressing changes recorded on the ICU progress notes.

    <comparator>No prophylactic dressing - usual pressure injury prevention strategies. 
At the study setting standard practice includes a number of strategies to address the development of pressure injuries as informed by the Pan Pacific Clinical Practice for the Prevention and Management of Pressure Injury. The Institution has a Pressure injury Prevention Policy, a Pressure Injury Prevention and Management Guideline, and a Nutrition Intervention to Promote Pressure Injury Healing Guideline. The ICU has additional written technical instruction called ICU Pressure Injury Prevention Strategies. Standard care will be implemented in accordance with these guidelines. Standard care in these guidelines require skin and pressure injury risk assessment within 8 hours of admission, a documented pressure injury prevention plan within 24 hours of admission. Additional instruction is provided to guide the conduct of the skin and pressure injury risk assessment. Mandatory pressure injury prevention strategies implemented for all patients include initial and ongoing daily skin and pressure risk assessment, assessment and management of all bony prominences at risk of pressure damage, use of slide sheets when moving the patient, nutritional risk assessment. Patients are repositioned four hourly unless more frequent repositioning is indicated, low air loss mattress is used if spinal clearance received, heel wedges  are used for off-loading, and skin care include the use of barrier creams and solutions and management of incontinence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pressure injury prevalence in intensive care units remains high, 13.1% to 28.7%, despite efforts to stem the prevalence through the implementation of best practice guidelines.  Pressure injuries are avoidable, but medical attention goes first and foremost to the task of stabilising the patients condition. Pressure injuries occur when patients are immobilised on admission to hospital as a precautionary measure until spinal injury is excluded, during lengthy hours of surgery and during recovery.
Recently, interest in a remarkably simple approach that can reduce the incidence of pressure injury has emerged.  The strategyprophylactic application of a dressing product to areas at risk of pressure injuryhas been seen to almost eliminate the incidence of pressure injury on the sacrum and heel and resulted in acute care expenses that were 3.6 times cheaper than usual care. It is suggested that the reason the dressings are effective is because they manage the microclimate of the skin and, specifically, they reduce the amount of moisture on the skin.
 
Though a systemic review of existing trials support the efficacy of this clinical approach, this theory of microclimate management has not, however, been tested in clinical trials to date. More research is needed to confirm prior study results and test if the intervention does alter the microclimate.
Participants in this study (n=336) will have been admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). All patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomised to either the prophylactic dressing and standard care study condition (intervention) or the standard care study condition (control).
Dressings will be applied to the sacrum, both heels, and the occiput if shaved. The dressing will remain in place for the participants duration in the ICU. The primary outcome measure will be the occurrence of a pressure injury in these anatomical locations during their stay in the ICU. Epidermal hydration, erythema and temperature of the pressure prone areas will be assessed for every study participant at scheduled repositioning of the participant during day shift hours.
Monitoring of PIs elsewhere on the body and during the entire acute episode will be undertaken. The cost of the ICU stay and the full acute episode will be monitored. The incidence of PI development and changes in microclimate state at each anatomical location and cost of care will be compared between the intervention and control groups.
