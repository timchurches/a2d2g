    <interventions>A pilot Randomised Control Trial (RCT) of group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)to assist  prisoners to manage mood and persistent symptoms following TBI.
A manualised programme will be delivered to cohorts of 12 sentenced male prisoners who have a criminal history of violence, burglary or sexual offences.  The manualised programme has been adapted from a programme developed for anger management.  The programme will be administered by a Registered Psychologist and Intern Psychologist within the health space inside the prison.  The programme is manualised and will be delivered in 10 x 1 hour sessions, across 5 weeks.  The study will involve 72 men in total.  The sessions are summarised as below: 
1	Introduction of facilitator and session structure
Housekeeping and group rules  confidentiality and respect 
Rationale for this intervention- discuss CBT and Mindfulness for TBI
Homework is to develop personal goals for the programme  
2	Psychoeducation on the importance of emotional regulation following TBI
Introduction of CBT 5 part model and the role of emotions in driving behaviour
3	Psychoeducation on relationship between thoughts, emotions and behaviour using 5 part CBT model
4	Introduction of the concept of mindfulness.
Mindfulness exercises in group using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy template 
5	Application of mindfulness to thoughts- psychoeducation on thought diffusion strategies 
6	Application of mindfulness to emotional regulation  
Exercise in acceptance of emotions
7	Standard session structure 
Integration of CBT and Mindfulness to understand relationship between thoughts and emotions and how this drives behavioural patterns
8	Introduction of the importance of life values and how they link to personal goals
9	Every day use of CBT techniques and Mindfulness practice to make alternative choices based on values/goals
10	Overview of programme 
Feedback and discussion.
The group members will be encouraged to complete all sessions but are able to withdraw consent to participate at any time.  Successful completion will be considered attendance at 80% of the sessions.  A register will be maintained noting attendance or absence.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated using G power 3.1.0 to identify the number of group participants required to provide for meaningful analysis.  The required sample size was calculated as 62 with a medium effect size of 0.3 (a=0.05, power = 80%, Number of groups = 2, number of measurements = 3).  The effect size was estimated from other studies which report an appropriate effect size for a positive psychological intervention as being between 0.23-0.34.  It is acknowledged that prison populations are relatively mobile, both from criminal rehabilitation (certain programmes happen in other parts of NZ) and release (both scheduled end dates and paroled releases, which is an unavoidable part of prison life).  The sample was consequently increased to 72 to allow for this potential source of attrition. 
A combination of repeated measures ANOVA and multi-level modelling will be used to determine the effectiveness of the intervention whilst controlling for demographic factors.   </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>International literature has indicated that the lifetime prevalence of TBI in prison populations is higher than in the general population. Given that TBI can lead to difficulties with impulse control, irritability and decision making, there is likely to be a link between TBI history and subsequent behaviour. This pilot RCT study aims to trial a targeted psychological intervention utilising cognitive behavioural therapy with consenting prisoners who are experiencing persistent symptoms from TBI, to determine if the intervention is effective in symptom management, preventing re-injury and subsequent offending behaviour.</summary>
