             with walking.

          -  Documentation of the presence of a nonsense point mutation in the dystrophin gene as
             determined by gene sequencing from a laboratory certified by the College of American

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dystrophinopathy is a disease continuum that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which
      develops in boys. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is
      important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function. Loss of dystrophin causes
      muscle fragility that leads to weakness and loss of walking ability. A specific type of
      mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of dystrophinopathy
      in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.
      The main goal of this Phase 3 study is to evaluate the effect of ataluren on walking ability.
      The effect of ataluren on physical function, quality of life, and activities of daily living
      will be evaluated. This study will also provide additional information on the long-term
      safety of ataluren.</summary>
