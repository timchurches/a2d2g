  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ingestion of krill oil capsules daily containing 1.7g of total EPA + DPA + DHA daily for 30 days followed by 30 days washout period.

Adherence to intervention protocols will be monitored at day 0, 5, 10, 15 and 30 through clinical visits -  capsule calendar will be collected at each visit.</interventions>
    <comparator>Ingestion of fish oil capsules daily containing 1.7g of total EPA + DPA + DHA for 30 days.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The health benefits of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with the incorporation of EPA and DHA into the cell membrane which then alters the membrane structure and cell functions. Consequently they reduce plasma triglyceride level, inhibit inflammatory response, suppress thrombosis process. Krill oil and fish oil are rich sources of EPA and DHA. The bio-availability of these fatty acids from the two oils maybe different due to chemical structure of the oils. This study will evaluate the incorporation of EPA and DHA into the red blood cell membrane. In addition the effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors will also be investigated.
