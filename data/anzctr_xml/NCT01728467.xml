  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study builds on data that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has a number of potentially
      beneficial effects including directly modulating glucose metabolism through multiple
      mechanisms. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of RVX000222 on
      postprandial plasma glucose in male individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or
      impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), during a frequently sampled oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT).</summary>
