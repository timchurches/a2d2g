  <interventions>
    <interventions>Smooth Sailing is an online mental health service designed and administered by the Black Dog Institute. It is based on the principles of stepped care such that the intensity of the recommended interventions is matched to individuals symptom severity and individuals step up if they have not responded to treatment after a set period of time. Exposure to Smooth Sailing involves (more detail outlined in Phase 2 Clinical Trial Protocol in Attachments section of ANZCTR record):
1.	Registration &amp; Mental Health Assessment. In class time, participants are given a slip of paper with the service URL and their unique identification code. They then use a school or personal internet device to visit this website and undertake registration.  Before registration commences, participants are asked to complete the Gillick Competency measure which consists of X questions to further confirm their understanding of the service and study requirements. Upon correct completion of this, participants are invited to create a personal profile (name, date of birth, email address, mobile phone number, and gender, history of mental health issues, and use of the internet for mental health information). Once a personal profile is created, four questionnaires were used to measure the presence of depression, anxiety, help-seeking attitudes and behaviours (see Appendix B in Attachments section of ANZCTR record). This takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.
2.	Step allocation. Based on the answers inputted during registration, Smooth Sailing allocates each participant to one of five steps. This is automatic and based on a clinical algorithm which accounts for the severity levels of the anxiety and depression symptoms as reported by the participant on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Each step matches a severity level and was based on clinical practice guidelines. The step allocations were: Nil/minimal (Step 0), Mild (Step 1), Moderate (Step 2), Moderately Severe (Step 3), and Severe (Step 4).
3.	Delivery of tailored program. After step allocation, Smooth Sailing delivers a program of content that is tailored to each step. Steps 0 and 1 receive online psychoeducation. Step 2 receive online psychoeducation + online self-directed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Steps 3 and 4 receive online psychoeducation + online self-directed CBT + additional support from the School Counsellor. Any participant who was allocated to Step 3 or 4 triggered an electronic notification alert which was automatically sent to the school counsellor for further investigation. This allowed the school counsellor to facilitate a face-to-face session within 48 hours to provide the counselling or refer on to external services. The online psychoeducation consists of five modules on i) general mental health, ii) depression, iii) anxiety, iiii) seeking help for yourself, iv) seeking help for a friend. Each of these modules contains information about definitions of mental health terms, signs and symptoms, causes of mental health problems, what to do if needing help, and strategies and tips for what a young person can do immediately. Each module is complemented by animations and illustrations to depict key messages as well as hyperlinks to other credible youth mental health services and websites including Headspace, Reachout, Kids Helpline. This content was created specifically for this service, and was reviewed by clinicians. It is designed to be self-directed, such that the youth can read and return to it whenever they wish. The online CBT module consists of a single webpage that outlines two evidence-based self-directed online cognitive behavioural therapy programs: i) MoodGym (Australian National University) and ii) Brave Online (University of Queensland). MoodGym is an interactive self-help book which helps to learn and practise skills for managing symptoms of depression and anxiety. It consists of five modules alongside questionnaires, summaries and a personal workbook. BRAVE was developed for children and teenagers who experience Separation Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Specific Phobia and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. This program helps young people to learn new ways to manage their anxiety and fears. It consists of 10 sessions and is effective for reducing social worries, anxiety about separating from loved ones, fears of specific objects or situation, worries about friendships, school performance or other everyday worries.
4.	Monitoring and Feedback. At two points in the study (Day 15 and Day 22) participants received an automated 18-item monitoring questionnaire to assess how they were doing. This consisted of the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scales (answered using yes or no, see Appendix B in Attachments section of ANZCTR record) and was delivered via email or SMS. An automated thank you message was received alongside a reminder to use the program if participants completed this questionnaire. 
5.	Reassessment (Post-test/endpoint): At Day 43, researchers revisited the schools. Participants again logged onto the service using the same URL and unique ID codes and were delivered the final endpoint questionnaires. In theory, the results of these questionnaires would be used to determine whether a participant had responded to care or needed to be stepped up.  In accordance with the Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Depression in Young Adults, if a participant has not responded to their care within 43 days of their baseline allocation, they would be stepped up to the next level of care.  Table 3 (in Phase 2 Clinical Trial Protocol in attachments section of the ANZCTR record) outlines the stepping matrix for depression and anxiety scores reported at 43 days. The matrix was designed such that a participant would not be stepped down, instead will either remain at the same step or step up. However, as the current trial ceased at 43 days, no stepping occurred during this trial. Instead, this trial was designed to provide the clinical data necessary to determine whether the steps are feasible for future trials. 

Throughout the trial, participants will be obligated to use Smooth Sailing at pre-test (for registration and baseline measure collection) and again at post-test (for reassessment and final endpoint collection) only. Completion of the monitoring questionnaires and use of the other components is entirely voluntary, and will be a measured as part of the study.

    <statisticalmethods>Although this study was an uncontrolled acceptability trial, we are also examining differences pre and post-test. A recent systematic review of help-seeking interventions (Gulliver et al., 2012) reports an effect size of d = 0.120.53 for psycho-education interventions. As such, our sample size calculations are based on using an alpha of 0.05 and effect size of 0.50. As guided by Cohen (1992), 64 participants were needed to demonstrate this effect. Given that 40% were estimated to be likely to drop out, we needed to recruit approximately 106 participants for participation. 

Data was collected using the Black Dog Institute e-health platform. Participant data was then exported to SPSS statistical software for analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Il, USA).  The primary outcome measure (help-seeking) was analysed using mixed modelling which is similar to a repeated-measures analysis. This type of analysis was used to determine any significant differences in the scores reported at time 1 (pre) and then at time 2 (post). The primary hypothesis (that students would report higher levels of help-seeking behavior and attitudes) was evaluated by examining differences between pre and post scores on help-seeking questionnaires. 

Secondary hypotheses were evaluated by pre and post comparisons of the depression and anxiety questionnaires, and descriptive analyses of the acceptability and feasibility questionnaires. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Anxiety, depression, and suicidality are prevalent among high school youth aged 12  17 years and help-seeking is low. Current mental health services for this age group are overburdened and lack capacity for mild-moderate symptoms. Alternative service models are needed to improve rates of help-seeking, reduce pressure on current systems, to prevent escalation of mental illness, and reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. Online stepped-care presents a viable alternative. It is based on the premise that simple, cost-effective internet interventions are offered to youth with mild-moderate symptoms, while more costly, intensive face-to-face interventions are reserved for those with more severe and persistent symptoms. Internet interventions can be readily integrated into stepped-care as they are fully automated, acceptable to youth, preserve fidelity of care, and allow for ongoing monitoring and automated feedback.
School is an ideal setting for the implementation of online stepped-care as students spend much of their daily lives in school. However, schools currently have a scattergun approach to mental health, with some offering a school counsellor, some offering psycho-education programs, and others not having anything at all. The Black Dog Institute was awarded funds to design, build, and evaluate an online mental health clinic (referred to hereon in as the e-clinic) targeting help-seeking for depression and anxiety symptoms in high school students. Co-designed with students/schools/parents, the e-clinic delivers mental healthcare using a sophisticated internet program that triages students mental health, delivers treatment, monitors progress and links in with the school counsellor and wellbeing team. To reduce the stigma associated with mental illness, this e-clinic service has been named Smooth Sailing.
Procedure: High school students were recruited to participate in the 6-week long trial. During this time, they registered to the Smooth Sailing service, answered a series of baseline questionnaires, and were allocated to a "Step", corresponding to their level of depression/ anxiety severity. Students were able to log on and use Smooth Sailing over the course of the next 6 weeks, at which time they re-completed the questionnaires at the follow-up assessment. Students that were allocated to the moderately-severe or severe categories at Baseline were followed-up by the School Counsellor within 48 hours. All students were also sent monitoring questionnaires via SMS or email at 14-day intervals, to check-in with how they were feeling and provide a reminder of the Smooth Sailing service.
The main objectives of this trial were to:
* Evaluate the effectiveness of Smooth Sailing intervention for increasing help-seeking for depression and anxiety among high school students;
* Measure the acceptability, feasibility, and demand of this type of service model in high school settings.</summary>
