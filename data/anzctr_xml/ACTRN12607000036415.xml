  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm A: Behavioural interventions to manage frequent night waking and/or difficulty settling to sleep including controlled crying, camping out, and advice on how to manage overnight feeding and dummies (pacifiers). Strategies were delivered by Maternal and Child health (MCH) Nurses over 1 to 3 visits. The initial visit was 30-60 minutes and took place during the routine individual MCH 8-month visit. Subsequent follow-up visits were 10-15 minutes in fortnightly intervals. </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Families recruited were attending community well-child clinics across 6 Melbourne local government areas when infants were 4 months postpartum in October/November 2003. Families were recruited from a broad sociodemographic sample. Infants whose parents reported a problem with their sleep at 7-8 months were then eligible to take part in the intervention trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>This was a cluster randomised controlled trial. Families were appraoched by their Maternal and Child Health nurse to take part in the study. Interested families were then cotacted by the research team to obtain informed consent. After all recruitment was complete, Maternal and Child Health centres (and their families) were randomly allocated to the intervention or control arm using a computer generated random number sequences for each Local Geovernment Area. An independent statisticain performed the randomisation and as all families and the researchers were unaware of intervention status at the time of recruitment and consent, allocation concealment was acheived.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to determine whether a brief, primary-care behavioural intervention, designed to manage infant sleep problems, can improve both infant sleep and symptoms of maternal depression. Up to 45% of parents report a problem with their infants sleep in the second six months of life whilst up to 15% of Australian mothers are affected by postnatal depression. There is a strong link between infant sleep problems and postnatal depression. This intervention has the potential to reduce the twin burdens of both sleep problems and postnatal depression and therefore significantly improve the wellbeing of mothers, their children and their families.</summary>
