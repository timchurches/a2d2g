  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Adverse Event (AE) During the Duration of the Study C87088 (up to 272 Weeks) - An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From study start to the end of the Safety Follow-up Period (up to 272 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the Duration of the Study C87088 (up to 272 Weeks) - An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose which results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization, results in persistent/significant disability/incapacity, is an infection that requires parenteral antibiotics, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From study start to the end of the Safety Follow-up Period (up to 272 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Remission (HBI = 4) at Study Completion Visit (Week 262) - HBI remission is defined as total HBI score of 4 points or less. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (8 items, score 1 per item) lower scores indicating better well being. The first three parameters are scored for the previous day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 262</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Inflamatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Remission (IBDQ = 170) at Study Completion Visit (Week 262) - IBDQ remission is defined as having a total IBDQ score of 170 points or greater. IBDQ score consists of 32 questions eaching having a score of 1 to 7. Overall scores range from 32 to 224.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 262</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma Concentration of Certolizumab Pegol After 1 Year (Week 52) - Plasma samples for determination of Certolizumab Pegol were taken prior to Certolizumab Pegol administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With Positive Anti-CZP Anti-body Status at Any Time From Week 0 of the Feeder Study C87085 to the Study Completion Visit in C87088 - Subjects are counted as antibody positive to Certolizumab Pegol if they have at least one positive result from Week 0 in the previous study C87085 [NCT00552058] to the Last Visit in this study. A positive result is defined as Anti-CZP antibody levels &gt; 2.4 units/mL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Week 0 of study C87085 [NCT00552058] to Study Completion Visit (Week 262) of C87088 (up to 268 weeks)</timepoint>
