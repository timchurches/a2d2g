  <interventions>
    <interventions>Growth (height, length, segmental length), body composition (percent body fat) nutrition (3 day weighed food record), physical activity (physical activity monitor), health outcomes (questionnaire), participation (questionnaire) and health resource use (questionnaire) will be measured at 18months of age, 3 years of age and 5 years of age.</interventions>

).  Height or length will be measured to the last completed millimetre with a portable stadiometer/ length measuring board (Shorr Productions, LLC, Maryland, USA).  Knee height and upper-arm length will be measured with an anthropometer (Holtain Ltd, Dyfed, UK).  Height estimates will be predicted from knee height and upper arm length using published validated equations.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Habitual time spent sedentary: 
The time that children spend sedentary in their own free-living environment will be measured using the ActiGraph GT3M accelerometer (Shalimar, FL) over a 3 day period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 18 months, 3 years and 5 years of age.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary intake: 
Usual dietary intake will be determined using a three day weighed food record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 18 months, 3 years and 5 years of age.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feeding ability:
Oral motor and swallowing function will be assessed using a number of measures obtained from a parent completed feeding questionnaire, direct observation during a clinical feeding evaluation of a regular meal and from ratings derived from the video taped clinical feeding evaluation.  Feeding dysfunction will be rated according to the Scedule for Oral Motor Assessment and the Dysphagia Disorders Survey</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 18 months, 3 years and 5 years of age.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation:
Participation will be determined using parent-report on the domains of self-care, mobility and social functioning using the scaled scores (rasch analysed) of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 18 months, 3 years and 5 years of age.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resource use and the direct costs of treatment: 
In order to determine the relationship between motor prognosis and resource use, medical and allied health resource use and the direct costs of treatment will be monitored and compared to outcomes with adjustment for confounders such as disease severity using cost and consequences analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 18 months, 3 years and 5 years of age.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life:
Parent perception of QOL will be assessed using the condition specific tool, CP QOL-child, from 4 years of age.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All Queensland born children diagnosed with CP, born between 1st September 2006 and 31st December, 2009. We define CP as a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. The characteristic signs are spasticity, movement disorders, muscle weakness, ataxia and rigidity.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This population based longitudinal study of children with CP from the age of 18 months to 5 years will permit the first comprehensive evaluation of the impact of functional attainment and lifestyle factors (dietary intake and habitual physical activity) on growth, body composition and nutritional status. This study will enable more accurate prediction of the early natural history of nutritional and growth problems in young children with CP linked to activity levels and health outcomes.</summary>
