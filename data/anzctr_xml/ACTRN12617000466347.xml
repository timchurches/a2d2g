  <interventions>
    <interventions>Brain MRI before cardiac surgery and approximately 5-10 days after cardiac surgery depending on availability of MRI scanner and paediatric cardiac anaesthetist.

Arterial blood pressure will be monitored invasively with an invasive arterial line.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The total number and volume of new white matter lesions on post-operative MRI scanning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between 5-10 days post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The time spent below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation. 

This will be analysed by calculating the amount of time that is spent below the calculated lower limit of cerebral autoregulation for that child and comparing this to MRI brain findings. We will be doing this by correlating invasive arterial blood pressure to MRI findings.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During cardiac surgery and for 12 hours post-operatively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of new intracranial haemorrhage on brain MRI</outcome>
      <timepoint>A repeat MRI will be undertaken once between 5-10 days post operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of new stroke on post-operative brain MRI</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between 5-10 days post-operative.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sadly, children who undergo cardiac surgery as infants are at increased risk of learning difficulties as they grow older. Why this occurs is not known and white matter injury detected on specialised brain scans is considered to be the crucial link. This study will look at the relationship between blood pressure during, and after, cardiac surgery as the potential link. The study will also assess the critical blood pressure threshold to avoid injury as currently there is no published data to inform clinical practice.

The impact of this research: Preventing brain injury may not only improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in the growing population of heart kids in New Zealand but also decrease the significant educational, economic and societal burden created by this potentially avoidable consequence of critical cardiac surgery.
