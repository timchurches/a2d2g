  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lacrimal gland botulinum toxin injection:

2.5U Botox (registered trademark) will be injected transconjunctivally into the lacrimal gland of the most symptomatic eye by an ophthalmologist. If the eye is still symptomatic at 1 week, a repeat injection will be given within 2 weeks of the initial injection.

The washout period between treatments will be 6 months from the initial injection.

Adherence is not an issue in this study because the drug is administered personally by the principal investigator.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo (normal saline)

Normal saline placebo will be injected transconjunctivally into the lacrimal gland of the most symptomatic eye. If the eye is still symptomatic at 1 week, a repeat injection of normal saline will be given within 2 weeks of the initial injection.</comparator>

      <outcome>Mean change in Munk Score over time

Munk Score is a subjective measure of epiphora symptoms, where participants report the number of times per day they are dabbing tears from their eyes.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications (if any). The most common complications from lacrimal gland botulinum toxin injections are ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and vertical diplopia (double vision in the vertical plane).

Other potential complications include:
- Allergic reaction (will be noticed at time of injection and treated as per standard clinical protocol)
- Flu-like symptoms
- Paralysis of more distant muscles (unlikely given low dose)
- Dry mouth
- Facial weakness
- Dizziness
- Paraesthesia
- Eyelid bruising/swelling

We will assess for these complications by asking if patients about them during follow-up phone consultations.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be formally diagnosed with NLDO or FNLDO by the principal investigator. At recruitment, informed consent will be obtained from participants and baseline details will be collected using a pre-designed questionnaire.

Participants will be randomised into one of two groups. Group A (treatment first) will have botulinum toxin treatment at the first treatment visit and placebo treatment at the second; Group B (placebo first) will have placebo treatment at the first visit and botulinum toxin treatment at the second.

We will use block randomisation with equal allocation between treatment arms. Randomisation will be performed as detailed below.An independent third party (ophthalmic technician or clinic nurse) will use the GraphPad calculator to generate a list of 50 participants, numbered 1 to 50. As participants are recruited, they will be assigned an identification number, which will correlate with the number on the randomised list. The investigators will not have access to the randomised list. If more than 50 participants are recruited, the GraphPad calculator will be used to randomly assign these participants as required.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed using the GraphPad random number calculator, available freely online (http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1/). This calculator randomly assigns participants to groups. It first assigns participants non-randomly, and then swaps the assignment of each participant with the assignment of a randomly chosen participant. This process is repeated twice to ensure it is completely random.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Noncompliant participants as well as those who withdraw voluntarily or non-voluntarily will be included in the final analysis.

Statistical analyses will be performed using Microsoft Excel (registered trademark) and Stata (registered trademark) version 13 using standard statistical method for hypothesis testing and calculation of confidence intervals. Logistic regression methods will be used to control for the effect of confounders, if any.

Sample size was calculated using the One Sample Using Percentage values calculator at the following website (accessed 12/1/2016):
https://www.dssresearch.com/KnowledgeCenter/toolkitcalculators/samplesizecalculators.aspx

If we assume a 75% response in the treatment group (based on prior similar studies), a 50% response in the control group, a confidence interval of 5%, and a beta error level of 5%, the recommended sample size is 38. If we assume a 20% dropout rate, we need to recruit approximately 50 patients in total for the study

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Epiphora, or excessive watering of the eye, is a distressing symptom of nasolacrimal duct obstruction. It can lead to significant reduction in quality of life and cause social embarrassment. Current treatment options, such as dacryocystorhinostomy, are surgically invasive and carry a small risk or morbidity.

Botulinum toxin injection into the lacrimal gland is a promising treatment for epiphora in patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction who refuse, or are not fit for surgery. It can be offered in an outpatient setting and published case series suggest that this treatment is safe and effective. However, there is currently a lack of randomised, controlled trials to support its routine use in patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

The proposed study will be the first of its kind to systematically evaluate botulinum toxin as a treatment for epiphora in patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction. We propose a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Patients will be randomised to receive an injection of either botulinum toxin or placebo (normal saline) initially, and 6 months later they will cross over treatments. We will perform phone follow-up interviews to assess change in subjective measures of epiphora symptoms and complication rates.

Our hypothesis is that lacrimal gland botulinum toxin injection will significantly reduce subjective symptoms of chronic epiphora in patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction as compared to placebo.
