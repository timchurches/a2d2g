  <interventions>
    <interventions>Partnered pharmacist charting: on admission to selected General Medical or Emergency Short Stay Units at a major tertiary institution (Alfred Hospital), patients' regular medications will be charted by a credentialled clinical pharmacist, and endorsed by a medical officer. 
At time of discharge from hospital, patients from selected General Medicical units will have the medication management section of their discharge summary completed by a credentialed clinical pharmacist, and endorsed by a medical officer.

Procedure:
Medication reconciliation on admission and discharge medication counselling both include face-to-face sessions with the patient as routine care. Admission medication charting and discharge summary completion do not replace this, nor do they add extra patient contact. 
Admission: 
The pharmacist takes a medication history (routine care), performs VTE risk assessment, has a discussion with the admitting medical officer about current problems and the medication management plan is agreed upon. Pre-admission medications and VTE prophylaxis are charted by the pharmacist; followed by a discussion between the treating nurse and pharmacist about the plan, including urgent medications to be administered, drug-related monitoring and reasons for any changes. 
Discharge: 
Following discharge medication and prescription review (routine care) and discussion with the medical team, the pharmacist electronically enters the following into the medication management section of the discharge summary:
-current list of all medications the patient should be taking on discharge, listed according to whether they are new (including indication), changed (including reason), or unchanged. 
-a list of all medications ceased during admission, including reasons
-medication allergies
-smoking status, and management during admission
-actions required by the GP, including medications requiring review
Once complete, the discharge summary is reviewed and endorsed by the discharging medical officer 

Admission medication charting takes approximately 15-20 minutes depending on the number and complexity of medications
Discharge summary completion takes approximately 5-15 minutes depending on the number and complexity of medications.

The duration of the observation period is four months. 

Based on the allocation of units to interventions, patients will receive either the admission or discharge intervention, but not both, per admission. Patients readmitted to hospital during the study period may be allocated to receive the same or different intervention during their next admission, as each admission is considered a new event.

For patients in ESSU, only the admission charting intervention is applicable.

Regular auditing of medication charts and discharge summaries was undertaken. Charts or summaries completed by a medical officer in the pharmacist-arm units were excluded (including charts completed outside of pharmacist working hours). </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients admitted to the remaining General Medical or Emergency Short Stay Units will have their regular medications charted by a medical officer on admission, with pharmacist review occurring within 24 hours, as is usual care.

    <concealment>This was a cluster randomised trial.

The GMU is divided into four geographically-based subunits, each with equivalent rostering of clinicians, participating in an equivalent rostering of admitting days. Admitted patients are allocated to teams according to geographical bed availability. This allocation is carried out by inpatient bed managers who were unaware that the study was taking place. There were no differences among number or seniority of staff among the four subunits.  The four GMU subunits were randomised to receiving a discharge summary with a medication management plan completed by a pharmacist in one cluster of two subunits, with standard medical discharge summaries continuing in the other cluster of the remaining two subunits.

Units were randomly selected using a random number generator to correspond to the four units by the primary investigator.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Normally distributed continuous data are presented using means (standard deviation) while ordinal and skewed data are presented using medians (inter-quartile range). Statistical significance was defined by a p-value of &lt;0.05. Statistical significance of difference in proportions was determined using a cluster-weighted chi-squared test or where value in a cell was less than 5, Fishers Exact test was used. Differences in the primary outcome were presented using risk of an error and the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one error. Statistical significance of difference in means was evaluated using the Students t-test and difference in medians was evaluated using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test.
For sample size calculation, the proportion of standard medical charted patients with an error was assumed to be 0.30. We aimed to detect a minimum clinically significant absolute difference of 0.10. Using a power of 90% and a two-sided significance (alpha) level of 0.05, the total sample size required was 824, with 412 in each arm and 206 patients within each cluster. The inter-cluster correlation coefficient was expected to be very small, approaching zero and an adjustment for the design effect was not performed. All analyses were conducted using Stata v 12.0 (College Station, Texas).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacists completing the medication management plan in the medical discharge summary for preventing medication errors. 
Design - We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing pharmacist completed medication management plans in the discharge summary to standard medical discharge summaries among patients discharged following an inpatient stay under a general medical unit. 
Setting - This trial was conducted at an adult major referral hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia with an annual Emergency Department (ED) attendance of approximately 60,000 patients
Participants The evaluation included patients discharge summaries written in the period of 16th March 2015 to 27th July 2015. 
Interventions - Patients randomised to the intervention had their medication management plan completed by a pharmacist. 
Main outcome measures - The primary outcome variable was an erroneous discharge summary related to a medication error as identified by an independent assessor, who was not part of the patients admission process.
