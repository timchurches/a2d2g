  <interventions>
    <interventions>The agent being investigated in this study (Clinpro Tooth Creme) utilises a funtionalised tri-calcium phosphate ingredient not currently available in any current dentine desensitizing agents.  It is hypothesised that this ingredient enhances the absorption of fluoride, calcium and phosphate into the tooth allowing greater remineralization to occur. In the context of hypersensitvity this increased remineralization will aid in blocking the hydrodynamic pain mechanism

Invetervention Group 1:

Apply a pea-sized amount of Clinpro Tooth Creme to a soft-bristled toothbrush and brush teeth for 2 minutes twice daily.
After brushing, adults should expectorate.

Intervention Group 2:

Twice daily brushing with a pea-size amount of Tooth Creme AND a directed topical application of Tooth Creme onto sensitive teeth before sleeping without rinsing.

The product shall be used for 6 weeks. A 6 week period has been shown as providing sufficient time to allow maximum benefit of a desensitizing product (Ricarte, 2008)</interventions>
    <comparator>Negative control - a standard toothpaste, with no active desensitisating ingredients  (1000ppm fluoride)- Colgate cavity Protection

To be used twice daily for 6 weeks.

Positive control/Comparator - Currently available dentine desensitizing agent, prespecified by the Investigator - Sensodyne Total Care Paste is to be used.

To be used as a toothpaste to brush teeth twice daily, for a duration of 6 weeks. A 6 week period has been shown as providing sufficient time to allow maximum benefit of a desensitizing product (Ricarte, 2008)</comparator>

    <summary>Introduction

The currently accepted definition of dentine hypersensitivity states that  Dentine hypersensitivity is characterized by short, sharp pain arising from exposed dentin in response to stimuli, typically thermal, evaporative, tactile, osmotic, or chemical, and which cannot be ascribed to any other form of dental defect or disease. 

The hydrodynamic theory is the most widely demonstrated and accepted pathophysiological theory of dentine hypersensitivity. The theorem proposes that dentine hypersensitivity is a result of movement of fluid within the dentine tubules. Most pain-producing stimuli cause movement of dentinal tubule fluid, the most common being cold and evaporative stimuli. This results in a pressure change across the dentin which activates intra-dental nociceptive nerve fibers, via a mechanoreceptor response, to cause pain. 

Currently available dentine desensitisers can be divided into two categories by their modus operandi: one is to interrupt the neural response to pain stimuli; the other is to occlude open tubules to block the hydrodynamic mechanism.

Clinpro Tooth Creme is a white paste that contains 950 ppm fluoride ion (similar to regular toothpaste) and a functionalised tri-calcium phosphate ingredient 

Aims

1) Investigate the efficacy of Functionalised tri-Calcium Phosphate in relieving dentine hypersensitivity
2) Assess the efficacy of Functionalised tri-Calcium Phosphate in relieving dentine hypersensitivity in comparison to an alternative desensitising agent
3) Compare the efficacy of Functionalised tri-Calcium Phosphate in relieving dentine hypersensitivity when applied topically and with brushing vs application during brushing only</summary>
