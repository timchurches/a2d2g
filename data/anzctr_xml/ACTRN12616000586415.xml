  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to one of three interventions: partner-assisted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia (PA-CBTI), individual Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia (I-CBTI) or partner-assisted sleep hygiene therapy (PA-SHT). Regardless of which intervention they are assigned, participants will attend 7 weekly 1-hour treatment sessions, wear an actigraph and complete daily sleep diaries.
CBTi is a multicomponent intervention. Clinicians work with clients to help them make changes to their sleep-wake patterns, to improve sleep. This includes setting regular sleep and wake times, getting out of bed when one is unable to sleep, sleep restriction and stimulus control. CBTi also addresses common misconceptions about sleep and unhelpful thought patterns, which may be perpetuating sleep problems. Finally, CBTi includes education about improving the sleep environment and relaxation techniques.
SHT focuses on education about sleep-wake cycles and helps participants to change and improve basic lifestyle habits that impact on sleep (e.g., avoiding caffeine late in the day).
In the partner-assisted conditions, the partner participates in every therapy session, and learns all the same information as the patient. The partner plays a supportive role, helping the patient to make behavioural changes in between treatment sessions. This includes reinforcing positive changes and helping to create an environment that encourages positive change. All treatment sessions, regardless of condition, take the format of individual one-on-one sessions (i.e., one sleep clinician per couple or client). Sleep clinicians are registered  psychologists, with expertise in sleep. Irrespective of condition, participants are asked to complete a daily sleep diary throughout the treatment program and to practice 1-3 strategies learnt in session in between therapy sessions. Ideally, these strategies are used daily. Participants will complete a daily sleep diary and a weekly adherence questionnaire with the help of the sleep clinician to monitor adherence.
Participants will wear the actigraph 24-hours per day (except when engaged in activities that may damage the device) throughout the 7 week intervention period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare three different treatments for decreasing the symptoms of insomnia. There are certain factors that may impact the effectiveness of treatments for insomnia. Therefore comparing these three treatments will help us develop a more effective way to treat insomnia. This study is the first well controlled comparison of these treatments. This study also investigates whether having a bed partner affects a person's sleep in any way.</summary>
