  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention that we will use it for this study is 3M 'Trademark' Standard Tie-On Surgical Mask, Cat No: 1816. 

Masks will be provided to intervention group mask tents to use it during the Hajj week in 2013 and 2014 (ie 13-18 October 2013 and 2-9 October 2014). Study staff will practically demonstrate the correct method of how to wear masks and help pilgrims to put on their mask for the first time. Each participant will be provided with 5 masks per day and a brochure with instructions about mask wearing and usage. The medical researchers will follow them each day to reminding them about recording their mask usage in a health diary.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any pilgrim develop subjective fever and one symptom of influenza-like illness e.g. cough.

A medical research team member will be available each morning and evening to distribute additional facemasks should pilgrims request extra, and to document any reported influenza-like illness symptoms development. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Laboratory proven respiratory viral infection.

During the Hajj week study team members will collect nasopharyngeal (NP) swab (or throat swab if an NP swab is not doable) for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of respiratory virus infection. The swab used will be 'Copan nylon flocked dry nasal swab'. The study staff who will take the swab will all have been trained to achieve an appropriate sample.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming that the prevalence of symptomatic RTIs is 30% in the controls and the prevalence of laboratory-proven respiratory viral infection in controls is approximately 12% the intervention could be considered clinically worthwhile if it can reduce the prevalence of syndromic or proven viral RTI by 50%.
Assuming a moderate intra-cluster correlation of 10% and a mean of 75 participants per cluster (tent), and inflating the sample by a factor of 8.4 to account for clustering, the sample size required for a cRCT to detect a reduction from 12% to 6% with 80% power at 5% significance is 2976 per arm. An additional inflation factor of 1.18 will allow for up to 15% loss to follow-up or incomplete outcome data. This results in a sample size of approximately 3500 participants per treatment making a total of 7000. 
For the first primary outcome (clinical/syndromic RTIs) a smaller sample would be sufficient to answer a more generic question, namely prevention of symptomatic RTI. The sample size required for detecting a reduction from 30% prevalence of RTIs to 15% with 80% power at 5% significance and considering for clustering and loss to follow-up is about 1170 participants per treatment making a total of 2340. 
To achieve the full sample size we aim to conduct the study over two years (2013 and 2014).  About 2500 pilgrims (or at least 2340) will be recruited in 2013 which will give an answer for the RTI outcome and could build on that sample for the second outcome (proven infection) which ultimately will be completed by recruiting another 4500 pilgrims in 2014. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a large scale cluster randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness of facemasks in preventing acute respiratory viral infection including influenza and coronaviruses.
The trial will compare the use of (simple surgical) facemasks versus no use of facemasks among pilgrims during the Hajj week (13 to 20 October, 2013, and 2 to 9 October 2014). Randomisation to each arm will be in a 1:1 ratio and will be done according to tents.

For the intervention tents free masks will be provided to each person to be worn continuously for at least 5 days of
stay at Mina. They will be given two diaries to record their flu-like symptoms and history of mask use.

Data available from questionnaires, diaries and laboratory tests will be analysed to examine whether mask use
makes a significant difference in reducing the frequency of laboratory confirmed respiratory virus infection.</summary>
