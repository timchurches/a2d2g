    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis were assessed with the use of SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The normality of distribution was estimated by the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Parametric data were expressed as the mean[standard deviation (SD)] and were compared in a t test .Nonparametric data were presented as median[interquartile range (IQR)] and assessed by using the MannWhitney test. Categorical variables were expressed as the number of patients (%) and mean values were compared in x2 test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. All reported P-values are two-tailed, and at a 5% level of significance.
The sample size evaluation was based the global QoR-40 scores on our pilot study. In a previous study, we accepted a 10-point difference performs a clinically relevant difference in quality of recovery. Based on the result of previous study, sample size per group were assessed that 28 subjects would be sufficient with a = 0.05 and a power of 80%. Taking into account an expected lost or follow-up data rate of 10%, the final sample size was 62 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arthroscopic knee surgery patients may experience discomfort, distress and pain following surgery with approximately 70% incidence of postoperative moderate-to-severe pain reported. These factors could affect the recovery of patients and extend discharge. Many studies have indicated that femoral nerve block(FNB) could relieve pain after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. However, FNB has been associated with quadriceps weakness, the risk of falling and delayed mobilization. In recent years, the adductor canal block(ACB) was shown to relieve pain and reduce morphine consumption after arthroscopic knee surgery with minor effects on muscle strength. A meta-analysis indicated that ACB provides better ambulation ability and pain control when compared with FNB and improve functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty. Although these advantages should be evaluated, the effects of ACB on the quality of recovery from patients perspective were not documented. The aim of the current trial was to assess the effect of pre-operative ultrasound-guided ACB on the quality of recovery after arthroscopic knee surgery.</summary>
