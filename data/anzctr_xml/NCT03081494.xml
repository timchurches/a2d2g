  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase Ib study of PDR001 in combination with regorafenib in adult patients with
      previously treated metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. The study will
      assess primarily the safety and tolerability and then the efficacy of PDR001 in combination
      with regorafenib. Particular attention will be paid to the level of activity of study drug
      combinations in CMS4 patients (retrospective analysis).</summary>
