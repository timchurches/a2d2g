    <interventions>Whole body vibration training: 

This is a novel form of resistance training for muscles of the lower limbs, buttocks and trunk.

Whole body vibration training has been shown to be effective in improving both muscle power and skeletal structure.The improvements seen in skeletal muscle are similar to that of power training. Vibration training can produce similar effects on skeletal muscle in a shorter period than progressive resistance training. 

Participants in will be supplied with and instructed on how to use a GalileoTM home vibration platform (Stratec, Pforzheim, Germany). The 12 week WBVT programme will involve a 15 minute program with a vibration frequency between 12 to 20 Hz per day. Participants, under parental/carers supervision, will be instructed to do three blocks of WBVT: three minutes WBVT followed by a three minute break (i.e. three minutes of WBVT, three minutes break, three minutes of WBVT, three minutes break, three minutes of WBVT). 

A home visit (duration 15 minutes) will be undertaken in week 1 to ensure correct use of the platform. A vibration diary should be completed by each participant during the three months.

Lifestyle measures: All participants will have clearly defined weight loss and physical activity goals.

Dietary advice- All participants will be seen by one of two weight management dieticians at The Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW) at baseline, 2, 6, 10 weeks. The initial appointment at baseline will be 30 minutes, subsequent appointments will be 10-15 minutes. Participants will be prescribed a diet based on moderate carbohydrate, increased protein diet; 40-45 % total energy (moderate glycaemic index and minimal refined carbohydrate), 30-35% fat (= 10% saturated fat), 25-30% protein. Energy restriction will be tailored on an individual basis to incorporate an energy restriction of approximately 500-1000 kJ/day. Nutrition intervention will utilise a structured meal plan and coaching model as routinely used in the Weight Management Services at CHW.

Exercise: All participants will be assessed by staff at The Childrens Hospital Institute of Sports Medicine (CHISM) according to the schedule. Participants will be given an exercise prescription with the aim of four, home based, 45 minute sessions of physical activity each week. The exercise program will incorporate an age-appropriate mix of both aerobic and resistance training and will be reviewed according to the schedule to avoid boredom. In addition increasing incidental physical activity, decreasing sedentary behaviours and active transport will be encouraged.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin sensitivity:

Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT ) and fasting insulin and glucose will be used as indicators of insulin sensitivity. All participants will undergo an OGTT at baseline and 3 months and indices of insulin sensitivity, including WBISI (whole body insulin sensitivity index), will be calculated. Fasting glucose and insulin will be used to calculate the insulin:glucose ratio and the Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA), proxy measures of insulin resistance.

An OGTT will be performed in the Endocrinology Testing Unit after an overnight fast. The dose of glucose will be 1.75 g/kg of body weight to a maximum of 75g. Plasma glucose and insulin will be sampled every 30 minutes for 2 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Insulin sensitivity will be measured at baseline and three months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Metabolic profile indicators: 

Blood pressure (BP), lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol), C- reactive protein (CRP)

Blood pressure will be measured using an automated BP monitor (Dinamap XL 9301), according to standard procedures.

Lipid profile and C- reactive protein (CRP)will be analysed on a fasting blood sample (serum).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Metabolic profile indicators will be measured at baseline and 3 months from randomisation.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adiposity: 

Dual Energy Xray (DEXA), Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference and waist to height ratio

DXA Prodigy will be used to measure body composition, including total body and trunk fat, lean tissue mass and bone mineral content.  The technique requires the participants to lie still for less than 4 minutes for the scan (10 minutes if weight &gt;90 kg). We have previously collected extensive normative DXA data on children and adolescents. The effective radiation dose of the DXA is 0.37microSv.

Height, weight and waist will be determined using standard procedures</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adiposity measures will be performed at baseline and at 3 months from randomisation</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle cross sectional area

Peripheral quantitative computer tomography: (pQCT) of non-dominant Tibia will be undertaken with the Stratec XCT-2000. The tibial diaphysis (66% site) will be analysed for muscle cross sectional area and stress strain index. pQCT will be performed at baseline and 12 weeks. The participant will be required to stay still for about 5 minutes. The foot will be placed in a rest and strapped into place for the examination. The effective radiation dose of the pQCT is 0.44microSv/ slice. Total effective radiation dose for this study is 1.62microSv. As part of every day living, everyone is exposed to naturally occurring background radiation and receives a dose of 2000-3000microSv. The dose in this study is minimal and no harmful effects have been demonstrated.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised control trial designed to test the hypothesis that three months of whole body vibration training (WBVT) will enhance the effect of lifestyle intervention, diet and exercise on improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic/cardiovascular profile in overweight adolescents with hyperinsulinemia. 

Obesity in children and adolescents is often associated with high insulin levels and other complications such as high blood pressure, high blood fats, fatty liver and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Adolescents with high untreated insulin levels are likely to progress to Type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise can improve obesity, reduce high insulin levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular sequelae. 

It is well known that exercise makes more muscle. Increased muscle tissue allows uptake of blood sugars more easily and thereby decreases insulin levels. We plan to see if whole body vibration training, a novel low impact form of resistance training, will lower insulin levels by increasing the muscle tissue in these young people. This in turn may improve their glucose uptake and reduce their insulin resistance. 

This new form of training may condition overweight adolescents by increasing their muscle strength and allowing them to take part in more structured physical activity. The promotion of physical activity and lifestyle change may prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular complications in later life.</summary>
