  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administration of Metformin tablets: If weight &gt; 60kg - 500mg daily for 2 weeks increased to 1g twice daily over the following 6 weeks, then 1g twice daily for 12 months. For weight &lt; 60kg - 500mg daily for 2 weeks then 500mg twice daily for 6 months. Dietary advice - session with a dietician (1 hour) at the commencement of the study and a review at 3 months (1 hour) a written information sheet will be provided. Activity data will be collected prior each dietary assessment using a SensWear device (external device worn over the upper arm - like a watch) for 5 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>placebo tablet containing: sodium starch glycolate (type A0, Povidone, maize starch, magnesium sterate, silica, colloidal anhydrous, hypromellose, macrogol 6000, purified talc, titanium dioxide. The tablets are identical to the metformin 500mg tablet aside from the absence of metformin. The placebo group also receive dietary advice

There will be an additional baseline comparator group of non Type 1 Diabetes participants. They will be recruited based on the same criteria as the T1D population (but will not have the diagnosis of T1D). This population will not receive the intervention and will have a single baseline assessment. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Prevention of vascular complications of diabetes requires strategies that begin early in the disease process. Risk factors in childhood track into adulthood and correlate with early markers of atherosclerosis such as vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function. 

We have shown that children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes have detectable endothelial and smooth muscle dysfunction that relate to body mass index (BMI). A significant number of youth with T1D are also overweight with insulin resistance. Metformin reduces insulin requirements and weight gain in type 1 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes Metformin substantially reduces risk of cardiovascular events and improves endothelial function. However there are no studies of cardiovascular outcomes or their earlier cardiovascular markers in type 1 diabetes despite the increasing prevalence of overweight status in this population and the fact that this is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 

Determining the effect of Metformin on vascular function in overweight youth with type 1 diabetes in a double blind randomized placebo controlled parallel trial will provide additional strategies to intervene in early in the process of atherosclerosis.</summary>
