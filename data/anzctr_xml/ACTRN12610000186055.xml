  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) Participant involvement is 1 visit (4 hrs) with fasting 6hrs immediately prior to visit
b) Strain gauge plethysmography and peripheral arterial tone technology (EndoPAT) will be used to assess endothelial function
c) Vasodilators sodium nitroprusside (Nitropress: 2 micrograms/min, 4 micrograms/min and 8 micrograms/min) and acetylcholine chloride (Miochol-E: 9.25 micrograms/min, 18.5 micrograms/min, 37 micrograms/min) will be delivered for 2 min each via the brachial artery during the strain gauge plethysmography. This will enable measurement of endothelial mediated vasodilation</interventions>
    <comparator>The untreated arm (contralateral to the cannulated arm) will be the comparator for the strain gauge plethysmography test. The test will be performed on this arm in the absence of brachial artery cannulation and therefore sodium nitroprusside and acetylcholine chloride. Healthy volunteers will be the comparator group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endothelial dysfunction is a disease process that occurs throughout the vascular system and results in abnormal regulation of blood vessel tone and the loss of atheroprotective properties of normal endothelium.
The presence of endothelial dysfunction in coronary or peripheral arteries is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events.
While it is well known that vascular dysfunction is associated with type II diabetes, the effects of standard treatments for this disease such as statins and fibrates on vascular function is less clear. This is even more so for type II diabetes patients with acute coronary syndrome. 
The assessment of arterial endothelial function using strain gauge plethysmography is considered the gold standard of endothelial function testing. However, it is invasive and not applicable to large patient populations. Therefore, recent non-invasive techniques such as Endo-PAT have been developed to overcome these shortfalls.  
Endo-PAT is a non-invasive peripheral arterial tonometer (PAT) which measures the changes in pulse wave amplitude (PWA) in the fingertip of the index finger. While Endo-PAT is approved by the U.S Food and Drug Authority, its reliability in detecting endothelial dysfunction in different patient cohorts is still being established.

Aims:
Our study aims to answer two research questions: Do patients at high cardiovascular risk under standard clinical care exhibit endothelial dysfunction?  We will examine endothelial function using both forearm venous occlusion plethysmography and Endo-PAT. The second research question is how reliable is the EndoPAT device in detecting endothelial dysfunction compared to strain gauge plethysmography?</summary>
