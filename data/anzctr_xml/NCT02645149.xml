  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Standard therapy or clinical trial
Treatment: drugs - Matched targeted therapy
Treatment: drugs - Trametinib and / or supportive care

Other: Standard therapy or clinical trial - Patients with BRAF and NRAS wild type tumour for whom there is no actionable genetic aberration in tumour tissue. These patients will receive trametinib based upon the known MAPK excess activity in the majority of melanomas that may be inhibited by a MEK inhibitor.

Other: Matched targeted therapy - Patients with BRAF and NRAS wild type tumour for whom there is a targeted therapy available, will receive targeted drug matched to gene defect in tumour. If a patient cannot receive the matched targeted therapy because of the existence of one or more drug specific exclusion criteria, an alternative matched therapy may be assigned, or these patients will be treated per standard therapy / clinical trial arm.

Other: Trametinib and / or supportive care - Patients with BRAF V600 and NRAS mutations will be treated with standard approved therapies or on clinical trials, and will be followed for clinical response and survival outcomes.


Treatment: drugs: Standard therapy or clinical trial
Patients with BRAF V600 and NRAS mutations detected by standard of care tumour testing will be treated with standard approved therapies or on clinical trials.

Treatment: drugs: Matched targeted therapy
Patients with tumour found to be BRAF and NRAS wild type will have tumour tested further using the extended molecular testing platform designed for this project. Patients will first receive standard therapy(ies) for BRAF / NRAS wild type melanoma until disease progression or intolerable drug toxicities. Followed by a targeted therapy matched to the genetic aberration detected in their tumour as listed above.

Treatment: drugs: Trametinib and / or supportive care
Patients with BRAF and NRAS wild type tumour for whom there is no actionable genetic aberration in tumour tissue following extended molecular testing, may receive trametinib (if not already administered as part of standard care) and/or supportive care.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a patient oriented translational research project aiming to improve clinical outcomes
      for patients with BRAF and NRAS wild-type unresectable Stage III or Stage IV metastatic
      melanoma who have progressed on, or are unable to receive standard therapy (in general,
      immunotherapy). Consecutive patients seen at three major clinics and fitting the broad
      eligibility criteria will be invited to participate.

      The approach is designed to test the impact of different targeted drugs on different
      mutations in a single type of cancer. In this project, patients will have tumour tissue
      genetically profiled to determine which mutation(s) are present, and will then be assigned to
      receive a matched drug expected to target the mutation(s) in the tumour. Where multiple
      targets are identified in one patient, or where multiple potential therapies would be
      appropriate for a single tumour mutation, the treating clinician may determine the
      appropriate therapeutic approach after consultation with the study team, using the latest
      version of library of matched therapies.</summary>
