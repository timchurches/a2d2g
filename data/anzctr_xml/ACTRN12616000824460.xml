    <interventions>Nicotine Replacement Therapy System
Dosing period consists of 3 days with approximately 21 mg of nicotine delivered transdermally per day using the Chrono Quit Smoking Solution (CQSS1).  Doses of 5.4% nicotine formulation delivered transdermally via the CQSS1 worn either on the upper arm or mid-thigh at programmed intervals of T0 (upon waking in the morning), T0.5, T1, T7, T7.5, and T13 hours each day. The dosing timepoints are consistent across 3 consecutive days.  Each CQSS1 is worn for 24 hours and is changed once daily upon waking.  The washout period between study treatments is 2 days.  Participants are required to stay in the clinic for 8 days.  The treatment will not be titrated.  The treatment will be adapted to subjects wake-up time.  The CQSS1 treatments will be administered by the health care provider.
Placement of the CQSS1 on the subject will be randomized to mid-thigh and taped, upper arm and taped, mid-thigh not taped, upper arm not taped.  Additionally, subjects will be randomized to the sequence CQSS1 then NicoDerm or NicoDerm then CQSS1.  Body location and taping status will remain the same throughout the study for each subject.  Pharmacokinetic and skin irritation assessment using an 8-point visual scale will be used.
</interventions>
    <comparator>NicoDerm (Registered Trademark) CQ (Registered Trademark) Patch product is a commercially-available adhesive patch that provides nicotine transdermally over 24 hours.  The study dosing period consists of 1 day with application of approximately 21 mg nicotine total.  The NicoDerm (Registered Trademark) CQ (Registered Trademark) Patch is applied to either the upper arm or mid-thigh in the morning of the dosing period at the time of dosing initiation, and worn for 24 hours.  The treatment will not be personalized, titrated, or adapted to individuals.  NicoDerm treatments will be administered by the health care provider.
Subjects will be randomized to mid-thigh and taped, upper arm and taped, mid-thigh not taped, upper arm not taped.  Additionally, subjects will be randomized to the sequence CQSS1 then NicoDerm or NicoDerm then CQSS1.  Body location and taping status will remain the same throughout the study for each subject.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate relative bioavailability of nicotine delivered by the CQSS1 vs NicoDerm with PK analysis.  This is a composite to include: Geometric mean ratios (test/reference) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24), and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-infinity).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>CQSS1 (Study Treatment A) for Days 1 and 3 of treatment: 
Blood draws at T0, every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours, T2.5 hours, T3 hours, hourly thereafter through hour 17, every 2 hours thereafter through 23 hours, and T24 hours.
CQSS1 (Study Treatment A) for Day 2 of treatment:
Blood draws at T15 hours and T24 hours.
NicoDerm CQ Patch (Study Treatment B) 1 day of treatment:
Blood draws immediately prior to patch application, every 20 minutes for first 2 hours, T2.5 hours, T3 hours, hourly thereafter through Hour 17, every 2 hours through hour 23, and then 24 hours after patch application.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate if the amount of nicotine delivered by the CQSS1 vs NicoDerm treatments (single dose) are equivalent. The 90 percent CIs for the geometric mean ratio (test/reference) for AUC0-infinity must fall between 80 and 125 percent.</outcome>
      <timepoint>CQSS1 (Study Treatment A) for Days 1 and 3 of treatment: 
Blood draws at T0, every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours, T2.5 hours, T3 hours, hourly thereafter through hour 17, every 2 hours thereafter through 23 hours, and T24 hours.
CQSS1 (Study Treatment A) for Day 2 of treatment:
Blood draws at T15 hours and T24 hours.

NicoDerm CQ Patch (Study Treatment B) 1 day of treatment:
Blood draws immediately prior to patch application, every 20 minutes for first 2 hours, T2.5 hours, T3 hours, hourly thereafter through hour 17, every 2 hours through hour 23, and then 24 hours after patch application.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety assessment with standard Adverse Event evaluation for tolerability of the CQSS1.  Vital signs and skin irritation assessments will be monitored periodically throughout the active period of dosing for possible adverse events of:  Bradycardia (pulse rate &lt;40 beats per minute [bpm]), Tachycardia (pulse rate &gt;120 bpm), Blood pressure &lt;90 or &gt;165 mmHg systolic, Blood pressure &lt;45 or &gt;105 mmHg diastolic, fever, generalized skin rash, abdominal pain, confusion, and pale skin.  A skin irritation assessment using an 8-point visual scale will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily throughout the study on treatment and washout days and at the safety follow-up visit 7 to 10 days from the last dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The skin adhesion assessment 5-point scale is validated and provided in US FDA Guidance, Assessing Adhesion with Transdermal Delivery Systems and Topical Patches, June 2016. The skin adhesion assessment of the CQSS1 will be completed by the health care professional.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Adherence assessment for the CQSS1 using a 5-point scale will be conducted each day immediately prior to initiation of dosing, at T6, T12, and T18 hours post-application, and immediately prior to the CQSS1 removal.

    <sequence>Subjects are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two sequences that determines the order in which the study treatments, CQSS1 or NicoDerm, are administered (AB vs BA), the location of device placement (upper arm or mid-thigh), and whether or not the device/patch will be taped or not taped.  Simple randomization using a randomization table created by computer software will be conducted.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics.  The sample size calculation is based on the assumption that the variability of nicotine delivered by the CQSS1 is the same as that of nicotine delivered by the NicoDerm CQ Patch.  Based on 20% intra-subject variability for the AUCs with a geometric mean ratio of 0.90 between nicotine delivered by the CQSS1 vs. NicoDerm CQ and at least 90% power with a 5% alpha (1-sided) ratio of geometric means within the range of 0.80 and 1.25, the sample size for this crossover study is 32 subjects, including 6 incompletes. </statisticalmethods>
