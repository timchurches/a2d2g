  <interventions>
    <interventions>For a given recruitment period, eligible subjects will be assessed at baseline 0-2 weeks prior to receiving lower limb Botulinum Toxin A (BoNTA) injections.  All subjects will then receive lower limb BoNTA as per present QCPHS protocol. Muscles to be injected will be selected by the Clinic Rehabilitation Consultant and physiotherapist according to assessment findings and clinical indications. Muscles selected will accordingly vary between subjects but must be in the lower limb as stated in the inclusion criteria. In the ambulant population, common muscles injected include medial hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis posterior.

Dose is different for all children but is according to recommendations based on the consensus opinion of the 'We Move' Spasticity Study Group (2002). This is worked out on a dose/kilo/muscle ratio which calculates a total dose/kilo. The maximum dose allowed is 16 units/kilo or to a total adult dose of 400 units. 

2-3 weeks post BoNTA injections, all subjects will commence their rehabilitation. Subjects will not be re-injected with BoNTA until completion of the rehabilitation and 6 month post BoNTA assessments (final assessment point and exit from study).

The Children allocated to the group-based intervention will receive physiotherapy together in a small group (3 or more children) with a physiotherapist and assistant. The format will consist of: 5 minutes warm up (group activity); 10 minutes of lower limb stretching (as a group); 4x5 minute circuit stations (group, paired or individual) addressing 1. Functional Strengthening 2. Balance 3. Targeted Motor Control 4. Fitness/Agility; 5 minutes warm down (group activity). Dose will consist of 6 sessions of physiotherapy provided in 1 hour sessions over 6 weeks. A standardised, individualised (3 activities related to individual goals to be completed 3 times a week) Home Exercise Programme will also be given to each participant and progressed each week as appropriate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Children allocated to receive individual-based physiotherapy will receive it in a one-to-one format with a physiotherapist. The dose and content will be the same as the group intervention, the only difference being the format. Those allocated to the individual control treatment will also recieve the Home Exercise Programme as per the group intervention.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The study will include children/adolescents aged 4-14 years with a diagnosis of spastic cerebral palsy who:
- are clients of the Queensland Cerebral Palsy Health Service
- require lower limb BoNTA to improve gait or mobility
- have a Gross Motor Function Classification System level I-III (Palisano, Rosenbaum et al. 1997)
- can commit to an intensive block of post BoNTA physiotherapy rehabilitation. This consists of 60 minutes, 1x a week for a total period of 6 weeks. Content of each 60 minute rehabilitation session will include: 5 minutes warm up activity; 10 minutes of lower limb stretching; 4x5 minute circuit stations with 1 minute inbetween each station to allow for rest/set up/drink. Stations to address: 1. functional strengthening 2. balance 3. targeted motor control 4. fitness/agility; 5 minutes warm down activity; 10 minutes review of home programme</inclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The randomisation process will involve allocating "group" or "individual" to numbers "1" or "2" via coin flipping by non-study personnel. Prior to commencement of recruitment, this process will be carried out 10 times (to allow for enough cohorts to recruit sufficient numbers to meet power calculations). Each allocation will be recorded on a piece of paper, folded and placed inside an envelope in a random order. For a given recruitment period, eligible subjects will be clustered equally into 2 'groups' "1" or "2" according to geographical location. This will address the need for logistical geographical planning of rehabilitation. The subjects will be allocated to the next consecutive envelope, which will be opened by the non-study personnel. They will read and record the treatment allocation from the paper inside (ie: 1= group, 2 = individual) and the study coordinator will be informed of the allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple block randomisation will occur so that for a given recruitment period subjects will be grouped equally into "1" or "2' according to geographical location of residence.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This single blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the relative effectiveness of two models of physiotherapy rehabilitation post lower limb Botulinum Toxin A (BoNTA) injections.  Traditional individual rehabilitation will be compared to a group-based model for children aged 4-14 years with Cerebral Palsy (CP) attending the Queensland Cerebral Palsy Health Service (QCPHS) for BoNTA injections.</summary>
