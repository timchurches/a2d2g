  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline (Average of Screening and Day 0) in the Average TMC Scores From Weeks 9 &amp; 12 - Total TMC score is a sum of chorea scores which range 0-28, with a decrease indicating improvement in chorea</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening, Day 0, Weeks 9, 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment Success at the End of Therapy as Measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) - A treatment success is defined as Much or Very Much Improved at the Week 12 visit. The PGIC is a 7-point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse to very much improved</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment Success at the End of Therapy Based on Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) - A treatment success is defined as Much or Very Much Improved at the Week 12 visit. The PGIC is a 7-point Likert Scale, ranging from very much worse to very much improved. The clinician was asked to comment about the subject.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Functioning Score (Based on Items 3a to 3j) From Baseline to Week 12 - Change in the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) physical functioning score (based on items 3a to 3j) from Baseline to Week 12. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Berg Balance Test (BBT) - The Berg Balance Test (BBT) is a 14-item assessment of sitting, standing, transferring, and turning. Each task ranging from standing up from a sitting position, to standing on one foot each task is given a score of zero (unable) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all of the scores.The scale range, which is 0-56, with higher scores indicating better balance/lower fall risk.</outcome>
