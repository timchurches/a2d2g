    <studytitle>Investigation of the Optimal Cooling period for hypothermic treatment of Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) in term neonates (OCHIE)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A study which will analyse all available clinical parameters of  term babies where the clinical decision has been to administer hypothermia treatment following a hypoxic event during cooling and re-warming to determine if there are clinical parameters which aids diagnosis of the severity of the hypoxic insult and outcome prediction and allows analysis and determination of the optimal cooling period based on the severity.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Additional measurements of the Resistance Index (RI) are measured with Ultrasound daily whilst cooled and every 0.5 degrees (C) increase in rectal temperature (approximately 2 hourly). After warmed, RI will be measured daily until recovery to normal (1 week maximum).
All available clinical parameters recorded and analysed including (but not limited to) vital signs, pathology results, and aEEG from time of consent until the return of the RI to normal (1 week maximum). Cerebral perfusion using Near-infrared Spectrometry (NIRS) continuously monitored from time of consent during cooling and re-warming and until RI returns to normal (again 1 week maximum). 
Analysis of MRI (one MRI after re-warming). 
Inclusion of 2 year developmental review. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Babies who have deprived of oxygen during birth can be at risk of brain damage because the blood rushes to the
brain to compensate for the lack of oxygen. Cooling has been show to help prevent brain damage. Currently all
babies are cooled for 72 hours but it is thought that some babies may benefit from being cooled for longer. Babies
in this study will have more frequent ultrasound scans through the soft spot on the head (fontanelle) to monitor
blood flow to the brain. Ultrasound scans will occur before cooling, daily whilst cooled, and every hour during rewarming (this takes around 12 hours).
Whilst being treated the baby will be monitored by a patient monitor that monitors blood pressure, heart rate and
respiration rate and an electroencephalograph (EEG) monitor which records electrical brain activity. The data from
the patient monitor and EEG will be collected and analysed for the research. Pathology results and MRIs may also be included in the research.
When the baby is 2, it is normal practice to invite parents of HIE babies to an interview with a Paediatrician to
discuss their developmental progress and this study will use the information from this developmental review.</summary>
