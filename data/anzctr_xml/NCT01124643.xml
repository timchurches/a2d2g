    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF- Q) - The MLHF-Q contains 21 questions with answers ranging from 0 (no) to 5 (very much). The final score ( 0 to 105) is the sum of the points for the 21 questions. A higher score indicates a worse quality of life.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class - Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea.
Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class IV: Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</outcome>
