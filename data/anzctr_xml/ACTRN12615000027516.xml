    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events related to study treatment or procedures.  The investigator will perform a full dental examination at each visit and participants will be questioned regarding any adverse events occurring between study visits.  Potential adverse events related to the investigational product include infection of the surgical site due to membrane exposure to the oral cavity and allergic reaction to the Celgro product.  Potential adverse events related to the dental surgery include pain, swelling, infection and slight bleeding at the surgical site.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 months post-treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound healing assessment.  The wound will be visually assessed by the investigator and the presence of soft tissue dehiscence, membrane exposure, swelling, inflammation, fibrin, plaque and necrosis recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week, 1 month and 6 months post-treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum pain score since the previous visit using a scale of 1-10 where 1 = no pain to 10 = worst pain</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tooth extraction or loss results in resorption of bone volume in the jaw.  This is a natural phenomenon which occurs mainly during the first 3 months following removal of the tooth.  Preservation of bone volume facilitates subsequent placement of dental implants and leads to improved functional and aesthetic outcomes for patients.

Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a commonly used technique where a bone substrate (autologous or de-proteinised bovine bone matrix) is packed around  the exposed implant to fill the defect, and covered with a membrane.  The membrane promotes the growth of new bone by occluding infiltration of competing soft tissue, but permitting fluid and nutrient transfer to the newly forming bone.  Native collagen membranes of porcine origin are commonly used as they have been proven to significantly enhance periodontal and bone regeneration in animal and human clinical studies.

Celgro(tm) is an acellular type I/III collagen matrix of porcine origin.  The product consists of natural collagen bundles without cross-linking or chemical additives.  It is free from animal-derived DNA and pathogens of porcine origin.

Celgro(tm) is a next-generation membrane that is manufactured using collagen originating from animals bred and exclusively raised in Australia, eliminating disease transmission concerns associated with foreign products.  Additionally, the collagen bundle structure of Celgro(tm) is mechanically stronger and more elastic than other collagen membrane products of this type.

This study proposes to use Celgro(tm) in a standardised dental implantation procedure to assess its suitability for use in GBR.
