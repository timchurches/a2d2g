Sessions are delivered in group format with facilitators following a detailed manual. Sessions last approximately one hour (once a week for 10 weeks) and are followed by an informal chat and refreshments.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postnatal depression (PND) interferes with the interaction between mother and infant, which in turn has long-term implications for the child's development. Further, treatment for PND directed at elevating mood has not been found to improve mother-infant interactions. For this reason we developed Community HUGS - a specialised 10-session playgroup for improving mother-infant relationships following PND. The aim of this project is to evaluate Community HUGS in a randomised controlled trial. It is hypothesised that women receiving the Community HUGS intervention will show less parent-child dysfunctional interactions and parental distress and higher maternal self-efficacy than women in the waitlist control condition post-treatment.</summary>
