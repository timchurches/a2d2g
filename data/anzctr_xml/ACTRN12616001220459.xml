  <interventions>
    <interventions>Psychobiotics is a group of probiotics which represents beneficial effects to mental health. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) is a recently published psychobiotic. This trial aimed at investigating the effects of PS128 on the intestinal function and quality of life on geriatrics. 
This trial will include people who were aged more than or equal to 60 and can listen, speak, read and write traditional Chinese. People who were prescribed to use antibiotics within 2 weeks or ingest probiotics products within 2 weeks will be excluded. Subjects will randomly assign to PS128 group or placebo group. After inclusion, the subjects will take PS128 (3 Ã— 10^10 CFU) or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) capsule after breakfast for 28 days. 
Five questionnaires used in this trial were completed by subjects on day 0 and day 28, including Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome (GSRS-IBS), WHOQOL-BREF, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Geriatric Depression Scale-30. Subject who was institutionalized elderly at collaborative elderly center will collect blood sample on day 0 and day 28. The subjects adherence will be monitored by checking the returning capsule packet.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo control will be the control group of this trial. Participants in this group will be given 400 mg of microcrystalline cellulose in a capsule. Participants will consume orally one placebo capsule daily with water for 28 days. All the scoring measured and sample collection are the same of all participants.</comparator>
