  <interventions>
    <interventions>Provision of home exercise program or protocol on DVD as well as brochure. There are seven hand therapy protocols that have been provided on DVD's. They are Flexor tendon repair: early active motion protocol Flexor tendon repair: passive protocol Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL) repair: early active motion protocol Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL) repair: passive protocol Short arc early active range of motion repair for zones 2 to 3 Controlled early active motion for zones four to seven extensor tendon repair TriMed wrist fixation system (TriMed Inc, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.) following Distal radius Fracture. The protocols have been published by EKCO Occupational Services Hand and Upper Limb Rehabilitation Unit in Brisbane Following initial appointment with the Occupational Therapist, if a patient is to begin one of the seven protocols they are invited to participate in the study. At the initial appointment all patients are provided with their usual care that includes splinting, wound and oedema management and the implementation of exercise therapy protocols. They are all provided with brochures and sent to an administration officer who randomly assigns them to a DVD or no DVD group. Length of time for initial appointment is 30 minutes to one hour.  Patients return for weekly appointments, which are an average 30 minutes duration, where exercises are checked for correctness and understanding, wound management and oedema management continues and splints modified if necessary. Patients are then advised to move to the next weekly stage on the DVD if they have been provided with one, and all are provided with a brochure entailing upgraded exercises. The duration of each weekly stage for both the brochure and DVD is 7 days. The weekly upgrading of exercises for the protocols on both the DVD and brochure covers a six week period. Hand therapy treatment for scar management and ongoing range of movement and oedema management can extend beyond this and is dependent on the clinical status of the patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>Brochures/handouts are provided to all patients at the initial appointment as part of standard treatment.Length of time for initial appointment is 30 minutes to one hour.  They are provided each week as exercises are upgraded. Subsequent weekly appointments are for  an average of 30 minutes. The brochures are static illustrations of same protocols as demonstrated on the DVD. The brochures contain step by step instructions regarding exercises and precautions following surgery. Each protocol has a series of up to seven brochures, which relate to the upgrading of exercises each week Patients in the control group receive weekly appointments, which is part of standard treatment</comparator>

    <summary>This study seeks to determine if compliance and understanding of a home exercise program is improved when the patients are provided with a DVD and a brochure when compared to using brochures only.  This is particularly relevant for rural and remote residents who  may not be able to attend weekly therapy sessions at the hospital</summary>
