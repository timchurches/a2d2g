  <interventions>
    <interventions>Type of intervention: One-on-one behaviour modification therapy. 
Delivery of intervention: To be run in individual sessions for 1 hour per week over 10 weeks (weekly schedule) or run twice daily over 1 week (intensive schedule). 
Description of intervention: Involves providing verbal prompts to encourage consumption of food/s with positive reinforcement (verbal prompts with/without toy etc), upon consumption of target foods. Parents initially observe from behind a one-way mirror and assist in collecting information about the behaviours they are observing in their child. As sessions continue, parents are transitioned into the room and are trained to offer new foods and provide positive reinforcement by the end of the therapy block.  
Arm Two: HELPing Mealtime Experience 
Type of Intervention: Small group sensory desensitisation therapy. 
Delivery of intervention: Run in small group sessions for 1 hour per week over 10 weeks (weekly schedule) or twice daily for 1 week (intensive schedule). 
Description of intervention: Involves the child being exposed to a gradually more challenging modelling and play with food (based on a sensory heirarchy of look&gt;touch&gt;smell&gt;taste). Parents initially observe the sessions from behind a one-way mirror with a second therapist and assist in observing transitions and reactions in their children. As the block continues, parents are rotated in and out of the room to assist in modeling play using the sensory hierarchy (i.e. 1 parent and primary therapist in the room; 1 parent and secondary therapist outside of the room).</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be a natural control group who is on the wait-list to receive therapy. Following assessment, and in determining eligibility for intervention, these children will either be offered input via an intensive schedule (as described above) or during a subsequent 10-week block. As recruitment for this study will occur in an ongoing fashion, there will be multiple opportunities therapy if it is not immediately available.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adequacy of diet and overall increase in dietary variety

Assessed via 3-day weighed food diary, Modified Children's Dietary Questionnaire (Margarey et al., 1999), and a Food Frequency Questionnaire. In addition to this, there will be a New Foods List where parents indicate, in an ongoing fashion, how many times their child is offered new foods and the number of acceptances or rejections.</outcome>

      <outcome>Improvement in mealtime behaviours (% desirable vs undesirable behaviours; mealtime duration)

Measured via Behaviour Paediatrics Feeding Assessment (Adapted from Crist et al., 2001), and self-developed HELP study: Eating Skills and Behaviour Questionnaire. Questionnaire involves parent-rated likert scales (parents rate how often their child presents with a certain behaviour from 0 = Never to 4 = Always).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in mealtime interactions between parent and child.

Measured via Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (Revised) (Eyberg, 1994). A video-tape is taken of the parent interacting with their child in a non-food related activity, a parent offering their child a preferred food and the parent offering their child a non-preferred food. All videos will be rated externally by the team psychologist who will not be working directly with the children involved.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>

Measured with the Children's Picky Eating Questionnaire (Adapted from Carruth and Skinner, 2000) and the New Foods List, where parents indicate in an ongoing fashion how many times their child is offered new foods and the number of acceptances or rejections.</outcome>

    <concealment>Sealed envelopes containing three stratified participant numbers will be developed using a random number generator before enrolment commences. This box will be kept under the control of a blinded colleague who will not have direct contact with any of the participants. An intake questionnaire is completed on contact with the parents' to determine eligibility. Parents provide written consent for their child to participate in the study if they are eligible. After initial assessment is booked with the principal investigator, the participants will then be allocated a number as per their order of enrolment. Assessment will need to be completed with a minimum of 3 participants before treatment can begin.</concealment>
    <sequence>As per above, sealed envelopes containing three (because one arm needs to operate in at least small groups of three), participants will be developed before intervention commences. A computer generated random number sequence will be used to allocate the numbers to sealed envelopes in groups of three.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of two child-directed feeding intervention programs for children from complex medical backgrounds (cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal) with feeding difficulties and restricted range of oral intake (&lt;30 foods across the food groups). Baseline assessments will include parent-completed questionnaires on-site (Herston) and feeding and growth evaluations. There are two arms of intervention. Arm One is an individual behaviour modification program. Arm Two involves small group sensory desensitization therapy.  Intervention will be provided over three phases. In Phase One, interventions will be provided weekly, over a 10-week period. Phase Two will involve offering a further block of therapy, (Arm One or Arm Two), where appropriate, over a 10 week period. Phase Three will involve providing either arm one or arm two on an intensive basis.</summary>
