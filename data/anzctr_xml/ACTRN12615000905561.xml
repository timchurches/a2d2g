  <interventions>
    <interventions>The effect of the DCHP will be measured in four different hospitals in Australia. The starting time for site 2,3 and 4 will be at 3 months intervals after site 1. Each site will have a 10week control period ( baseline data), a 4 week implementation period (no data collection) before a 12 month intervention period. The results will be pooled for final reporting.

The education component of the intervention is a face to face 15-30 min power-point provided by nurse educators to clinical and non-clinical staff focussing on good communication, re-orientation and carer engagement. The education will occur in the 3 months prior to implementation and continue throughout the interventation period for new staff to the target wards. The education is provided to all levels of clinical and non-clinical staff who may have contact with a pateint with Cognitive Impairment (CI).An education register is kept and it is expected that 80% of staff will be educated. Each hospital has selected between 5 -7 wards in their acute service. Intensive Care, Emergency and Peadiatrics are excluded.The awareness component is the use of an over bedside graphic called the Cognitive Impairment Identifier linked to positive screening for CI. The CII is copyrighted to Ballarat Health Service.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual acute hospital care. This is care as required for hospital accreditation.Currently this is usually care targetting patients with CI who are percieved as disruptive on the ward. In such cirmcustances the patient may be "specialled" ( have additional 1 on 1 staff supervision) and the family asked to stay.</comparator>

The adverse event data will be collected using the existing hospital adverse event reporting systems. Health Round Table will collate the hospital data reporting on-
1.	All patients admitted for multi-day stay aged 65 years and over (aged 50 years and over for ATSI status patients)
2.	For all patients admitted for multi-day stay aged 65 years and over (aged 50 years and over for ATSI status patients):

The primary economic evaluation will comprise a cost minimisation exercise. An analysis of costs and quality-of-life will also be undertaken to determine the ICER as the ratio of the mean cost difference between patients (aged 65+ with CI) in the pre- and post-implementation periods to the mean difference in DEMQOL score between patients (aged 65+ with CI) in the pre- and post-implementation period.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dementia was the third leading cause of death in 2010, with 9,003 deaths recorded across Australia. For people aged 65 and over, dementia was the second leading cause of burden of disease and the leading cause of disability burden. Dementia is now the ninth National Health Priority Area in Australia.
Bail et al. (personal communication) from the Hospital dementia Services Project (2012) indicates that patient with dementia in medical and surgical services have 2.5 times increased risk of adverse event compared to the no dementia group matched for age and other comorbidities.
In the acute hospital setting patients can have difficulties with memory and thinking because of dementia or for other reasons such as delirium or specific brain injury such as stroke. Irrespective of the cause, disorders of memory and thinking or more succinctly Cognitive Impairment (CI) are a source of risk in the complex hospital environment.
While dementia can also occur in younger people, the current study will focus on patients in acute hospitals aged 65 and over with cognitive impairment as this is the largest hospital group.

Rationale for study: 
It is recognised that hospital staff are not adequately equipped to identify or respond appropriately to people with dementia.
The Dementia Care in Hospitals Program (DCHP) is an all of hospital education program to improve communication with and awareness of patients with Cognitive Impairment (CI) linked to a bedside alert: the cognitive impairment identifier (CII). This program was first developed and introduced at BHS in 2004 in partnership with people with dementia and their families. The DCHP has been adopted by 25 public and private hospitals in Victoria. The program involves comprehensive training for clinical and non-clinical hospital staff. 
Unpublished evaluations of the program found that 80% of staff reported it improved their practice and 40% reported that it had improved their response to carers. Carers also reported greater satisfaction with the care their family member received (AIHW 2013). However, while staff perceptions and carer and patient satisfaction were measured, the effect of the DCHP on clinical outcomes such as adverse events and cost effectiveness has not been measured. 
The Department of Social Services has now funded a roll-out of the DCHP to other Australian jurisdictions and requested a national evaluation which is the basis for this study. There are three interrelated but separate elements to the evaluation that is the subject of this protocol-
1.	Change in patient quality of life, carer satisfaction and staff knowledge and perceived difficulty with care
2.	Change in nursing modifiable adverse events in patients over 65 with cognitive impairment
3.	Cost effectiveness of the DCHP
Element (2) is the basis for a PhD to be completed by A/Prof Mark Yates
