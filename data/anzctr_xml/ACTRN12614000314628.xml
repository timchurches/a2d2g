  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive sensory discrimination training- one hour three times a week for six weeks. Sensory discrimination training is administered one to one with an occupational therapist and involves the progression through graded stimuli from the greatest differences to finer differences in texture discrimination, object recognition and body position sense. These sub- components of training are also integrated into a client selected goal.</interventions>

Data from Carey et al., (2011) intervention study with adults post-stroke was used to determine sample size and effect size. This data was used because this study is trialling the same treatment outlined in Carey's work but with children. Means and standard deviations for the experimental and control groups at baseline and the end of phase one were used. Experimental group baseline: -41.14 (35.79) and end of phase one: -18.78 (40.92); the control group baseline: -31.24 (27.07) and end of phase one: -26.61 (33.54). The calculated power is .95 with an effect size of 1.213 and a sample size of 32 participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to find out if a sensory discrimination training method that is effective in reducing sensory impairment in adults who have had a stroke is also effective in reducing impairments in sensation for children with cerebral palsy. 

We hypothesise that sensory discrimination training will improve sensory discrimination for children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and result in improvements in function, activity and quality of life.  Additionally we hypothesis that central changes will be evident on fMRI following intervention. We hypothesise that changes will be sustained at 6 months post intervention.</summary>
