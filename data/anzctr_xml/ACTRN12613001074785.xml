  <interventions>
    <interventions>at least 90 patients with lumbar disc hernia who are candidates of conservative (nonsurgical) treatment will be randomized in three 30-patient, age- and sex-matched groups. Management will be similar in all three groups. One group will receive oral ciprofloxacin, 500mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Another group will receive oral co-amoxical 250 mg three time daily for 2 weeks. In the third group no antibiotic will be administered. </interventions>
    <comparator>Only standard management including advice to rest and stay inactive for at least 2 weeks, as well as conservative (nonsurgical) treatments such as analgesics and anti-inflammatories.
This is the group that will not be administered any antibiotics.</comparator>

To detect a pain relief=1.5 units according to VAS, with a standard deviation=2 (according to previous reports), at a significant level of 5% (a two-sided t-test) with 80% power 27 patients were needed in each group, which was augmented to 30.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>According to results of some recent studies, infection may cause Modic changes. This study aims to investigate whether antibiotic therapy along with conventional management of non-surgical lumbar disc herniation may cause better and/or rapid amelioration of symptoms.  </summary>
