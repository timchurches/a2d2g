  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Corneal Thickness - Percentage of corneal swelling (positive value) or deswelling (negative value) measured with Haag-Streit pachymetry equipment in microns, reported as a percent.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 8 hours of contact lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endothelial Blebs - Corneal images captured with equipment are measured, manually outlined to estimate total bleb area from 0 to 100%. This is measured as a change in percentage after 20 minutes compared to the value prior to lens wear (baseline).</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, after 20 minutes of treatment conditions</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Limbal Redness - Scale of 0 to 4, where 0=none and 4= severe redness. Measure reported as a comparison of 8 hours of wear to baseline with the difference being reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, After 8 hours of treatment conditions</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Comfort - Patient reported subjective comfort of lenses or spectacles (range 0-100, where 100 is best).</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 8 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Be of legal age (i.e. = 18 years).

          -  Be mentally competent, willing and able to sign a written informed consent form.

          -  Have contact lens distance sphere requirement in the range -1.00D to -6.00D.

          -  Have spectacle astigmatism &lt;1.25D in each eye.

          -  Currently wear soft contact lenses (for at least 6 months prior to the trial) with
             documentation of current prescription.

          -  Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the purpose of this
             study a normal eye is defined as one having: i) no evidence of lid abnormality or
             infection; ii) no conjunctival abnormality or infection; iii) no clinically
             significant slit lamp findings (i.e, edema, staining, scarring, vascularization,
             infiltrates or abnormal opacities); iv) no other active ocular disease.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Required concurrent ocular medication.

          -  Any systemic illness which would contra-indicate lens wear or the medical treatment of
             which would affect vision or successful lens wear.

          -  Eye injury or surgery within eight weeks immediately prior to enrollment for this
             study.

          -  Abnormal lacrimal secretions.

          -  Pre-existing ocular irritation that would preclude contact lens fitting.

          -  Keratoconus or other corneal irregularity.

          -  Pregnancy, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrollment.

          -  Participation in any concurrent clinical trial.</exclusivecriteria>
