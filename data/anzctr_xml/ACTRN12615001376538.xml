    <scientifictitle>In cardiac surgery for children on cardiopulmonary bypass, does the addition of nitric oxide to the bypass circuit, compared to not adding nitric oxide, reduce low cardiac output syndrome?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nitric Oxide was blended with oxygen in the gas administration line to the cpb (cardiopulmonary bypass) circuit, for the duration of cpb which was dependent on procedure (range 30 to 240 mins).
Nitric oxide was delivered at 20 parts per million (Ikaria delivery system which measures concentration of nitric oxide delivery electrochemically)
Methaemoglobin levels were monitored throughout cpb by the study perfusionist (who was unblinded to whether nitric oxide was to be delivered). Levels were higher in those that received nitric oxide (proving adherence - nitric oxide was indeed being delivered) but never reached clinically important levels.</interventions>

    <concealment>A patient was deemed eligible for inclusion at the time of consent, before randomisation.
Randomisation was performed just prior to starting cpb by the study perfusionist. He/she opened a sealed opaque envelope (from centre for epidemiology and biostatistics) which told him/her whether to add nitric oxide to the cpb gas flow or not. </concealment>
    <sequence>The centre for epidemiology and biostatistics at RCH performed simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software</sequence>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>A statistician employed by hospital was used. 
The incidence of LCOS following cardiac surgery is around 50%. A pilot study suggested this could be reduced to 30% using the intervention being studied.. In order to detect a reduction in LCOS from 50% to 30% (effect size), where alpha (level of statistical significance) is 0.05 and beta 0.2 (80% power) a sample size of 186 participants was calculated. Attrition rate was zero as loss to follow up not possible (the children were not followed up after discharge from hospital and data was available from hospital records for the entirety of their stay).

    <summary>We hypothesised that adding nitric oxide to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit may reduce the occurrence of low cardiac output syndrome on ICU and improve patient outcomes (such as reducing the need for mechanical ventilation and shorten ICU length of stay)
