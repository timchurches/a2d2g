  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator - Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the first documented occurrence of PD or death. Investigator PFS was summarized per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) which is a set of published criteria defining when cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stable) or worsen (progress). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the worsening of non target lesions significant enough to require study treatment discontinuation. For participants who had not progressed or died at the time of the analysis, censoring was performed at the last adequate disease assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause (average of 9 study months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS is defined as the interval of time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. For participants who did not die, time of death was censored at the date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until death due to any cause (average of 9 study months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Confirmed Response (Complete Response or Partial Response) - A participant was defined as a responder if he/she sustained a complete response (CR: the disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have a short axis of &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters or the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions or lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at Baseline with a short axis of =10mm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until the first documented complete response or partial response (average of 9 study months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response for Participants With a Confirmed Response (Complete Response or Partial Response) - Duration of response is defined as the time (in months) from the first documented complete response (CR: the disappearance of all target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must have a short axis of &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions) or partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters or the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions or lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at Baseline with a short axis of =10mm) until disease progression (PD). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5mm or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or the worsening of non target lesions significant enough to require study treatment discontinuation. PD was based on the radiological evidence by investigator.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE) - An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a par., temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Protocol specific SAEs included: ALT=3XULN and total bilirubin =2XULN (35% direct) or ALT =3XULN and INR &gt;1.5 (if INR is measured); any new malignancy with a histology different from the primary tumor; left ventricular ejection fraction that met stopping criteria; central serous retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion; pyrexia accompanied by =grade 3 hypotension, or hypotension that is clinically significant as judged by the investigator, dehydration requiring IV fluids, or severe rigor/chills.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two-arm, double-blinded, randomized, Phase III study comparing dabrafenib
      (GSK2118436) and trametinib (GSK1120212) combination therapy to dabrafenib administered with
      a trametinib placebo (dabrafenib monotherapy). Subjects with histologically confirmed
      cutaneous melanoma that is either Stage IIIC (unresectable) or Stage IV, and BRAF V600E/K
      mutation positive will be screened for eligibility. Subjects who have had prior systemic
      anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting will not be eligible although
      prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting will be allowed. Approximately 340 subjects
      will be randomized 1:1 (combination therapy: dabrafenib monotherapy). Subjects will be
      stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (&gt; the upper limit of normal (ULN) versus
      less than or equal to the ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K). The primary endpoint
      is investigator-assessed, progression-free survival for subjects receiving the combination
      therapy compared with those receiving dabrafenib monotherapy. Subjects will be followed for
      overall survival; crossover will not be permitted.</summary>
