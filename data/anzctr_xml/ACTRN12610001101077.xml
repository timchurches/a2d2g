This is an investigator initiated, randomized, open-label, national, multicenter, three-arm, pilot study evaluating the efficacy of peginterferon alpha-2a plus Tenofovir combination therapy and Peginterferon lead in therapy followed by combination therapy with Tenofovir  in adult HBeAg-positive outpatients with CHB.  
Only subjects who have provided written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. 
allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was "off-site" or at central administration. Concealment is done by sealed envelopes. Central randomisation is done by fac from the offsite central administration. Randomisation has been developed by the statistician and concealed by sealed envelopes. Each randomisation will take the next sequential envelope allocated to the sites allocated concealed sealed envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, openlabel, national, multicenter, three arm, pilot, investigator initiated study evaluating the
efficacy and safety of Tenofovir 300 mg PO in combination with peginterferon alpha2a sc 180 Âµg in patients with
HBeAg positive CHB. The patients will be randomized into three treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1:1
Arm 1: Full course combination therapy: 48 weeks of both peginterferon alpha2a plus Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
Arm 2: Peginterferon alpha2a lead-in therapy: 24 weeks of a lead in course of peginterferon monotherapy, followed by 24 weeks of combination peginterferon 
Arm 3: Peginterferon alpha2a 180mcg weekly for 48 weeks 
The study consists of four periods:
Screening (= 8 weeks prior to Baseline visit),
Baseline Visit (Day 1),
Treatment Phase (48 weeks)
Posttreatment 
Followup
(24 weeks)

Study purpose: The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of Peginterferon and Tenofovir therapy may lead to improved antiviral outcomes compared to that typically seen with Peginterferon monotherapy.

Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the combination of peginterferon alpha-2a with Tenofovir in achieving sustained HBV suppression  as measured  by HBsAg loss  in adult patients with HBeAg positive CHB

Secondary objectives include 
1. Evaluating the effect of on HBsAg clearance rates by a lead in phase of Peginterferon monotherapy for 24 weeks prior to combination therapy 
2. Evaluating the effect of peginterferon and Tenofovir combination therapy on other parameters of viral suppression including 
3. HBV DNA non-detectability, reduction from baseline, and sustained reduction in HBV DNA over the course of the study.
4. HBeAg loss, Anti-HBe seroconversion and reduction in HBeAg titres from baseline
5. HBsAg loss, HBsAb seroconversion and reduction in HBsAg titres from baseline
6. ALT normalization
7. To determine which baseline and on therapy markers may be used to predict clinical and virological outcomes including quantitative HBeAg and HBsAg titres, HBV viral load, ALT and HBV genotype

In addition a sub Immunological Study will be conducted at 2 of the study sites (Monash Medical Centre and St
Vincents Hospital Melbourne). Patients recruited at both sites will be invited to participate in smaller subcohort
study evaluating innate immune during the treatment and follow up periods to determine whether innate immune function can be used as a predictive marker of treatment induced HBsAg and HBeAg seroconversion.</summary>
