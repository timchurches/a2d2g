  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is comprised of nine sub-studies.  Eight of the sub-studies will investigate one L-amino acid as follows: i) L-isoleucine; ii) L-valine; iii) L-tyrosine; iv) L-methionine; v) L-lysine; vi) L-arginine; vii) L-cysteine; viii) L-phenylalanine. The ninth sub-study (ix) will investigate a comparison between L-isoleucine and L-leuine. Separate recruitment will be conducted for each sub-study.

Gastric emptying (measured by 2D ultrasound and breath testing), blood glucose, gut hormones release, insulin concentrations, appetite perceptions (measured by Visual Analogue Scales, VAS) and energy intake during a buffet meal, will be measured in each sub-study. 

Subjects enrolled in each sub-study i) to viii) will receive, in randomized, double-blind fashion, an intragastric bolus infusion (200mls) of i) 5g L-amino acid; ii) 10g L-amino acid; iii) saline (control). Those enrolled in study ix) will receive in randomized, double-blind fashion, an intragastric bolus infusion (200mls) of i) 5g L-isoleucine; ii) 5g L-leucine; iii) saline (control). Subjects will receive one infusion per visit. Study visits will be separated by 3-7 days.

For each study visit a baseline blood sample, VAS, ultrasound, and breath sample will be taken (t = -20). At t = -17 min the infusion will be administered over 2 minutes using a feeding tube. At t = -2 min a further VAS and ultrasound will be taken. At t = -1 min, subjects will consume, within 1 minute, a mixed-nutrient drink (Ensure, 400 kcal, 300 ml) labeled with 150 mg of 13C-acetate for measurement of gastric emptying by breath sampling. Blood samples, VAS and ultrasound measurements will be taken every 15 minutes over the next hour (t = 0 to 60 min). Breath samples will be taken every 5 minutes from t = 0 to 60 min. 

At t = 60 min, subjects will be presented with a cold, buffet-style meal. Subjects will be allowed 30 minutes to freely consume the buffet meal until comfortably full. At t = 90 min a final blood sample will be taken, and VAS administered.</interventions>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 40-60 minute screening visit. A questionnaire is answered by the volunteer, and based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, eligibility is determined. A signed informed consent is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised treatment for each study visit. Randomisation involves contacting the holder (study assistant) of the randomisation table to inform them of the next subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocationg a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution on each study day. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally and is associated with serious co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. Once adipose tissue has been accumulated, and food intake is limited by low calorie diets, counter-regulatory mechanisms induce an increase in appetite and a decrease in energy expenditure, which makes weight loss very difficult to maintain. To combat the global burden of obesity and its co-morbidities, a major challenge lies in the development of effective therapies that increase fullness and satiety, and result in good blood glucose control, while lacking adverse effects that are often associated with current therapies. 

There is increasing evidence that nutrient stimuli in the gastrointestinal tract play a central role in the control of energy intake and blood glucose. Proteins, and their building blocks, amino acids, are of interest, since high-protein diets are very effective for weight loss, particularly loss of fat, rather than muscle mass, and for improving postprandial glycaemic control, in obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. There is some evidence that a number of amino acids (including those to be studied) may also have effects on energy intake, blood glucose and gut function in humans. Thus, they are of special interest in terms of potential therapeutic approaches for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

This study will investigate the dose-related effects of intragastric administration of specific L-amino acids on gastric emptying, gut hormone release, glycaemic control, appetite perceptions and energy intake in healthy, normal weight and overweight or obese type 2 diabetic patients.  </summary>
