  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the treatment condition will receive Sleep Restriction Therapy based on principles of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia. Treatment will be provided by a Psychologist, Clinical Psychologist, or Provisional Psychologist at the Child and Adolescent Sleep Clinic (Flinders University). Sleep Restriction Therapy involves reducing time-in-bed to 30 minutes less than the usual average total sleep time. This will be achieved by shifting the child's usual bed time later by 30 minutes. Child participants and their parent/guardian will attend two therapy sessions (one week apart, 1 hour on each occasion) and will implement their given schedule for a period of two weeks. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored using a 7-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy</interventions>
    <comparator>Control participants will undergo Bedtime Regularisation. Child participants and their parent/guardian will attend two therapy sessions (one week apart, 1 hour on each occasion). Treatment will be provided by a Psychologist, Clinical Psychologist, or Provisional Psychologist. Participants will receive psycho-education (e.g., information about sleep architecture, REM sleep, circadian rhythms) and implement a regular and consistent bedtime schedule. This will be achieved by calculating their average time-in-bed across the baseline week, and then planning a schedule that involves being in bed for that amount of time each night (using a bed time and rise time that works for their household). This schedule will be implemented for a period of two weeks. Adherence to the planned sleep schedule will be monitored using a 7-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Linear mixed model regressions (LMMRs) will be used to assess if the self-reported anxiety scores of children in the treatment group show a greater reduction compared to children in the control group (interaction effect). LMMRs will also be used to assess for greater changes in REM sleep for the treatment group compared to the controls (interaction effect for more continuous REM sleep in the treatment condition).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether changes in REM sleep stability (during treatment for insomnia) can account for reductions in anxiety in primary school-aged children. Compared to children in the control group, we expect children in the treatment group to show improvements in sleep, anxiety and REM sleep stability..</summary>
