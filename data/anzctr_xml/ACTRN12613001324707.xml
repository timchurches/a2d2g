  <interventions>
    <interventions>Critically ill patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this group will receive  heparin infusion, based on weight (if body weight &lt;50 kg: 8 000 units/24 hours; if body weight comprised between 50 and 70 kg: heparin 10 000 units /24 hours; if body weight &gt;70 kg: 12 000 units/ 24 hours) in absence of any indication for full systemic anticoagulation, and in absence of bleeding. If the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) is higher than 45, the heparin will be withhold until the APTT is equal or less than 45seconds. The APTT is monitored 6 hourly. The intervention will last until the ECMO is removed</interventions>
    <comparator>Critically ill patients undergoing extra corporeal membrane oxygenation usually receive full systemic anti coagulation with infusion of heparin over 24 hours, unless the patient is bleeding. The dose of heparin is variable between patients and is based on an APTT comprised between 50 and 70 seconds. This treatment is given over the ECMO course.
This control group is standard practice where the study is going to be conducted.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in intensive care unit (ICU) is a rescue therapy for reversible cardiac and/or respiratory failures. It can also provide support until cardiac or lung transplantation. Haemorrhagic complications are the most frequent of the complications occurring on ECMO, and they have been shown to independently impact on patients prognosis. Although some of the haemorrhagic complications may be related to patient severity or patient disease, improving anticoagulation management may prevent some bleeding events and improve patient outcome.
The primary aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of administrating low dose anti coagulation in critically ill patients on ECMO when there is no indication for full systemic anticoagulation
We will randomise 20 patients so that 10 will receive low dose heparin and compare their complications and outcomes to the other 10 patients treated with the standard dose of heparin.</summary>
