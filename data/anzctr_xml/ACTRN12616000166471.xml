  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study involves patients scheduled for elective caesarean section under spinal (group 1) and general anaesthesia (group 2). All of the patients will be managed by the standard, routine spinal and general anaesthesia methods and will be monitored by the standard methods (pulse oximetry, ECG electrodes, non-invasive blood pressure). After clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord, 10 I.U. of synthetic oxytocin (the dose of oxytocin requested by the obstetrician due to the low uterine tone intraoperatively) will be given intravenously as a bolus and 10 I.U. of oxytocin will be given as an infusion through 3 minutes in all of the patients. Any changes in oxygen saturation after intravenous application of oxytocin, as well as the changes in pulse and mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>Concerning the reduction of the bleeding of the uterus during caesarean section by administering oxytocin intravenously, both groups of patients (those undergoing elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia (group 1) and those undergoing elective caesarean section under general anaesthesia (group 2)) are treated the same: 10 I.U. of oxytocin intravenously as a bolus and 10 I.U. of oxytocin in infusion. Oxygen saturation, MAP and pulse are being compared between the two groups. Each group of patients implies standard treatment because both spinal and general anaesthesia are considered as legitimate and standard methods of providing anaesthesia for caesarean section, as well as the doses of oxytocin given to both groups. The two groups are mutually compared as the goal of the study is to quantify the potential impact of oxytocin on lung haemodynamics and consequently on oxygen saturation in both groups, as well as the possible difference in oxygen saturation between the two groups.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using MedCalc Software version 12.1.3. (Mariakerke, Belgium). X2 test will be used to compare categorical variables. Numerical variables will be tested for the normality of distribution using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and presented as mean +/- standard deviation or median (interquartile range) as appropriate. t test will be used to compare normally distributed variables, while nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test to compare data that will not meet normal distribution. A P value &lt;0.05 will be considered as significant. The sample size was calculated due to difference of means and standard deviations with alpha 0.05 (type I error) and beta 0.20 (type II error). For the study to have 90% power at P&lt;0.05, a sample of 35 patients per group was required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intravenous application of synthetic oxytocin after caesarean section delivery and umbilical cord transection is a common and widely accepted method for reducing postpartal bleeding and prevention of uterine atony. There are numerous clinical studies which have proven that after intravenous oxytocin application, due to the vasodilation effect, reducement in peripheral resistence occurs and mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreases. In response to those changes, compensatory tachycardia occurs and stroke volume of the heart increases. Although the impact of oxytocin on systemic circulation is known for decades, there is not much knowledge about the impact of oxytocin on lung haemodynamic and gas exchange. Due to our clinical observations, we decided to examine the impact of oxytocin on arterial oxygen saturation in caesarean section patients and to determine the possible difference in arterial oxygen saturation between general and spinal anaesthesia after intravenous application of oxytocin.</summary>
