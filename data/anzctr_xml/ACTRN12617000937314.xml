    <interventions>Denosumab plus immobilisation.
Denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously will be administered at baseline and then again after six months if clinical evidence of inflammation persists.
The immobilisation device (e.g. total contact cast, Aircast boot) will be applied by an appropriately qualified medical professional at the participant's recruitment site. Standard care and follow up of participants, including management of immobilisation, will be provided by the recruitment site. Immobilisation will be continued until resolution of acute Charcot neuropathic osteoarthropathy (CN).</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This study is adequately powered to detect baseline differences in estimated bone mineral density (BMD) using calcaneal quantitative ultrasound comparing the acute CN foot to the contralateral foot. Using the standard deviation and effect size published by Sinacore et al (2008) and Petrova &amp; Edmonds (2010), 35 and 24 participants respectively would be needed to have an 80% chance of detecting a baseline difference in estimated BMD at the two-sided 5% significance level. 

No previous studies have monitored calcaneal quantitative ultrasound parameters in acute CN during treatment with an antiresorptive drug. Calculated from our unpublished data in people with diabetes, this study will have an 80% chance of detecting a difference in BUA of 17.1 db/MHz at the two-sided 5% significance level. Of note, Pitocco et al (2005) found BMD using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry significantly increased in the acute CN foot of 11 participants after 6 months of oral bisphosphonate therapy.

Data will be collated using Microsoft Excel. Descriptive data will include medians, means and standard deviations. Data analysis will otherwise be performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CAL, USA) software. Differences between groups will be analysed with t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Correlations will be analysed using multiple linear regression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Charcot foot affects patients with decreased nerve function in their feet, most often due to diabetes, and leads to significant bone deformity. The resulting deformity increases the risk of ulcers, infection and amputation. However, if detected early, this process may be prevented. Standard treatment currently involves using a cast or boot to minimise movement in the foot until inflammation resolves. We will investigate whether the addition of denosumab, a medication currently used for treating osteoporosis, reduces inflammation and bone loss in the foot. Bone loss will be monitored during treatment using a heel ultrasound machine. The potential clinical benefits may include a reduction in the length of time that a cast or boot is required, and reduction in the severity of bone deformity.</summary>
