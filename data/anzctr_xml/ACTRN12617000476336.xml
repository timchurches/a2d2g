  <interventions>
    <interventions>Antenatal corticosteroids (Dexamethasone IM)

The drug regimen for this trial is aligned with the WHO recommendations on use of antenatal corticosteroids. The intervention regimen will be:
 - A single course of 6mg dexamethasone by intramuscular injection, administered every 12 hours, to a total of four (4) doses (time points 0 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours and 36 hours)
 - If the full regimen is completed, the woman would have received a total of 24mg in divided doses
 - If a woman has not delivered within 7 completed days after completion of the first course, is re-assessed as eligible (if the gestational age is still less than 34 weeks), and a subsequent clinical assessment demonstrates that birth is planned or expected in the next 48 hours, a second course according to the regimen described above will be administered. Hence, the use of a repeat course in eligible women shall be the same as the initial allocation (i.e. women initially randomized to dexamethasone will only receive dexamethasone as repeat course).

No further repeat courses will be used (i.e. a maximum of two courses per participant).

Adherence will be monitored through documenting number of injections administered to each participant. </interventions>
    <comparator>Identical placebo (normal saline), administered according to the same regimen as for dexamethasone, with one injection every 12 hours to a total of four doses.

- If a woman has not delivered within 7 completed days after completion of the first course, is re-assessed as eligible (if the gestational age is still less than 34 weeks), and a subsequent clinical assessment demonstrates that birth is planned or expected in the next 48 hours, a second course according to the regimen described above will be administered. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The assignment schedule will be stored at WHO. Allocation concealment will be achieved by having identical treatment packs (i.e. intervention and control are in identical packaging) assembled in containers delivered to study centres. At time of randomization, study staff will take the next sequentially numbered pack from the box. The container is designed to ensure that packs are taken sequentially.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be generated by the study data manager/programmer. The study statistician and WHO project manager will liaise with the study pack packaging company, to ensure that intervention and control packs are absolutely identical and their sequence is according to the randomization sequence. Boxes of study packs will be sent directly to participating centres. 

Local investigators and research teams will conduct the allocation. Once eligibility is confirmed and consent obtained, the next sequentially numbered pack will be pulled by the research assistant from the box containing the study packs and administered according to 
study procedures. 

Participating centres will pilot study activities before commencement of screening and recruitment.

In this trial, some women will be randomized and complete the assigned course, but will not deliver. When they re-present to the facility, they will be re-assessed for eligibility for a repeat course. This repeat treatment will be according to the initial allocation. Blinding will be ensured, while maintaining the initial allocation.

    <statisticalmethods>A total of about 5,416 women are needed to detect a reduction of 15% or more from a 25% deaths to 21.3%, among neonates from women who were administered ACS at &lt;34 weeks, in a two-sided 5% significant test with 90% power. With 10% loss to follow-up, about 6,018 women will have to be recruited. 

The primary analysis will be based on all participants with outcome data available. Any participants with protocol violations, including women who no longer wish to receive their allocated intervention but are prepared to have data collected, will be analyzed in the group to which they were allocated (intention- to-treat strategy). We also plan to conduct a secondary per-protocol analysis. It is expected that few patients will cross over or be lost to follow up, hence it is expected that these two analyses will likely closely agree. </statisticalmethods>
