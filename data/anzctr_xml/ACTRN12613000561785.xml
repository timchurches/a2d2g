  <interventions>
    <interventions>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).

rTMS will be administered using the Magventure Magpro or NeuroStar TMS Therapy System (Neuronetics Inc). Prior to the administration of rTMS, each participants resting motor threshold (RMT) will be determined according to standard published methods.

Participants will undergo a total of 20 treatments, daily (mon-fri) for 4 weeks. In each treatment, participants will receive 75 trains of 4 second duration with a frequency of 10 Hz. Stimulation intensity will be set at 120% RMT and will applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 

The above protocol is in compliance with current published rTMS safety guidelines.

Participants will undergo an assessment at baseline, at the end of weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, and at a subsequent one -month follow-up. The clinical outcome of rTMS treatments will be determined through these assessments.

    <comparator>Participants allocated to the sham condition will be administered sham rTMS that will be identical to the active condition (described above) except no stimulation will be applied. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>40 participants with fibromyalgia will be recruited into the trial. As we are expecting that our DLPFC rTMS treatment course will result in a significant change in clinical outcomes (effect sizes of reduced pain intensity, secondary pain outcomes and quality of life reported by  Mhalla and colleagues (2011) were generally around d = 0.80) we are predicting at least a moderate to large effect size. Therefore, our chosen sample size should provide power of 90% to detect (a = .05, two-tailed) moderate to large effect sizes (f = 0.50), while allowing for a drop-out rate of 15-20%, in a repeated measures ANOVA.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, is an approved treatment option for patients with depression in the Canada and several EU nations, with significant evidence demonstrating greater clinical outcomes following longer treatment courses. For patients with fibromyalgia, studies suggest rTMS may also offer a novel treatment approach for pain relief. However these effects are short-lasting thereby limiting its clinical application. Yet no studies to date have explored the effects of a treatment course of similar duration to that used in depression. In addition, there is a dearth of literature exploring target sites other than the motor cortex, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); a brain region directly implicated in the control of pain perception. In the proposed world-first study, we will carry-out a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the use of an rTMS treatment course applied to the DLPFC in patients who suffer from fibromyalgia. To do so, we will recruit a total of 40 patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia who will undergo a blind 4-week acute rTMS daily treatment course. We expect our proposed treatment course of rTMS to the DLPFC in patients with fibromyalgia will provide a model for an interventional treatment course that may be extended to other pain syndromes. Thereby reducing dependence on pharmaceutical treatments in patients who suffer from chronic pain and increasing quality of life for the millions of chronic pain sufferer's worldwide.</summary>
