  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 26 patients receiving standard rehabilitation together with Music Therapy intervention who will be compared with 26 patients receiving only standard rehabilitation as usual.   Each standard occupational therapy session will last for up to 60 minutes, out of which up to 30 minutes will be focused on upper limb rehabilitation. The music therapy intervention will have up to 30 minutes therapy session and is provided daily by a board certified music therapist for a duration of 10 sessions (exclude weekends and public holidays). The components of the intervention include music rhythmic stimulation with movement exercises directed by occupational therapis simultaneously. The exercise is 
sequential flexion-extension of elbow movements of one arm.

All subjects in the study will received individualised therapy.  All subjects in either condition will receive up to 60-minute intervention daily for a duration of 10 sessions (exclude weekends and public holidays). The follow-up will be 3 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>For control group: All subjects in the control group will receive up to 60-minute of standard OT session, out of which up to 30 minutes will comprise of upper limb exercise which is individually designed based on individual impairment and needs.  Subjects receive individualized therapy in SGH Inpatient Rehabilitation Wards.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). The ARAT is used to determine upper limb function .  It is an observational test that is designed to assess recovery in the upper limb following cortical damage. The test consists of 19 items with each item rated on a 4-point scale with "0" indicating no movement possible and "3" indicating movement performed normally.  The total score on the ARAT ranges from 0 to 57, with the lowest score indicating that no movements can be performed, and the upper score indicating normal performance. Thus, higher scores will indicate better performance</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fugyl Meyer Assessment (FMA). It is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. FMA is comprised of five domains, including (1) Motor functioning (in the upper and lower extremities), (2) Sensory functioning, (3) Balance, (4) Joint range of motion and (5) Joint pain. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery and to plan and assess treatment.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Jebson-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT). It was designed to provide a short, objective test of hand functions commonly used in activities of daily living. The test items include a range of fine motor, weighted and non-weighted hand function activities which are timed: (1) writing (copying) a 24-letter sentence, (2) turning over 3 x 5? cards, (3) picking up small common objects such as a paper clip, bottle cap and coin (4) simulated feeding using a teaspoon and five kidney beans, (5) stacking checkers, (6) picking up large light objects (empty tin can) and (7) picking up large heavy objects (full tin can x 1 lb). There is a choice of 4 pre-written sentences for the writing subtest so that a different sentence can be selected for each re-test with the same patient.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale (PRPS). The PRPS is a clinician-rated 6-point Likert-type item measuring patient participation in inpatient rehabilitation sessions. Patients will be rated based on observations by therapist and study investigators on a scale of 1 (none) to 6 (excellent).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements taken at commencement and end of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Motor Activity Log (MAL). It is a 30-item structured interview intended to examine how much and how well the patients use their more-affected arm outside of the laboratory setting. Patients are asked standardized questions about the amount of use of their more-affected arm (Amount Scale: 0 representing 'not used'  to 5 representing 'same as pre-stroke') and the quality of their movement (How Well Scale: 0 representing 'not used' to 5 representing 'normal') during the functional activities indicated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements taken at commencement and end of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time taken for completion of specified task will be recorded by using a stopwatch and time will be recorded in seconds. The timed task will involve coordination of multiple upper limb joint movements for task performance. In the specified task, participant will reach out to pick up a block and place on the designated location, this will be repeated 8 times. Shorter time taken, will indicate better upper limb coordination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements taken at commencement and end of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a 14-item scale, with seven items measuring anxiety (HADS-A) and seven measuring depression (HADS-D).  Each item is on a 4-point ordinal scale with "0" indicating least frequency occurrence versus "3" which indicates highest frequency of occurrence. The scores range from 0-21 for each scale with higher scores indicating more distress.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual analog mood scale (The Faces Scale, Andrews &amp; Withey, 1976). The Faces scale consists of seven faces that progress from a smilling face to a frowning face, and participants will circle the face that closest to expressing how they feel.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing rehabilitation due to neurological diseases such as stroke, Parkinsons disease, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury are often faced with significant physical and psychological stressors.  Patients are often inattentive and not motivated during therapy sessions. Music therapy (MT), which is the clinical use of music interventions within a therapeutic relationship, has been shown to be of benefit to patients with neurological diseases in rehabilitation setting. The data on mood, attention and motivation level of patients undergoing rehabilitation in the neurology rehabilitation ward is, however, limited especially where music therapist is involved. Hence this pilot study aims to investigate the effectiveness of rhythmic stimulation on upper limb function and mood of stroke patients with undergoing rehabilitation in the inpatient neurology rehabilitation ward.  The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 26 patients receiving standard rehabilitation together with MT intervention who will be compared with 26 patients receiving only standard rehabilitation as usual.  The null hypotheses being tested are that there will be no significant differences in upper limb function, mood and participation level in ARAT, HADS, visual analog mood scale (Faces Scale, Andrews &amp; Withey, 1976), and PRPS between the two groups of patients. The inclusion criteria for participation in the study include persons diagnosed either with ischaemic or haemorrhagic acute stroke undergoing daily occupation therapy for 10 sessions (exclude weekends and public holidays).  Each standard occupational therapy session will last for up to 60 minutes, out of which up to 30 minutes will be focused on upper limb rehabilitation. The music therapy intervention will have up to 30 minutes therapy session and is provided daily by a board certified music therapist for a duration of 10 sessions (exclude weekends and public holidays). The components of the intervention include music rhythmic stimulation with movement exercises directed by occupational therapist.</summary>
