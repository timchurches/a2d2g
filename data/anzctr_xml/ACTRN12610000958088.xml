  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spirulina platensis, a cynobacterium used frequently as a dietary supplement had been found to exhibit many immune-stimulating and antiviral activities. It had been found to activate macrophages, NK cells, T cells, B cells, and to stimulate the production of Interferon gamma and other cytokines. Natural substances isolated from Spirulina platensis had been found to be a potent inhibitor against several enveloped viruses by blocking viral absorption/penetration and some virus replication stages after penetration into cells. 
We aimed to study whether this dietary supplement possesses any therapeutically feasible activity worthy of further larger controlled clinical evaluation, and is there any place to use it in the management of hepatitis C virus infection.</summary>
