    <studytitle>Parecoxib, celecoxib and paracetamol for pain management following caesarean delivery</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In women receiving spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section, is there a difference in the opioid dose-sparing, analgesic efficacy and quality of post-operative pain relief provided by multimodal postoperative analgesic regimens based on patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with pethidine, together with either placebo, cyclo-oxygenase 2 enzyme (COX-2) inhibitors, paracetamol or COX-2 inhibitors and paracetamol in combination.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>All women will receive patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with pethidine (20 mg bolus, 15 minute lock-out, no background) and either:
1) placebo (intravenous normal saline 2 ml &amp; normal saline 200 ml intra-operatively;  oral placebo capsules - 2 capsules at 6 and 18 hours postoperatively &amp; 4 capsules at 12 hours postoperatively)
2) cyclo-oxygenase 2 enzyme (COX-2) inhibitors (intravenous parecoxib 40 mg in 2 ml normal saline and placebo [normal saline 200 ml] intra-operatively; post-operatively, oral celecoxib 400 mg  [2 x 200 mg capsules] at 12 hours postoperatively and 2 placebo capsules PO at 6, 12 and 18 hours)
3) intravenous paracetamol 2 g in 200 ml normal saline and intravenous normal saline 2 ml intra-operatively; post-operatively, oral paracetamol 1 g [2 x 500 mg capsules] at 6, 12 and 18 hours and 2 additional placebo capsules at 12 hours
4) COX-2 inhibitors and paracetamol in combination (intravenous parecoxib 40 mg in 2 ml normal saline and paracetamol 2 g in 200 ml normal saline intra-operatively; post-operatively, oral paracetamol 1 g [2 x 500 mg capsules] at 6, 12 and 18 hours and oral celecoxib 400 mg [2 x 200 mg capsules] at 12 hours)
Intra-operative drugs will be given after delivery.  All women will have access to rescue analgesia - immediate release oral tramadol 100 mg 2 hourly (maximum 600 mg in 24 hours).
The placebo capsules are cornstarch in a gelatin capsule.
The paracetamol 2 g in 200 ml normal saline or the placebo equivalent of 200 ml normal saline will be infused over 15 minutes.
The parecoxib 40 mg in 2 ml normal saline  or the placebo equivalent of 2 ml normal saline will be given as a bolus.</interventions>

    <concealment>Women will be recruited at antenatal pre-admission caesarean section clinics, from the maternal-fetal assessment unit, labour and birthing unit or the hospital antenatal ward.  All women must have consented to combined spinal epidural anaesthesia and informed consent for the study will be obtained.  Randomisation and allocation will be performed by the hospital pharmacy department, with women being allocated to 1 of 4 groups. All study drugs will be prepared in blinded fashion and using identical placebos to active drug, by the hospital  pharmacy.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>An intention to treat analysis Continuous data were summarised using median, interquartile range (IQR) and range (R) and categorical data using frequency distributions.  Univariate comparisons of continuous outcomes between treatment groups were conducted using Kruskal-Wallis tests.  Pair-wise comparisons between control and treatment groups were made with an overall family-wise type 1 error controlled at alpha 0.05. The Chi-square test was used for comparisons of categorical outcomes.  Area under the curve (AUC) for rest and movement pain to 24 hours was calculated using the trapezium rule; missing data at some time points were imputed by carrying the last observation forward. P-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  The analysis was performed by an author (EAN) using SPSS 18.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and StatXact 8.0, Cytel Inc, 2007.</statisticalmethods>
