    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With a Varicella Vaccine Response - Vaccine response defined for initially seropositive subjects as having an antibody titer at 8 months post-transplantation &gt;4 fold the pre-vaccination antibody titer.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Any Solicited Local Adverse Events - Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) - An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 AE = an AE which prevented normal, everyday activities. Related = AE assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the 43-day follow-up period after each vaccination</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
