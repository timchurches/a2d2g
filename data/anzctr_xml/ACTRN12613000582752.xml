  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether providing a single high dose of vitamin D using in conjunction with standard treatment (including antibiotics) improves outcomes in adults hospitalised with pneumonia. The main hypothesis is that outcomes will be improved in those taking vitamin D compared to those who are given a placebo.</summary>
