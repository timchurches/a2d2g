    <studytitle>The effect of running shoe design on comfort and injury rates in recreational runners</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised controlled trial to compare comfort and injury rates in recreational runners with normal foot type wearing motion control running shoes versus barefoot running shoes versus their own running shoes. </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm1: Participants will receive a pair of dual density running shoes. The ASICS (Registered Trademark) GEL-1100 (Trademark) series shoe provided is a motion control shoe that provides cushioning and stability.
Arm2: Participants will receive a pair of barefoot running shoes. The Vibram FiveFingers (Registered Trademark) Sprint model provided has a polyamide fabric upper and performance rubber sole.

Participants being issued with a new pair of footwear will be given a two week adjustment period to adapt to the new footwear prior to beginning the study. Participants will be asked to wear the shoes for some or all of their weekly running sessions if they are comfortable doing so.

Study duration is 6 months and participants will complete surveys at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. 

Adherence will be monitored via the surveys. Questions include how many times per week the footwear was used, percentage of training completed in the footwear, and details of training (type, distance, surface)</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Regular recreational runners will be recruited by advertisement. Interested participants will be questioned regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the initial telephone contact and then screened for foot type and other exclusion criteria at the initial appointment. Subjects will be randomised into one of two intervention groups or a control group . Randomisation will be stratified using history of running injury, gender and mileage to ensure similar groups from baseline. Allocation concealment will be used to prevent selection bias. Allocation will be by  contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was “off-site”.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be via a software randomisation function</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Fifty participants will be allocated to each group. We based the a priori sample size calculations on a minimal important difference of 10.2mm on a 100mm visual analogue scale for comfort (Mills et al., 2010). Assuming a standard deviation of 20 mm, a power of 0.80, and an a level of 0.05, we require 37 participants in each group. We increased the sample size by approximately 20%, in each group, to allow for loss to follow up. This has been rounded up to 50.</statisticalmethods>
