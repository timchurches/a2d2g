    <inclusivecriteria>These criteria reflect the evidence that pre-eclampsia is more than hypertension and
        proteinuria, particularly at onset:

          -  Hypertension. sBP &gt;140mmHg and/or dBP &gt;90mmHg, twice, &gt;4h apart after 20 weeks'
             gestation. sBP will be included to reflect international guidelines.

          -  Proteinuria. 24h urinary protein &gt;0.3g/d3, or in the absence of a 24h urine
             collection: &gt;2+ dipstick proteinuria after 20wk or a random protein:creatinine ratio
             &gt;30mg protein/mmol creatinine106-108.

          -  HELLP syndrome that is non-hypertensive and non-proteinuric, using Sibai's
             criteria109,

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At present, the management of pre-eclampsia is guided by expert opinions that are not
      well-based on firm evidence. What is required is a clinical tool that can accurately
      determine a women's risk for adverse outcomes, and thereby reduce the risk for women while
      safely prolonging pregnancies remote from term (to improve fetal outcomes). This research
      project, 'a severity score for pre-eclampsia,' will develop such a clinical tool that is
      specific to the condition. This severity score will be used clinically (to guide management)
      and in research (in both clinical trials and basic science research), and will provide an
      evidence base on which to build future practice, improving outcomes for pregnant women and
      their babies. In addition, this project is part of a three part strategy to better understand
      the mechanisms of disease in pre-eclampsia and to investigate a potential disease-modifying
      therapy, namely, recombinant human activated protein C.</summary>
