  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 6-month resistance training program that will consist of three 1-hour sessions every week. Ten multi-joint exercises will performed at each session and and a trainer to particiant ratio of 1:2 will be maintained. This will ensure that the particiants lifting technique is correct and  the appropriate feedback and encouragement is received.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To improve self-concept.
This will be measured via questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-months into intervention, after the intervention (6-months) and at follow-up (12-months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To improve body composition.
This will be assessed via Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and also anthropometric measures such as skinfolds and girths. This will allow percent body fat and lean body mass to be assessed.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To improve strength.
This will be assessed using one-repetition maximum testing for bench and leg press.</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants are classed as &lt; Tanner stage 2.
Participants are categorised as a high risk by the Sports Medicine Australia pre-exercise screening questionnaire and do not obtain a medical clearance.
Participants have current or have had previous injuries which would prevent them from participating in resistance training (e.g. knee reconstruction).
Participants exhibit musculoskeletal conditions which would place them at risk as a result resistance training (e.g. severe scoliosis).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Participants were staggered into the study. Upon completing baseline testing each participant was assigned a number (e.g. first participant to complete basleine testing was assigned number 1 etc.). Each number had already been randomly assigned with a group allocation which was revealed to the participant (and the Principal investigator) after baseline testing was complete.</concealment>
    <sequence>Before recruitment began an impartial individual, using a random number genererator, produced a random list of group allocation for a possible 70 participants (i.e. each number was assigned as a 1 or 0 with 1 = intervention and 0 = control). Each group allocation was written on a piece of paper and concealed inside a non-transparent envelope which was sealed and the corresponding participant number written on the outside. The principal investigator only opened each envelope when a participant completed baseline testing and was assigned a randomisation number. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Random effects mixed modelling was used to assess the effect of the intervention and analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis.
Per protocol regression analysis was also performed to determine whether training attendance had an effect on each outcome.
Mediation analysis was also run with strength and body composition outcomes as the independent variables, exercise self-efficacy, physical self-worth and self-esteem as the dependent variables and training attendance as the mediator.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether participating in a 6-month strength training program can improve the strength, body shape and self-esteem of teenage boys. 
It is anticipated that at completion of the 6-month strength training program participants who took part in the intervention will show greater improvements in their self-esteem, strength and body shape relative to those participants who did not take part in the intervention.</summary>
