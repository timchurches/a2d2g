  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three breakfast meals that differ in glycaemic load (GL) and dairy composition.
Meal 1 (GL ~ 36/low dairy) - 70g white bread, 10g margarine, 10g vegemite (or 30g diet jam), 200ml sweetened fruit drink, 100ml water
Meal 2 (GL ~ 27/medium dairy) - 35g white bread, 100g yoghurt, 20g cheese, 5g vegemite (or 15g diet jam), 100ml sweetened fruit drink, 100ml water
Meal 3 (GL ~ 21/high dairy) - 35g white bread, 100g yoghurt, 20g cheese, 5g vegemite (or 15g jam), 100ml reduced fat milk, 100ml water.
Food and beverage intake is not controlled for other meals, however there is an overnight 'wash-out' period between interventions.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine the effect of dairy consumption on satiety and certain aspects of cognition (speed of processing, short term memory, working memory, attention and speed of reasoning) in a sample of primary school children aged 10-12 years.   
Primary outcome measures are post prandial glucose levels, satiety and cognitive functioning.  
It is hypothesized that  meals with a lower glycaemic load and higher dairy composition will be associated with improvements in measures of cognitive function and satiety compared to a meal high in glycaemic load and containing no dairy food.</summary>
