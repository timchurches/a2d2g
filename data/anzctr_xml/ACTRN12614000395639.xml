  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised controlled trial will determine the benefit of comprehensive lifestyle changes in a sample of New Zealanders with common chronic diseases. Participants will have raised body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 or BMI greater than or equal to 25 and either ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes). Participants who are assigned to the intervention group will participate in a programme of lifestyle change (incorporating a low-fat pure vegetarian diet) for 3 months, and those assigned to the control group will receive their usual-care. 

A brief, standardised personality assessment will help identify any personality traits associated with adherence. This trial will evaluate the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention incorporating a low-fat, pure vegetarian diet for New Zealanders on a broad range of health determinants and risk factors. As far as we are aware it will be the first trial of such a lifestyle intervention outside of the USA. 

The intervention involves attendance of twice weekly evening sessions of 2.5 hour duration designed to enable participants to learn about the relation of food and nutrition to a range of diseases and recognized disease risk factors. These will include brief lectures, practical demonstrations, videos, cooking classes, and small group work. Participants will also be provided with educational materials, some food items, and some items of kitchen equipment in order to facilitate the lifestyle changes advocated in the intervention. They may be expected to complete some small assignments, recordings, or homework activities between evening sessions. This study intervention will differ significantly from lifestyle interventions previously studied by focusing on the how to rather than the why to. 

Ongoing adherence will be monitored through the use of food recall diaries monitored monthly for three months in the intervention group, then at months three and six after study initiation. Diet recall will be performed for the control group at study initiation and at six months after study initiation. 

Evening sessions will run for three months total, with an additional weekend together for an immersion in the lifestyle changes and team-building 2 weeks into the programme. The aim of the intervention is to help participant learn and teach one another how to make positive changes in their dietary (and other lifestyle) behaviours so that they can reduce risk of their established diseases progressing (potentially reversing these if related to lifestyle factors) and prevent developing new diseases. 

The lifestyle intervention will advocate a nutritionally complete dietary plan where participants follow a low-fat (10-15% calories from fat) plant-based diet. The diet includes every type of fruit, vegetable and grain. Whole grains are encouraged. Very high-fat plant-foods such as nuts, avocados, and olives are discouraged, as are highly-processed foods. Restricting use of sugar and salt will be encouraged as will minimizing or cessation of caffeine. The diet specifically excludes meat (of any kind, including chicken and fish), dairy (including cheese, yoghurt), and refined oils (such as canola, olive, or sunflower oil). Participants will be encouraged to eat until satiation from the foods included in the diet, without regard for total energy intake (i.e. not counting calories). A very small amount of B12 supplementation will be provided to all participants following this diet, to ensure adequate intake. 

Vitamin B12 supplementation will be provided at no cost to those in the intervention group, in the form of drops containing 50mcg per dose, which should be taken daily.

In summary, this study will be conducted by doctors providing participants (and when necessary their families) with an intervention in their community in the form of education on the management of chronic disease by dietary and lifestyle changes. Those conducting the study are also the main investigators.

Update Nov 2015, post initial study extension:
Participants and researchers have agreed to continue approximately 6 further intervention sessions from November 2015 to February 2016, for the participants of both the first randomised group (who are at month 15 of the research) of participants, and the second non-randomised group (who are at month 8 of the research). These sessions will be further meetings of approximately 2 hours length in which we will discuss sustaining the lifestyle changes and providing further support to participants. The participants will each be provided with a cookbook; Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease cookbook, or Happy Herbivore Light and Lean. The Ethics Committee has been informed of these minor additions to the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment was provided for the control group during the first 6 months of the programme, under the usual care provided by general practitioners.

After the initial intervention was offered to the lifestyle change group, significant differences from baseline were seen from preliminary analysis. This included primary end points. As such, the control group was offered to undertake the lifestyle intervention starting April 14th 2015. 

The ethics committee that granted original approval was updated prior to the start of this second stage of the intervention and granted approval for the extension of data collection (see data end points).</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants self-identify (with assistance from their GP) as willing to undergo a lifestyle change, and have a diagnosis of raised body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 or BMI greater than or equal to 25 and either ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes)

*Ischaemic heart disease: defined as a diagnosis of IHD confirmed by the patients GP as well as any one or more of the following: angina requiring medication; prior surgery including stents or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); a total cholesterol of &gt;6 pre-treatment with statins; or pre-treatment hypertension as defined by &gt;140 systolic, or &gt;90 diastolic. See exclusion criteria for more information.  

*Diabetes mellitus type II: defined as a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes confirmed by the patients GP as well as a previous diagnosis based upon findings consistent with the current New Zealand standards for type 2 diabetes: either both &gt;50mmol/mol HbA1c and symptoms, or two repeat tests three months apart &gt;50mmol/mol if no symptoms.

*Raised BMI: A current BMI greater than, or equal to 30kg/m2 is an entrance criteria in of itself, or participants can have a current BMI greater than or equal to 25kg/m2 and IHD or a BMI greater than or equal to 25kg/m2  and diabetes.

Patients must be able and willing to follow all instructions, including attending education sessions twice weekly (on Tuesday and Thursdays), must be able and willing to follow the intervention at home (i.e. be the primary cook, or have the primary cook of the household provide this food), and be aged between 35-70 years old. Participants must be willing to fill out a diet recall, undergo additional blood tests and measurements, and not adjust any additional supplements or remedies they may be taking during the study unless advised to do so by their GP or other doctors. Certain supplements may be stopped.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A brief synopsis of the study purpose, intended intervention, and outcome measures will be presented to local general practitioners (GPs). GPs will be informed of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants and invited to discuss the study briefly with their patients. Participants will be provided with an information sheet from their GP and an invitation to register their interest with the researchers. Participants will be asked to rate their self-efficacy, reflecting perceived ability to successfully undertake a lifestyle change. Answers will be compared to a standard deviation from previous studies for the self-efficacy scale. 

Once a patient has registered their interest, had their eligibility confirmed with their GP, and undergone the self-efficacy measure, patients will be invited to undergo further screening. Those who are eligible at this stage and remain interested in participating will then be contacted for an individual semi-structured interview, during which further information regarding their eligibility will be confirmed by a research assistant. Participants will at this point be asked to sign an information release form allowing the researchers to contact their GP to confirm any further details that may affect their eligibility. Once eligibility has been confirmed by the research team, patients will be invited to participate, and written consent sought.

Each will be randomised to either the intervention or control group by the physician co-researcher phoning the programme coordinator. Ultimately, this was done by listing participants by order of interview. Without providing identifying details to the public health physician, allocations were generated by computer programme and these were entered in by the research coordinator for each participant.

The GP of the participant will not be informed by the research team as to which group the participant is allocated in, but as this trial is not able to blind participants, the GP will be able to ask the participant directly. 

The participants in the intervention group will then be contacted to attend group sessions held twice weekly during evenings at the same venue. Control group members will be contacted for further participation as appropriate.

Update post study extension: 
After the initial lifestyle group competed the intervention, 10 individuals from the control group chose to participate in the next intervention. Those who were initially screened and interviewed but were unavailable to participate were offered an opportunity also and 11 form this group joined this group to make 21 participants. This group began the intervention on April 14th 2015.</concealment>
    <sequence>A public health physician co-researcher generated allocations using a 1:1 sequence from a computer programme. Married, partnered and related participants were randomised together in place of the first person (a total of 5 pairs were randomised). 

Stratification was not used, and allocations were not subsequently be changed.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our intervention aims to help patients learn and teach one another how to make positive changes in their dietary (and other lifestyle) behaviours. The intervention will advocate a nutritionally complete dietary plan where participants follow a low-fat plant-based diet.

We hypothesise that those who participate in the BROAD intervention will lose weight, improve their diabetes control and have an improved heart health and quality of life. </summary>
