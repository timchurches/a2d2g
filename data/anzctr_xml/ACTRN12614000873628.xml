    <concealment>Existing clinical records from the Lung Transplant Database will be screened to identify potentially eligible participants according to inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study.
Potentially eligible participants will be approached first by email or postal letter providing information about this trial, once consent is signed participants will be  allocated a unique ID that will be randomised to receive either placebo or fish oil.

    <sequence>*Randomisation tables and allocation schedules provided by study statistician, generated using statistical software (StatsDirect)
*Strata to history of previous lesion/s
*Anticipate 20-30 percent of participants with some history of skin cancer.  Allowed up to 100 with no history and 60 with history.
*Trial nurse/project officer confirms eligibility of consenting participant
-Participant details are recorded on the relevant allocation schedule according to skin cancer history status
-Patient ID and allocation code are written on a script by the trial clinician
-Study nurse takes the script to pharmacy
-Pharmacist matches allocation code to placebo/intervention using unblinded tables provided by trial statistician
-Bottles containing study drug, labelled with patient ID and allocation code, and handed back to the study nurse for dispensing to the participant

    <statisticalmethods>This study in N equals 100 participants (50 per group) is a pilot trial and is not designed to assess difference between treatment groups. The sample size is based on the total expected number of eligible and consenting lung transplant patients at The Prince Charles Hospital. It will allow estimation of consent, adherence and retention rates to within approximately 10 percentage points with 95percent confidence.

Primary analyses will be descriptive in line with the pilot aims to estimate parameters required to design a definitive study.  Eligibility, consent, adherence and retention proportions will be calculated overall and the latter two will be assessed by allocation arm.

Secondary analyses to compare the groups will be performed using logistic and linear regression as appropriate for the specified secondary outcomes using a complete case approach under the intention to treat principle.  No imputation will be undertaken. All analyses will be adjusted for the stratification criteria used in the randomisation schedule and for baseline values of the secondary outcome where available.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oil for the prevention of skin cancer in lung transplant recipients.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join the study if you are over 18 years of age, and are a lung transplant recipient for at least 1 year. 

Study details

Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take 4 x 1000mg oral capsule of omega-3 fish oil supplement daily for 12 months. Participants in the other group will take 4 x 1000mg of placebo (olive oil) daily for 12 months. Participants will not know which treatment they are taking until the end of the study.
All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires, blood tests and skin exams at baseline and at the end of the study at 12 months.
