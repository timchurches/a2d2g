    <summary>Phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics trial of the focal adhesion kinase
      (FAK) inhibitor PF-00562271 in patients with positive Positron Emission Tomography [PET]
      scans due to advanced non-hematologic malignancies, including pancreatic, head and neck, and
      prostatic neoplasms, and patients with other malignancies appropriate for serial biopsy.
      Screening consists of a Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography [FDG-PET] and tumor
      imaging, medical history, physical examination, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]
      performance status, blood draws, a pregnancy test for female patients of childbearing
      potential. Treatment consists of PF00562271 tablets continued until progression of disease,
      unacceptable toxicity, or patient request. Evaluations for bioactivity are measured by serial
      FDG-PET and blood tests for biomarkers related to FAK and PYK2 kinase activities.</summary>
