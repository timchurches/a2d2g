    <healthcondition>whether adefovir can prolong the disease-free survival and overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with HBV-DNA &gt;=10000 copies/ml</healthcondition>

    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>we give adefovir 10mg oral tablet, once a day to patients in treatment group.Overall duration of antivirus treatment is according to the guideline of chronic hepatitis B. The indicatons to stop antivirus treatment are as follows:1.to the patients with HBeAg(+), they should take medicine for 6-12 months after HBeAg(+) becoming HBeAg(-) and then can stop the antivirus treatment;2.to the patients with HBeAg(-), when HBV-DNA is undetectable for three times with a interval of 6 months,they can choose to stop treatment;3.to cirrhosis patients, we recommend taking antivirus treatment for whole life.</interventions>
    <comparator>we give no anti-virus treatment to patients in control group</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the prognosis of HCC patients treated by adefovir or not, defined by overall survival(OS) and disease free survival(DFS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>AFP,Ultrasound monthly and MRI or CT half a year for first 2 years post-surgery, then AFP,Ultrasound every 2 months and MRI or CT half a year up to 5 years post-surgery.HBV-DNA should be checked every 3 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the rate of HBV reactivation after liver resection and the change of liver function. The patients will check serum HBV-DNA every 3 months(in our hospital) and liver function every month(in the local hospital). If the HBV-DNA increases 10 times or become detectable, it means  virus reactivation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>to check liver function monthly in the first 2 years and every 2 months after 2 years and HBV-DNA every 3 months after liver resection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of our study is to see whether anti-virus drugs can improve the prognosis of liver cancer and reduce the viral reactivity. We supposed that adefovir can reduce the tumor recurrence and viral reactivity, prolong the overall survival of patients.</summary>
