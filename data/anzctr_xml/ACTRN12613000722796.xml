  <interventions>
    <interventions>Trauma survey include a rapid primary survey to immediately identify and manage life-threatening injuries followed by a head to toe secondary survey supplemented with diagnostic testing is the standard of care in trauma management. Tertiary survey had been introduced to identify injuries missed during the primary and secondary surveys performed in the resuscitation room, and includes a repeated head-to-toe examination and review of all laboratory and radiology studies, usually completed within 24 hours of admission. 
Once trauma call is activated, cardiothoracic surgery and emergency physiotherapists pagers are alerted
Senior cardiothoracic and senior emergency physiotherapists (Coordinators) screen patients and provide tertiary survey forms to allocated physiotherapists (assessors) in respective wards.
(For trauma admissions occurring overnight during the week and over the weekend, a senior physiotherapist will coordinate and screen any eligible trauma patients)
Within 24 hours, the assessors will inform the coordinators when ready to assess the patient.
Blinding:
If trauma team has already completed the tertiary survey, one of the coordinators will cover trauma teams tertiary survey with an opaque paper before assessor conducts tertiary survey on the patient. The patient will also be encouraged by the coordinator prior to the assessors tertiary survey, not to disclose what trauma team may have informed the patient after their tertiary survey.

Similarly, if the trauma team has not completed tertiary survey, the coordinator will inform the patient not to disclose assessors tertiary findings to the trauma team.

Once the assessors complete the tertiary survey assessment form, the forms will return to the coordinators
Coordinators then will document when the treating team has completed the tertiary survey form/photocopy treating team trauma survey

Physiotherapists and medical/trauma team who are conducting the tertiary survey will be blinded from each others tertiary survey as described above. However, pre tertiary survey information (results of initial work up, physical examination and radiologic studies that have been performed as part of primary/secondary surveys) will be available to both physiotherapists who are completing the tertiary survey and the medical/trauma team. This would be considered the norm for any patients having a tertiary survey.

Currently, when a treating physiotherapist identifies a missed injury, the physiotherapist would inform the treating team of such finding. Therefore, when an assessor prior to the trauma team has identified a missed injury, the coordinator will inform the trauma team of the findings.
	
For the purpose of this study, missed injury is defined as any injuries missed after primary and secondary surveys conducted within 24 hours of admission. This is the definitive assessment

    <statisticalmethods>To determine the sample size needed, a retrospective audit of trauma admissions in July 2013 was carried out (unpublished data). 104 patients were assessed and 10 injuries were identified as missed, corresponding to a prevalence of missed injuries of 10%, or a sensitivity of the Trauma team review to identify injuries of 90%. In order to demonstrate that the physiotherapist review would identify injuries with a clinically acceptable sensitivity of 95%, corresponding to a 5% increase in sensitivity, at a confidence interval of 0.1, a sample size of around 150 patients is needed
Analysis:
	The outcomes are compared using 2x2 table. This will have P group and T group as the diagnostic test, and the presence or absence of a missed injury as the pathology. A Chi-square test can be used to determine the sensitivity and specificity for assessments by Physiotherapists and Trauma team and whether there are any differences.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Any missed injuries in trauma can cause prolonged hospital stay due to change in medical/surgical therapy, immobilisation, increase morbidity and mortality and increase cost of care. 
Trauma patients are referred to the physiotherapist for acute rehabilitation and ongoing care in the community when discharged from hospital.

The aim of this study is to compare a medical tertiary survey and physiotherapy tertiary survey in identifying missed musculoskeletal extremity injuries after trauma admission.
The patient recruitment period will be 12 months. 
When the eligible trauma patient is recruited to the study, the assessing physiotherapist will perform a tertiary survey as a part of an initial assessment to a physiotherapy treatment. Tertiary survey filled out by the physiotherapist will be compared with the treating trauma team. There will be 2 outcome groups in this study. Patients whose tertiary survey performed by physiotherapists prior to the admitting trauma team will be in P group. Patients whose tertiary survey performed by admitting trauma team prior to physiotherapists will be in T group. 
The outcomes of this study are: 1. Number of missed musculoskeletal injuries identified by physiotherapist and admitting trauma team 2. Comparison of new or missed and types of musculoskeletal injuries identified by physiotherapists 3. Number of tertiary surveys completed by physiotherapists earlier than the admitting trauma team.
