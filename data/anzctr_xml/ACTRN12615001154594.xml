  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible and willing participants that are due to have arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements as part of their standard care will have transcutaneous monitors (either one or two SenTec monitoring devices) attached to their earlobe(s). Two separate SenTec devices are being assessed. Both can be tested in each participant (one per earlobe) or one per participant (one device tested on one earlobe). This will be determined by availability of devices (for example, if one device is being used in a separate study and unavailable at the time of recruitment, only one device will be assessed).  

A period of at least 30 minutes* will elapse to allow the device(s) to stabilise before the planned ABG is obtained  either by clinical staff or a study investigator. Readings on the transcutaneous monitors will be recorded at the time blood enters the collection vial and compared to analysed results from the ABG. 

*time may need to be extended if readings not stable by 30 minutes

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) is the gold standard measurement to estimate oxygen saturations and carbon dioxide levels in the bloodstream. 

Transcutaneous monitoring of carbon dioxide and oxygen saturations has the advantage of being easily measured using a small clip, usually placed on the earlobe. Unlike an ABG measurement, it allows continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide and oxygen levels, is painless, and does not have the risk of causing distal ischemia. 

The SenTec transcutaneous monitors have been used in several of our studies investigating the effects of oxygen therapy on blood carbon dioxide and oxygen levels. While the SenTec devices have been validated previously in one study, the devices need to be validated in the setting and under the standard operating procedures (SOPs) that are used in Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (MRINZ) trials. 

Our aim is to recruit patients (inpatients or outpatients) who are due to receive an ABG as part of their clinical management at Wellington Regional Hospital. When the ABG sample is taken the study investigator will record the carbon dioxide and oxygen saturation levels displayed by the transcutaneous monitor(s). These will then be compared to the ABG results.

    <publicnotes>Please note that 16 is the minimum number of participants we plan to recruit. We are testing two SenTec devices, and for each device, there must be 16 measurements made. These can be individually paired (one device per participant) or paired simultaneously (both devices on one participant at the same time - one on each earlobe). Therefore, the maximum number of participants that may be recruited should not exceed 32, if only one device were attached to each individual participant recruited.</publicnotes>
