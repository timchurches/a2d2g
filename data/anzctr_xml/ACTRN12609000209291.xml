  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relief of breathlessness by the mean of the Dyspnoea Visual Analogue(VAS) scores. This will be calculated separately for morning (am) and evening (pm) scores.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On days 5,6and 7, and days 19,20, and 21.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systematically evaluate any adverse effects from the use of sustained release morphine in this participant population. 
The participant will be visited at home weekly and phoned weekly at  times convenient to the patient, visits will last approximately 30-40 minutes. their blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be measured, their blood oxygen saturation by means of a pulse oximeter and their end tidal cardon dioxide by means of an end tidal carbon dioxide monitor. 
Using the Anticipated Adverse Event Assessment frequent side effects of morphine sulphate  will be monitored and categorised according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events.This will be assessed at both the  home and phone contacts.
Adverse events will also be monitored by  asking the patient if they have "any other problems" and  how they rate the effectiveness of breathlessness control, both assessed twice weekly.They are asked to fill out the Chronic Respiratiory Questionnaire - Dyspnoea Subscale (Mcmaster University) weekly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 4,7,14,18,22.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide.
A study nurse will visit the patient at home, at a time convenient to the patient to measure the respiratory rate and will use a pulse oximeter and an end tidal carbon dioxide monitor (all non invasive procedures).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline,Day 7, second baseline (Day 14) and day 22.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate any of the descriptive type(s) of the subjective sensation of dyspnoea that are more likely to be associated with primary pulmonary hypertension.
Participant will keep a diary for a maximum of 23 days, anticipated to take 5-10 minutes daily to fill out. they will be asked to indicate twice daily,the intensity of dyspnoea now on a modified Borg scale.the intensity of dyspnoea now, on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), to indicate once daily, their average breathlessness, worst breathlessness and best breathlessness in  in the last 24 hours, each utilising a VAS scale and their exercise tolerance using the Medical Research Council of Great Britain Scale for Dyspnoea. 
They will also be asked to indicate twice in their diary,at the end of each arm, (active and control) the level of dyspnoea control and  the overall level of dyspnoea in the last 7 days and  the level of satisfaction with medications received in the last 7 days.
(While measurements and analysis will be based upon the data from the last 3 days of each arm participants are also asked to provide responses once or twice daily to make sure they are comfortable with the pattern of participation prior to responding on the key census days).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 5, 6, 7 and 19, 20, 21.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Define any changes in quality of life generated by either arm of the study by using the McMaster Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - Dyspnoea Sub-scale.  This will be filled by the patient 4 times at study nurse home visits.( visits will  lasting about 30-40 minutes)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, day 7, second baseline (day 14) and Day 22</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify the clinical characteristics of people who derive the greatest benefit from sustained release morphine in the setting of maximally treated primary pulmonary hypertension (and whether there is a differential response based on severity of objective cardiorespiratory dysfunction).
This will be assessed from the subjective responses to questions relating to the sensation of breathlessness in the patient diary on the last 3 days of each arm of the study. The clinical characteristics based on objective cardiorespiratory dysfunction will be established  from existing results of tests done prior to enrolment. They include an Echocardiogram, a right Heart Cardiac Catherterisation and  six minute walk tests.(These tests are routinely done on  this patient population as part of their diagnosis and ongoing health care and not specifically done for the study).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and days 5, 6,7,19,20,and 21.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine whether there is blinded preference for the net clinical benefit of one arm in the study. This will be assessed from questions asked of the patient in the daily diary, only asked at the end of both the active and contol arms.These questions will  relate to the effectiveness of  breathlessness control, the overall level of breathlessness, and their level of satisfaction with the medications received only in the last 7 days of each arm of the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 5,6,7,19,20.and 21.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dyspnoea is a source of physical and psychological distress, and is one of the most commonly feared aspects of the dying process. By definition, people with severe primary pulmonary hypertension have breathlessness, despite maximal therapy and recent advances in therapies for primary pulmonary hypertension.
In parallel with attempting to treat the underlying pathology causing breathlessness, the sensation of breathlessness itself must be ameliorated. For many participants there comes a point when there are no further identifiable
reversible components of the disease and the full focus of care moves to reducing
the subjective sensation of breathlessness.
Opioids have been studied for the relief of breathlessness predominantly in people
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease although people with cancer and heart
failure have been included. [Abernethy, Miriam Johnson] A meta-analysis verified
that overall there is benefit from the use of morphine in people with refractory
breathlessness. [Jennings]
This prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study
is modelled on a study successfully undertaken by some members of this research team. The study proposes to specifically study people with primary pulmonary hypertension for whom breathlessness is a significant symptomatic problem to establish whether there is benefit from sustained release morphine, and if so, what magnitude of benefit, and the clinical characteristics of those who are most likely to respond to this intervention. Any toxicity will also be carefully monitored.Study participants will receive either Kapanol 20mg and Coloxyl and Senna 1 to 2 tablets, or kapanol placebo and coloxyl and senna placebo for one week, will receive no intervention medication for the second week then will receive the alternative intervention combination for the third week.</summary>
