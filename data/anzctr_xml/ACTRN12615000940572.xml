  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Probiotics are live micro-organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotics have been proven to reduce necrotizing enterocolitis, a devastating and life threatening emergency in neonates. Over recent years, the role of probiotics in improving gut motility and function has emerged. Probiotics, especially specific strains could improve nutrition in neonates by improving tolerance of oral feeds. Intolerance or poor tolerance of feeds along with repeated infections are some of the factors contributing to malnutrition in these high risk infants. Prevention of nutrition related issues in newborns will improve their long term development as well as their growth. 
We propose to compare single strain probiotic as compared to multiple strain probiotic for their ability to improve oral feed tolerance in neonates. We will be administering either the single strain or multi strain probiotic after allotting the infant into either one or the other group and then examine the babys stool for presence of these good bacteria (contained in the probiotic). We will also be looking at the complex genetic structure of the bacteria in stool and study if probiotics could change the bad bacteria to good beneficial ones.
We will enrol all newborns less than 28 weeks of gestation, after parental consent. The probiotic supplements will be administered to the baby after starting oral feeds and continued till the baby is near term (37 weeks of gestation). Since probiotics improve intestinal motility, we will be investigating whether multiple strain probiotic will improve it to a better extent as compared to single strain probiotic. We will administer a small amount of dye orally to the infant and observe its excretion into stools. The better the effect on gut motility, the faster will be the excretion and shorter will be the time to excrete the dye as well. 
In summary, this project will help us to conclude whether multiple strain probiotic will be more beneficial as compared to single strain for routine use in this high risk population.
