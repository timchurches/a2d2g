  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known
      which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating young patients with
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This partially randomized phase III trial is studying how well combination
      chemotherapy works in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.</summary>
