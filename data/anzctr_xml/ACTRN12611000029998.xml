  <interventions>
    <interventions>Autologous dendritic cells cultured from peripheral white blood cells and loaded in vitro with irradiated autologous tumour tissue obtained by surgery, day 0. Surgery is often performed to debulk recurrent tumour. There is no "standard" treatment for recurrent GBM and outwith trials, each case is assessed on individual circumstances. Suitability for second surgery is however a prerequisite of this study.
The dendritic cell-based vaccines (DCV) will be administered intradermally. Patients will receive an initial priming course of three DC vaccinations of 4 x 10^6 cells, administered at week 3, 5 and 7. Further booster DCV vaccinations (1 x 10^6 cells) will start at week 10 and then alternate with courses of temozolomide on a 28 day cycle. Patients will receive a maximum of 6 booster DCV vaccinations over a period of 6 months. 
Temozolomide will be administered at an adjuvant dose of 150-200 mg/m2 Body Surface Area (BSA) for 5 days every 28 days, a maximum of 6  cycles of Temozolomide over a period of 6 months, with total duration of the treatment up to 26 weeks.
The 6 cycles of boost DCV vaccine alternate fortnightly with the 6 cycles of Temozolomide.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of using resected tissue from recurrent Temozolomide-treated GBM patients to generate autologous, tumour antigen-loaded, DCV. This outcome will be assessed by percentage of successful vaccines produced.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At completion of vaccine (DCV) production.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of treating recurrent GBM with combined surgery, DC immunotherapy and Temozolomide chemotherapy as assessed by percentage of study patients completing priming course of DCV and 2 cycles of Temozolomide.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At completion of priming course of DCV and 2 cycles of Temozolomide.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of treatment (as assessed by the frequency of premature withdrawal due to serious adverse events).  Serious adverse events related to autologous dendritic cell vaccination are very rare.  There is a small risk of anaphylaxis.  Patients are monitored for half an hour after each vaccine prior to discharging home.  There are no other serious adverse events expected related to the vaccine.  Serious adverse events related to Temozolomide are also rare with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia being the most common occurring in up to 10% of patients.  Given that all patients on this study have already demonstrated their tolerance to Temozolomide during their adjuvant treatment, the expectation is that serious adverse events related to Temozolomide would be less than the documented incidence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months following completion of all study treatments.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiological response rate to salvage Temozolomide following DCV-treatment relative to salvage Temozolomide alone in historical controls. This outcome will be assessed by MRI</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6mo) of patients receiving salvage Temozolomide therapy following DCV-treatment relative to salvage Temozolomide alone in historical controls as assessed by clinical assessment by the clinican and MRI</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The development of drug resistance is a major cause for the failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer patients. We wish to explore the possibility that this therapeutic impasse can be overcome by appropriately sequenced immunotherapy and chemotherapy. We hypothesise that many of the proteins involved in developing drug resistance will be over-expressed in tumour tissue relative to normal tissue, and can therefore serve as targets for vaccine-induced immune attack. A course of immunotherapy designed to drive immune responses towards drug-induced proteins may therefore 'sensitise' tumour tissue to further chemotherapy by selectively removing drug-resistant cells. We wish to explore this possibility in patients with glioblastoma multiforme, as this aggressive disease recurs in all patients post-chemotherapy, and current salvage chemotherapies are ineffective. The aims of this safety trial are:
1) To investigate the feasibility of generating vaccines using surgically-removed tissue from patients who have recurred after treatment with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide
2) To investigate the feasibility and safety of administering these vaccines prior to, and during, subsequent rounds of temozolomide therapy
3) To investigate whether the vaccination procedure generated from temozolomide-exposed tissue sensitises progressing tumours to subsequent temozolomide.</summary>
