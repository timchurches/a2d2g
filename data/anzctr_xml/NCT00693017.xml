  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Considered Responders as Assessed During the Maintenance Period - The number of participants who were considered responders during the 12 week Maintenance Period (Week 4 to Week 16). A responder was defined as a participant with a decrease &gt;= 50% from baseline in the number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days (i.e. 28-day myoclonic seizure frequency in Period from Week 4 to the Week 16 visit compared to Week -8 to randomization at Week 0 [Screening/ Baseline Period]). Occurrence of seizures was documented in a seizure diary. The diary was dispensed at the Screening Visit and maintained by the participant (parent/caregiver) and reviewed at each following visit. The diary was completed daily. All seizures except myoclonic seizures were counted individually in the the diary. Due to early termination of the study by the Sponsor, no formal analyses were conducted.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage Change From Baseline in the Monthly Number of Days With Myoclonic Seizures - Percentage Change from Baseline in the monthly number of days with myoclonic seizures was assessed both for the Maintenance Period alone (Week 4 to Week 16) and for the entire double-blind treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16). Due to early termination of the study by the Sponsor, no formal analyses were conducted.</outcome>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Subject is male or female and aged 12-65 years.

          2. Subject has at least eight days with at least one myoclonic seizure over the two
             months Baseline Period. Myoclonic seizures must occur in the context of IGE and may be
             accompanied by other primary generalized seizures, provided these are also consistent
             with a diagnosis of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE).

          3. Subject (or parent/caregiver, for subjects below the age of consent) is willing to
             sign an informed consent form. Subjects below the age of consent in their country,
             must where appropriate be willing to give informed (written or verbal) assent.
             Subjects from the age specified in local regulations will be required to sign an
             appropriate informed consent form.

          4. Subject is taking a stable regimen of one or two other AEDs for at least two weeks
             prior to Visit 1 (start of the Baseline Period).

          5. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of any type of idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE)
             which has myoclonic seizures (and which may be accompanied by other generalised
             seizure types), according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981) and the ILAE Classification of Epilepsies
             and Epileptic Syndromes (1989). Diagnosis should have been established by clinical
             history, electroencephalogram (EEG) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging
             (CT/MRI) of the brain consistent with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. A CT/MRI scan
             should have been performed within five years of the screening visit or, if not
             available from this period, should be performed in the Baseline Period.

          6. EEG should have been performed within one year of the screening visit or, if not
             available from this period, should be performed in the Baseline Period.

          7. Female subjects are pre-menarchal, or if of childbearing potential, are not pregnant
             or lactating, or are post-menopausal.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential = 18 years must abide by one of the
             following medically acceptable contraceptive measures: oral contraception pill,
             contraceptive injections, implants or patches, intrauterine device in place for at
             least three months or vasectomised partner or abstinence throughout the study.
             Subjects &lt;18 years and of childbearing potential must be either abstinent or willing
             to use one of the medically appropriate forms of contraception for the duration of the
             study.</inclusivecriteria>

             brain imaging such as CT or MRI performed maximally five years before the screening
             visit), or clinically significant organic disease.

          2. Subject has a history of, or results of clinical investigations (including EEG data)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is intended to provide evidence that zonisamide is safe and effective in the
      treatment of myoclonic seizures. The total planned trial duration will be 6.5 months. After
      that, subjects who have completed the study will be eligible to enroll in an open-label
      extension study until zonisamide is marketed for this indication or further development in
      this indication stops. This extension study will be described in a separate protocol
      (E2090-E044-318).</summary>
