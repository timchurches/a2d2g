  <interventions>
    <interventions>Early blinded introduction of daily egg protein at 4-6 months of age (with first weaning food) until 8 months of age as freeze dried egg powder at 0.5g/day  Diet otherwise strict avoidance of all egg until 8 months.

Control group-- Daily Placebo rice powder to be mixed with water/breast milk from 4-6 months of age until 8 months .Avoidance of egg in infants diet until 8 months- including cooked and baked egg in custards/biscuits/cakes/other foods. No other foods will be specifically avoided.  
Diet normalised with no dietary restrictions from 8 months of age. 
Egg powder and placebo to be continued daily (blinded from 8-12 months of age) with normalised diet.
The intervention and placebo are introduced with the first weaning food- which may be rice cereal, apple, pear (or other first food) and not prior to first food introduction. The powder can then be mixed with these foods on a daily basis. Developmental readness for solids requires that the egg powder and placebo are not introduced until the family has introduced first weaning food.</interventions>

      <outcome>Ovalbumin and Ovomucoid specific IgG4/ IgG1,IgE

This examines markers of potential tolerance to egg protein with anticipated high IgG4. Evidence of IgE to ovalbumin rather than ovicmucoid- both egg proteins may be markers of likley egg tolerance or sensitisation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to test the hypothesis that the early introduction of common food allergens in the diet of infants at high risk of food allergy may increase tolerance and decrease IgE mediated allergen sensitisation and clinical food allergy. Specifically we aim to establish whether introduction of egg protein at 4 months of age into the diet of infants at high risk of atopic disease  is associated with a decrease in egg sensitisation and clinical egg allergy.</summary>
