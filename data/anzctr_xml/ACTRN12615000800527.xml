  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dignity Therapy is a brief, individualized psychotherapeutic intervention typically comprising of 4 to 6 one hour sessions where people with terminal illness are offered the opportunity to create a legacy document, the Dignity Therapy transcript.  The number of sessions, frequency of sessions, and total number of sessions is flexible depending on the needs and desires of the participants.  

In this study, Dignity Therapy will be offered using e-health methods, such as videoconferencing, email or chat.  The method chosen will depend on the preferences of participants.  The therapy will be administered by a psychotherapist trained and experienced in dignity therapy.  Adherence to the intervention protocol will be monitored by three co-investigators trained in dignity therapy, who will review 20-30% of randomly selected interview transcripts.  In this research, we will examine the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy delivered through e-health for equitable and cost-effective service delivery.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of dignity therapy delivered through e-health methods for people with terminal illnesses. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with a life-limiting condition with a prognosis of six months or less, but are expected to survive 4 weeks or more. Study details All participants in this study will receive dignity therapy. Dignity therapy is an individualised end-of-life psychotherapy that aims to reduce distress and enhance quality of life for people with terminal illnesses and their families. Participants will receive 4 to 6 one hour sessions with a psychotherapist via e-health methods, such as videoconferencing, email or chat (depending on personal preference).
