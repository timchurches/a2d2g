    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Post-Baseline Change in SF-36v2 Questionnaire Score From Any Time Point Compared With Baseline - The SF-36v2 assessment tool was used to obtain information about subjects' general health status and health-related quality of life. Until a formal assessment of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) is performed, changes from baseline of more than 0.5 standard deviations are suggested as clinically meaningful. Scores were transformed to a 0-100 point scale, with higher scores representing more positive answers. Scores were normalized to have a mean of 50 and SD of 10 to allow for comparison with outcomes from other chronic diseases. Recall period is the past week prior to administration. The change in scores was measured at the transitioning period and immediately prior to withdrawal/completion over 2 years, and the mean of these measurements was recorded to calculate the change from baseline and the best post baseline change score was reported for the entire group</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, beginning of each stage, change in therapy and minimum frequency of every 3 months during stages, prior to early discontinuation, up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Post-Baseline Change in the Short Form of the Motivation and Energy Scale (MEI-SF) From Any Time Point Compared With Baseline - The MEI-SF (18 questions) was used to measure the reductions in mental energy, physical energy, and social motivation, either as symptoms of chronic ITP or as a side effect of pharmacotherapy. Minimal clinically important differences are estimated as 0.5 standard deviations or 7.5 points. All items use either a 7-level (0 to 6) or 5-level (0 to 4) response scale; items with a 5-level response scale were rescaled to 7-levels, and items were reverse-scored as necessary such that higher scores represent higher HRQoL Total score ranges from 0 to 108 points. Recall period is past week prior to administration. The change in scores was measured at the transitioning period and immediately prior to withdrawal/completion over 2 years, and the mean of these measurements was recorded to calculate the change from baseline and the best post baseline change score was reported for the entire group</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, beginning of each stage, change in therapy and minimum frequency of every 3 months during stages, prior to early discontinuation, up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Post-Baseline Change in the FACIT-Fatigue 13 Item Subscale Score From Any Time Point Compared to Baseline - The FACIT-Fatigue consists of 13 questions in which patients rate the frequency (0-4) of symptoms of fatigue, in terms of tiredness, weakness, and fatigue Items were reverse-scored as necessary such that higher scores represent higher HRQoL Total score ranges from 0 to 52.Using anchor-based estimates, the minimally important difference in this subscale is 3.0 points.
Recall period is past week prior to administration. The change in scores was measured at the transitioning period and immediately prior to withdrawal/completion over 2 years, and the mean of these measurements was recorded to calculate the change from baseline and the best post baseline change score was reported for the entire group</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, beginning of each stage, change in therapy and minimum frequency of every 3 months during stages, prior to early discontinuation, up to 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Post-Baseline Change in the FACT-TH6 at Any Time Point Compared to Baseline - The FACT-TH6 consists of 6 questions in which patients rate (0-4) their general degree of worry related to bleeding and bruising, and resulting activity impairment and frustration. Although the six items do not constitute a formal domain or subscale of the FACT-Th assessment tool, these items had been identified by focus groups of patients with chronic ITP as important indicators of their HRQoL. Items were reverse-scored as necessary such that higher scores represent higher HRQoL. Total scores ranged from 0 to 24. Recall period is not specified. The change in scores was measured at the transitioning period and immediately prior to withdrawal/completion over 2 years, and the mean of these measurements was recorded to calculate the change from baseline and the best post baseline change score was reported for the entire group</outcome>

             Hematology/British Committee for Standards in Haematology (ASH/BCSH) guidelines
             [George, 1996; BCSH, 2003]. In addition, a peripheral blood smear should support the
             diagnosis of ITP with no evidence of other disease causative of thrombocytopenia
             (e.g., pseudo thrombocytopenia, myelofibrosis). The physical examination should not
             suggest any disease which may cause thrombocytopenia other than ITP.

          -  Prior completion of treatment and follow up periods in an ITP study of eltrombopag

             3 years to rule out myelodysplastic syndromes or other causes of thrombocytopenia

          -  Previous therapy for ITP with immunoglobulins (IVIg and anti-D) must have been
             completed at least 1 week prior to first dose of study medication and the platelet

             to randomization. Subjects treated with cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil or
             danazol must be receiving a dose that has been stable for at least 3 months prior to
             the first dose of study medication.

          -  Prothrombin time (PT/INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) must be
             within 80 to 120% of the normal range with no history of hypercoagulable state.

        apply:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality, other than ITP, identified on the screening
             examination, or any other medical condition or circumstance, which in the opinion of
             the investigator makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study or
             suggests another diagnosis.

          -  Concurrent malignant disease and/or history of cancer treatment with cytotoxic
             chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

             thromboembolic events (e.g. atrial fibrillation), or subjects with a QTc &gt;450 msec.

          -  Female subjects who are nursing or pregnant (positive serum or urine b-human chorionic
             gonadotrophin (b-hCG) pregnancy test) at screening or pre-dose on Day 1.

             longer) preceding the first dose of study medication.

          -  Subject treated with drugs that affect platelet function (including but not limited to
             aspirin, clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs) or anti-coagulants for &gt; 3 consecutive days within

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An open-label, dose-adjustment, extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      eltrombopag for the treatment of subjects with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) who
      have previously been enrolled in an eltrombopag trial. This study will allow adjustment of
      the eltrombopag dose to achieve an individualized dose and schedule for each subject. In
      addition, the ability to reduce the dose of concomitant ITP medications in the presence of
      eltrombopag, while maintaining platelet counts = 50,000/µL will be investigated.</summary>
