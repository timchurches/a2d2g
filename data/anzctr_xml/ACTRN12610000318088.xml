  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a growing body of research indicating that vitamin D blood concentrations can impact on brain functioning. In particular, there is robust evidence in animal models showing that vitamin D deficiency during development impairs brain functioning in adulthood.  However, no studies have examined whether enhancing vitamin D blood concentrations by vitamin D supplementation during adulthood can improve brain functioning.  

This study will assess whether increasing vitamin D blood concentrations via vitamin D supplementation in healthy adults improves various aspects of brain functioning such as attention, response inhibition, and general mood and emotions.  

We anticipate that this study will provide us with important information about the effects of enhancing vitamin D blood concentrations on brain function in healthy adults.</summary>
