  <interventions>
    <interventions>Candidates in the study will be selected from a
pool of patients undergoing total hip replacement. In order to evaluate the Accolade II femoral hip stem radiopaue tantalum bead markers will be inserted resulting in the standard operating time (typically 1-2 hours) being extended by approximately 10 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to identify whether there is a difference in the micromotion of the Accolade II(R) cementless femoral stem between 6 months post-surgery and 2 years post-surgery, providing an indication of long-term fixation.  Functional outcomes, pain and quality of life will also be assessed. This study is a prospective observational case series being performed at a single study centre. One Principle Investigator will perform all surgery for this study.</summary>
