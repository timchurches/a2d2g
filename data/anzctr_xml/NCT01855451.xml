  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A standard treatment for patients with head and neck cancer is radiation given with high
      doses of a chemotherapy drug called cisplatin, given every 3 weeks during the radiation. This
      treatment is effective but can significantly increase side effects such as difficulty with
      swallowing, a sore mouth, fatigue, hearing loss, ringing in the ears and kidney failure. In
      Australia, a commonly used treatment HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma is
      a lower dose of cisplatin given weekly during the radiation. The high dose and low dose
      schedules result in a similar total dose of cisplatin being given during the radiation, but
      it is thought that the weekly schedule results in fewer side effects while maintaining
      effectiveness.

      Another approach widely used around the world for patients with head and neck cancer, is to
      administer the antibody, cetuximab, weekly during radiation. Cetuximab has a very different
      side effect profile to cisplatin, and has been reported to result in less exacerbation of
      radiation related side effects. Both cetuximab and cisplatin can reduce the growth of a
      cancer and increase the effectiveness of radiation. Both cisplatin and cetuximab appear to be
      effective treatments in combination with radiation, but have not been directly compared.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the treatment related side effects (both acute and
      longer term) between the cisplatin and cetuximab regimens. Both treatments would be given
      with the same dose of radiation therapy over 7 weeks. The results of this trial will help
      determine the optimal treatment for patients with HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell
      Carcinoma.</summary>
