  <interventions>
    <interventions>Internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy program consisting of 6 modules. Each module will take approximately 30 minutes to read and will then include behavioural homework to complete over the next fortnight (approximately). Each module will involve psychoeducation, sensate focus, communication exercises, cognitive exercises and mindfulness techniques. Unlimited email contact will also be available and fortnightly web-based chat groups will occur to discuss progress and relevant issues.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to implement and evlaluate an internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy program for females with sexual dysfunctions. It is anticipated that this study will increase treatment success and lower attrition rates by addressing the limitations of previous internet-based interventions and incorporating mindfulness techniques. Evaluation of the program will be conducted using data collected at pre-treatment, post-treatment and at a 3-month follow-up. A waitlist control group will be included for comparisons. This study will help to determine the efficacy of internet-based treatment options for female sexual dysfunctions and further elucidate the role of mindfulness in female sexual dysfunction interventions.</summary>
