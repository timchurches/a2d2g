  <interventions>
    <interventions>A pillow with Taxus chinensis extract (smells similar to tea) infill (cross-over at the middle of the study, after two weeks break) will be provided for participants to use during their sleep for three weeks.

Each participant will be provided with a mobile device, which has an embedded accelerometer and microphone to record the body movement and the volume of breathing sound during their sleep. Participants will be automatically promoted by a special designed software embedded in the mobile device to record movement and sound volume during the night. The smart phone will be placed close to the body during sleep and will only switch on network during day time to transfer the data. Participants have an option to use it as their primary phone during the study. Participants will also be asked to answer a set of questions on general well-being, sleeping quality, diet and physical activities at pre and post of each intervention, for analysis.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>It is anticipated that this study will discover the details of how Taxus chinensis aromatic therapy improves the participants sleeping quality.

The participants' body movement and breathing sound volume (not to record to the actual sound) will be automatically recorded by the mobile device during their sleep. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is to be used as a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances, at pre, mid (when crossover) and post trial to assess the effects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcomes will be measured and analysed at the end of each phase of the trail, ie. when the interventions (treatment and control group) crossover (week 4) and at the end of the trial (week 8). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>It is anticipated that this study will discover the details of how Taxus chinensis aromatic therapy improves the participants general well-being.

Physical and psychological well-being will be investigated by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and a questionnaire to record participants' diet and physical activity levels will be used, and participants' blood pressure will be measured by the researcher, at pre, mid (when crossover) and post trial to assess the effects. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcomes will be measured and analysed at the end of each phase of the trail, ie. when the interventions (treatment and control group) crossover (week 4) and at the end of the trial (week 8). </timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A researcher who is familiar with this type of clinical trial will be invited as the third party to label the treatment and placebo pillow (which will be packed the same). The pillow is assigned to match the participantsâ€™ codes and groups (i.e. A1, A2... or B1, B2...; names will be kept confidential). This researcher will be asked not to reveal relevant information to either researchers or participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be grouped based on a random number table. Participants in Group A will receive the treatment of the Taxus chinensis extract scent pillow for the first three weeks while participants in Group B will receive the placebo during the same period. After two weeks of the wash out period (break), for the second three weeks, the interventions will be switched, i.e. Group B will receive the Taxus chinensis extract scent pillow and Group A use placebo. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The data will be analysed through the application of paired t-test using a software program SPSS 18.0 to determine the following:
- The difference between Group A and Group B before treatment commenced.
- The difference between pre- and post-intervention results for all the participants in both groups, i.e. in the first three weeks with Group A as the treatment group and Group B as the control group, and in the second three weeks with Group B as the treatment group and Group A as the control. Pre- and post- treatment effects were also considered for the combination of Group A and B. P &lt; 0.05 was accepted as significant.
