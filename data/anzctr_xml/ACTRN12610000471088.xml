  <interventions>
    <interventions>TENS treatment with four silicone-carbon electrodes will placed on the skin next to the episiotomy, i.e. in the puerperae(mothers who have just given birth), thigh and gluteal muscles region. TENS is applied with 100Hz frequency and 75 microseconds pulse for 60 minutes. This is a one off intervention.
Forty puerperae were randomly set into two groups: TENS and control.</interventions>
    <comparator>A control group was composed from primiparous puerperae  with episiotomy and feeling perineal pain. The control group that was submitted to the routine procedures (eg. drugs such as dipyrone) the institution. Pain assessment through numerical rating scale (NRS) will be performe in at the beginning of the study, after TENS and 60 minutes later.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effectiveness of TENS as a pain relief resource applied in puerperal women that present episiotomy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post episiotomy pain was assessed while resting, sitting and ambulating through a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ). Pain assessment through NRS was be performed in both groups at the beginning of the study, after TENS and 60 minutes later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterized the painful complaint and evaluate if the pain in the episiotomy to interfere on the development of the daily activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Brazilian version of the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ) was employed before and after TENS to characterize the pain. To check functional capacity, at the beginning of the study, puerperae was asked about their limite, or not daily activities and about the activities they had not yet performed.  These activities were: sitting, ambulating, urinating, bowel movement, personal hygiene, eating, sleeping and breast-feeding.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a controlled, single-blind, randomized clinical study that compares two study groups; high-frequency TENS and control. Forty primiparous puerperae submitted to natural childbirth with episiotomy in a Brazilian Maternity took part in this study. The method in which allocation concealment was performed, i.e. the person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation was concealed and it was done by central randomization by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomization by using a randomization table created by a computer software. Randomization was programmed in order to generated a location sequences to endure balance for the number of subjects in each group throughout the study. The number of patients in each group was equal.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Pain assessment through NRS was performed in both groups at the beginning of the study, after TENS and 60 minutes later. MPQ will be employe before and after TENS. TENS with 100Hz frequency and 75 microsecond pulse for 60 minutes was employe without causing any pain. Four electrodes was place near the episiotomy, in the pudendal and genitofemoral nerves that supplied the perineal area.</designfeatures>
