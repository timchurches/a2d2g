  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs such as
      luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, flutamide, and bicalutamide may stop the
      adrenal glands from producing androgens. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining hormone therapy with
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy given at the
      same time as hormone therapy is more effective than chemotherapy given after hormone therapy
      in treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy given at the
      same time as hormone therapy with that of chemotherapy given after hormone therapy in
      treating patients who have prostate cancer.</summary>
