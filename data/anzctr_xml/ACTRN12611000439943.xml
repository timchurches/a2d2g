2. High Potassium [low in sodium (~500mg) and high in Potassium (~1500mg)]

This study involves comparing the effects of three meals comprising of meat and bread (containing different amounts of sodium and potassium) on brachial and central bloodpressure. 
Washout of at least 72 hours between test days.
Measures will be collected every fifteen minutes for three hours postprandially and comparisons will be made between the control and intervention meals for their effects on blood pressure and measures of blood vessel function.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in Australia. High blood pressure is one of the major modifiable risk factors for the development of CVD. There is a strong association between sodium chloride salt intake and elevated blood pressure. Salt reduction in diets has been shown to reduce blood pressure but salt intakes remain very high in many countries. Recent studies have shown that long term use of a salt substitute  potassium chloride, can result in significant reductions in blood pressure. However, there are currently no published studies on the acute effects of potassium chloride on blood pressure.
The aim of this research study is to compare the effects of three meals containing different amounts of sodium and potassium salts on blood pressure and blood vessel function.</summary>
