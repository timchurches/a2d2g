  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial will involve patients diagnosed with Meniere's Disease with a positive herpes serology. Participants will be required to take two Valtrex tablets per day, with each tablet containing 500 mg of Valaciclovir (trade name Valtrex). Participants will continue taking tablets on a regular daily basis for 9 months or until further intervention. The end-point of the treatment occurs either at the end of 9 months, or when the participant withdraws from the trial.
During the treatment period, and for a subsequent 3 months follow-up, participants will be asked to maintain a daily diary of their wellbeing, vertigo and hearing (each with a 0-5 rating scale).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will blindly be given either a supply of the active drug (Valtrex tablet) or a placebo tablet (control).</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be the frequency of vertigo attacks during the trial, with vertigo being defined as both a perceived nystagmus and the sensation of vertigo lasting longer than 20 minutes. Vertigo attacks will be recorded by the participant in a daily diary with a rating scale of 0 (no balance problems) to 5 (perceived nystagmus with dizziness lasting longer than 20 minutes).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 9 months after the commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The level of subjective hearing fluctuation. Participants will log their subjective hearing function in a daily diary using a rating scale of (compared to previous day)
0 - no hearing change
1 - hearing loss 
2 - hearing improvement
3 - increased tinnitus annoyance
4 - decreased tinnitus annoyance
5 - unsure about change
     (multiple numbers can be chosen)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 9 months after the commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The subjective level of tinnitus, which will be derived from the hearing fluctuation rating scale logged in the participant daily diary (above).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 9 months after the commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The subjective level of wellbeing will be logged by the participant in the daily diary using a rating scale of 0 - not stressed to 5 - extremely stressed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 9 months after the commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of the time until the first vertigo attack within the 9 month treatment period. The vertigo attack timing will be derived from the participant's daily diary, and the vertigo rating scale of 0-5 (with 5 being a true vertigo attack with nystagmus and dizziness lasting longer than 20 minutes).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 9 months after the commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Meniere's Disease sufferers will be asked to participate during routine clinical visits, or approached to participate via two magazine publications produced in Australia for Meniere's Sufferers. Participants will be asked to enroll by the Principal Researcher, who is the clinician responsible for the initial diagnosis and assessment of the efficacy of the trial treatment (used to determine the outcome). After the initial diagnosis, the participant is then sent to a Secondary Researcher at a nearby facility (&lt;300m away). The Secondary Researcher will be responsible for randomly allocating each patient a supply of the active or placebo tablets. Tablets will be de-identified. The Secondary Researcher is the only person who will know what each participant is taking until the end-point for each participant. The Secondary Researcher will maintain a private log of each participant's name and the drug allocated to them.</concealment>
    <sequence>The Secondary Researcher will use a "covariate-adaptive randomization" method to approximately randomize the allocation of drugs between the active and placebo groups. Covariates will include the number of participants assigned to each group, age, sex and severity of the disease (based on the AAO-HNS criteria for assessing Meniere's severity).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Meniere's Disease is characterized by unpredictable attacks of debilitating vertigo, interspersed with periods of quiescence. It affects around 50,000 Australians. Several studies have provided supportive evidence that a viral infection of the inner ear may be the cause of the disease, but few studies have trialled antivirals as a preventative treatment. This trial will involve a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of preventing the vertigo attacks in Meniere's Disease with antiviral drugs.</summary>
