  <interventions>
    <interventions>The asthma self-management program was developed using Banduras self-efficacy model. This study aims to develop a new asthma self-management program by enhancing the self-efficacy of adolescents in managing their asthma, thereby improving symptoms of asthma. The contents of the asthma self-management are  based on the Expert Panel Report-3 (EPR-3) of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in the US (2007), including assessing and monitoring asthma severe and asthma  control, control of environment factor and comorbid condition that affect asthma, medication, and educational for a partnerships in care. The asthma self-management program for the intervention group will be carrying out  by the researcher who is a registered nurse,  involves three face-to-face 30-40 minute meetings with participants from Week 1 to Week 3 and a 20 minutes mobile phone reminder call in Week 4. The aim of the phone call is to identify problems, give support  and revision of information provided in the meetings sessions, and help adolescents with asthma to solve any problem they face in practicing their asthma action plan. During the discussion, the researcher will give positive feedback and encouragement about their effective behaviors in order to achieve confidence in carrying out asthma self-management. Following each of the first three face-to-face meetings a text message will be sent to remind participants to use their medication, encourage them, and motivate them.
 The asthma self-management program, which is 4 weeks duration, will be carrying by the researcher. During the study period, participants in the intervention group will be asked to record their daily asthma symptoms, name of the asthma medicine, and peak expiratory flow rate. After the 4-week period of the intervention, post data will be collected again</interventions>
    <comparator>The usual asthma care in the control group is conducted by the outpatient department of nursing at the pediatric outpatient department , which is based on the guidelines of the Bureau of Health Promotion in Taiwan.  The contents of asthma care include the nature of asthma; controlling triggers of asthma; manipulation of peak flow meter; medication usage; assessment of severity of asthma; and introduction of diary of asthma symptoms and signs, according to the Bureau of health promotion in Taiwan. The contents will be divided into three sessions: first sessions is introduction what is asthma, control of environment factors, and medication. Secondary , inhaler using , and explanation diary of symptoms and sign of asthma. The final session is to evaluate patients inhaler manipulation and understand  how to avoidance of trigger.  Each time is from 10-20 minutes  for a newly diagnosed with asthma. The strategies in the control groups are lecturing and dialogue. In addition, information about how to correctly manipulate inhaler is presented by DVD. The time is about 5 minutes.   </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size of this study was calculated using a significance level was established at 5% to avoid a type I error, and power was set at 80% to avoid type II error, and one-tail, at least a difference of 6.3 units between the control and experimental groups in scores of self-efficacy, according to Pichoras research. The result indicated that 39 per group is needed.  Furthermore, the anticipated attrition rate of respondents of past study of adolescents self-management is 19.1%. Therefore, a total of 94 participants (47 per group) will be recruited.  </statisticalmethods>
