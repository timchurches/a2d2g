    <summary>RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. Anastrozole may be effective in preventing breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well anastrozole works in preventing
      breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for the disease.</summary>
