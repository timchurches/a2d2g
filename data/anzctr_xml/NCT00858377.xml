    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Arm 1- Dose Escalation
Treatment: drugs - Arm 1- Dose Expansion

Experimental: Arm 1- Dose Expansion - The dose expansion part of the study will begin after completion of the dose escalation phase and will consist of 3 cohorts of 14 subjects each. One taxane-resistant tumor type will be evaluated in each cohort.

Experimental: Arm 1- Dose Escalation - The dose escalation part of the study is aimed at determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AMG 900 and if necessary, the MTD with prophylactic GCSF support (MTD-G).


Treatment: drugs: Arm 1- Dose Escalation
AMG 900 is a small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinases A, B and C. AMG 900 will be administered daily for 4 days every 2 weeks (i.e., 4 consecutive days of dosing followed by 10 consecutive days off treatment).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This first-in-human study of AMG 900 will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose
      expansion. The dose escalation part of the study is aimed at evaluating the safety,
      tolerability and PK of oral AMG 900 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Up to 50 subjects
      may be enrolled in dose escalation. The dose expansion part of the study will consist of 42
      subjects in three taxane-resistant tumor types. The dose of AMG 900 will be dependent upon
      data from the dose escalation part of the study</summary>
