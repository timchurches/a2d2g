  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean 24 Hour Heart Rate at Day 14 - Heart rate was assessed by Holter monitoring and was measured over a 24 hour period at day 14. Heart rate was defined as the average value over the 24 hour monitoring period. The baseline measurement was the average heart rate taken from the 24 hour Holter monitoring period performed at screening or the last 24-hour period before taking the first dose of study drug. Least square means are based on the analysis of covariance: 24 hours mean heart rate = center + treatment + baseline value + Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) before inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + FEV1 30 min post salbutamol/albuterol + error.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 14</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean 24 Hour Heart Rate at Day 1 - Heart rate was assessed by Holter monitoring and was measured over a 24 hour period at day 1. Heart rate was defined as the average value over the 24 hour monitoring period. The baseline measurement was the average heart rate taken from the 24 hour Holter monitoring period performed at screening or the last 24-hour period before taking the first dose of study drug. Least squares means are based on the analysis of covariance: 24 hours mean heart rate = center + treatment + baseline value + Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) before inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + FEV1 30 min after inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + error.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Day 1 and Day 14 - Spirometry testing was performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of two measurements at 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hour 45 minutes post dosing. Baseline is defined as the mean of the two values taken at 45 minutes and 15 minutes prior to dosing at day 1. Least square means are based on the analysis of covariance: response variable=center + treatment + baseline value + Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) before inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + FEV1 30 minutes post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol.</outcome>

      <outcome>Trough Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Day 1 and Day 14 - Spirometry testing was performed in accordance with American Thoracic Society standards. Trough FVC was defined as the mean of two measurements at 23 hours 15 minutes and the 23 hours 45 minutes post dosing. Baseline was defined as the mean of the two values taken at 45 minutes and 15 minutes prior to dosing at day 1. Analysis of covariance: FVC parameter = center + treatment + baseline FVC + FEV1 before inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + FEV1 30 min after inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + error.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in QTc (Fridericia's Formula) at Day 1 - The change from baseline in QTc at 30 minutes, 4 hours and 23 hours 45 minutes post dose on day 1. QT calculated (QTc) was calculated from the QT interval and RR (in seconds) using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT / 3v RR. Least square means are based on the analysis of covariance: response variable = center + treatment + baseline value + FEV1 before inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + FEV1 30 min post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in QTc (Fridericia's Formula) at Day 7 - The change from baseline in QTc at 30 minutes and 2 hours post dose on day 7. QT calculated (QTc) was calculated from the QT interval and RR (in seconds) using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT / 3v RR. Least square means are based on the analysis of covariance: response variable = center + treatment + baseline value + FEV1 before inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol + FEV1 30 min post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol.</outcome>
