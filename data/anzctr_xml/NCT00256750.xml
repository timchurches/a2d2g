      <outcome>Percent of Participants With a Composite of Measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (mGFR) Less Than 60 mL/Min/1.73 m^2 at Month 12 or With a Decrease in mGFR Greater Than or Equal to 10 mL/Min/1.73m^2 From Month 3 to Month 12 - Measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) is the direct measurement of renal function and was assessed by measurement of the clearance of a true glomerular filtration marker (non-radiolabeled iothalamate) using a validated procedure. A GFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 was used as the approximate equal of the threshold values of serum creatinine (SCr) of 1.5 mg/dL. A change in GFR of at least 10 mL/min/1.73 m^2 was used as the approximate change in SCr of at least 0.3 mg/dL. The change component of the composite renal endpoint was assessed from Month 3 to Month 12, since post-transplant renal function is largely stable by Month 3.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent of Participants Experiencing Acute Rejection (AR) Post-transplant by Month 12 - Acute rejection was defined as a clinico-pathological event requiring clinical evidence and biopsy confirmation. Clinical evidence was defined if either a or b was satisfied: a: an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine; b: an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness; or a serum creatinine that remains elevated within 14 days post-transplantation and clinical suspicion of acute rejection exists. Allograft biopsies were evaluated by a blinded central independent pathologist using Banff 97 working classification of kidney transplant pathology. Banff 97 diagnostic category for renal allograft biopsies is an international standardized histopathological classification. AR was defined by a renal biopsy demonstrating a Banff 97 classification of Grade IA or greater, with higher scores indicating more severe rejection.

      <outcome>Percent of Participants Using Lymphocyte Depleting Therapy (LDT) for the Initial Treatment of Acute Rejection (AR) by Month 36 - The use of LDT (thymoglobulin or antithymocyte gamma globulin [ATGAM]) was permitted only for participants randomized to cyclosporine (CsA) who experienced impaired renal allograft function and anticipated delayed graft function following transplantation. Acute rejection (AR) defined as a clinico-pathological event requiring clinical evidence (an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine or an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness; or a serum creatinine that remained elevated within 14 days post-transplantation and clinical suspicion of acute rejection existed) and biopsy confirmation. AR defined by a renal biopsy demonstrating a Banff 97 classification of Grade IA or greater, with higher scores indicating more severe rejection. Banff 97 diagnostic category for renal allograft biopsies is an international standardized histopathological classification. Only the episode with the highest Banff grade for each participant was counted.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent of Participants With Corticosteroid Resistant Acute Rejection (AR) by Month 36 - Steroid-resistant acute rejection (AR) defined as the use of lymphocyte-depletion therapy following treatment with corticosteroids. AR defined as a clinico-pathological event requiring clinical evidence and renal biopsy confirmation demonstrating a Banff 97 classification of Grade IA or greater, with higher scores indicating more severe rejection. Clinical evidence defined: either a or b was satisfied: a) an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine; b) an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness; or a serum creatinine that remained elevated within 14 days post-transplantation and clinical suspicion of acute rejection existed. Allograft biopsies were evaluated by a blinded central independent pathologist using Banff 97 international standardized histopathological working classification of kidney transplant pathology. Only the episode with the highest Banff grade for each participant was counted.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Recovered Completely From an Episode of Acute Rejection (AR) by Month 12 - Acute rejection (AR) = a clinico-pathological event requiring clinical evidence and renal biopsy confirmation demonstrating a Banff 97 classification of Grade IA or greater. Clinical evidence = if either a or b was satisfied: a: an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine; b: an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness; or a serum creatinine that remains elevated within 14 days post-transplantation and clinical suspicion of acute rejection exists. Complete recovery following AR defined as serum creatinine [SCr] levels returned to baseline. Recovery calculated using 2 algorithms: Algorithm 1 = last laboratory measurement prior to onset of AR (baseline and first laboratory measurement after 84 days since onset of AR = resolution); Algorithm 2 = lowest laboratory measurement on or after transplantation and prior to onset day of AR (baseline and lowest laboratory measurement after onset on first AR up to Month 12 = resolution)</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent of Participants With Subclinical Rejection at Month 12 - Subclinical rejection defined as histological findings by the central pathologist consistent with acute rejection, but lacking its clinical correlate. Acute rejection defined as a clinico-pathological event requiring clinical evidence and renal biopsy confirmation demonstrating a Banff 97 classification of Grade IA or greater, with higher scores indicating more severe rejection. Only the episode with the highest Banff grade for each participant was counted. Clinical evidence defined if either a or b was satisfied: a) an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine; b) an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness; or a serum creatinine that remained elevated within 14 days post-transplantation and clinical suspicion of acute rejection existed.

      <outcome>Mean Value of Physical and Mental Components Using SF-36 Questionnaire - SF-36 was a Participant-Reported Quality of Life (QoL) Short Form (SF) questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 2 scale measures: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). PCS represented by 4 domains: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, and general health perception. MCS represented by 4 domains: vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Their scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores, which were transformed to a range from 0 to 100; 0= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. Higher scores reflect better health-related functional status. Scoring is standardized using the norm-based scoring method where data is scored in relation to the U.S. general population having a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Scores below 50 are below the U.S. general population norm and above 50 are above the U.S. general population norm.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Relative to an Identified Distribution (Ridit) Value of Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Using Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale (MTSOSDS-59R) - The Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale (MTSOSD-59R) was used to assess the occurrence (never, occasionally, regularly, almost always, always) and distress (0=no distress to 4=terrible distress) of symptoms associated with immunosuppressive therapies. Ridit (relative to an identified distribution) analysis (Fleiss JL. Statistical methods for rates and proportions. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1991) was used. Ridit scores were calculated at baseline and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months for overall symptom occurrence score and overall symptom distress. The Ridit score reflects the probability that a score observed for an individual randomly selected from a group would be higher (worse symptom) than a score observed for a randomly selected individual from the reference group. The reference group was constituted by the frequency distribution of the responses of all participants on all items at baseline. The ridit of the reference group is by definition, 0.5.</outcome>
