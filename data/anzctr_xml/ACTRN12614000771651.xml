  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention that will be used is called the Integrated Employment Success Tool (IEST). The IEST is a protocol/ checklist tool to be used by employers of adults with HFA/AS to create an awareness of the characteristics of adults with HFA/AS and subsequently identifies possible areas of environmental workplace difficulties that may occur. It highlights what possible actions and/or modification are required to resolve these difficulties and recommends services, products or educational training courses that can be accessed to assist in creating a suitable workplace environment for the adult with HFA/AS, employers and co-workers.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control/comparator group is referred to as the 'Treatment As Usual' Group. This group will receive the treatment/intervention that is typically issued by Disability Employment Service Providers for adults with HFA/AS. This may include: on-the-job support, training and/or counselling for job seekers.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A cluster RCT will be undertaken with adults with HFA/AS and their prospective workplace. Instead of the participants being allocated to an intervention, randomisation of the workplaces will occur. Therefore, once participants seeking employment through Centrelink and/or Disability Employment Services are employed, clustering and randomising of the workplaces will occur. Participants will then either be allocated to the ‘IEST Intervention’ group or the ‘Treatment as Usual’ group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants who go through a Disability Employment Service (DES) provider, will be allocated a workplace as per normal procedure. The DES will be unaware as to which group the participants will be allocated to, i.e., either the IEST group workplace or the TreatmentAs Usual group workplace. DES will be concealed from this group allocation process. Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is 'off-site'.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Group equivalence at baseline will be determined on type of employment and/or workplace. The sample size of 80 will allow for the effect size of 0.6 or larger with a ß-level of 0.2 and an a-level of 0.05. This sample size allows for expected attrition rate that may occur throughout the period of the study trial. ANOVA will be used to analyse the difference; within individuals, within groups and between the groups</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has shown that only few adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), particularly those without intellectual disability, participate in the competitive workforce. Many studies have identified the need to develop vocational support programs to enable individuals with ASD to participate in and retain employment. However, there is limited research detailing the impact of workplace environmental factors in employment and the potential successful employment outcomes that may occur from modifying the environment through the use of an ASD specific tool.

The overall aim of this research project is to develop the Integrated Employment Success Tool (IEST) which will be used to adapt the workplace environment to facilitate successful employment outcomes for adults with high functioning autism/ Asperger Syndrome.</summary>
