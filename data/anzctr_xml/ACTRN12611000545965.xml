  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pre-randomisation
All participants receive their usual daily dose of Suboxone(R) as soluble buprenorphine/naloxone tablets (7 days open label)

Post-randomisation
Randomised to one of two arms (intervention or comparator).
Arm 1: Soluble sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone films at their usual daily dose (10 days double-blind double dummy placebo controlled followed by 14 days open label)

NB. The placebo for Arm 1 were matched soluble sublingual inactive films. If patients were randomised to Arm 1, they would receive both film and tablets in the double-blind phase, with the film being active and the tablets placebo. Conversely, if randomised to Arm 2, they would receive both film and tablets in the double-blind phase, with the tablets being active and the film placebo. Patients received only ONE active preparation at all times.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient preferences and ratings of ease/convenience of use between Suboxone sublingual film and Suboxone tablets as measured by likert and visual analogue scales</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured 31 days after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dose effects of Suboxone sublingual film compared to Suboxone tablets as measured by visual analogue scales, as well as the subjective opiate withdrawal scale (SOWS) and the objective opiate withdrawal scale (OOWS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured on day 0, day 5, day 17, day 24 and day 31 after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events on Suboxone sublingual film compared to Suboxone tablets using a self-report questionnaire. Examples of such adverse events are constipation, dry mouth and insomnia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured on day 0, day 5, day 17, day 24 and day 31 after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease of removing Suboxone sublingual film from the mouth post-administration. This task used matched placebo sublingual films, and the participants was asked whether all, some or none of the film could be removed after (i) 30 seconds and (ii) 1 minute in the mouth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured on 31 days after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time taken to dispense Suboxone sublingual film compared to Suboxone tablets. Participants were asked to indicate when they could no longer feel the tablet or film in their mouth, and the time from when it was administered was recorded in seconds.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured on 3 separate occasions during the final 14 days of the trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the novel soluble sublingual film dosage form of Suboxone(R) in comparison to the existing tablet dosage form. It was hypothesised that participants would prefer the novel dosage form to the existing tablet due to its ease of use and the added convenience it provided.</summary>
