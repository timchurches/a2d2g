  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety: Procedure-related anxiety will be measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale.

      <outcome>Procedure related pain
At the end of the pleural procedure, patients will be asked to rate their overall feelings of pain using a 10 point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pleural procedures are performed both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Similar to other endoscopy procedures, it is known that patients undergoing pleural procedures can experience considerable pain and anxiety. The use of sedative and analgesic medications can somewhat alleviate these symptoms. However these medications can be expensive and can result in side effects such as respiratory depression. On the contrary, music is an inexpensive and non-pharmacological intervention that has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety in patients undergoing endoscopy and surgical procedures. However, to date, there have not been any studies that have evaluated the effects of music therapy in patients undergoing pleural procedures. Our study aims to fill an important gap in knowledge. If our proposed study demonstrates that music indeed reduces anxiety and pain levels in patients undergoing pleural procedures, it will reduce the patient morbidity and lead to a more comfortable hospital experience. This may also result in reduce need for sedative and analgesic medications for our patients, resulting in cost savings and risk reduction for our health service. </summary>
