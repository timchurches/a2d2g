    <summary>To evaluate use of cognitive behavioural therapy to treat anxiety and depression in clients with Asperger's Disorder</summary>

The study has been completed and submitted as part of requirements for the degree of Doctor of Psychology (Clinical) at the University of SA. The following is the abstract of the thesis:
A program was provided to seven adult clients previously diagnosed with Aspergers disorder (AsD) who responded to a letter offering a program using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches to clients with AsD who also experienced difficulty with anxiety, depression, or handling social situations. Four clients presented with clinically significant levels of depression and/or anxiety. For three of these, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaire results indicated positive clinically significant change. The fourth client showed some desired changes in behaviour. Three clients presented with sub-clinical levels of anxiety and depression prior to treatment. While there were some decreases in DASS scores for these clients, they were not clinically significant. All clients reported they found the program helpful and that they had learned and implemented skills found helpful in their daily lives. Psycho-education, behavioural skills like progressive relaxation and an impulse control strategy called 'Stop 1, 2, 3, Cool it Breathing,' (S123CIB) and cognitive strategies such as identifying and then challenging thoughts identified as leading to feelings expressed through inappropriate actions were found helpful. The findings of this report are encouraging and supportive of use of CBT with clients with AsD, although the small numbers involved mean that findings are tentative, and suggestive of areas of further research rather than conclusive.</publication>
