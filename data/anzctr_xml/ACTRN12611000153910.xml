  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cardiac MRI, Echocardiography, serum biomarkers at baseline, 1 month (during chemotherapy), 3 and 12 months (post chemotherapy).  This will take approximately 90 minutes.  We will perform these interventions to identify sub-clinical changes of probable significance for development of later manifest ventricular dysfunction.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We wish to study and determine early predictors of cardiac toxicity during combined trastuzumab and/or anthracycline chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer by way of precise assessment of sub-clinical right (RV) and LV systolic and diastolic function. Volume measurements and determination of oedema and myocardial fibrosis will be performed by CMR and advanced echocardiography in order to identify sub-clinical changes of probably significance for development of later manifest ventricular dysfunction. Secondary aim is to correlate observed cardiovascular changes with cumulative dose chemotherapy, age and pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors and biochemical markers or cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis. We hypothesise that:
-	CMR images will show evidence of myocardial oedema, before patients develop chemotherapy induced cardiomyopathy
-	tagging imaging techniques will demonstrate lowered active diastolic function
-	degree of cardiac dysfunction will be proportional to number of chemotherapy cycles conducted
-	CMR and advanced echo will allow for identification of patients at high risk of heart disease
-	Abnormalities seen on advanced echo and features of fibrosis on CMR will correspond with abnormal biochemical markers</summary>
