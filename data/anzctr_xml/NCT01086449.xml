  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the

             visits).

          -  A male or female between, and including, 18 and 30 years of age at the time of the
             first vaccination for inclusion in the young adults cohort or aged between, and
             including, 50 and 69 years of age at the time of the first vaccination for inclusion
             in the older adults cohort.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

             grandparents and able to speak Japanese).

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

             - Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

          -  Male subjects may be enrolled in the study, if the subject:

               -  has agreed to practice adequate contraception (until 2 months after completion of
                  the vaccination series).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine/product, or
             planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine/product
             dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone &gt;= 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent.
             Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Concurrent or planned participation in another clinical study, at any time during the
             study period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational
             or a non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Immunosuppression resulting from haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, AIDS or
             symptomatic HIV infection.

             product through participation in a HZ vaccine study).

          -  History of HZ.

          -  History of any allergic disease or reaction likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months preceding
             the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.

          -  Receipt of any other immunisations within one month before the first study vaccination
             (2 weeks in the case of inactivated influenza vaccines or other non-replicating
             immunisation products [e.g., tetanus and reduced dose diphtheria toxoid (dT) vaccine,
             pneumococcal vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine]), or scheduled within
             30 days after study vaccination.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

          -  Fever is defined as temperature &gt;= 37.5°C (99.5°F) on axillary setting;
