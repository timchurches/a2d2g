  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women in both groups will be weighed at recruitment, before 20 weeks gestation. Women in the control group will be advised of their body mass index (BMI), and recommended weight gain for pregnacy based on Institute of medicine guidelines. 
Women in the intervention group will have a single individual session lasting approximately 30 minutes with a dietitan or food technologist or trained midwife, consisting of a dietary history and simple dietary advice. They will be encouraged to weigh themselves regularly and record weight gain on a personalsed graph. Weight gain will be recorded in both groups at 36 weeks pregnancy</interventions>
    <comparator>Women will be weighed in street clothes on a calibrated scale at the time of recruitment, which is before 20 weeks gestation</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Being overweight and gaining too much weight in pregnancy increase the chances of complications of the pregnnacy for the mother and baby. 
We believe that by giving women simple dietary advice and encouraging them towards healthy weight gain targets in pregnancy, these outcomes may be improved</summary>
