  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the efficacy of the FPH modified positive airway pressure (PAP)
      device with or without SensAwake; and with different pressure support in OSA participants; in
      both an in-home and in-lab environment. Comfort, compliance and the accuracy of the pressure
      delivery will also be evaluated. The FPH device will be compared to a market released
      product.</summary>
