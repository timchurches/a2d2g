  <interventions>
    <interventions>The PMA consists of four randomised controlled trials, which include some / all of the following parent focused interventions: 
promotion of breastfeeding
promotion of responsive feeding
dietary and parenting advice regarding introduction of solid foods (the 'how' and 'what' of child feeding)
reducing television (TV) viewing in early childhood
promoting active playing
developing good sleeping habits
Duration of the interventions ranged from antenatally to 2 years of age
The intensity and frequency of sessions varied between trials. The least intense intervention comprised six 2 hourly sessions at 3 monthly intervals. The most intense comprised a mix of home visits and group based sessions for sleep and healthy eating the maximum being 10 sessions over a period of 18 months.
The sessions are delivered  face to face by a range of different health care professionals.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Early Prevention of Obesity in Children (EPOCH) Collaboration was formed in 2009. The main objective of the EPOCH Collaboration is to determine using a prospective meta-analysis of four randomised trials if early interventions for childhood obesity impact on BMI z scores at age 18-24 months. Additional research questions will focus on whether the interventions have an impact on dietary quality of child, TV viewing time, duration of breastfeeding and parenting styles.  The enlarged sample size of the combined dataset (approximately 1800) will allow greater reliability when exploring intervention effects, with respect to pre-specified participant- and intervention- level characteristics. It will also allow for examination of complex interactions that are likely to be of high clinical importance.
