  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised crossover trial comparing the effects of a standard test bland meal to four standard meals containing different amounts of chilli. The standard meal consisted of a bread roll, beef burger and glucose drink. Three meals contained chilli paste/blend (20g, 30g and 40g) while two capsules containing 1.5g of chilli powder, with an equivalent capsaicin content of 40g of chilli paste/blend, were included in a fourth meal. Participants consumed each of the five meals over five visits, in random order, with a one week washout period between consecutive visits.

Chilli blend (a commercial product) was made of chillies, sugar, food acid and water.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have previously observed that adding chilli to a meal reduces the need for extra insulin to control the blood glucose. This finding is interesting and needs further investigation. Insulin is required to control blood glucose, however in some people the body produces more insulin than is required. This condition over long periods leads to hyperinsulinaemia and/or insulin resistant states, where in the insulin produced become inefficient and this may lead to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome and heart disease. 
As mentioned earlier our previous study showed a possible beneficial effect by controlling for insulin secretion as well as insulin clearance from the body. In the present study we plan to test the effects of different doses of chilli taken as food or in a capsule supplement on blood glucose and insulin. This study aims; to investigate the minimum dose of chilli required to show significant effects on blood glucose and insulin concentration, to investigate and compare the effects of chilli intake as food and as a capsule supplement on blood glucose and insulin concentrations and platelet function, to investigate and compare the effects of chilli intake as food and as a capsule supplement on blood pressure, functioning of blood vessels and metabolic rate.</summary>
