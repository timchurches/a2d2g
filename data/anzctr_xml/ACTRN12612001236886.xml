  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This cross-sectional study is the first to assess the use of rapid HIV tests in a clinical setting in New South Wales (NSW). The study will assess acceptability of the process of rapid HIV testing for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) among patients and staff in public sexual health clinics in Sydney. The study will also assess barriers to HIV testing; patient flow in clinics during the study; and the performance of the rapid test compared to conventional laboratory HIV serology. The patient and staff surveys used in this study were piloted with patients and staff during development. The study aims to recruit at least 1000 MSM subjects across four sites: Sydney Sexual Health Centre, Albion Street Centre, Clinic 16 Royal North Shore Hospital and Parramatta Sexual Health Clinic. The rapid test used in the study is the Alere Determine HIV 1&amp;2 Antigen/Antibody Combo assay which produces a result 20 minutes after the patient specimen is applied. MSM attending for screening will be identified through triage and provided with information regarding the study. Eligible MSM who consent will receive pre-test discussion and have specimens taken for sexually transmitted infection screening, rapid HIV testing and conventional HIV serology. Rapid test results are provided to subjects during their visit with counsellor support for reactive results when required. The recruitment period will be at least 12 months from October 2011.</summary>
