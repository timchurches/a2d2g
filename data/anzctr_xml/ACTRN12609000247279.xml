  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at treatment with the drug Cediranib, in patients who have advanced or metastatic lung cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 

Trial details: 
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. Both groups will receive intraveneous chemotherapy treatment. The first group will also receive the new drug Cediranib. The second group will receive a dummy (placebo) treatment. Both groups will receive the chemotherapy drugs Paclitaxel and Carboplatin. This will be administered intraveneously once every 3weeks. The number of cycles will be determined by the physician. No more than 6 cycles will be administered. The group receiving the drug Cediranib will receive a daily dose of 20mg, administered orally, in addition to the chemotherapy treatment. The group receiving the dummy treatment will receive a daily dose, administered orally, in addition to the chemotherapy treatment. 
The study aims to see whether combining the drug Cediranib with chemotherapy treatment, compared with chemotherapy alone, improves overall survival rates. 
The study also looks at quality of life.</summary>
