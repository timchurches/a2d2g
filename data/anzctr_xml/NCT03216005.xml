          -  Failed compression therapy of at least 6 months' duration;

          -  Deep system venous reflux characterized by &gt;1 second reflux time;

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Untreated significant superficial venous incompetence which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may be the primary source of existing symptoms;

          -  Deep venous intervention in the target limb or outflow vessels within 6 months of
             consent;

          -  Significant peripheral arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index of &lt;0.50 or with
             incompressible vessels;

          -  Insufficient inflow through the treatment vein upon manual augmentation;

          -  Chronic, diffuse, post-thrombotic femoropopliteal vein disease that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would preclude venous valve formation or would inhibit flow
             through the treatment sites;
