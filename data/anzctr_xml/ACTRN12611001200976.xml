    <concealment>During the treatment period, subjects will be randomised to receive sodium selenate (VEL015 10 mg tds [total of 30 mg daily]), VEL015 320 mcg tds [total 960 mcg daily] or or placebo tds in a ratio of 2 to 1 to 1 respectively. Subjects will be randomised on Day 0 (Visit 2). At the time of randomisation, the subject will be assigned a unique Randomisation Number, which will be allocated in ascending order of random numbers based on the predetermined randomisation schedule, and according to their chronological order of inclusion in the study. Subjects will then be allocated a corresponding treatment kit labelled with the same treatment number.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The two hallmark neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease are extracellular amyloid deposits, and intracellular deposits of neurofibrilliary tangles comprised of abnormal tau protein. The clinical trial of amyloid therapies have been disappointing and this clinical trial represents the first trial of a therapy directed towards tau pathology in Australia to our knowledge. 

Everyone has a naturally occurring protein called tau in the brain and the fluid around their brain and spine (cerebrospinal fluid). There is a link between Alzheimers Disease and a reaction involving tau where too much phosphate is attached. This may cause brain cells to work less well or die.   Further, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) which breaks down phosphate has been shown to be less active in people with Alzheimers. VEL015 works by increasing the activity of PP2A and therefore decreasing the available phosphate in the brain. Studies in animals have shown that VEL015 helps to prevent this reaction between tau and phosphate.  We now want to find out if it will help to treat Alzheimers Disease in humans.</summary>
