    <interventions>Brief Name
Using a phone with tracking and activity software to objectively measure activity levels and utilization of local health care resources after discharge following Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS).

Why
The use of measured data, rather than self-report or using clinical outcomes as a proxy, over a longer time period will provide the first objective insight into cardiac patients activities immediately following discharge, and whether these align with the discharge education they received before they left hospital.

What
Prior to discharge, participants will be provided with a Samsung Galaxy J1 mini mobile phone (or similar), equipped with a data-only SIM card and loaded with a pedometer (step counting) app and a GPS tracking app.
Accessories will include the charging cable and armband to carry the phone in that position if desired.  The study nurse will activate the phone and instruct the participant on how to charge it;  written instructions will also be supplied.  The participants are not expected to interact with the phone except for wearing and charging.

Procedures
Participants will be asked to carry the phone during waking hours for the duration of the study and charge it every night. 
The study nurse will call each participant once a week to check that they are not having any problems with the phone.  If requested they will also provide a summary of the participants step count for the previous week. A short questionnaire will also be administered at this time, and a slightly longer one after the first 4 weeks and at the end of the study. 
At the week 4 call the participant will be asked if they wish continue with the study- if no they will be informed that there is no penalty with stopping at that point and thanked for their participation. Participants will be able to keep the phone on completion of the study.

Who provided
An experienced Registered Nurse and/or Aboriginal Liaison Officer will be trained on the operation of the phone and apps and the conduct of the interviews.

How
Initial recruitment, baseline data collection and provision and activation of the phone will be conducted face to face.  All further contact will be by telephone.

Where
Recruitment will occur in two major Adelaide metropolitan hospitals.
Monitoring will occur in the participants homes and communities as they go about their usual daily activities.  Data from the GPS will only be analysed when it occurs at health service locations previously agreed to by the participant.

When and how much
Data will be recorded continuously during waking hours for a period of at least 30 days and up to  90 days from enrollment.

How well
Correlation of the recorded activity with that reported during the weekly phone contact will be performed to assess adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparisons will be made Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants, and between participants who reside in metropolitan areas and participants who reside in rural/remote areas.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>40 participants will be recruited- it is intended that the final cohort will include 20 metropolitan and 20 rural/remote participants,  10 of each will be of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent. Due to the exploratory nature and limited funding, the results will not be generalisable however they will be used to  inform a future larger scale investigation.
Summarised spatial data and personal variables will be analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Intergroup differences will be analysed using cross tabulation with chi square testing for significance.
Geographic Information Systems software (ESRI ArcMap v10.3) will be used to analyse the spatial information.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of discharge education  and the use of patient resources in patients that have had a heart attack or unstable angina when they return home. 
We will explore if patients actually follow the recommended activity guidelines and use of healthcare services such as cardiac rehabilitation, pharmacy, general practice, pathology and emergency department in the first 30 up to 90 days after discharge from hospital. Patients who live in areas with high and low levels of access to cardiac services will be compared with each other.
Outcomes will be assessed with the use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
Participants who agree to participate will be educated on the use of a phone which they will be asked to carry for at least 30 days.
Participants will receive weekly phone calls for the duration of the study during which the nurse will ask a series of questions about their experiences with the phone and will ask about the health service locations that have been visited.</summary>
