    <inclusivecriteria>1. Age 12 to 65 years

          2. Presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with an acute illness compatible
             with influenza infection (each of the following is required):

               -  oral temperature of =100.4°F or =38°C (obtained in office or self-measured within
                  12 hours prior to screening - if self-measured, subject must also have taken an

                  feverishness).

          3. Confirmation of influenza A or B infection in the local community by one of the
             following means:

               -  the institution's local laboratory,

                  scheme.

             Note: Time of onset of illness is defined as either the earlier of:

               -  the time when the subject experienced the presence of at least one respiratory
                  symptom AND the presence of at least one constitutional symptom.

          5. Willing and able to provide written informed consent (including assent by legal
             guardian if under 18 years of age) and comply with the requirements of the protocol,

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Severity of illness requiring or anticipated to require in-hospital care or subject
             defined as being at high risk of complications from influenza infection according to
             the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for seasonal influenza in
             adults and children (Committee of Infectious Diseases (CID) 2009:48) or current
             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Current criteria for
             persons 12-65 years of age who are at risk of influenza complications include (list to
             be reviewed and updated as required prior to initiation of the study and at least
             monthly during the study):

               -  Persons with asthma or other chronic pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis
                  in children or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.

               -  Persons with hemodynamically significant cardiac disease.

               -  Persons who have immunosuppressive disorders or who are receiving
                  immunosuppressive therapy.

               -  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected persons.

               -  Persons with liver disorders.

               -  Persons with active cancer.

               -  Persons with chronic metabolic disease, such as diabetes mellitus, inherited
                  metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders.

               -  Persons with neuromuscular disorders, seizure disorders or cognitive dysfunction
                  that may compromise the handling of respiratory secretions.

               -  Residents of any age of nursing homes or other long-term care institutions.

               -  Persons who are morbidly obese (Body Mass Index =40).

          2. Females of childbearing potential who are either pregnant, breast-feeding or are
             sexually active without the use of birth control. Female subjects of child-bearing
             potential that are sexually active must have a negative baseline pregnancy test and
             must agree to continue an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the
             study and for 1 month post-treatment. A double barrier method, oral birth control
             pills administered for at least 2 monthly cycles prior to study drug administration,
             an intrauterine device (IUD), or medroxyprogesterone acetate administered
             intramuscularly for a minimum of one month prior to study drug administration are
             acceptable methods of birth control for inclusion into the study. Female subjects are
             considered of childbearing potential unless they are postmenopausal (absence of
             menstrual bleeding for 1 year - or 6 months if laboratory confirmation of hormonal
             status), or have had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubular ligation or bilateral
             ovariectomy.

          3. Vaccination for seasonal influenza on or after August 1, 2015.

          4. Receipt of any dose of nitazoxanide, oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, amantadine or
             rimantadine within 30 days prior to screening.

          5. Prior treatment with any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to
             screening.

          6. Subjects with active respiratory allergies or subjects expected to require
             anti-allergy medications during the study period for respiratory allergies.

          7. Known sensitivity to nitazoxanide or any of the excipients comprising the nitazoxanide
             tablets.

          8. Subjects unable to take oral medications.

          9. Subject has chronic kidney or liver disease (including Hepatitis A, B or C) or known
             impaired hepatic and/or renal function.

         10. Presence of any other pre-existing chronic infection that is undergoing or requiring
             medical therapy.

         11. Presence of any pre-existing illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             place the subject at an unreasonably increased risk through participation in this
             study.

         12. Subjects who, in the judgment of the Investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the
             requirements of this protocol.</exclusivecriteria>
