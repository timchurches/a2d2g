  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised to 'standard care' or to the intervention. The intervention is a supervised preoperative fitness program. This program will involve 14 sessions of High Intensity Interval Training on a cycle ergometer over 4-6 weeks prior to surgery. The aim is to perform three sessions a week, but depending on the number of available days between enrolment in the study and the date of surgery four sessions a week may be performed.

Exercise will be performed with other patients who are enrolled in the same or similar studies under the supervision of a senior trained exercise physiologist (greater than five years experience) in the School of Physical Education. Exercises will use stationary cycling (Monark cycle ergometers), with monitoring of pulse and blood pressure. For patients on beta blockers the level of perceived exertion, using the 1-20 Borg scale  will be monitored as well as the pulse. Each session will begin and end with 5 min of unloaded cycling. Initial sessions will include ten 15-second intervals at a heart rate exceeding 85% of age predicted maximum heart rate, or a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) score of 16, with rest intervals of 45 seconds at heart rates of 50% maximum heart rate. All training programs will be individualised to meet the capacity of the participant. The duration of exercise will increase and the duration of rest will decrease as the participant gains fitness.  The aim of the 14 session format is for participants to achieve five 2 minute intervals of high intensity work with 2 minute active rest durations. The total interval duration will not exceed 10 minutes throughout the training period.  Each session will last approximately 20 to 25 minutes.. 
For safety reasons, the intensity of exercise and intervals will be adjusted if systolic blood pressure exceeds 180 mm Hg, if the heart rate exceeds 95% of the maximum observed on baseline CPET, or if the perceived exertion on the Borg scale exceeds 18.  Pulse (as the indicator of high intensity) will be monitored and recorded from downloadable Polar Heart Rate monitors to assure exercise adherence. This will be monitored by the exercise physiologist and the duration of the training intervals will be adjusted to reach the required heart rate. Monitoring for adherence will look at the number of  sessions attended and the number of sessions where the target heart rate is reached.
 
Patients who have their surgery delayed will complete one additional HIIT session per week up until surgery to maintain fitness. All adverse events will be recorded.

    <statisticalmethods>Differences in Peak VO2 will be recorded as mean results with standard deviations. Assessing the significant differences before and after HIIT and between the two groups will require mixed effects modelling and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analysis, using baseline fitness as the covariate. 
Differences in the SF 36 subscales scores (these give a score between 0 and 100) between the two groups will be assessed using the student t- test or Mann-Whitney U test depending on the distribution of scores. Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.
The postoperative morbidity survey generates a percentage of patients with or without morbidity. Differences between groups can be compared using the chi-square test. Differences in complication rates between groups will also be compared using the chi-square test or with Fishers exact test. The surgical recovery score generates a score between 17 and 100. As the scores are likely to be non-parametric, distribution differences between the groups will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Length of stay data is also likely to be positively skewed and will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Estimation of the required number of participants is difficult as we need a standard deviation around the change in Peak VO2 to calculate the sample size (So we would want a change in Peak VO2 of 2ml/kg/min with a standard deviation of x ml/kg/min with an estimated 20% drop out rate after randomisation. As it was difficult to get a standard deviation for changes in Peak VO2 with 14 sessions of HIIT it was decided by our statistician to use an 'adaptive design' where we calculate the standard deviation from the first 30 patients (15 patients in each group) and at that stage we will be able to calculate the required number of participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many of the risk factors associated with developing complications after surgery cannot be changed, such as the extent of the problem requiring surgery, the operation required and the health problems that the patient suffers from. However it may be possible to reduce complications by optimising fitness before surgery. In this study we will examine if fourteen exercise sessions on an exercycle over five weeks can improve overall cardiorespiratory fitness. Fitness will be measured by the peak oxygen consumption, which is measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing. We will also monitor patients after surgery to check for differences in a range of clinical outcomes including the speed of recovery from surgery, length of hospital stay, complications and quality of life.
Both the individual and the community may benefit from this research. Improving fitness, and potentially improving outcomes will be of benefit to the individual patient. At the community level there is no work being routinely done to improve fitness before surgery. If we demonstrate that improving fitness improves operative outcomes this should lead to the introduction of exercise programs for patients while they are waiting for their surgery.
