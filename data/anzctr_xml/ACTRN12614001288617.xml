    <interventions>Arm 1-The device used was the ThermoMed 1.8, ThermoSurgery Technologies portable battery operated device. The generator has received clearance by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CL. 
It delivers precisely controlled localized radio frequency waves to selectively destroy diseased tissue.Heat therapy was administered as a single session. The lesion and surrounding normal skin was cleaned with normal saline. Then the area was anasthetized with 2% lignocaine using a 1cc  syringe .The device was used in according to manufacturers instructions (ThermoMed 1.8 ;Thermosurgery) .It generates a 6.78 mHz frequency  applied with a hand set that is attached to two applicator electrodes which were placed on the diseased skin. A temperature of 50 degrees centigrade was applied for 30 seconds to cover an area about 49-73mm squared, according to the size of electrodes ( three sizes are provided). Then the applicator is moved to another area of the lesion until the entire area is treated. Once treatment begins the temperature is measured by a thermistor embedded in the applicator which ensures that the applied temperature remains constant. After treatment the lesions were  covered with gauze to prevent secondary infections and patients were given an antibiotic cream( soframycin 1% per 30 grams depending on the size of lesion to cover the lesion) to be applied twice a day for 3 days.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment efficacy was measured by the percentage of patients clinically cured by 8 weeks , 10 weeks , 12 weeks and 16 weeks after initiation of treatment in both groups.
Cure was defined as complete re-epithelialization of the CL lesion with no evidence of papules, active inflammation or induration .
Partially cured if healing was 50-100%
Non responders  or treatment failures were those who had lesions that were less than 50% healed at the end of three months or if new lesions occur while on treatment.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Informed consent was obtained to participate in the study.Samples of lesion aspirate and scrapings from the active edge of the lesions were taken for laboratory investigation for the confirmation of presence of Leishmania parasites by microscopy and culture
Once the patients were eligible to participate in the trial, they were briefed about the study, its aims and protocol by the investigator. Informed written consent was obtained from the patients by a trained research assistant to avoid any bias ( the investigator refrained from taking consent). The clinical trial data form  was completed and  photographs of the baseline lesions were taken. The clinical trial data form was filled to obtain demographic  and clinical details with regard to  baseline size and type of lesion. Patients then proceeded to the nursing officer to be randomized into one of the arms of the trial. </concealment>
    <sequence> An independent senior nursing officer at the skin clinic was trained to assign patients to either treatment group by making them pick one of two identical cardboard pieces out of a box (the cardboard pieces had been labelled with different treatment codes on one of its sides) .After patients were assigned by the nurse to each treatment group the card board pieces were returned to the box.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The software used was SPSS version 20 to enter data and analyze. The demographic details and lesion characteristics  were provided using descriptive statistics with chi squared test to check for any significant difference among the two groups in each treatment arm.
The association between cure rate at (8,10,12,16 weeks) and sex, age, site of lesion and lesion characteristics were assessed using a stratified analysis with chi-squared test. A p value of greater  than 0.05 was taken to be significant. 
Sample size calculation:
The sample size was calculated using the non-inferiority design, to show that the new intervention thermotherapy is no worse than the standard therapy intra-lesional SSG by a margin of delta . Delta is defined as a clinically acceptable margin of difference between the treatments being compared. 
 The formula below designed for hypothesis testing of non-inferiority trials when the outcome measure is a dichotomous variable is used in the sample size calculation.
N= sample size per group
delta= the clinically acceptable margin of difference from the treatments being compared.
The literature review done for clinical trials comparing the two modes of treatment show that there is a clinically acceptable margin of difference of  about 10% .

The null hypothesis -Thermotherapy is inferior to intra-lesional SSG by a clinically acceptable marginal difference of 10%.
P= the response to standard treatment intralesional SSG is 92% effective.
N=2( Z(1-apha)+Z(1-beta )divided by delta x P(1-P)
Z(1-alpha)=1.645
Z(1-beta)=0.845
alpha -is the probability of type 1 error that occurs in rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true and its value is taken as 0.05.
beta- the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when its  false. This is given by the power of the research (1- type II error/beta): the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. Conventionally, the power is set at 0.80. 
The sample size calculated when p=92% is 92 patients per arm of treatment, considering loss to follow up we can add on another 5% and the total number of patients per arm was calculated as 97.

    <summary>Once the patients were eligible to participate in the trial, they were briefed about the study, its aims and protocol by the investigator. Informed written consent was obtained from the patients by a trained research assistant to avoid any bias ( the investigator refrained from taking consent). The clinical trial data form was completed and  photographs of the baseline lesions were taken. The clinical trial data form was filled to obtain demographic  and clinical details with regard to  baseline size and type of lesion. Patients then proceeded to the nursing officer to be randomized into one of the arms of the trial. The assigned treatments are as follows:- 
Thermotherapy ( Test group)
Heat therapy was administered as a single session. The lesion and surrounding normal skin was cleaned with normal saline. Then the area was anasthetized with 2% lignocaine using a 1cc  syringe .The device was used in according to manufacturers instructions (ThermoMed 1.8 ;Thermosurgery) . It generates a 6.78 mHz frequency  applied with a hand set that is attached to two applicator electrodes which were placed on the diseased skin. A temperature of 50 degrees centigrade was applied for 30 seconds to cover an area about 49-73 mm2 according to the size of electrodes ( three sizes are provided). Then the applicator is moved to another area of the lesion until the entire area is treated. Once treatment begins the temperature is measured by a thermistor embedded in the applicator which ensures that the applied temperature remains constant. After treatment the lesions were  covered with gauze to prevent secondary infections and patients were given an antibiotic cream( soframycin( 1% in 30 grams) as much as required to cover the lesion) to be applied twice a day for 3 days. 
 
 SSG (control group)
One of the trained medical officers  administered branded SSG, Pentostam using a 1cc  syringe with a fixed needle after the lesion was cleaned with normal saline .SSG was administered intra-lesionally until complete blanching of the lesion and its margins.The injection was given at right angles to the lesion to infilterate in a vshaped pattern that ended with the needle being advanced to the base of the lesion.Depending on the size of the lesion the dose varied from about 1-3 ml given weekly until cured or up to 10 weeks .The same medical officer treated all the patients to minimize variations. Patients were followed up fortnightly up to 12 weeks and then monthly up to the 4th month to assess response to treatment and then after 3 months of complete cure to assess for any relapse or recurrence.The clinical trial data form was completed at every follow up visit with regard to size of lesion, degree of re-epithilialization , whether cured or not , whether further treatment was required and remarks were documented. Photographs were taken at each visit and were saved in folders for each patient. The occurrence of adverse effects were evaluated by asking patients and examining lesions  and were documented in the remarks section of the data form.
