          6. Women of Childbearing potential (WCBP) must:

             a. Have a negative medically supervised pregnancy test prior to the start of study
             therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study,
             and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices and
             continues sexual abstinence.

             b Either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse (which must be
             reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective
             contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting study drug, during the
             study therapy (including dose interruptions), and for 28 days after discontinuation of
             study therapy.

          7. Males Subjects must:

               1. Agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a WCBP, even if they have had a
                  vasectomy, throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption and after
                  the cessation of study therapy.

               2. Agree to not donate semen during study drug therapy and for a period after end of
                  study drug therapy.

          8. All subjects must

               1. Have an understanding that the study drug could have potential teratogenic risk.

               2. Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and
                  following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               3. Agree not to share study medication with another person.

               4. All patients must be counseled about pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal
                  exposure.

        Female Subjects:

        Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) with regular cycles must agree to have pregnancy
        tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on
        study, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following discontinuation from the study. If
        menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 28
        days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28
        following discontinuation from the study.

        In addition to the required pregnancy testing, the Investigator must confirm with FCBP that
        she is continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit. Counseling
        about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at
        a minimum of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study
        drug and to not donate blood.

        Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a subject misses her period or if her
        pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal. Study drug treatment must be
        discontinued during this evaluation.

        Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at
        least 28 days after the discontinuation from the study.

        Male Subjects:

        Counseling about the requirement for latex condom use during sexual contact with females of
        childbearing potential and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be conducted at a
        minimum of every 28 days. During counseling, subjects must be reminded to not share study
        drug and to not donate blood, sperm, or semen.

        If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study subject or the partner of a
        study subject during study participation, study drug must be immediately discontinued.</inclusivecriteria>
