  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fear-less Triple P is a 6-session, weekly program for parents of anxiety-disordered children. Sessions are of 60-90 minutes duration, and are administered in small groups of 6-8 families. Administering clinicians include clinical psychologists and intern psychologists - students completing their postgraduate studies in clinical psychology.  Content covered includes: Psychoeducation about anxiety; emotional resilience; cognitive challenging; exposure; strategies for managing children's anxiety; and problem solving. Sessions are recorded in order to be able to review for treatment adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active treatment condition (Fear-less Triple P) was compared to a Waitlist control condition, in which participants were assessed before and after a 6 week wait (the equivalent duration of the active treatment being evaluated).</comparator>
