  <interventions>
    <interventions>The decision aid (DA) was developed by a team of researchers at the University of Western Sydney, The University of Sydney, and Arthritis New South Wales. The DA is a 45-page resource available in electronic or paper versions, and contains three distinct sections: 1) Information on RA, conception, pregnancy, and parenting; 2) decision making activities, and; 3) resources. Specifically, it provides women with information about RA and its effects, the impact of RA and medications on conception, pregnancy and motherhood, the impact of pregnancy on RA, and womens stories. The booklet also contains worksheets to assist women in the decision making process, including a decision tree, scales to rate the pros and cons of each option, identifying support networks, a knowledge checklist, and a note taking section. Development of the DA was conducted based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and following the guidelines of the IPDAS Collaboration. 
The DA is currently listed on the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute Patient Decision Aid website: https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/AZsumm.php?ID=1787 
The electronic version of the DA (i.e. in the form of a PDF) was the only intervention used in the current study. The participants were not provided with any further intervention(s). </interventions>
    <comparator>Women in the control condition were not provided access to the decision aid until the end of the study.
Once the trial had ceased, the women in the control group were sent an electronic copy of the DA via email. That is, once all post-intervention data was collected, follow-ups were conducted, and preliminary data was analysed (i.e. to ensure the DA resulted in no harm to participants). Identically to women in the DA group, women in the group received no other resources or treatments.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 to 12 weeks post intervention (Decision Aid). Follow up timeframe depended on participants' rate of completion (DA use and survey response).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional conflict: measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 to 12 weeks post intervention (Decision Aid). Follow up timeframe dependent on participants' completion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety- measured using anxiety component of The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

      <outcome>Depression- measured using the depression component of The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</outcome>

      <outcome>The Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) is a self-administered, disease specific questionnaire developed to measure perceived self-efficacy in people with chronic arthritis. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses were conducted using IMB SPSS Statistics (21.0), with statistical significance set at p &lt; .05 (two-tailed). Baseline differences between the DA and control groups were assessed using an independent samples t-test. Primary and secondary outcomes were analysed using a series of 2 (group: intervention and no intervention) x 2 (time: pre and post) mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses were conducted on each measure (PiRAQ, DCS, ASES, HADS-A, and HADS-D), including the DCS subscales, and questions measuring RA-Complicated Decision and Decisional Certainty. A power analysis using the G*Power 3 computer program revealed a total sample size of 130 subjects was required to detect moderate effects (0.13) with 95% power using a within-between repeated measures ANOVA.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arthritis NSW has identified that there is a need for more information and support for women faced with family decisions in the context of their RA. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop a Decision Aid (DA) resource (printed booklet and an online version) for women with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who were contemplating pregnancy. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the DA, a randomised control trial (n = 200) was conducted with women diagnosed with RA, aged between 20-45 and who may be contemplating pregnancy.</summary>
