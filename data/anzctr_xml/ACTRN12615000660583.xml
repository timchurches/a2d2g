  <interventions>
    <interventions>The internet-delivered Reboot Online program contains 8 lessons over 12 weeks. It is a multi-disciplinary pain management program combining psychological cognitive behaviour therapy with a physical therapy component. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons). Each lesson will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Participants will have access to summaries after each lesson, homework exercises, view videos of physical exercises, expert talks, extra resources and have receive email contact from a clinician after the first two lessons, then as required. The participant is able to contact a clinician via phone or email throughout the program - they will be able to ask questions and receive guidance from a multidisciplinary team (a registered psychologist, physiotherapist, pain specialist and psychiatrist). The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviation the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email.
Strategies used to improve adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework and videos, collection of data on how long participants spent reading the lessons and practicing the skills.  </interventions>
