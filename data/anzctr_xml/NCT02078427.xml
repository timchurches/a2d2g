  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Joint health outcomes - assessed by physical exam using only the pain, bleeding, and physical exam parameters of the Gilbert Scale. - The World Federation of Hemophilia developed a musculoskeletal evaluation system, commonly referred to as the Gilbert test, to measure hemophilia joint health status.The Gilbert test needs to be performed in the absence of acute bleed, acute pain, and acute inflammation into the evaluated joint.
Four parameters are used in each Gilbert test: pain (score: 0-3), bleeding (score: 0-3), physical exam (score: 0-12), and X-ray evaluation (score: 0-13)
Scores of 0, represent no pain, no bleeding, no physical exam issues, and/or no x-ray issues. Higher scores for each of these categories represents worsening conditions.</outcome>

      <outcome>Annualized bleed rate, all joints - The annualized bleed rate for all joints will be calculated per participant and summarized over the set of available participants.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Annualized bleed rate, all bleeds - The annualized bleed rate for all bleeds will be calculated per participant and summarized over the set of available participants.</outcome>

      <outcome>Annualized bleed rate, pre-existing target joints at baseline - The annualized bleed rate for pre-existing target joints at baseline will be calculated per participant and summarized over the set of available participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of New Target Joints - The incidence of new target joints will be calculated as the total number of new target joints in all participants divided by the total number of observation days. The time to the first occurrence of a new target joint in a participant will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier technique.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Status of joint health by X-ray by Pettersson scale - The status of joint health by X-ray by Pettersson score will be summarized for timepoints 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after study start. Linear interpolation (for any time interval) and linear extrapolation (for up to 0.5 years) will be used to derive an estimate of the score at these timepoints.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Status of Joint Health by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scoring System- Using The Lund Scoring System (LSS) - LSS score format= A(e:s:h). Sum of values for Subchondral Cyst (score: 1-6), irregularity/erosion of Subchondral Cortex (score: 1-4), and Chondral Destruction (score: 1-6) gives value for the A component of score. e, s, h components represent effusion/hemarthrosis, hypertrophic synovial, &amp; hemosiderin deposition (score: 0-4 for each). Max. score is 16(4:4:4).

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall effectiveness assessment for prophylaxis therapy - Excellent: Same or lower breakthrough bleed rate (BBR) within last 12 months (M) compared with previous prophylaxis; if participant did not receive previous prophylaxis with rAHF-PFM or another Factor VIII (FVIII), same or better than expected outcome according to investigator's expectation
Good: Minor increase in BBR within last 12M compared with previous prophylaxis; if participant did not receive prophylaxis with rAHF-PFM or another FVIII, slightly less than expected outcome according to investigator's expectation
Fair: Moderate increase in BBR in last 12M compared with previous prophylaxis; if participant did not receive prophylaxis with rAHF-PFM or another FVIII, somewhat less than expected outcome according to investigator's expectation
Poor: Significant increase in BBR in the 12M compared with previous prophylaxis; if participant did not receive prophylaxis with rAHF-PFM or another FVIII, little to no benefit according to investigator's expectation</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall effectiveness assessment for on-demand treatment - Excellent: Bleed episodes typically respond to same or fewer number of infusion and same or lower dose as compared with previous on-demand treatment or investigator's expectation
Good: Most bleed episodes typically respond to same number of infusion and dose but some require more infusions or higher dose as compared with previous on-demand treatment or investigator's expectation
Fair: Bleed episodes typically require more infusions and/or higher dose than expected as compared with previous on-demand treatment or investigator's expectation
Poor: Bleed episodes routinely fail to respond to same number of infusion and dose and require additional or different factor concentrate for hemostatic control as compared with previous on-demand treatment or investigator's expectation</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 years, Throughout the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global effectiveness assessment for on-demand treatment - Excellent: Full relief of pain and cessation of bleeding as evidenced by objective signs (e.g., swelling, tenderness, irritability, inconsolability, and decreased range of motion in the case of musculoskeletal hemorrhage) within approximately 8 hours of a single infusion. No additional infusion is required for the control of bleeding. Administration of further infusions to maintain hemostasis would not affect this scoring.
Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after the infusion. Possibly requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
Fair: Probable or slight relief of pain and slight improvement in signs of bleeding within approximately 8 hours after the infusion. Requires more than 1 infusion for complete resolution.
Poor: No improvement or condition worsens.</outcome>
