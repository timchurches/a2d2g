  <interventions>
    <interventions>Growth measurements - Approximately 250 patients will be enrolled. Patients from birth to &lt; 17 years on the date of consent will be enrolled. Patients aged 0 to &lt; 4.5 years on the date of consent may also be enrolled, the timing of which will be at the discretion of the sponsor. Approximately equal numbers of boys and girls will be enrolled.

             any research-related procedure.

          -  Aged 0 to &lt; 17 years, inclusive, at study entry. Patients aged 0 to &lt; 4.5 years on the

               -  Hypothyroidism

          -  Cardiac or vascular disease, including the following:

               -  Cardiac dysfunction (abnormal echocardiogram [ECHO] including left ventricle [LV]
                  mass) at Screening Visit

               -  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

               -  Congenital heart disease

               -  Cerebrovascular disease, aortic insufficiency

               -  Clinically significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias

          -  Current treatment with antihypertensive medications, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II
             receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac
             glycosides, systemic anticholinergic agents, any medication that may impair or enhance
             compensatory tachycardia, drugs known to alter renal function that is expected to
             continue for the duration of the study

          -  Have been treated with growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or
             anabolic steroids in the previous 6 months or long-term treatment (&gt; 3 months) at any
             time

             sequelae.

          -  Have any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high
             risk of poor compliance with the visit schedule or of not completing the study.

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, would interfere
             with study participation</exclusivecriteria>
