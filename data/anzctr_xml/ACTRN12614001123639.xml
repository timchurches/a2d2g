  <interventions>
    <interventions>Weight loss - self directed or through weight loss clinic. Diet included any type of caloric restriction, and exercise included any type of exercise in which it was possible to quantify the recommended activity. 

According to recent AHA/ACC guidelines for the management of obesity in adults, any weight loss &gt;3% is considered meaningful reduction and compared from weight loss &lt;3% or weight gain group. To determine the dose response effect of weight loss (WL), groups were divided into Group-1 (&gt;10% WL), Group-2 (3-9% WL) and Group-3 (&lt;3% WL or weight gain). 

For the purpose of these analyses, weight fluctuation (WF) was defined a priori as at least a 2% weight cycle (Gain and loss or loss and gain). For the assessment of the effect of WF we have divided the patients into Wide (&gt;5% WF) Average (2-5% WF) and stable (&lt;2% WF) during the yearly follow up for 5 years.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), in sex specific metabolic equivalents (METs), was estimated from a symptom-limited maximal treadmill exercise test (EST) using standard Bruce protocol at baseline and final follow up.

These outcomes will be assessed at baseline and final follow up of the patient. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It remains unclear whether obesity itself or its accompanying co-morbidities are causative in the development of the favourable substrate for atrial fibrillation. The exact mechanisms remain the subject of current research. There is preliminary data suggesting a reversal of this substrate following interventional weight loss strategies. Intensive weight reduction strategies may play a role in reversing the adverse electromechanical substrate and thus complementing concurrent therapies, pharmacotherapy or catheter-based.
In this observational clinical study, we propose to evaluate the effects of weight loss on the substrate predisposing to AF (clinically collected maps) and arrhythmia burden (during routine follow up).
