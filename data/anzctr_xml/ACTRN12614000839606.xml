    <studytitle>An Implementation Project to Improve Identification Of Altered Mood for People Hospitalised After Acute Stroke</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Will patients with acute stroke who are admitted to a hospital providing the mood identification program have a greater likelihood of having altered mood identified than patients  in hospitals providing standard care and when compared to an historical control period?

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with stroke and TIA admitted to intervention sites will be observed (from admission onwards) and screened (after 5 days) for altered mood. Screening will be undertaken using the Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale (HADS) or for those with cognition/ communication issues the Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety (BOA) and Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire Hospital Version (SADQ-H10) tools. These will be repeated as clinically indicated. Staff will be trained in observation and screening. Evidence of identification of altered mood, including screen scores, will be recorded in the medical record. </interventions>
    <comparator>The National Stroke Foundation Audit data from 2011 and 2013 will be used as historical comparative data for both Intervention and Control sites.
Both groups will also undertake a prospective, pre-implementation  file audit for all patients admitted with stroke or TIA over a 5 week period.
The intervention will then be implemented at the Intervention sites, while the Control sites will continue with business as usual. No changes regarding identify altered mood will be trialled at these sites.
A repeat of the file audit will be undertaken at Intervention and Control sites 5 months after commencing the intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Altered mood is a common problem after stroke and can impact on stroke survivors recovery. Despite this it is often
poorly identified by health professionals. Accessing psychology services after stroke is an enormous issue with
only 12% of acute services having access to clinical psychology and 29% having protocols for referral to psychology.
This pilot, implementation study aims to improve the identification of suspected altered mood in patients with stroke
admitted to Hunter New England Health (HNEH) hub services. It will trial standardised processes and tools, supported by training for clinicians. Identification processes will commence early in the acute setting and continue during the stroke survivor's inpatient stay in HNEH hub facilities. Results from identifying suspected altered mood will be included in the patient discharge summary. This controlled, pre and post-implementation cohort design study will include comparisons to historical audit data and control sites. </summary>
