    <interventions>Low osmolarity ORS and zinc supplements to treat acute diarrhoea will be provided through health care facilities public and private. Additionally, in the intervention study areas, access to low osmolarity ORS and zinc supplements will be provided to children suffering from acute diarrhoea through the sale of Diarrhoea Treatment Kits (DTK) at a modest price using Part II Pharmacy outlets or village retail shops. These alternative delivery strategies will be used in the study areas for 1 year.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a community cluster-randomized operational study to evaluate the use of low osmolarity ORS and zinc as a treatment modality during acute diarrhoea in children aged one month to 5 years. During the course of the operational study in both the intervention study area and in the control study area low osmolarity ORS and zinc supplements to treat acute diarrhoea will be provided through health care facilities public and private. However, in the intervention study areas additional access to low osmolarity ORS and  zinc supplements and will be provided to children suffering from acute diarrhoea through the sale of Diarrhoea Treatment Kits (DTK) at a modest price using Part II Pharmacy outlets or village retail shops. 
A baseline, midterm and end-of-intervention household and health facility surveys will be undertaken to determine the characteristics related to the treatment of an episode of acute diarrhoea in a child less than five years of age. The study will be undertaken in Bagamoyo and Kisarawe Districts for Tanzania Mainland.</summary>
