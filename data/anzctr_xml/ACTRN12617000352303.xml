  <interventions>
    <interventions> This stepped-wedge trial will be conducted in two cancer-specific telephone counselling services and will assess the comparative effectiveness of: i) Treatment as Usual (Arm 1): single-stage distress screening and unstructured referral to Cancer Council internal services; compared with ii) Structured Care (Arm 2): multi-stage distress screening and a structured referral model with follow up monitoring. Both Treatment as Usual (Arm 1) and Structured Care (Arm 2) will be delivered by trained consultants during the course of an inbound telephone call to the New South Wales and Victorian Cancer Councils 13 11 20 Cancer Information and Support service.

According to the stepped wedge design, the Structured Care (Arm 2) intervention will be rolled out sequentially over 3 6-month time periods: 1) all consultants will deliver Usual Care (Arm 1) from 0-6 months, 2) half of the consultants will be randomised to deliver Structured Care (Arm 2) and half will continue to deliver Usual Care (Arm 1) from 7-13 months, and 3) all consultants will deliver Structured Care (Arm 2) from 14-20 months. Accounting for a 1-month wash in period between each time period, the trial will be 20 months.  

Arm 1 (Treatment as Usual): Depending on the course of the conversation, callers may be offered any of the following existing services by Cancer Council consultants: i) Online peer-based support and information; ii) Face-to-face support groups where people affected by cancer support each other; iii) One-to-one telephone support from a person who has recovered from a similar experience; iv) Telephone support group meetings of 3-7 members and qualified facilitators twice a month; v) referral to social work, legal, financial or transport assistance; vi) cancer survivor programs; vii) information resources; or viii) referral to a counsellor/psychologist. Callers may be offered one or more of these services based on the consultants clinical judgement and the caller's level of distress which is measured by a single-item screening tool (the Distress Thermometer [DT]). 

Arm 2 (Structured Care): Consultants who are randomised to Arm 2 will administer a two-stage screening process (the DT plus PHQ-4). Based on these results, the consultant will refer to the structured care model and offer the caller those services which align with their level of distress (i.e mild, moderate or severe). The structured care model was developed specifically for this study by the University of Newcastle research team, Cancer Council NSW, and Cancer Council Victoria. Development included: i) a review of existing distress screening and management guidelines including the NCCN guidelines; 2) iterative discussion with place card mapping and think aloud methodology; and 3) pilot-testing.
The structured care model can be supplemented with an additional follow-up call involving repeat screening and further support for those with elevated or unchanged distress scores (i.e. stepped care). Those callers with moderate to severe distress will be offered this additional outbound call; if accepted, the call will be scheduled at least two weeks following the initial inbound call and dependant on other events (such as start or completion of treatment). 

Callers allocated to Arm 1 (Treatment as Usual) will not be denied any services. Rather, callers within Arm 1 will not be assessed for service suitability in the systematic and structured fashion which will be the case for Arm 2 (Structured Care).

Intervention fidelity: To assess consultants fidelity to administering the DT (Arm 1 and 2), the PHQ-4 (Arm 2 only), and the structured care model (Arm 2 only), the research team will review a random sample of audio recordings. Furthermore, using the Client Record Management Systems it will be possible to audit the proportion of calls in which DT or PHQ-4 scores were recorded; participants will also be asked to report which services were offered during their call at a 3- and 6-month follow up survey. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (control): Consultants randomised to this group will refer callers to services based on their clinical judgement and DT scores. Those callers who receive Treatment as usual will not be denied any services. Rather, these callers will not be assessed for service suitability in the systematic and structured fashion which will be the case for the Structured Care group (intervention). </comparator>

      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2 (distress). General psychological distress will be measured by the GHQ-28 (General Health Questionnaire-28) which is a widely used, self-report measure of general psychological distress. The measure takes approximately 5 minutes to complete and uses 28 items to assess perception of health in terms of ability to: play a useful part in life; make decisions; overcome difficulties; enjoy normal activities; face problems; and feel confident, worthwhile, and happy over the last 4 weeks.  The GHQ-28 has excellent internal consistency, diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity: 0.93; specificity: 0.92), and test-retest reliability. The measure has been validated and used in the Australian community and with cancer patients.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>This trial is a stepped wedge design with all: a) consultants delivering Treatment as Usual for the first six months; b)half of consultants randomised to deliver Structured Care for the second 6 month data collection period; and, c) all remaining consultants delivering Structured Care for the last 6 month data collection period. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to assess referral uptake rates. Differences between GHQ-28 scores for the intervention and comparison group will be tested using a generalised linear model. The outcome in the models will be the GHQ-28 scores at 3 and 6 months, and the model will include terms for the intervention group, the interaction between the intervention group and time, which will allow the effect of the intervention on the outcome to be different at 3 and 6 months. A comparative effectiveness analysis will be completed to assess the differences in service provider costs between the two groups. 

The trial aims to recruit a total of 1512 participants; this represents approximately 63 callers per consultant for each 6-month time period in the stepped wedge design and accounts for a 70% consent rate with 10% attrition at each data collection period. This sample size will provide the study with approximately 80% power to detect a difference of 0.3 standard deviations in the mean score of the GHQ-28 between the two study groups at an alpha level of 0.05 and assuming an intra-cluster correlation of 0.04. Effect sizes of 0.3 standard deviations or greater have been achieved in psychosocial support interventions using the GHQ-28 as an outcome measure.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a two-step distress screening process and a referral model can improve individuals use of supportive services and reduce their levels of distress after contacting the Cancer Council 13 11 20 Information and Support line. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with cancer or care for someone with cancer, reside in Victoria or New South Wales, and are telephoning the Cancer Council 13 11 20 line. 

Study details
Individuals affected by cancer (patients, family members, or friends) who call the Cancer Council New South Wales (NSW) or Victoria 13 11 20 services will receive distress screening as part of routine practice. CIS consultants will be randomised to deliver either: i) Treatment as Usual - provision of information, referral to emotional support or instrumental services based on a single distress question and consultants judgement; or ii) Structured care  an additional 4 screening questions and a referral model, based on the callers level of distress. Participants will be contacted at 3 and 6 months after this call to complete a survey exploring distress levels, service use, and the impact of health education. 

Structured care is not yet a feature of community-level cancer support services. The new knowledge that would be produced by this study will directly inform decisions about whether or not such a model is adopted by Cancer Councils in NSW and Victoria. The project will directly contribute to improving the performance of telephone support services for cancer patients nationally and internationally. </summary>
