Treatment: devices: AQUABEAM System
To utilizes proprietary heat-free high-pressure waterjet technology to resect and remove prostate tissue using the AQUABEAM system, which is a personalized image-guided tissue removal system.

Treatment: surgery: Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP)
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is a type of prostate surgery done to relieve moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: Adverse Events Comparisons using Clavien-Dindo Grading System - The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects with adverse events rated as probably or definitely related to the study procedure classified as Clavien-Dindo Grade 2 or higher or any Grade 1 event resulting in persistent disability (e.g. ejaculatory disorder or erectile dysfunction) evidenced through 3 months post treatment. Note that the Clavien-Dindo classification scheme is for grading postoperative complications not events that reflect lack of effective treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three months post-treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: Comparisons of IPSS - The primary effectiveness endpoint is the IPSS change score from baseline to 6 months.</outcome>

    <summary>A prospective multicenter randomized blinded study comparing Aquablation of the prostate with
      the AQUABEAM System and TURP for the treatment of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS). The
      primary endpoints for safety and effectiveness will be measured at 3 and 6 months,
      respectively, and subjects will be followed out to 3 years to collect long-term clinical
