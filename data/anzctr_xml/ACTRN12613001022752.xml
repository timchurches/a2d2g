  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 14C UBT is a non-invasive method with remarkable reliability. The 14C UBT used method for detecting H. pylori infections.
1. To prevent contamination from urease-producing resident flora in the mouth, patients brushed their teeth before the test. After overnight fasting (at least 4 hours), the patients swallowed 37 kBq (1 micro Ci) of an encapsulated form of C-14 (Helicap TM, Kibion, Uppsala, Sweden) with 50 mL of water. Breath samples were collected using a special dry cartridge system (Heliprobe BreathCard TM, Kibion, Uppsala, Sweden) at 10 minutes. Patients exhaled into the cartridge until the indicator membrane changed color from orange to yellow. The breath card was then inserted into a special Geiger-Muller counter (Heliprobe TM -analyser, Kibion, Stockholm, Sweden) and the activity counted for 250 seconds. The results were expressed both as counts per minute (CPM) and as grade (O: not infected, CPM &lt; 25; 1: equivocal, CPM: 2550; 2: infected, CPM &gt; 50).
2. a) Completion of the test time is about 10 minutes
b) The test is undertaken in each participant on one occasion only.
3. Each participant was observed until the test result</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: To investigate the association between glaucoma and H. pylori infection by testing for the presence of H. pylori infection in patients with glaucoma using the 14C urea breath test. 
Methods: A comparison was made regarding H. pylori positivity using 14C urea breath testing (UBT) between a group of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and a control group with normal intraocular pressure and no finding of glaucomatous optic disc. 
Results: The 14C urea breath test was positive in 18 (51.42%) out of 35 patients in the glaucoma group and in 15 (42.85%) out of 35 patients in the control group. The positivity rates were similar between the glaucoma and control groups and there was no significant difference between the groups (p&gt;0.05).      
Conclusion: According to the 14C urea breath test, there is no association between primary open-angle glaucoma and H. pylori.
