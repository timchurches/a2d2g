    <summary>Phase 1

This trial investigates the safety and feasibility of escalating doses of mesenchymal stem cells (multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types) in people with life-threatening disease requiring umbilical cord blood transfusion.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have a life threatening disease  either leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma  requiring umbilical cord blood transfusion.  There are only nine participants in this trial.

Trial details
Participants will receive an infusion of mesenchymal stem cells.  There will be three groups of three people only, given different doses of mesenchymal stem cells. Infusion toxicity will be measured up to 4 hours after transfusion. Adverse events including infection and recurrence of cancer up to 2 years after transfusion will also be measured. This trial aims to test the safety and feasibility of treatment with mesenchymal stem cells.

The study will test the safety and feasibility of manufacturing mesenchymal stem cells from the placentas of women undergoing elective Caesarean section and transplanting the cells into people with life threatening blood cancers. The placentas would otherwise be discarded.</summary>
