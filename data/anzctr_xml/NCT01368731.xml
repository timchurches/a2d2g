  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Prophylactic use of coagulation therapy

No Intervention: nil prophylactic coagulation - 

Active Comparator: Prophylactic coagulation - 


Treatment: surgery: Prophylactic use of coagulation therapy
The procedure is completed as per usual, and if the patient has been randomized to the intervention group the appropriate coagulation therapy will be applied immediately after standard EMR to visible vessels within the mucosal resection area.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis of this study is that prophylactic coagulation therapy with coagulation
      forceps to visible vessels within the mucosal defect for colonic Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
      (EMR) will reduce the rate of delayed bleeding when compared with current established
      standard EMR technique.</summary>
