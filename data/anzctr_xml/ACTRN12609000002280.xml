    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the effect of E7080 on the objective tumor response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Months 2, 4, 6, 8 and every two months until all participants have completed 8 cycles of treatment or are off study treatment which ever occurs first.</timepoint>

An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. For this study the medicinal product is E7080.) and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular vital signs measurements and physical examinations; Holter monitoring; 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram evaluations; and regular monitoring of hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis values.)</outcome>

    <summary>The primary purpose is to determine the effect of E7080 on the objective response rate (ORR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by independent imaging review (IIR) and determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in the patients with medullary thyroid cancer [MTC] or radioiodine (131I) refractory/resistant differentiated thyroid cancer[DTC].</summary>
