  <interventions>
    <interventions>Hair sparing whole brain radiotherapy with volumetric modulated arc therapy will be delivered to all participants for the study at the Radiation Oncology Department at Mater Sydney Hospital. All patients will undergo radiotherapy planning, simulation and contouring, conducted by experienced radiation planners and oncologists. All patients will be treated with whole brain radiotherapy 30 Gy in 15 fractions, given one fraction maximum per day. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)  will be delivered via arcs. The numbers of VMAT arcs used will be radiation planner dependent. Hippocampal avoidance (HA) may be attempted if clinically indicated, with a mean dose to hippocampus not exceeding 9 Gy and maximum dose of 14 Gy. Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to metastases of 45Gy in 15 fractions may also be added if clinically indicated. </interventions>
    <comparator>Two bald patients will make up the control group. Two bald control patients who require whole brain radiotherapy for brain metastases will receive hair sparing whole brain radiotherapy with volumetric modulated arc therapy as per the intervention group at the Radiation Oncology Department at Mater Sydney Hospital. Control patients will undergo radiotherapy planning, simulation and contouring, conducted by experienced radiation planners and oncologists. Control patients will be treated with whole brain radiotherapy 30 Gy in 15 fractions, given one fraction maximum per day. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)  will be delivered via arcs. The numbers of VMAT arcs used will be radiation planner dependent. Hippocampal avoidance (HA) may be attempted if clinically indicated, with a mean dose to hippocampus not exceeding 9 Gy and maximum dose of 14 Gy. Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to metastases of 45Gy in 15 fractions may also be added if clinically indicated. Thermo Luminescent Dosimetry (TLDs) will be placed on skin surfaces within the field in first week, to validate the dose to scalp with this technique.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Twelve (12) patients will be involved in this feasibility study. Ten patients will be assessed by the clinician to have hair worth saving and will be placed on the full protocol. Two additional patients, who are bald by nature or from previous treatment, will be asked to be involved in a dosimetric study. 
The QOL endpoint of role function has been shown to deteriorate at tumour progression  and a change of 10 points is considered clinically significant. Time-to-event data will be compared between study arms using the log-rank test with a p-value of 0.05 considered significant to allow for multiple comparisons. Mean change scores and effect sizes will also be calculated from baseline to each assessment time point for relevant domains/items after formulation of a priori hypotheses by investigators with clinical or HRQL expertise, and will be compared between arms.
For the purpose of the analysis of time to deterioration in QOL, death or withdrawal from the QOL study due to inability to complete the assessments will be considered an event (i.e., deterioration in QOL) for all the QOL endpoints. Patients who do not deteriorate and remain alive or are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting volumetric modulated arc therapy hair sparing whole brain radiotherapy (VMAT HSWBRT) in cancer patients with brain metastases.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have a solid tumour or melanoma with brain metastases, for which you require whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). The trial will enrol ten patients with stable scalp hair of at least 2.5cm in length and two patients who are bald.

Study details
Standard WBRT involves the scalp receiving the full dose of radiation, damaging hair follicles and often leading to alopecia, which decreases quality of life. VMAT HSWBRT may allow for the radiation to be delivered to the metastases whilst minimising the radiation received by the scalp. For all participants, the treatment will involve attending radiotherapy planning/simulation sessions. Patients are treated with VMAT HSWBRT 30Gy in 15 fractions, one fraction delivered at each daily session. Participants will also undergo follow up visits at 4 weeks and 3 months after treatment.

It is hoped that if found to be feasible and effective, the use of VMAT HSWBRT could reduce symptoms of alopecia following WBRT for brain metastases and increase quality of life.</summary>
