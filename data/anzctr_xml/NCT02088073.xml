  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is hypothesized that ZS is more effective than placebo control (alternative hypothesis) in
      maintaining mean double-blind randomized maintenance phase (DBRMP) Day 8-29 serum potassium
      levels (3.5 - 5.0 mmol/l, inclusive) among hyperkalemic subjects in whom normokalemia was
      established during the open-label acute phase versus no difference between each ZS dose
      (highest to lowest) versus placebo control (null hypothesis).</summary>
