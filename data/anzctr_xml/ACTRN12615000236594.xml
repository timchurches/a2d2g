  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electromagnetic Millimetre Wave Therapy (EMT), originally developed in Russia, has shown promise in pain relief therapy in several randomised controlled trials conducted in the USA and Europe in the last 15 years. EMT was shown to be effective in reducing painful conditions, including joint pain, headache, postoperative pain, and neuropathic pain.
EMT involves a local exposure of the skin (2-3 cm2) to low power electromagnetic waves (&lt;20mW/cm2) in the millimetre range (30-300GHz).
Consenting patients will holds the device on Day 1 once for 15 minutes either to the localised area of pain or, in case of systemic pain, to the sternum.
EMT may have three main effects: (i) sedative and analgesic; (ii) anti-inflammatory action and enhancement of tissue generation processes and (iii) immune stimulation.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory pilot study. We aim to recruit 20 patients presenting with any type of pain (e.g. localised muscular skeletal or systemic neurological pain). Patients will receive only one EMT session. The protocol will be adjusted in accordance with recruitment and findings. The pilot study will provide mean changes and standard deviations needed for future sample size calculations.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Electromagnetic Millimetre Wave Therapy (EMT), originally developed in Russia, has shown promise in pain relief therapy in several randomised controlled trials conducted in the USA and Europe in the last 15 years. EMT was shown to be effective in reducing painful conditions, including joint pain, headache, postoperative pain, and neuropathic pain.

Aims of this study
In this study, we want to find out: 
1.	The effect of EMT on pain relief
2.	The effect of EMT on pain related quality of life
3.	The duration of pain relief by EMT
4.	The tolerability of EMT

The proposed study will be a preliminary investigation of the effectiveness of EMT in pain relief. Data will inform the proposal for a larger cohort study. 
Patients, presenting with chronic pain and attending the NIIM clinic, will be approached to participate. Pain levels and locations will be variable, in this pilot phase. Consenting patients will be treated with EMT therapy for 15 minutes. Subjective pain levels, and the impact on the quality of life will be assessed at baseline, shortly after EMT treatment, and at regular intervals for three days after the clinical session, using validated pain scales.
