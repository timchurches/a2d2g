    <concealment>Patients will attend the unit to receive the medication, they will be allocated to a treatment sequence which is described in the protocol. The sequence is concealed by allocating a number.</concealment>
    <sequence>Different combinations of FP2h, FP14 and Placebo 2 and 14 were organized.  Subjects will receive an envelope that has a letter that identifies the sequence in which the medication will be given. The objective is to avoid the researcher is involved in the sequence selection and the patients are blinded to the order in which they will receive the medication.</sequence>
