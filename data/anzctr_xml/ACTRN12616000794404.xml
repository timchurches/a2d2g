  <interventions>
    <interventions>30 minutes prior to induction of intravenous anesthesia, patients were received an ultrasound-guided serratus plane block., SPB group was performed with 0.5% ropivacaine 20ml by a single consultant anaesthetist. Patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) was starting at emergence from anaesthesia : sufentanil 3ug/kg+ tropisetron hydrochloride 0.01mg/kg (diluted with normal saline 100ml) were taken as protocol. The loading dosage was 2ml which administered at emergence from anaesthesia. , background infusion was 1ml/h; bolus dose was 1ml with 15 min lock out). The duration of PCIA  is the first 48 hours post surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Ultrasound-guided serratus plane block (SPB )was not performed before induction, and the anesthesia was applied as group SPB, and intravenous PCIA was used postoperatively. PCIA:  sufentanil 3ug/kg+ tropisetron hydrochloride 0.01mg/kg (diluted with normal saline 100ml) were taken as protocol.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer has continued to be the most common cancer afflicting women, every year, thousands of patients undergo surgery in the region of the breast and axilla. These procedures cause significant acute pain and may progress to chronic pain states in 2560% of cases .A novel ultrasound-guided anaesthetic technique that may achieve complete paraesthesia of the hemithorax.Patients were allocated to either the general anesthesia group (group control) or SPB (serratus plane block) + general anesthesia groups (group SPB) by using randomized central computer-generated sequence software (SAS 18.0). The allocation ratio was 1:1 for the two groups. Group assignment was concealed by opaque sticking envelops and was given to the researchers.We will evaluate the pain in resting state and movement state by visual analog scale (visual analogue score, VAS), and to study the effect of serratus plane block on the acute pain and chronic pain after modified radical mastectomy.We predict this technique can block primarily the thoracic intercostal nerves and to provide complete analgesia of the lateral part of the thorax. We believe that this may be a viable alternative to paravertebral blockade and thoracic epidural analgesia in this patient population,and may theoretically be associated with a more desirable side-effect profile.</summary>
