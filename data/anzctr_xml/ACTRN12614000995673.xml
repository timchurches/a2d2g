  <interventions>
    <interventions>For the study group, the beverage contained 12.5% carbohydrates (poly-carbohydrates), 50 kcal/100 mL, 285 mOsmol/kg (NutriciapreOp, Nutricia Ltd.)
The study group received 800 mL (administered orally) of carbohydrate beverage in the evening before surgery (22:00) and an additional 400 mL 2 h before anesthesia induction. </interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo group received a non-caloric colorless liquid with the same taste, without carbohydrates in the same amount as the patients in the study group. The control group did not receive any of these drinks and were subject to the traditional preoperative fasting which lasted from the night/evening before the day of the surgery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient well-being: Thirst, anxiety, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea, weakness and sleep quality were assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) scores 110.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>VAS score questionnaire was filled twice, within 24 h following the surgery (in the morning of the first postoperative day) and between 36 to 48 h following the surgery (in the morning of the second postoperative day.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of hospital stay.</outcome>
      <timepoint> The length of hospital was recorded for each patient, until the hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Convalescence: time of regaining daily activities after the operation e.g. return of bowel sounds, discharge of first flatus, first defecation, naso-gastrointestinal drainage, first oral intake,first sit out of bed, first walk with assistance, first walk without assistance,

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients were randomized into one of three groups: a study group, placebo, and control. For this purpose, a colleague blinded to the rest of the study (patients, clinical and biochemical parameters recorded during the study) was asked to prepare and label beverages according to the randomization codes. All other researchers were blinded to those codes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random order generation included simple randomization using procedure of dice-rolling, by which was created randomisation record (1P,2C, 3P, 4S, ...).
Bottles were labelled only with sequence numbers 1,2,3... </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Overall complication rate (primary outcome measure) in open surgery is known to be about 15-30%. A power analysis shows that an accrual of 93 patients in each group would allow detecting a 15% difference in the rate of complications with 80% power at the 5% level of significance. Therefore, it is required that at least 280 individuals are included in the study.
Number of participants was limited by the two year approval form Ethical Committee. In the end of the second year the trial stopped, with the total amount of patients that were able to be enrolled in the study for the period of two year time, which was insufficient to reach the goal of 280 patient, but again it was a bigger sample compared to other similar published studies in different journals around the world.
Data are presented using tabular presentations. Data processing was performed using the statistical package InStat 3 (San Diego, California, USA). The following statistics were calculated: arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean. Minimal and maximal values were also recorded. For statistical testing, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons for parametric data and the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test and the Dunn test for multiple comparisons for non-parametric data. Differences were significant for values of P &lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

    <publicnotes>After enrolling the first six participants, enrolling other participant has stopped until getting the approval of the Ethic Committee. Results from this six participant were enrolled in the evaluation of total results, and that is the reason why date of enrollment of first participant is before the ethic committee approval date. In that time Ethic Committee was in the phase of its constitution. </publicnotes>
