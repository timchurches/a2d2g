  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is going to be conducted among selected 50 patients in the late period after cerebral stroke and 40 patients with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. The study is also going to be conducted in a group of 60 healthy persons in order to calculate the gait indexes such as Gait Deviation Index (GDI) and Gait Variability Index (GVI) which require standard values obtained from the analysis of healthy individuals. The main objective of the study is to compare consistency of observational scale of gait assessment with objective method which is 3-dimensional (3D) gait analysis in patients after stroke and in children as well as youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. And thus the answer to the question whether simple, inexpensive, easy to use, observational Wisconsin Gait Scale can fully substitute very costly and require technological knowledge, time and unique equipment 3D gait analysis.
 Specific objectives:
- comparison of consistency of spatiotemporal parameters acquired during 3D gait analysis with spatiotemporal traits assessed in part one of WGS, as well as 3D kinematic parameters with the kinematic parameters in part one, two, three and four of WGS
- comparison of results of the observational WGS and the global gait indexes such as GDI and GVI, constituting objective methods of assessing gait taking into account parameters identified during 3D gait analysis
- assessment of inter- and intra-observer reliability of the WGS in observational gait analysis based on the analysis of video recording in children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and to present the possibility of using this scale in everyday practice in the case of hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients
- examination of correlations between gait assessment performed by means of the WGS and the global gait indexes GDI and GVI and Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS)
The patients' gait is going to be assessed with the use of WGS, functional level of children and youth based on GMFCS, spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters are going to be examined in Gait Laboratory with the use of BTS Smart system (6 cameras, 120 Hz) from BTS Bioengineering (BTS Bioengineering,Milan, Italy). Reference markers are going to be placed according to the internal protocol of the system (Helen Hayes (Davis) Marker Placement) on the sacrum, pelvis (anterior posterior iliac spine), femur (lateral epicondyle, great trochanter and in lower one-third of the shank), fibula (lateral malleolus, lateral condyle end in lower one-third of the shank), foot (metatarsal head and heel). The subjects are going to walk at their comfortable speed and are going to use auxiliary equipment such as canes and elbow crutches, and tripods during the evaluation. During one study 6 passes of the patient are going to be registered and, subsequently, spatio-temporal and kinematic parameters are going to be calculated with use of Tracker and Analyzer programs (BTS Bioengineering), averaging the results to a single session. The following parameters are going to be analysed: cadency, gait speed, step width, duration of swing phase and duration of stance phase of the paretic and of the non-paretic limb, gait cycle length, step length and kinematic parameters of hip, knee, and ankle joint and pelvis. Furthermore, the global gait indexes GDI and GVI is going to be calculated, which are objective methods of assessing gait taking into account parameters identified during 3D gait analysis. GDI is going to be calculated based on the kinematic parameters and the GVI based on the spatiotemporal parameters. 3D gait recording is going to be performed simultaneously with two video cameras distributed in such a way as to obtain images record in both a frontal plane and a sagittal plane. The video camera filming the view of the frontal plane is going to be located in the middle of the delineated distance, 2 metres away from the route walked by the subject. The camera filming the view of the sagittal plane is going to be placed in line with the route walked. The recording is going to be made for 6 walks, with the minimum of 3 complete gait cycles. The films available for rating and gait assessment provide right and left side, as well as back and front view of the patient. The subjects are going to be instructed to walk the defined distance at self-selected (comfortable) speed, with the support of orthopaedic aids used on a daily basis. Interpretation of the recording and gait assessment based on WGS is going to be performed independently by three experienced physiotherapists, who were trained in gait disorders affecting post-stroke and with hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients, and possess knowledge of assessment criteria used in WGS. Intra-observer reliability of the WGS in the assessment of children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy is going to be done by 3 independent researchers separately analyzing video recording, evaluation results are going to be compared between researchers. Inter-observer reliability of the WGS in the assessment of children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy is going to be done by 3 independent researchers separately twice (two weeks apart) analyzing video recording, evaluation results are going to be compared between the study 1 and 2. 
The approximate duration of each of the assessment sessions will amount to 30 minutes for the first session and 30 minutes for the second session for hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients to complete WGS.
Stroke patients will receive a single assessment session only to compare consistency of observational scale of gait assessment with objective method. Hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients will receive two assessments two weeks apart to assess inter-observer reliability of the WGS in observational gait analysis and evaluation results are going to be compared between the study 1 and 2. Inter-observer reliability of the WGS in the hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients aims at presenting the possibility of using this scale in everyday practice in the case of hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients. Single assessment session in patients after stroke results from the fact that the inter-observer reliability of the WGS in this group of patients has already been examined in the previous studies.
All patients are going to be examined in the same laboratory by the same people and with the use of the same equipment. The observation period is 3 months. The observation period refers to total recruitment of all participants.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy individuals will complete only a single assessment session, including 3D gait analysis based on which the gait indexes such as Gait Deviation Index (GDI) and Gait Variability Index (GVI) will be calculated, which requires standard values obtained from analysis of the healthy individuals. GDI will be calculated based on the kinematic 3D parameters and the GVI based on the spatiotemporal 3D parameters.
The second comparator is 3D gait analysis which constitutes the golden standard in this field since it provides reliable numerical data representing temporal, spatial and kinematic gait parameters. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gait assessment with the use of the Wisconsin Gait Scale. 
WGS assesses fourteen observable gait parameters, divided into four subscales related to the specific gait phases: stance phase, toe off phase, swing phase and heel strike phase of the affected leg; it also takes into account the use of orthopaedic aids while walking. The specific components of the scale focus on assessment of spatiotemporal (subscale one), as well as kinematic parameters of gait (subscale one, two, three and four). Scores assigned to all the items of the scale are in the range from 1 to 3, except for the first item which is graded from 1 to 5, and the eleventh item graded from 1 to 4. The scores are in the range from 13.35 to 42 points. Higher scores reflect greater gait impairments.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The inspiration for research is the fact that in the literature there is scarcity of reports focusing on assessment of correspondence between observational gait scales and objective data, in particular acquired from 3D gait analysis, and the authors underline the importance of these comparisons, suggesting that more research is needed to more comprehensively analyze the psychometric properties of the Wisconsin Gait Scale in patients with diverse neurological disorders, other than stroke. Another reason was the fact that classifications taking into account participation in a social life, activity, as well as secondary alterations children with cerebral palsy are available in the literature but there are few scales focused on multivariate assessment of the walking pattern of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy.
The main objective of the study is to compare consistency of observational scale of gait assessment with objective method wich is 3D gait analysis and the global gait indexes GDI, GVI in patients after stroke and in children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. And thus the answer to the question whether simple, inexpensive, easy to use, observational Wisconsin Gait Scale can fully substitute very costly and require technological knowledge, time and unique equipment 3D gait analysis. The objective of the study is also an assessment of inter- and intra-observer reliability of the Wisconsin Gait Scale in observational gait analysis based on the analysis of video recording in children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and to present the possibility of using this scale in everyday practice in the case of hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients. Research is going to be conducted in gait laboratory University of Rzeszow. Patients recruited to the study are going to be stroke survivors, over 6 months from the onset of ischaemic stroke, who are able to walk unassisted and children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy who are able to walk unassisted. Gait assessment based on WGS are going to be performed independently by three experienced physiotherapists, with the use of video recordings. Assessment of temporospatial, kinematic parameters and global gait indexes GDI, GVI is going to be based on gait analysis performed with BTS Smart system. Moreover, assessment of functional level of children and youth with hemiplegic cerebral palsy is going to be based on GMFCS. The expected effect of the research has practical dimension, efforts to find a tool that is going to be compared to the objective methods but cheaper, easy to use and available for use in everyday clinical practice.
