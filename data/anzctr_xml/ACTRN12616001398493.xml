  <interventions>
    <interventions>Self-help behavioural activation (BA) remotely supported by telephone vs usual care.

Participants randomised to BA will be mailed a specifically-designed self help workbook titled "Helping you to maintain a positive mood in older age". The workbook is based on clear principles of an evidence supported psychological treatment for depression in later life. It outlines relevant information about depression and offers guidance on how to identify depressive symptoms and take action to improve mental wellbeing. In particular, the booklet outlines how to monitor activities, keep a balance between activities and recognise the connection between activity and mood.

To offer support to participants and optimise adherence to the intervention, a behavioural activation therapist will telephone participants on 3 occasions throughout the course of the 8 week program (first call within 2 weeks of randomisation than at week 4 and week 8) with a 4 week interval period between each call. The approximate duration of these telephone sessions will be 20-30 minutes and participants will be asked to complete activities from the workbook during the 4 week interval periods. The BA therapist will encourage participants to complete all relevant activities and participants can spend as much time as they wish completing each relevant stage through the work book.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Medical Care - Usual care received from the participants General Practitioner and any other care the participant may be receiving from other services.

Control participants will receive a copy of the Behavioural Activation self-help booklet at the end of the study. This will be once the final participant recruited into the study has returned their 52 week follow up health &amp; lifestyle questionnaire which assesses the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001) and the brief measure for assessing Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006).</comparator>

    <concealment>20,000 randomly selected men and women from the Western Australian electoral roll aged 65 years or over residing in regional and remote Western Australia will be posted a project information sheet, consent form, health screening questionnaire and replied paid envelope.

Respondents who return their questionnaires and respond in the affirmative to one of two of the “Whooley” questions contained within the screening questionnaire will be contacted by study staff to confirm eligibility, answer any questions and complete assessment for the presence of a Major Depressive episode utilising the SCID- I. The TICSm will also be administered to ascertain evidence of cognitive impairment. 

Participants who meet study entry criteria including the presence of subsyndromal depression (as evidenced by their affirmative answer to one of the Whooley questions and because they do not fulfill criteria for the diagnosis of a Major Depressive episode according to the SCID 1), will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

Standard Medical Care or Standard Medical Care and Behavioural Activation Intervention

Due to the nature of the study, participants in the intervention group and the behaviour therapist facilitating their efforts will not be blinded to group allocation. Research staff assessing end points (SCID-1) will be blinded and will not have access to information detailing the participant's group status.</concealment>
    <sequence>Group allocation will occur according to a list of random numbers generated by computer.  The list will be generated and centrally maintained by the University of Western Australia's Centre for Software Practice, which will have no direct contact with participants.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will follow CONSORT guidelines. We will use standard descriptive statistics to compare basic sociodemographic and clinical data across treatment arms. We will examine the proportion of participants in each study group who converted to a Major Depressive Episode over the 52 week follow up period   with analysis of contingency tables and logistic regression. We will use imputation methods (ICE) to examine the primary outcome on an intention-to-treat basis. Multilevel mixed models will be employed to investigate changes in PHQ-9, GAD-7 and SF-12 scores over 52 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Symptoms of low mood and depression are common in later life and can include; feeling sad, empty or down, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, poor concentration and thoughts about death. There is now evidence that depression is 23% more frequent among people living in regional Australia than in the city, possibly because of difficulty accessing relevant health services.  

When feeling low, a persons motivation to do things can decrease. Some may find that they give up hobbies or activities previously enjoyed, and over time might end up doing very little. This can lead to a further decline in mood and start a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break.  One of the ways of overcoming depression and low mood is by changing behaviour, such as gradually increasing activity levels. The results of several studies show that the more activities people engage in the better they feel. Behavioural Activation (BA) interventions encourage participants to meaningfully increase their engagement in activities with the aim of improving mood and sense of achievement. 

The current pilot study is seeking to test out (pilot) whether a supported self-help behavioural activation intervention designed for older Western Australians living in regional and remote areas is effective at: preventing the onset of depression among those with some depressive symptoms. The results will be used to improve the program and make it ready for a full clinical trial so that definitive evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention can be obtained.

Specific aim of definitive trial:
To determine the effect of a  BA intervention on the 1 year incidence rate of Major Depression in  older adults with subsyndromal  depression living in regional Western Australia.
