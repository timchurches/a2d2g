    <comparator>The sequence of pressure measurements will alternate in the pattern: Patient 1 - Head up, flat, head down. Patient 2 - Flat, head down, head up. Patient 3 - Head down, head up, flat. And so forth.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hepatic venous pressure - as measured via a 23 gauge cannula inserted into the middle hepatic vein prior to hepatic resection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three measurements in each position (head up, flat, head down).  Two minutes will separate each measurement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship between hepatic vein pressures and central venous pressures (CVP). Traditionally, CVP is measured and interventions are made to lower this pressure.  However, it is the intra-hepatic venous pressure that is more important in preventing blood loss during resection. We will correlated the measured intra-hepatic pressure with the patient's CVP at that time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each of the three measurements will be compared with the central venous pressure at the time of measurement.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Blood loss is a common complication of liver resection surgery.  One intervention to reduce this is by lowering central venous pressure (CVP) by having the patient slightly head up.  The limitation with this is that it is not CVP that effects blood loss but rather liver venous pressure.  Although this is likely to be influenced by a patient's CVP, they are not the same pressure.  

We aim to see the relationship between position  and hepatic venous pressures (measured by direct cannulation of the middle hepatic vein during surgery) as well as relationship between this pressure and the patient's CVP at the time of measurement.</summary>
