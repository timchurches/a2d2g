over the counter in Australian supermarkets and chemists.
Participants will be given a tablet log to mark off each day, once they have taken their supplement.  All remaining tablets, along with the log, will be returned at the end of the supplementation period to monitor compliance.

To have 80% chance of detecting an effect size of this magnitude (F=.15) in a two armed study (multivitamin, placebo) with at least  3 time points (baseline, 1 hour post-treatment, 1 month post treatment) a total sample of 75 participants would be required (alpha level = .05). To account for a 15% drop out rate, 86 participants will be included in the study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Whilst the importance of diet on health and well-being has long been established, there has been a recent interest in the effects of nutritional status on mood and memory. For instance, deficiencies in a number of nutrients have been associated with poorer mood. For this reason researchers have focused on the role of vitamins and minerals including folate, vitamins B12, B6 and zinc in the treatment of mood and stress disorders, as well as a way to improve cognition (i.e. memory, attention, mental function), general well-being and quality of life. Previous research studies have shown that taking a multivitamin for at least one month may improve the mood, general well-being and cognition of middle aged and older adults. This study will investigate the effects of a Womens 50+ multivitamin supplement on mood, cognition and well-being.   </summary>
