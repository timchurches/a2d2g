  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It was a parallel group, single blinded, randomized clinical trial, in a multicenter study, carried out from December 2012 to March 2013, at Dermatology departments of two tertiary care referral centers i.e. Madina Teaching hospital and DHQ hospital, Faisalabad. All patients with perniosis were screened and all eligible patients (according to inclusion and exclusion criteria), who gave written informed consent to participate in the trial were enrolled. 
They were randomizd into either group A (topical GTN 0.4% cream) or group B (oral nifedipine, 10-40mg/day) by concealed random allocation (sealed envelopes) according to the sequence generated by computerized random tables. They were evaluated for improvement in signs and symptoms and any side effects, weekly till complete recovery. Complete resolution of signs and symptoms was taken as the end point. Primary outcome was better efficacy and secondary outcome was side effects.
