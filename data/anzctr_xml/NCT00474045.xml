Experimental: Insulin detemir - Individually adjusted insulin detemir injected subcutaneously as basal insulin + individually adjusted insulin aspart injected subcutaneously as bolus insulin from randomisation (gestational week 8-12) and continued until 6 weeks after delivery. If a subject was not pregnant at randomisation, treatment was given up to a maximum of 52 weeks. For subjects who became pregnant, randomised treatment was continued until 6 weeks after delivery. Subjects who were not pregnant at 52 weeks after randomisation were withdrawn

Active Comparator: Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin - Individually adjusted NPH insulin injected subcutaneously as basal insulin + individually adjusted insulin aspart injected subcutaneously as bolus insulin from randomisation (gestational week 8-12) and continued until 6 weeks after delivery. If a subject was not pregnant at randomisation, treatment was given up to a maximum of 52 weeks. For subjects who became pregnant, randomised treatment was continued until 6 weeks after delivery.
