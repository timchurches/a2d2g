  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CSL's IVV Overall Vaccine Efficacy (VE) Versus Placebo Through Assessment of Incidence of Laboratory Confirmed Influenza A/B Infection - Incidence of Laboratory Confirmed Influenza A/B infection was assessed per the study population in the 2008 and 2009 Southern Hemisphere influenza seasons.
Vaccine efficacy = 100 x (1 - ratio of incidence rate). Ratio of incidence rate = active Study Vaccine recipient infection rate / placebo recipient infection rate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2008 and 2009 Southern Hemisphere influenza seasons, until 30 November 2009</timepoint>

      <outcome>CSL's IVV Vaccine Efficacy Versus Placebo Through Assessment of Incidence of Laboratory Confirmed Influenza A/B Infection Due to Strains Matched to Vaccine Strains - Incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza A/B infection due to strains matched to vaccine strains was assessed per the study population in the 2008 and 2009 Southern Hemisphere influenza seasons.
Vaccine efficacy = 100 x (1 - ratio of incidence rate). Ratio of incidence rate = active Study Vaccine recipient infection rate / Placebo recipient infection rate.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) - The criteria for the protocol defined ILI were as follows:
At least one respiratory symptom:
cough, sore throat or nasal congestion
And at least one systemic symptom:
fever (as defined by oral temperature = 37.8°C (100.0°F), or feverishness (as defined by participant's subjective feeling of fever), chills or body aches.
The CDC ILI case definition was the occurrence of fever (100°F [37.8°C] or higher) in conjunction with either cough or sore throat.</outcome>
