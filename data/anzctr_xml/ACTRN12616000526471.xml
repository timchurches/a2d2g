    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate (4 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 7 consecutive days) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection.. The treatment was taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. The drug was tested in one site. Eligibile subjects were treated for 7 days days and followed up for 28 days.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of treatment failures (early treatment failure + late clinical failure +late parasitological failure) and adequate clinical and parasitological responses. This was composite primary outcome.

Enrolled patients were assessed for parasitological (using microscopy) and clinical (axillary temperature equal or more 37.5 centigrade) responses during the 28 days follow-up. Standard physical examination was performed and axillary temperature was measured  at baseline, during the treatment and post-treatment over 28 days.  Thick and thin blood films were collected  and examined at baseline, during the treatment and post-treatment over 28 days. 
Treatment outcomes was classified according to the latest WHO protocol (WHO 2009:.World Health Organization. Methods for surveillance of antimalarial drug efficacy).</outcome>

      <outcome>Percent of adverse event was documented. 
The known adverse events of artesunate are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dizziness, nausea, vomiting.

Parents or guardians of all enrolled patients was asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients was evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events was recorded on the case report form.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The estimated prevalence of patients positive at day 3 after Artesunate  in the area was below 15%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 15%, a minimum of 40 must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, a number of 50 patients was targeted in the study.

WHO excel software program was used for data management and analysis. Data was analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition patients was considered withdrawn from the analysis due to consent withdrawal, failure to complete treatment, enrolment violation, voluntary and involuntary protocol violation and if the PCR results was unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure was due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.

The final analysis included:
* a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
* a description of all the patients included in the study;
* the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
* the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
* the proportion of patients positive on day 3 (72 hours after treatment) 
* the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
* Proportion of patients carrying K13 mutations

    <summary>Title: Assessment of parasite clearance rate in Plasmodium falciparum malaria induced by Artesunate in Guyana.

Purpose: To assess the efficacy, including parasite clearance time, and safety of artesunate 7 day treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria

Objective: To assess the efficacy, including parasite clearance time, and safety 7 days artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections

Study Sites: study was conducted in Malaria Clinic, Georgetown, Guyana

Study Period: The study was conducted from March to December 2014

Study Design: Single arm prospective study.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged 2 years and above with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection 

Sample Size: 50 patients.

Treatments and follow-up: Artesunate (daily dose for 7 days) was be given.

Clinical and parasitological parameters was monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

Primary endpoints: (i) the proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy;  (ii) the proportion of patients positive on day 3 and parasite clearance time; Recrudescence was to be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 

Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
