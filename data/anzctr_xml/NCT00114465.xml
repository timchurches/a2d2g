  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects should have a definitive diagnosis of colonic CD or small bowel and colonic
             CD based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and pathological findings.

          -  Subjects should have a CDAI score &lt;150 at week 0

          -  Patients receiving the following treatment are eligible:

             5 aminosalicylates, if the dose remained constant for 4 weeks before the screening
             visit and had been used continuously for 8 weeks before screening and the patient has
             previously flared whilst on the medication; Azathioprine/6MP, if the dose remained
             constant for 8 weeks prior to the screening visit and had been used continuously for
             12 weeks before screening and the patient has previously flared whilst on the
             medication. Proprietary probiotic preparations must be stopped at least two weeks
             prior to starting the trial preparation.

          -  Concomitant use of any other immunosuppressant eg. Methotrexate, tacrolimus,
             cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, must be at a stable dose of 8 weeks continuous
             use for 12 weeks prior to screening and the patient has previously flared whilst on
             the medication.

          -  Subjects must demonstrate their willingness to participate in the study and comply
             with the proceedings by signing a written informed consent.

          -  Men and women =18 to &lt; 75 years of age of any race and gender

          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease, other than Crohn's
             disease, that would interfere with the study's evaluations.

          -  Subjects should understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules;
             and agree to record symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant medications
             and adverse events accurately and consistently in a daily diary.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients should not be enrolled into the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          -  Patients with Ulcerative colitis

          -  Patients with fistulising CD or isolated small bowel CD

          -  Patients with a CDAI =150 at week 0

          -  Patients on prednisone, budesonide or any form of corticosteroids for the treatment of
             CD.

          -  Serious infections, such as hepatitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis in the previous 3
             months. Less serious infections in the previous 3 months, such as acute upper
             respiratory tract infection (colds) or uncomplicated urinary tract infection need not
             be considered exclusions at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             haematological, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological or cerebral disease.

    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of the probiotic VSL#3 versus
      placebo, in addition to standard maintenance drugs, in maintaining remission in Crohn's
      disease (CD).

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To determine the time till flare of CD patients on VSL#3 compared to placebo.

        -  To assess whether concurrent therapy with VSL#3 leads to an improvement in the quality
           of life (QOL).

        -  To assess whether concurrent therapy with VSL#3 reduces the severity of a flare if it
           occurs.</summary>
