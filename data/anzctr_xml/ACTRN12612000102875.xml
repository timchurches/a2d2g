  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two afternoons of testing, separated by at least one week, undertaking a series of tasks assessing driving performance, sustained attention and reaction time. Sessions will last for approximately three hours commencing at 14:30.

The sessions will be randomised between participants, however the testing order will be the same for both sessions: Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), Karolinska Drowsiness Task (KDT), two hour drive on racetrack at 50km/hr, PVT, KDT.

In addition, ten professional drivers will be observed carrying out their normal driving duties for 2000km. Assessments will include lane deviation and ocular measures using Optalert. Daily measures of PVT performance and KSS scores will be taken.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will partake in the same testing session twice, once when rested and once following a sustained wake period of 30 hours.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Driving performance: a 120 minute drive around a racetrack at a designated speed of 50km/hr. Ability to keep to the required speed limit and lane deviation will be assessed (via the AWS-1000 and manual observation/tally kept by driving instructor in the passenger seat).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following the first PVT and KDT tasks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ocular measures: (1) of drowsiness, via Optalert system. (2) visual scanning, via the iView-X.</outcome>
      <timepoint>(1) Optalert measures of drowsiness will be recorded across all tasks. 
(2) iView-X eye tracking device will record visual scanning during the drive only.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate which ocular measures of alertness are capable of detecting driving impairment during a two hour track driving session. Drivers will be assessed twice: once when rested and once following 30 hours of continuous wakefulness. Additional assessments of reaction time and sustained attention will be undertaken. These findings will help to determine the validity of ocular measures as a tool for fatigue detection, with the aim of reducing sleep-related motor vehicle accidents.

In addition, ten professional drivers will be observed carrying out their normal driving duties for 2000km. Assessments will include lane deviation and ocular measures using Optalert. Daily measures of PVT performance and KSS scores will be taken.</summary>
