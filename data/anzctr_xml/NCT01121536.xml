    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Armodafinil

Experimental: Armodafinil 150-200 mg/day - Participants began taking armodafinil at a dosage of 50 mg/day; the dosage was increased by 50 mg/day on days 2 and 4, up to a dosage of 150 mg/day. At the discretion of the investigator, the dosage of armodafinil may be increased to 200 mg/day on day 6 or thereafter, and reduced to 150mg/day if the higher dose is not well tolerated. Treatment was administered for six months.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) - AEs were graded by the investigator for severity on a three-point scale: mild, moderate and severe. Causality is graded as either related or not related. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in death, a life-threatening adverse event, hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event that may require medical intervention to prevent any of the previous results.
Protocol-defined adverse events requiring expedited reporting included skin rash, hypersensitivity reaction, emergent suicidal ideation or suicide attempt, and psychosis.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score - The YMRS is a clinician-rated, 11-item checklist used to measure the severity of manic episodes. Information for assigning scores is gained from the participant's subjective reported symptoms over the previous 48 hours and from clinical observation during the interview. Seven items are ranked 0 through 4 and have descriptors associated with each severity level. Four items (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive behavior) are scored 0 through 8 and have descriptors for every second increment. The total scale is 0-60. A score of =12 indicates remission of manic symptoms, and higher scores indicate greater severity of mania. Negative change from baseline scores indicate a decrease in severity of mania.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Total Score - HAM-A measures the severity of anxiety symptoms. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.

Every effort was made to have the same rater evaluate a participant across all visits.
Total scores range from 0-84, with a score of 0 indicating no depression and a score of 84 indicating the most severe depression. Negative change from baseline values indicate improvement in the severity of depression.

Total scores range from 0-27, with a score of 0 indicating no depression and a score of 27 indicating the most severe depression.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Endpoint in the Global Assessment for Functioning (GAF) Scale - The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults, e.g., how well or adaptively one is meeting various problems-in-living. Ratings of 1 - 10 mean the participant is in persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) or persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death. Ratings of 91 - 100 indicate no symptoms, and the participant exhibits superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. Positive change from baseline values indicate improvement in functioning.

             the following protocol-allowed mood stabilizers: lithium; valproic acid; olanzapine;
             quetiapine; aripiprazole; lamotrigine; risperidone; ziprasidone, (only if taken in
             combination with lithium, valproic acid, or lamotrigine). The following criteria must
             also be met:

               1. The mood stabilizers must be taken in an oral formulation, with the exception of

                  drugs is lithium, valproic acid, or lamotrigine.

               3. The patient must be judged by the investigator to be compliant with treatment
                  with the mood stabilizer(s).

               4. The patient must be willing to continue treatment with the same protocol-allowed
                  mood stabilizer(s) at dosages considered appropriate by the investigator.

          -  The patient has a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score of 14 or less at the
             enrollment visit. Patients who have a YMRS score of 12 through 14 must be discussed
