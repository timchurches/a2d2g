  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the treatment group will undergo speculum examination, the cervix will be wiped with chlorhexidine and pipelle endometrial biopsy taken between luteal days 7 to 10 (days 21 and 24 of a spontaneous 28 day cycle) preceding their IVF stimulated cycle or 4 to 7 days prior to ceasing the combined oral contraceptive pill if using a pill cross-over cycle.
This intervention will occur only once and will take approximately five minutes to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control group will undergo sham biopsy, whereby they undergo speculum examination, the cervix will be wiped with chlorhexidine and the biopsy catheter placed beside the cervix (and not into the uterus) between luteal days 7 to 10 preceding their IVF stimulated cycle or 4 to 7 days prior to ceasing the combined oral contraceptive pill if using a pill cross-over cycle.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Live Birth Rate
All patients who become pregnant as a result of participating in an IVF program are required to have pregnancy and neonatal outcomes recorded. This data is known as the Australian New Zealand Assisted Reproduction Database and is part of the National Perinatal Statistics Unit.  Patients or their doctors are contacted routinely to collect this information. This study requires the same information to be collected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At one year post randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Implantation Rate.
This will be assessed by determining the number of gestational sacs on transvaginal ultrasound at 7-8 weeks of pregnancy as is part of routine clinical practice for those patients who conceive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7-8 weeks of pregnancy or 12 weeks post randomisation</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biochemical Pregnancy Rate.
A quantitative serum hCG (using immunoassay) will be performed on Day 14 post oocyte retrieval.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 14 post oocyte collection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Pregnancy Rate.
This will be determined by the presence of a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound at 7-8 weeks of pregnancy in those women who have had a positive serum hCG on Day 14.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7-8 weeks of pregnancy or 12 weeks post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endometrial Thickness.
This will be measured by transvaginal ultrasound at the time of oocyte retrieval.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Implantation of the embryo remains a key rate limiting step for successful outcome in an IVF/ICSI cycle in women with subfertility.  Several small and heterogeneous studies have suggested that injury to the endometrium (lining of the uterus) prior to an IVF/ICSI cycle improves the clinical pregnancy rate or live birth rate.

The aim of this study is to determine whether a single endometrial biopsy prior to an IVF/ICSI cycle influences the live birth rate in women under 40 years of age who have failed to conceive a pregnancy despite having undergone at least 2 embryo transfers of reasonable quality embryos.

The study will be a large, single blind, randomised controlled trial with the above aim, whilst trying to control for many of the confounders present in previous small studies.</summary>
