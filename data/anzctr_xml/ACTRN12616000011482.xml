      <outcome>Severity of dry eye will be assessed using OSDI and bacterial burden determined by swab of skin surrounding the eye to assess changes in signs and symptoms of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) severity  in each eye of each subject before the three months' application of topical Lauricidin or placebo and after three months application of Lauricidin or placebo.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in signs and symptoms of dry eye after 3 months use of Lauricidin cream or placebo will be assessed using:
1. Questionnaire: Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) 
2. Assessment of tear lipid layer pattern using the TearScope (Keeler).
3. Assessment of the meibomian gland drop out with infra-red photography (meibography). 
4. Assessment of the morphology of the eyelids with slit-lamp biomicroscopy.
5. Phenol red thread test - lower temporal lid for 15 seconds
6. Measurement of the tear film breakup time (TFBUT) using fluorescein
7. Grading the corneal and conjunctival staining with fluorescein
8. Pressure equivalent to the eyelid force upon blinking will be applied to the lower or upper central eyelid in order to assess the expressibility of glands. Meibomian gland secretion quality and expressibillity are graded through gland expression with the Meibomian Gland Evaluator (TearScience).
9. A swab of the inferior tarsal conjunctiva using a sterile disposable q-tip. The swab sample will then immediately be stored in a sterile vial for later analysis.
Lid swabs from individuals will be cultured, and the bacteria will be isolated and identified by gram-staining. Isolated bacteria will then be grown in liquid media, and the supernatant will be extracted and used to quantify the lipase levels through colorimetric assay.

    <statisticalmethods>Using Inference for Means:Comparing Two Independent Samples sizes tool from  http://stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/index.html (quantitative) and based on a study by Abelson M, Ousler G, Nally L. Alternate reference values for tear film break-up time in normal and dry eye populations. Adv Exp Med Biol 2002;506,Part B:1121-1125. 100 subjects with normal ocular health and 100 patients with a history of dry eye. 5 Âµl of 2% fluorescein were instilled. Average of 3 readings. The mean tear film breakup time (TFBUT) for normal subjects was 7.1 s (range 4.7 to 11.4 s) and for dry eye
patients 2.2 s (range (0.9 to 5.2 s). On the basis of this, a cut-off for dry eye diagnosis of
= 5 s was recommended. When we input these data into the above tool  we obtain a sample size of 8 for each group in order to distinguish normals from dry eye patients with the cut-off for dry eye diagnosis of  5 s. So our total sample size will be 16.
TFBUT less than or equal to 5 seconds is considered dry eye;
TFBUT &gt; 5 seconds is considered  normal.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dry eye disease is characterised by chronic lack of sufficient lubrication and moisture on the surface of the eye leading from slight irritation to inflammation. Meibomian glands are lipid secreting glands present in eyelids. These lipids form the outer-most layer of multi-layered tear film and are responsible for reducing tear evaporation, defending the ocular surface from contaminants and maintaining ocular surface clarity.  In a patient with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), the lipid producing glands of the eyelids are defective, due to either obstruction or physical changes of the secretory lipids. This imbalance can cause tear film instability, which can lead to dry eye disease. Dry eye symptoms include persistent dryness, scratchiness, foreign body sensation, and can include burning sensation. As part of dry eye disease, MGD is quite common, but it is unfortunately often overlooked and undiagnosed in the clinic. Recent publications in the area of MGD illustrate the complex nature of the disease, with the underlying processes involved remaining uncertain.
It has been suggested that the bacteria that live on our skin and around our eyes might contribute to MGD by the production of an enzyme (a lipase) than can degrade the protective lipid layer of the tears and contribute to tear film instability. 
Lauricidin is an over-the-counter wellness agent, the active ingredient of which is glycerol monolaurate (GML), a naturally occurring inhibitor of bacterial lipase production. GML is found in coconut, milk and other foods and is classed by the FDA as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS). Lauricidin is sold as a skin cream containing 1% glycerol monolaurate.

This research project aims to determine whether application of Lauricidin to the skin around the eyes can improve the signs and symptoms of MGD and dry eye. Current literature on microbial factors in MGD suggests that individuals suffering from the disease have altered levels of certain naturally occurring bacteria present on the ocular surface. This results in elevated volumes of bacterial lipases and an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of normal lipids. The breakdown of the meibum lipid by lipases is believed to produce free fatty acids that contribute to the inflammatory process involved in MGD, as well as structural changes of the glands resulting in obstruction. This theoretical understanding forms the basis of a dry eye product readily available on the Australian market. Optimel (http://www.melcare.com/optimel.html). Optimel is very viscous and anecdotally stings upon application. Thus a topical formulation that can achieve similar outcomes would be desirable.  
As such, this study hopes to reveal a positive correlation between the levels of bacterial lipase and severity of MGD.</summary>
