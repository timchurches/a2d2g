  <interventions>
    <interventions>Flucloxacillin 1 g twice daily orally plus probenecid 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days
Adherence will be monitored by tablet count in blister pack</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete resolution, improvement, no change or worsening in infection surface area, redness, swelling, pain, tenderness and purulence, and in feverishness.  Surface area will be measured by FDA-recommended width x length method.  Redness, swelling and purulence will be assessed by the research assistant.  Pain, tenderness and feverishness will be assessed by visual analogue scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 48-72 hr after starting treatment, 7 to 8 days after starting treatment, and 7 to 14 days after completing treatment </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence (or not) of any treatment-associated adverse effects, including stomach upset, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, rash, itch, flushing, or joint pain.  The patient may also free-text any other possible TAAE.  </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pharmacokinetic studies show that probenecid more than doubles the T&gt;MIC90 for flucloxacillin and S. aureus and unpublished case series support the use of probenecid in this manner.  We wish to formally compare probenecid-boosted oral flucloxacillin with flucloxacillin alone in adults with mild to moderate outpatient skin infections</summary>
