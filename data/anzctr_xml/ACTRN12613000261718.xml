    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Advertisements for trial participants will be placed in Brisbane newspapers and magazines. Flyers will also be placed in local Brisbane hospitals such as the Princess Alexandra (PA) Hospital and the Mater. The trial will be advertised on the Arthritis QLD website.

Potential participants will be invited to phone or email their interest to the clinical trial co-ordinator who will assess their initial eligibility. If eligible, potential participants will be asked to attend the PA hospital to have an x-ray taken of their affected knee. If an x-ray has been taken in the previous 6 months they will not be required to have another taken, but must be able to bring their x-ray to the hospital. A rheumatologist at the PA hospital will grade the knee x-ray according to the kellgren-lawrence scale. If the grade is -2 or -3 and the participant meets all other eligibility criteria they will be invited to enrol in the study.

The investigator who will assess participant eligibility will be blinded to participant treatment group allocation. Futhermore, a block randomisation allocation sequence will be generated and held by a researcher not associated or involved with the clinical trial. As recruitment progresses, participants will be allocated to a treatment group that will be provided to the study investigator on a per-participant basis. </concealment>
    <sequence>The study statistician not associated with the recruitment phase will generate a block randomisation for a two treatment regime.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have clinically investigated GlycOmega Plus in two previous clinical trials (with no placebo arm) in participants with knee OA. Both trials demonstrated significant improvement in knee pain, stiffness and physical function at a dose of 3000mg per day for 8-12 weeks. This current trial aims to determine the clinical effectiveness of GlycOmega Plus in treating OA knee pain, stiffness and physical function at a dose of 1500mg for 12 weeks in a randomised placebo controlled design. Further we aim to assess faecal bacterial profiles to determine if participants with OA demonstrate altered bacterial growth and whether influencing bacterial growth with the supplementaion of GlycOmega Plus can be correlated to improve knee OA symptoms. </summary>
