  <interventions>
    <interventions>Childcare centre cooks in the intervention arm will be mailed a hard copy printed education material together with sections of the nutrition guidelines relevant to menu planning. The design of the printed education material will be theory informed and based on evidence from key systematic reviews in the field. The printed education material will be printed a single A4-sized, double sided and laminated resource. The material will only be mailed out on a single occasion. No other strategy to encourage use of the resource will be undertaken. The number of intervention resourced returned and not successfully mailed out will be recorded internally.</interventions>
    <comparator>Childcare centres in the control arm will receive usual care and no other intervention from the research team. These services all have access to the guidelines online and may have received a hard copy version of the guideline from health promotion units within their district.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A list of childcare service centres located in the New South Wales region (excluding the Hunter New England region) was obtained using a central government repository. A random sample of services was selected from the list. A research assistant examined whether each of the service provided meals to children by searching center websites. Eligible services were randomised to receive either the printed education material or usual care.</concealment>
    <sequence>Childcare centres were randomly allocated to intervention and control group using the RAND function in excel by a statistician independent to the study.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We required 154 participants to have 80% power of detecting an effect size of 0.45 standard deviations, with a significance level of 5%. Assuming a 70% response rate at follow up, we will approach 220 centres. An ANCOVA will be undertaken to assess the impact of the intervention on the primary oucome - intentions to use.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to examine the use of printed education materials to support the dissemination of nutrition guidelines in childcare centres. We hypothesise that the use of these materials will increase the cooks intentions to apply such guidelines when planning their menu. This increase in intentions is also likely to be supported by improvements to attitudes and perceptions of whether other people think this is important. We will also ask cooks to report on whether their menus comply to the nutrition guidelines.</summary>
