          2. Female Subjects:

               1. For post-menopausal women, if there is any clinical concern about the menopausal
                  status, this should be confirmed by an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test.

               2. Pre-menopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
                  Baseline and be willing to use two effective methods of contraception
                  simultaneously (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual
                  intercourse is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)
                  from the Screening visit until 3 months after last dose of study drug.

               3. Are surgically sterilised or have had a hysterectomy.

          3. Male Subjects:

             a. Who are willing to use two effective methods of contraception simultaneously
             (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is in line
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) from Day 1 until 3 months after
             last dose of study drug.

          4. Diagnosis of mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) with increased level of
             certainty (provided by evidence of clinical deterioration within the 6 months
             preceding Screening, as assessed by the investigator) as determined by the National
             Institute of Ageing (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) workgroup.

          7. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan in the 12
             months preceding Screening that in the investigator's opinion is consistent with AD as
             the principle aetiology of the dementia with no other clinically significant
             abnormality, e.g. another principle underlying aetiology of the subject's dementia, or
             a lesion which could affect cognition e.g. a brain tumour or large stroke.

          8. On stable dose of acetylcholinesterase (AChEI) and/or memantine (at least 3 months
             prior to Screening) OR treatment-na√Øve. Initiating AChEIs or memantine during the
             study will not be permitted.

          9. Apart from a clinical diagnosis of mild dementia due to AD, the subject must be in

             assessments.

             sufficient contact with the subject to be able to provide accurate information as to
             the subject's cognitive and functional abilities. The study partner must be available
             to provide information to the investigator and study site staff about the subject and
             agrees to attend all study site visits in person for scale completion. A study partner
             should be available for the duration of the study. The measure of adequate
             availability will be at the investigator's discretion.

         11. Must be willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol and must be
             available to complete the study.

         12. Must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the study.
