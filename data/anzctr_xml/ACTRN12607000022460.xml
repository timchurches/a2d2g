  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The optimal duration of adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal patients with operable early stage breast cancer is currently unknown and it is thought that relapse of disease following adjuvant therapy may be due to the presence of cells which are non-responsive to first cycles of treatment.  Therefore, IBCSG VI will investigate whether 3 cycles of initial adjuvant chemotherapy are as effective as 6 cycles and whether the addition of 3 cycles of chemotherapy after a treatment-free interval is as effective as administering an initial course of chemotherapy alone in premenopausal patients.</summary>
