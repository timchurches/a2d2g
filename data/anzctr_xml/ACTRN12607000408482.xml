  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed study will use Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) devices to compare the nocturnal glycaemic outcomes of having a carbohydrate supper (control) versus having no supper (intervention) to determine whether a carbohydrate-containing snack before bed is required to prevent hypoglycaemia. Supper will consist of a dairy snack containing 15 grams of carbohydrate.
The study duration is 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will have a 4 day wash-out period as they will be control for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of week one, and then be treatment for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of the following week (or vice versa with order of treatment first week and control second week).</comparator>

    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed. Eligible subjects from the diabetes database will be invited to participate in the study. Subjects will then be randomised to either the control group (supper) or treatment group (no supper) by coin toss. Subjects will then swap to the alternative group the following week, since they will act as their own control.</concealment>
    <sequence>Coin toss will be used to randomly allocate whether each subject undergoes the control or treatment group first. This will be allocated as each subject is recruited.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with diabetes are currently recommended to have a carbohydrate supper before bed when using insulin injections.  This is done to avoid overnight hypoglycaemia (blood glucose levels below 4mmol/L). This advice is based on using insulins such as Protaphane. 
Some of the new insulins available, such as Lantus, do not have an action peak. With these new insulins, we think it is unlikely that a supper before bed is needed to prevent overnight hypoglycaemia. To our knowledge there are no research studies that have tested this idea.
This project looks at testing overnight blood glucose levels with and without supper, when using multiple daily injections of insulin that includes Lantus. The results of this study will help us to know whether supper is needed when using Lantus insulin.</summary>
