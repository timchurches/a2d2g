  <interventions>
    <interventions>16 participants will be recruited for this study. There will be 2 experimental groups to which participants will be randomly and equally assigned: 

Group 1: High Fat Diet
Participants in Group 1 will consume a 9-day high fat diet consisting of  ~65% total energy as fat, ~20% total energy as carbohydrate and ~15% total energy as protein. This diet has been used multiple times previously by the research team and will be produced by the study dietitian in accordance with personal food preferences and any allergies. Participants will be provided all meals for this part of the study and will receive individual diet counselling by the study dietitian when required.

Group 2: High Fat Diet and Resistance Exercise
Participants in Group 2 will consume the identical diet as Group 1. In addition, on days 6, 9 and 12, participants will perform a lower-body resistance exercise session. For the resistance exercise, participants will perform 3 exercise in total: machine-based leg press and leg extension, and a free-weight dumbbell squat. All exercises (3-4 sets of 10-12 repetitions each exercise) will be performed at ~75% of the participants pre-determined 1 repetition maximum. The sessions will be conducted with the participants individually, or in groups of 2, of which will supervised by researchers that have obtained at least a Certificate III qualification in Exercise/Fitness Instruction. 

In both groups, the initial control diet for days 1-3 is based on current Australian recommended daily intakes, and consists of ~20% total energy as fat, ~65% total energy as carbohydrate and ~15% total energy as protein..Diets will be prepared beforehand by a dietitian and participants will have all of their meals provided to them for the entire dietary period. The meals will be collected from the ACU School of Exercise Science at times arranged with study participants. Regular phone calls and a dietary recall will be used to monitor adherence to the diets. Participants in the resistance exercise group will be advised that all exercise sessions need to be attended in order to complete the study, of which there will be a total of 3 across a 7 day period.

    <comparator>Group 1: High Fat Diet
Participants in Group 1 will consume a 9-day high fat diet consisting of  ~65% total energy as fat, ~20% total energy as carbohydrate and ~15% total energy as protein. This group will serve as a control with respect to investigating the capacity for resistance exercise to potentially ameliorate the repressive effects of fat toward muscle growth responses.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>MPS will be determined by the participants consuming doses of deuterium water (50 ml four times/ day for a total 200 ml/day) everyday throughout the nine day high fat intervention (total = 1.8 litres). Muscle biopsies will be acquired  in order to analyse MPS responses and these will be taken on days 4, 6, 9 and 12 of the high fat dietary control period (Note: for days 1-3 participants will consume a standard carbohydrate-based diet as a 'lead in') to determine changes in protein synthesis before and after dietary modification and after resistance exercise. In addition, the determination of MPS via the deuterium method requires blood sampling, of which a single sample (~5 mL) will be taken on each day during dietary control (i.e., days 4-12).</timepoint>

      <outcome>A dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) for body composition. The DXA scan will measure total body mass, fat mass and lean mass.</outcome>

      <outcome>Cognitive Assessment Tasks involving questions and problem solving tasks designed to measure a range of cognitive functions including learning, memory, attention, decision making, verbal fluency and reaction times.

3.	Symbol Digit Modalities Test
4.	California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT)
5.	Taylor Figure Test
6.	Verbal Fluency

8.	N-Back task
9.	Iowa Gambling Task
10.	Stop Signal Task
11.	Colour Blind Question
12.	Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
13.	CVLT (delay)
14.	Taylor Figure (delay)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ingestion of excess energy, particularly fat, is largely responsible for the current epidemic of lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes and sarcopenia (the progressive loss of muscle mass with increasing age). The development of sarcopenia is exacerbated by low levels of physical activity and also in overweight or obese individuals through an increase in
body fat and concomitant decrease in muscle mass. However, performing resistance and aerobic exercise in combination with the ingestion of high quality protein sources (e.g., dairy-based protein) has been shown to enhance and/or maintain muscle mass. This has important health implications for reducing the risk of developing sarcopenia, obesity or other debilitating health conditions such as diabetes. Accordingly, the aim of this
research is to investigate whether a short-term (9 day) high fat diet (HFD) decreases muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and, whether performing resistance exercise during consumption of the HFD can in part relieve the repressive effects of fat toward skeletal muscle anabolism; hence, MPS. </summary>
