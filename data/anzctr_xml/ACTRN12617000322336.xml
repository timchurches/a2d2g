  <interventions>
    <interventions>Infants randomised to the intervention will receive budesonide 0.25 mg/kg (0.5 mL/kg). Exogenous surfactant (Curosurf [trademark], Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) will be used as a carrying vehicle for the budesonide. The dose of surfactant will be 200 mg/kg for the initial dose, and 100 mg/kg for subsequent doses (if required). Each enrolled infant will receive at least one, and no more than two, interventions. The intervention will be administered intra-tracheally via an endotracheal tube or catheter, by a medical officer or appropriately credentialed neonatal nurse.  </interventions>

Each enrolled infant will receive at least one, and no more than two, control interventions.

    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be provided by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU) at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia. Randomisation with balanced variable block sizes will be used, stratified by study centre, gestational age (23-25 weeks’ vs. 26-27 weeks’ completed gestation) and by prior surfactant therapy prior to enrollment and mode of respiratory support (ventilation via an endotracheal tube vs non-invasive respiratory support) . Multiple births where more than one infant is eligible will be randomised individually.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will follow standard methods for randomised trials. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. For dichotomous outcomes, including the primary outcome, the two treatment groups will be compared using relative risk with 95% CI, both overall, and within the pre-specified subgroups. The individual components of the primary outcome, death or physiological BPD at 36 weeks PMA, will be compared between the two treatment groups using relative risk with 95% CI, both overall, and within the pre-specified subgroups. For dichotomous secondary outcomes, analysis will be limited to the two treatment groups, using relative risk with 95% CI. For continuous outcomes, the two treatment groups will be compared using difference of means, together with 95% CI, for outcome variables which are normally distributed; for outcome variables, which are not normally distributed, the comparison will be difference of medians, with 95% CI. All comparisons (relative risk, difference of means, difference of medians) will be estimated using regression models with standard errors adjusted to take into account the clustering due to multiple births. Where there are differences in the baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups that might be associated with outcomes, an additional adjusted multivariable analysis will be carried out using generalized linear model methods. Reporting of findings will be done in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Pre-specified sub-group analyses will be performed to determine if there is an interaction between treatment effect and gestational age strata or exposure to surfactant prior to randomisation.

Cost effectiveness analysis will incorporate costs of the intervention and of hospital care (including complications) for the birth admission until death or first discharge home from all health care facilities which includes the primary birth hospital and where appropriate, secondary hospital(s). A decision analysis will be constructed based on the primary outcome and associated hospital costs. Cost-effectiveness will be reported as cost per life year gained and cost per infant with BPD prevented for the intervention group compared to control. Extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted. The longer term costs associated with BPD will be constructed via systematic review and updated with Australian unit costs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterised by disordered alveolar and vascular development, most commonly affecting extremely preterm infants exposed to mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). BPD is associated with mortality, and adverse long-term pulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Despite advances in neonatal care including antenatal corticosteroids, exogenous surfactant, and the increasing use of non-invasive ventilation, the incidence of BPD is not decreasing. BPD remains the most important pulmonary complication in extremely preterm infants occurring in about 50% of survivors to 36 weeks post menstrual age, with no new therapies shown to prevent it. 
Laboratory and clinical studies suggest a crucial role for lung inflammation (pre- and post-natal) and host immune response in the pathogenesis of BPD. A subcommittee of perinatal experts of the National Health, Lung, Blood Institute summarised the current state of knowledge regarding BPD and identified potential points in its pathogenesis susceptible to therapeutic interventions. One recommendation was to study the use of selective anti-inflammatory therapies, to attenuate the inflammatory response in the developing lung to potentially prevent BPD. As inflammation is a primary mediator of injury in the pathogenesis of BPD, anti-inflammatory agents such as postnatal corticosteroids have long been the focus of preventive interventions. Whilst systemic (intravenous or oral) corticosteroids reduce inflammation and improve respiratory function, their early use may be associated with many side effects. Given the serious adverse effects of systemic corticosteroid administration, safer alternatives are sought.Inhaled or nebulised corticosteroids are technically challenging to deliver with conflicting results from trials as the dose, optimal timing of initiating treatment and the duration are unknown. Local administration of corticosteroids to the lung via the intra-tracheal route has the potential to maximise anti-inflammatory effects on the distal airway, minimise systemic absorption and decrease the risk of adverse effects. Exogenous surfactant is a proven effective therapy for RDS in preterm infants. Combining budesonide with surfactant is a simple intervention that may prevent BPD in the high-risk population of extremely preterm infants.
The aim of the PLUSS trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early intratracheal corticosteroid (budesonide) combined with exogenous surfactant as the vehicle for distribution compared with exogenous surfactant alone to increase survival without BPD at 36 weeks PMA in extremely preterm infants born &lt;28 weeks gestation.
This is a multicentre, double-blind, two-arm, parallel 1:1 placebo-controlled randomised trial. Families, healthcare providers, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to the randomisation group.
Infants enrolled in the study will be randomised to receive intratracheal surfactant and budesonide or surfactant alone.
