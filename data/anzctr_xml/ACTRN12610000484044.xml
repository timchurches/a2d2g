  <interventions>
    <interventions>1000 kJ portion of 121 single foods were selected, tested and grouped into ten food categories : dairy products, breakfast cereals, bakery products, fruits and fruit juices, vegetables, snack foods, carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, fat-rich foods, beverages and alcoholic drinks. Separate groups of healthy subjects (n = 10 - 13 for each group) were recruited to test each category of foods. Each participant acted as their own control, testing the reference food (either white bread or glucose) on two separate occasions. Then the participant consumed the testing foods in a food category on separate mornings. The wash-out period between test sessions was at least one day. 

2000 kJ portion of 13 mixed meals were consumed by two  groups of healthy subjects on separate testing days. One group (n = 11) consumed 6 meals and the other group (n = 10) consumed 7 meals. The reference meal of white bread was tested at the beginning and end of the whole test sessions.  The wash-out period between test sessions was at least one day. 


Foods and meals varied widely in macronutrients, fiber and glycemic load and were representative of common energy source contributed to the western diets.  Finger-prick blood samples were collected before the meal (0 min) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 min after the start of the meal and assayed for glucose and insulin.</interventions>
    <comparator>Iso-energetic portions of either glucose or white bread were consumed twice as the reference food and the average glucose or insulin responses were used as the basis of comparison with all other foods or meals.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The correlations between observed glucose response and calculated glycemic load (GL) in 121 single foods and 13 mixed meals respectively. 

The observed blood glucose response for each test food or meal relative to the reference food was described as a glucose score (GS). Specifically, for each subject, finger-prick blood samples were collected and assayed for glucose at regular intervals over 2 hours after the meal. Then the glucose incremental area under the 120-min response curve (AUC) was calculated according to the trapezoidal method and compared with the average reference AUC.The mean +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) for a group of subjects was the reported observed GS to the test food or meal. 

The GL was calculated as published Glycemic Index values  x available carbohydrate content per 1000 kJ portion for each food or meal. 

Linear regression analysis was used to test associations between GS and GL, with stepwise regressions used to examine the extent to which GL accounted for the variability of GS.</outcome>

      <outcome>The correlations between observed insulin response and calculated glycemic load (GL) in 121 single foods and 13 mixed meals respectively. 

The observed blood insulin response for each test food or meal relative to the reference food was described as a Food Insulin Index (FII). Specifically, for each subject, finger-prick blood samples were collected and assayed for insulin at regular intervals over 2 hours after the meal. Then the insulin incremental area under the 120-min response curve (AUC) was calculated according to the trapezoidal method and compared with the average reference AUC.The mean (+/- SEM) for a group of subjects was the reported observed FII to the test food or meal.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aimed to determine the degree of association between calculated glycemic load (GL) and glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects consuming iso-energetic portions of single foods and mixed meals. 10 groups of healthy subjects consumed 1000 kJ portions of 121 single foods in 10 food categories and other 2 group of subjects consumed 2000 kJ of 13 mixed meals. Foods and meals varied widely in macronutrient content, fibre and GL. Glycaemia and insulinemia were quantified as incremental area under the curve relative to a reference food (=100). Then the results were correlated with GL to determine the extent that GL can explain the variability of glucose and insulin responses in healthy subjects.</summary>
