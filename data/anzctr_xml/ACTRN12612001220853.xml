  <interventions>
    <interventions>A novel mobile-phone delivered text message intervention consisting of 16 text messages in total sent over one month, with one message sent every 2 days. Participants will receive similar text message content and will have the option of receiving text messasges in a)English, b) English with some Te Reo Maori words of greeting and encouragement, c) Te Reo Maori, or d) English with a Pacific language greeting. 
The text message programme is based on Brief Intervention for Harm guidelines and behaviour change theory and consists of supportive, motivational and informative messages aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm.
Eligible trauma patients will be screened using the 10 question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) questionnaire. Those with AUDIT scores 7-15 for women and 8-15 for men will be eligible to take part in the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care i.e. they will receive interventions/referrals (for hazardous alcohol use) that they would normally receive from their hospital Clinical Teams. They will also receive an alcohol brochure from the Research Team.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In New Zealand and internationally, missed opportunities in the healthcare system to identify and reduce hazardous drinking among high-risk patients are very common. We have developed a mobile-phone text message programme (YourCall) based on Brief Intervention for Harm guidelines and behaviour change theory, which is aimed at reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm. The text messages consist of supportive, motivational, and informative messages developed with input from experts in mobile phone health technology, drug and alcohol clinical services, health psychology, and Maori, Pacific, and Asian Health. The goal of this research is to evaluate the mobile-phone text message intervention among trauma patients aged 16 to 60 years admitted to hospital who screen positive for hazardous alcohol use.
 
We will screen trauma patients for hazardous alcohol use (using the 10 question Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT] questionnaire) and carry out a randomised controlled trial to investigate the effectiveness of the text message intervention. The study will compare a group of patients who receive the text messages to a control group who receive usual care. Our primary outcome of interest is reduction in alcohol misuse (measured using the three-question AUDIT-C survey) at 3 months. The effects will be reviewed at 6, 9 and 12 months. Through record linkage to hospital discharge, mortality and Accident Compensation Corporation data, we will also investigate the impact on further injuries and other harms. This patient-centred intervention has the potential to be cost-effective, highly scalable and accessible to harder-to-reach communities, including youth and economically disadvantaged groups.</summary>
