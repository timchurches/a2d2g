  <interventions>
    <interventions>This pilot study compared the therapeutic potential of a low glycemic load diet, comprised of higher levels of protein and low glycemic index foods, with a control diet (no intervention). The intervention diet consisted on 25% energy from protein, 45% energy from low glycemic index carbohydrates, and 30% energy from fats. Diets were isocalorically matched with baseline and the intervention period was for 12-weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group did not receive any information about diet, nor any dietary instruction.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Sequence generation and allocation were performed by a third party staff member and were concealed from the investigator until after the participant enrolment.  The method involved creation of a numbered list of 1 to 100, then random number generation.  Even and odd numbers were indicative of test group and control group respectively and were entered on the list as they were generated, prior to recruitment of any subjects.  The third party staff member not involved with the conduct of the study entered recruits on the list in order of recruitment and revealed their designated group to the investigator following completion of recruitment.</concealment>
