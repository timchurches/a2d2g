  <interventions>
    <interventions>clinical trial that involves a single patient, with the patient serving as their own control. N-of-1  trials, or tests, use a multi-cycle, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design where each participant is assured of receiving both the study medication and placebo, and thus learns whether the treatment works specifically for him or her.Each participant will undergo 3 pairs of treatment/placebo periods (each period is 2 weeks; each N-of-1  test will last 12 weeks). Treatments will be randomized separately within each pair of periods (e.g. ABBAAB) by the study statistician.Data from day 1 will be discarded to provide a washout period.There will be a two week run-in period, on 3 mg melatonin.Standard scripts will cover dispensing a two week supply of 3 mg melatonin to the patient.  Medication instructions will be explained. We will ask patients to complete a sleep diary (with baseline and weekly administration of the PDSS-2) during the two weeks on 3 mg. If the participants PDSS-2 scores improve, the test dose will be 3 mg; if the score does not improve, the test dose will be 6 mg. We will use a threshold of -3.44 points change in the PDSS-2 for detecting clinically significant improvement.  Patients, clinicians, research staff and outcome assessors will be blinded.
Participants will take either immediate release melatonin or placebo 30 mins before bedtime. Two doses will be available (3 mg or 6 mg) in personalised N-of-1  tests.  For both doses, the comparator will be placebo. trial medications are prepared in oral capsule and will be administered sublingual.
Patients will be asked about progress, any queries and adverse events weekly by the RN during follow up phone calls.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to see whether using melatonin assists with sleeping in patients with Parkinsons Disease.IMET stands for Individual Medication Effectiveness Tests. An IMET is a new way of working out whether the medication is working for the individual taking the medicine.   Most projects that test the effectiveness of medicines give information about the effects of that medication on groups of people. IMETs give information about the effectiveness of the medicine only for the person doing the test.  

The IMET will take twelve weeks, and use active and placebo (inactive) medication.  Placebo and active medication look exactly the same, but the placebo is not active and has no effect.  The IMET team will arrange things so that neither you nor your study doctor, will know what medication you will be taking at any one time. But everyone will know that you will be taking either medication for periods of two  weeks at a time, and in a random order.
