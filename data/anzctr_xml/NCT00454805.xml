  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival - Number of months from randomisation until progressive disease based on RECIST (progression of target lesions, clear progression of existing non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions) or death in the absence of progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST performed at screening and every 8 weeks through to progression or discontinuation whichever is earliest.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate - Best objective tumour response (based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)) during the study for patients with measurable disease. Best objective tumour response defined as:
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters (LDs) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs.
Progression (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of LDs of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LDs since treatment started (including the baseline sum of LDs) and at least 5 mm increase.
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST performed at screening and every 8 weeks through to progression or discontinuation whichever is earliest.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Number of days from date of response (complete/partial based on RECIST) to date of progression</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 8 weeks until progression or discontinuation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Benefit Rate - Clinical Benefit is defined as the number of patients having a best overall tumour response of CR/PR or SD for =6 months.
The Clinical Benefit rate is defined as the number of responders divided by the number in the Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set: responder=overall best response of complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months (calculated from the date of randomisation) as defined by RECIST criteria at any point prior to the data cut-off.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 8 weeks until progression or discontinuation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Clinical Benefit - Number of days from date of clinical benefit to date of progression. Clinical benefit is defined as having a best overall tumour response of CR/PR or SD for =6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 8 weeks until progression or discontinuation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
