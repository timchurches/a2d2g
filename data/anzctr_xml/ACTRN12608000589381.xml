  <interventions>
    <interventions>The term prophylactic ovariectomy implies that the ovaries are normal at the time of the hysterectomy and that it is performed for possible future benefit.
Usually the decision to remove or preserve the ovaries is based on the surgeons recommendations or by request of the patient. Many clinics say that 45 years old is the age at which a prophylactic ovariectomy is strongly recommended. Also, the predominant teaching is that a prophylactic ovariectomy in patients with low risk of ovarian cancer must be avoided in women under 40 years old. It is routinely performed in women over 50 years old and is individualized in between.
Data gathered from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in between the years of 1988 and 1993, reported that ovarian retention only happens in about 40% to 50% of the patients who undergo a hysterectomy at the age of 40 or more. Conservative numbers suggest that about 300,000 women suffer from bilateral prophylactic ovariectomy each year in the same country.
In this trial, intervention group will undergo a hysterectomy without bilateral ovariectomy while the control group will  have a bilateral ovariectomy (current clinical practice) during the hysterectomy.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>mean well-being and quality of life scores. Researchers will interview each participant regarding their quality of life, using the MENCAV questionnaire.
This questionnaire is the first Spanish questionnaire designed to assess the quality of life in menopausal women. Analysis of the reliability and internal validity of the MENCAV suggests that the questionnaire has demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency (42). It has been developed from an aggregate of 213 items that after a process of reduction and testing was left with 37 items structured in 5 dimensions: physical health (10 items), psychological health (9 items), sexual relations (4 items), couple relationship (4 items), and social support (10 items). It is a valid, reliable instrument of quick administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The questionnaire will be administered on five separate occasions
1) Pre-operatively
And
2) Post-operatively.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be identified and potentially recruited through the pre-operational gynecological evaluations in out patient clinics of the participant hospital centers. Once the participants are identified and her eligibility has been confirmed, the informed consent will be sought. Once a participant has signed the informed consent sheet, they will be randomized.
the investigator will staple the envelope (closed), that contains the letter corresponding to the assigned group, to the inner part of the file’s cover to avoid it from getting lost during its handling by the nurse staff, filers or the rest of administrative workers at the day of the surgery.</concealment>
    <sequence>Web based software shall be used to complete the randomization process.
The participants shall be randomized from national coordination centers  that will be located in either the epidemiology unit of the “Primero de Mayo” General Hospital in San Salvador or in the “Dr. A. Carit” Women’s Hospital in San José, Costa Rica. The operation centre will be located at IHCAI FOUNDATION in San Jose, Costa Rica.
The sequence generation will be develop using a computer program.
Every randomized participant will be analyzed in the group in which they were assigned following the principles of intent to treat analysis.
Randomisation of the participants will be completed as near to the date of surgery as possible to reduce the number of study withdrawals.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To establish the potential harms or benefits of performing a prophylactic ovariectomy in conjunction with a hysterectomy in postmenopausal women.
The objectives are: to disprove the following null hypothesiss
1. The well-being and the quality of life of post menopausal women shall not be adversely affected in those who have a hysterectomy in conjunction with ovariectomy compared to those who have a hysterectomy alone.
2. The requirement for further pelvic surgical intervention in post menopausal women who have a hysterectomy in conjunction with ovariectomy is not greater compared to those who have a hysterectomy alone.</summary>
