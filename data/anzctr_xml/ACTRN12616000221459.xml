  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participating families will be randomly allocated to either standard, in-clinic Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) or Internet-delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy.

Standard PCIT: 
Standard PCIT is a clinic-based protocol, which draws on real-time, wireless technology to provide in vivo coaching of parent-child interactions by a therapist observing the parent-child dyad from behind a one-way mirror. Treatment is divided into 2 phases: (1) Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) and (2) Parent-Directed Interaction (PDI). During CDI, parents are coached in traditional play therapy skills, including following the childs lead, describing the actions of the child, and reflecting and imitating the childs appropriate speech and play. Parents are taught to consistently attend to and reinforce positive child behaviours via praise, descriptions, reflections, and imitations, while simultaneously withdrawing their attention from negative, inappropriate behaviours. During CDI, the overall purpose of applying these skills is to improve the quality of the parent-child relationship. During PDI, , parents are coached to set limits and provide appropriate, consistent consequences for inappropriate behaviour (e.g., time-out). The overall purpose of PDI is to reduce the frequency and intensity of disruptive child behaviour, and to allow parents to effectively manage disruptive behaviour if/when it does occur. 
The first treatment session of each phase begins with a Teach session during which parents are taught specific skills, which are then practiced in the following 6 coaching sessions. Since transition between phases and to graduation from treatment depends on parents reaching a prescribed level of the phase-specific skills (mastery criteria), the dosage of treatment varies between families. However, prior research indicates improved outcomes and lower attrition rates using a fixed approach to dosage, whereby transition through and from treatment occurs after completing a pre-specified number of sessions, rather than a variable approach that requires reaching skill mastery. The current protocol utilises this fixed approach, with all families receiving 14 weekly, one-hour treatment sessions in total (one CDI Teach session and six CDI Coach sessions, and one PDI Teach sessions and six PDI Coach sessions). This treatment dose is consistent with the average number of PCIT sessions completed in prior research (i.e., 12-16 sessions). The therapy will be delivered by a therapist certified in PCIT, one-on-one in a research clinic setting.

I-PCIT:
I-PCIT is an Internet-delivered format of PCIT, drawing on real-time, interactive technology. Unlike standard PCIT, I-PCIT uses real-time videoconferencing for sessions, delivering live coaching to parents wearing cordless headsets to afford mobility to provide live and evidence-based coaching of parent-child interactions directly to a familys home setting. Although the delivery format differs from standard PCIT, the contents of I-PCIT directly follow the standard protocol, with the minor exception that the initial session also includes an introduction to technological aspects of treatment. To maintain relative control of the in-home setting during treatment, parents are told their appointment should be treated just as any in-clinic appointment (e.g., direct phones to voicemail) and pets should be locked in other rooms. During sessions, I-PCIT families broadcast parent-child interactions live from their home via webcam over an encrypted connection, and therapists provide instantaneous feedback from a remote site to a wireless headset worn by the parent. Also, whereas handouts are given in standard PCIT after sessions throughout treatment, I-PCIT session handouts are made available online and only for the session in which the principles are introduced. As in the standard PCIT protocol, I-PCIT will be delivered in a total of 14 weekly, one hour treatment sessions (one CDI Teach session and six CDI Coach sessions, and one PDI Teach sessions and six PDI Coach sessions). The therapy will be delivered by a therapist certified in PCIT, one-on-one, with the therapist situated at the research clinic and the family situated in their own home.

Adherence to the protocol will be monitored via the number of sessions that participating families attend and adherence to homework requirements (i.e., five minutes of daily skill practice).</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>To assess the non-inferiority of I-PCIT compared to standard PCIT, the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference between the two interventions will be computed. Non-inferiority will be concluded at the 2.5% level if the lower bound of the confidence interval falls above a pre-specified level on the primary outcome measure of child behavioural symptoms. Specifically, a non-inferiority margin of 15 points on the ECBI Intensity scale is to be used to determine non-inferiority. This corresponds to an effect size of d=.33, which was determined the smallest difference between the two treatments that would be considered clinically meaningful. 

Multilevel models will be used to examine group means over time in the continuous, normally-distributed outcomes. The mean difference between the groups and 95%CI at the post-intervention measurement will be obtained and non-inferiority will then be assessed.  

All analyses will be conducted using both intent-to-treat and per-protocol approaches, as per the recommendation outlined in both ICH E10 and CONSORT  guidelines. The intent-to-treat analysis will include the data of all participants randomised into groups, regardless of actual participation in treatment. In contrast, the per-protocol analysis will only include participants who comply with the protocol (i.e., complete treatment). The most rigorous approach is to use both analyses, with the strongest results obtained when non-inferiority is demonstrated in both populations of participants. Analyses will be performed in Stata/SE 13.1 or SAS 9.4 software.

Power Analysis: For power of 80% and alpha=0.05, 88 in each group would be required in order to show non-inferiority of I-PCIT on the ECBI primary outcome measure, assuming a common SD of 40 and that a mean difference greater than 15 points is unacceptable (d=.33).  Analyses were run using Stata/SE 13.1.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many Australian families are unable to access evidence-based psychological treatments for their childs Disruptive Behavioural Disorder (DBD) due to their geographical location and limited availability of appropriate mental health services. For these families, Internet-delivered treatment may be a promising means of overcoming these barriers. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of Internet-delivered Parent Child Interaction Therapy (I-PCIT), as compared to standard, clinic-delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), using a non-inferiority, randomized control trial. It is expected that I-PCIT children will show non-inferior reductions in ODD/CD rates, and in oppositionality, aggression, noncompliance, and hyperactivity, relative to standard PCIT children. It is also expected that I-PCIT parents, relative to standard PCIT parents, will show (i) non-inferior increases in the use of effective commands, labeled praise for child compliance, behavioural descriptions, verbal reflections, and household consistency and follow-through, (ii) non-inferior reductions in the use of criticisms and indirect commands, (iii) non-inferior improvements in family functioning, and (iv) non-inferior reductions in parental stress and depressive symptoms. Families are eligible to participate if their 2-7 year old child meets clinical criteria for a DBD, parent(s) are fluent in English, not intellectually disabled or with a history of severe physical or mental impairments, and own a computer. Eligible parent-child dyads randomly allocated to I-PCIT will receive 14 weekly one-hour PCIT therapy sessions delivered over secure online videoconferencing software by a trained PCIT therapist under the supervision of a Master Trainer. Dyads allocated to the standard PCIT condition will similarly receive 14 weekly one-hour PCIT therapy sessions delivered in-clinic at the UNSW Parent-Child Research  Clinic. All participating dyads will complete four identical 1.5 hour assessment sessions over videoconference or in-person at pre-treatment, mid treatment, immediately post-treatment, and 3-months post-treatment. These sessions will involve coded observations of parent-child interactions, computer-based questionnaires completed by parent(s), and a clinical interview with a research assistant blind to treatment condition.</summary>
