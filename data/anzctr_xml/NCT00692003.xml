  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Considered Responders as Assessed During the Maintenance Period - The number of participants who were considered responders during the 12 week Maintenance Period (Week 4 to Week 16). A responder was defined as a participant with a decrease from baseline in Primary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures (PGTCS) frequency of &gt;= 50% (i.e. 28-day PGTC seizure frequency in the period from Week 4 to the Week 16 visit compared to Week -8/-4 to randomization at Week 0). Each participant's response to treatment was assessed on the basis of their seizure diaries. The diary was dispensed at the Screening Visit and maintained by the participant (parent/caregiver) through out the titration and maintenance treatment periods until the Early termination Visit at Week 16. Due to early termination of the study by the Sponsor, no formal analyses were conducted.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in 28-day PGTC Seizure Frequency - Absolute Change from Baseline in 28-day PGTC Seizure Frequency was assessed both for the Maintenance Period alone (Week 4 to Week 16) and for the entire double-blind treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16). Due to early termination of the study by the Sponsor, no formal analyses were conducted.</outcome>

          2. Subject has = 3 PGTCS over the two months before screening and during the eight weeks
             Baseline Period with at least one seizure in each one month period. PGTCS must occur
             in the context of Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) and may be accompanied by
             other primary generalized seizures, provided these are also consistent with a
             diagnosis of IGE.

          3. Subject (or parent/caregiver, for subjects below the age of consent) is willing to
             sign an informed consent form. For subjects below the age of consent in their country,
             where appropriate they must be willing to give informed (written or verbal) assent.
             Subjects from the age specified in local regulations will be required to sign an
             appropriate informed consent form.

          4. Subject is taking a stable regimen of one or two other Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) for
             at least two weeks prior to Visit 1 (start of the Baseline Period).

          5. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of any type of idiopathic generalized epilepsy which
             has PGTCS (and which may be accompanied by other generalized seizure types), according
             to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Classification of Epileptic
             Seizures (1981) and the ILAE Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes
             (1989). Diagnosis should have been established by clinical history,
             electroencephalogram (EEG) and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI)
             of the brain consistent with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. CT/MRI scan should have
             been performed within five years of the screening visit or, if not available from this
             period, should be performed in the Baseline Period.

          6. EEG should have been performed within one year of the screening visit or, if not
             available from this period, should be performed in the Baseline Period.

          7. Female subjects are pre-menarchal, or if of childbearing potential, are not pregnant
             or lactating or are post-menopausal.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must abide by the one of the following
             medically acceptable contraceptive measures: oral contraception pill, contraceptive
             injections, implants or patches, intrauterine device in place for at least three
             months or vasectomised partner or abstinence throughout the study.

             brain imaging such as CT or MRI performed maximally five years before the screening
             visit), or clinically significant organic disease.

          2. Subject has a history of, or results of clinical investigations (including EEG data)
             that are suggestive of, partial seizures as defined by the ILAE, including generalized
             tonic clonic seizures which are suspected to be secondarily generalized.

    <summary>Zonisamide is already marketed for the treatment of partial seizures in epilepsy. This study
      is intended to provide evidence that zonisamide is safe and effective in the treatment of
      primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The total trial duration will be 5.5-6.5 months.
      After that subjects who have completed the study will be eligible to enrol in an open-label
      extension study until zonisamide is marketed for this indication or further development in
      this indication stops. This extension study will be described in a separate protocol
      (E2090-E044-316).</summary>
