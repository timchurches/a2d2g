    <statisticalmethods>The sample size will be based on up to 30% of patients with brown snake and tiger snake envenoming developing neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, major haemorrhage or acute kidney injury based on  data from ASP and the intention to reduce this to at least 10% of cases. In order to detect whether antivenom decreases the proportion of patients with major envenoming from 30% to 10%, with a significance level (alpha) of 5% and a power of 80%, a minimum of 72 patients must be recruited to each arm of the trial (ie. a total of 144 patients). We will aim to recruit 150 potentially envenomed patients over a 3 year period of recruitment. From 2006 to 2014 ASP has recruited a median of 50 envenomed patients per year presenting to hospital within 2h of the bite. In the process of recruiting these 150 patients potentially 50 to 100 non-envenomed patients will be recruited to the study and receive antivenom.
Statistical analysis will be performed on all envenomed patients with detected venom in their blood. The dichotomous primary outcome will be analysed by intention to treat using Fishers exact test comparing those administered early antivenom with those not. Appropriate statistical tests will be used for continuous outcomes depending on whether the data is parametric or non-parametric.
There will be pre-defined subgroup analyses by snake type (determined by venom specific enzyme immunoassay) and by individual major clinical envenoming syndromes (neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, major bleeding and acute kidney injury).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, standard practice for any snake bite requires laboratory testing to determine if a patient has been envenomed, and coagulation studies are the most important tests. The administration of antivenom is then based on the presence of clinical effects of envenoming and abnormal laboratory investigations. However, many of these envenoming effects are irreversible, so once they develop they are unlikely to be reversed by antivenom. In this case, antivenom needs to be given prior to the development of abnormal laboratory test or clinical effects. The aim of this project will be to administer antivenom early  as soon as the patient presents to hospital, without first waiting for laboratory tests or the development of clinical signs of envenoming, and/or retrieval to a major hospital. The objective is to prevent envenoming effects that may lead to significant morbidity or death.</summary>
