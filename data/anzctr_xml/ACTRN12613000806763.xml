  <interventions>
    <interventions>Common management for both groups will include the following:

1.  Pre-medication other than oral analgesic (such as paracetamol) will not be used.
2.  Induction will be with intravenous propofol (50-200mg), including co-induction consisting of fentanyl 25-100 micrograms and midazolam 1-5 mg. Antimemetics including dexamethasone and 5HT3 antagonists (such as ondansetron) may be administered by the treating anaesthetist.
3. Analgesia will consist of intraoperative opiates, 1 g paracetamol orally four times per day, intravenous opiates during early recovery (such as  fentanyl up to 30 mionutes after surgery),  Morphine 2.5-10mg subcutaneously 3 hourly, or oral oxynorm 10-20mg 6 hourly will be used for breakthrough analgesia. NSAIDs including Cox II inhibitors (such as paracoxib 40mg intravenously may be used.  
4. Patients will not be included in the study if the treating anaesthetist considers that a regional anaesthetic rather than a general anaesthetic would be in the best interest of the patient. This would most likely be a spinal anaesthetic. 

Intervention drug.
Following induction of general anaesthesia either desflurane or sevoflurane via inhalation will be introduced as the maintenance anaesthetic and titrated to maintain an adequate clinical depth of anaesthesia for the remainder of the operation and stopped after the last skin stitch is completed. Typically this will involve inhaled anaesthetic concentrations of 6% desflurane and 2.0% sevoflurane, reflecting the different potencies of the drugs. If Bispectral index monitoring (depth of anaesthesia monitor) is available, the target range is 40-60.

Sample-size estimates are based on the pilot data for all domains recovery at day 3 (desflurane 35.2% vs. sevoflurane 20%) and using Fishers exact method test to determine a difference of 10% difference in the total score using a 2-tailed test with 80% power at a P=0.05 significance.  The minimal sample size is 137 for each group.   This will be increased to 150 patients per group to account for potential non-completions.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Aims: To identify whether the quality of recovery over time is affected by sevoflurane versus desflurane when used as the primary anaesthetic for knee arthroscopy surgery.

Significance: Quality of recovery is an emerging field within anaesthesia of great importance.  Although large outcome studies are very important in anaesthesia, there is a changing focus from mortality and morbidity studies, to quality of recovery. The reason is that the frequency of mortality is now very low with the result that few interventions will further reduce mortality. Very large numbers are required to demonstrate any improvements in surgery and anaesthesia when mortality is used as an outcome. However early data on the PQRS as well as clinical reports indicate that the quality of recovery is often poor in many patients, and yet these are not identified by the treating anaesthetist.  There are implications for the individual patient, for the practice of anaesthesia, and for the community (such as safe return to work or to driving). Knee arthroscopy is often performed as an outpatient (day) procedure, and therefore may be perceived as minor surgery. However, for some patients the quality of recovery including cognitive decline may be more profound than would be expected from brief peripheral surgery. The role of the anaesthetic agent may have an important influence on this recovery. It is frequently assumed by anaesthetists that anaesthetics from the same class should produce similar effects when administered for a brief anaesthetic, but there are insufficient data to validate that assumption. This study will help anaesthetists to choose the anaesthetic that is best for their patients undergoing brief surgery.

Hypothesis: The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in recovery in all domains measured using the PQRS, in patients undergoing knee arthroscopy under general anaesthesia with either sevoflurane or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic

Methods: A parallel group, randomised trial with 1:1 allocation ratio will be conducted in adult patients undergoing arthroscopy, where the intervention is to receive sevoflurane or desflurane as the primary anaesthetic agent.   Quality of recovery will be measured using the Post-operative Quality of Recovery Scale (PQRS), at baseline (preoperative), 15 and 40 minutes, one and three days, and three months following surgery. Patients who are unable to complete the PQRS due to language limitations, or who will receive  regional anaesthesia will be excluded.   Recovery is defined as return to baseline values or better for each of the survey questions and is dichotomised to recovered or not recovered.  Recovery is grouped within domains (physiological, emotive, nociceptive, cognitive, and activities of daily living, with a sixth domain of self-assessment). The primary endpoint will be the incidence of recovery for all domains (not including self-assessment) on the third day after surgery.  Based on a pilot study performed at the Epworth Hospital, we estimate the ability to detect a clinically important difference with 150 patients in each group.   Guidelines for other aspects of patient care including co-induction agents, antiemetics, and post-operative analgesics will be issued to reduce variability between patients.

Likely benefits:  There are pharmacological differences between sevoflurane and desflurane that make them more or less attractive to the anesthetist.  Desflurane, should provide for earlier and more complete recovery then sevoflurane, but sevoflurane is an easier drug to administer due to a lower incidence of airway irritability. There are very few data investigating quality of recovery with these two drugs beyond emergence and PACU care.  This study will provide data into whether there are longer-term differences in the quality of recovery between these two drugs.
