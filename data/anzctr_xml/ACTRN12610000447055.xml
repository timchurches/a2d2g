    <interventions>Administration of a small dose of midazolam (0.03mg/kg), propofol (0.4mg/kg), fentanyl (1.5mcg/kg) or placebo by intravenous bolus, 3 minutes prior to induction of anaesthesia by propofol, infused at a rate of 3ml/kg/hr until loss of consciousness as confirmed by syringe drop.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Amount of induction drug required (as determined by time to LOC x infusion rate of 3ml/kg/hr)  to loss of consciousness (LOC) as determined by:
1. Syringe drop and
2. Lack of response to command</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to LOC measured from 'propofol on' time and determined by:
1. Syringe drop (primary indicator)
2. Lack of response to command (every 30 sec until lack of response)
Bi-Spectral Index monitor (BIS) 'below 60' time is also noted and amount of propofol till this point calculated as above.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is good evidence of a true synergy between midazolam and propofol induction and data suggests that pre-dosing with propofol also reduces induction requirements. However, there has been no measure of the actual cardiac output changes in any human studies apart from that of Adachi et al.
We plan to explore the relationship between cardiac output and induction doses of propofol in more detail and, in particular, to explore the effect of co-induction agents on cardiac output and to further evaluate cardiac output changes around induction of anaesthesia.</summary>
