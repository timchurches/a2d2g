  <interventions>
    <interventions>Music Therapy is a treatment that the patient uses music, sounds, voice and musical instruments in a therapeutic process to develop his capacities and his difficulties. The treatment is focused in the relation between patient- music therapist. Thus, music, sounds, voice and musical instruments are the way to promote health benefits for the patient. In this study, each patient will receive 20 sessions of treatment. Each session lasts 30 minutes and happens once a week. Before starting the consultations, all patients will be assessed by Evaluation of Language Development (ELD). In the next moment, it will be executed the randomization and division of patients into two groups (experimental group and control group). After, patients in the experimental group will receive the treatment. Then, the participants in the experimental group and control group will be evaluated again by ELD. Finally, the control group will receive treatment the same way that the experimental group.</interventions>
    <comparator>Hospital Care Activities (consultations, examinations, nutritional guidance, for example). The Hospital Care Activities will happen two or three times a month. These activities will run for 20 weeks (the same duration of the music therapeutic process for the experimental group). The control group receives the same treatment of music lasting 30 minutes each for a total of 20 sessions after the end of the sessions in the experimental group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analyzes of the overall averages of ELD. That is, some comparisons between means that can vary from 49 to 140 points</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured before and after treatment of music in the experimental group and the control group. Thus, the result will be assessed twice in each group</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Analyzes with the averages of each of the two sections, language comprehension and expressive language.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The second outcome will be measured before and after treatment of music in the experimental group and the control group. Thus, the results will be evaluated twice.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A health professional (not involved in the research) organizing the names of patients in alphabetical order. In the next moment, he will provide a number for each patient. The numbers are from 1 to 42. After, the health professional will put these 42 issues in the Pepi 4.0 Softwere, it making the randomization of the 42 participants into two groups (both with 21 participants).</concealment>
    <sequence>The research subjects are members of the population of children with multiple disabilities of the Center for Integration of Special Children (Kinder), in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The subjects will be chosen by the criterion of simple random sampling, using a table of random numbers. Thus, only 42 individuals will be selected from all individuals of the population that are framed in the criterion for inclusion. The randomization will be performed by a health professional is not involved in research. This person will organize the names of patients in alphabetical order. In the next moment, it will provide a number for each patient. The numbers are from 1 to 42. Then the health professional will ask these 42 questions in PEPI 4.0, making randomization of the 42 participants into two groups (both with 21 participants). Then it will organize a list of patients in the experimental group and a list of patients in the control group. The list of the 21 patients in the experimental group will be delivered to two musicoterapeutas that will make the visits.</sequence>
