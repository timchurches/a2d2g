  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Glycine is an amino acid that can be purchased at health food shops in Australia. Some studies have suggested that glycine, when administered in conjunction with typical medications, improve schizophrenia symptoms. However, glycine doesnt work in all patients. Much more research is needed to determine how and whether glycine affects brain activity, cognitive processes and other schizophrenia symptoms. 

The purpose of this project is to investigate the use of glycine as an adjunct treatment for improving cognition in schizophrenia. We will investigate whether glycine treatment, in combination with standard antipsychotic medication, is more effective at improving cognitive and clinical symptoms of schizophrenia than antipsychotic medication alone. We will measure schizophrenia patient's baseline level of glycine and we will examine whether glycine treatment affects brain activity, cognition and clinical symptoms differently, depending on the patient's baseline level of glycine.</summary>
