  <interventions>
    <interventions>Minocycline 100 mg Twice daily (bd) introduced as soon as possible following trauma to lower limbs continued for 1 month. Minocycline may reduce the need for opioids which are normally used to treat severe pain caused by complex lower limb trauma.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo which will be made using the same capsules as the minocycline but filled with a pharmacologically inert substance. The placebo medication will be produced in line with the placebo certificate of compliance. The placebo will be taken taken twice daily (bd) for one month.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with complex lower limb trauma experience severe pain. Opioids and inflammation activate glia which may increase the severity of pain experienced. Minocycline acts via inhibiting Toll Like Receptor 4 and may reduce pain severity if given early. This and drugs with similar effects at TLR4 receptors appear to work well in animal models of severe pain. Minocycline may also reduce opioid tolerance and opioid side effects particularly respiratory depression.</summary>
