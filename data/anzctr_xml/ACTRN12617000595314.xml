  <interventions>
    <interventions>All clinical trial participants will undergo two scans as part of the clinical trial as detailed below.

All participants will receive a 68Ga-CPCR4-2 PET/CT examination on Siemens Biograph mCT Flow at Herston Imaging Research Facility (HIRF). Images will be acquired 1 hour post intravenous injection of 68Ga-CPCR4-2 (68Ga-Pentixafor) using standard activity of 150MBq. The scan range is from vertex to mid-thigh acquired using 3 minutes per bed position.  Patients will be required to lie supine for the duration of the procedure (up to 35-40 minutes).  A low dose CT (LDCT) scan will be acquired for the purpose of attenuation correction of PET images and anatomical localisation.

For subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer, an F-18 FDG PET/CT examination will be performed on Siemens Biograph mCT Flow at HIRF. Imaging will be performed as per standard clinical protocol. Participants will be required to fast for 6 hours and F-18 FDG images will be acquired 1 hour post injection of F-18 FDG using the standard dose algorithm 4.5MBq/kg (up to a maximum 370MBq). The scan range is from vertex to mid-thigh.  Patients will be required to lie supine for the duration of the procedure (up to 30 minutes).  A low dose CT (LDCT) scan will be acquired for the purpose of attenuation correction of PET images and anatomical localisation.
Subjects presenting with localised pancreatic cancer will undergo standard of care F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging at Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital Department of Nuclear Medicine. 
Participants with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer will undergo a F-18 FDG PET at HIRF because those diagnosed with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer do not normally undergo a F-18 FDG PET as part of standard of care diagnosis imaging.  The FDG PET scan at HIRF for metastatic patients will proceed regardless of the results from the first scan.  

68Ga-CPCR4-2 and F-18 FDG imaging will be performed on different days but will be completed within a week of each other.  

A qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will administer both the 68Ga-CPCR4-2 and F-18 FDG Tracer to participants and perform the scan.  Interpretation of the results of the PET/CT scans will be performed by a qualified Nuclear Medicine Physician.</interventions>
    <comparator>In this pilot study, we wish to gain preliminary information on the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-CPCR4-2 PET in pancreatic adenocarcinomas.  To do this the clinical trial will compare the uptake seen of primary pancreatic tumours, metastases, and other extra-pancreatic lesions on 68Ga-CPCR4-2 PET/CT with the findings on standard imaging studies, FDG-PET/CT.

The PET/CT and PET/MRI procedure:
Common risks and complications include:
1. Minor pain and bruising
Less common risks and complications include:
1.  Infection from an intravenous cannula site that may require treatment with antibiotics
2.  An allergy to injected drugs may occur, requiring further treatment
Rare risks and complications include:
1.  Death as a result of this procedure is very rare

All adverse events reported by the subject/or in response to questioning or observation by the Principal Investigator will be recorded from the time of consent, during the imaging sessions and for 30 days after the PET scan or until the time of treatment initiation whichever comes first.  </outcome>

    <summary>This study is looking at a new way of detecting the spread of pancreatic cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have biopsy proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The tumour may be operable, locally advanced or metastatic. Any prior treatment is allowed.

Study details
All participants in this study will undergo a single 68Ga-CPCR4-2 PET/CT at the Herston Imaging Research facility (HIRF).  A qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will insert a tube into your vein and inject a radioactive substance called 68Ga-Pentixafor.  You will then be required to wait for 1 hour, called the uptake time, before emptying your bladder and proceeding to have your scan.  The scan involves lying flat with knees supported and arms resting above your head.  You will be scanned from head to mid-thigh.  The scan time for the 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT will be approximately 35 - 40 minutes.  
An 18F-FDGPET/CT scan will also be conducted at HIRF for patients identified to have metastatic disease at diagnosis.  You will be asked to fast for 6 hours prior to the scan.  A qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will insert a tube into your vein and inject radioactive substance called FDG.  You will then be required to wait for 1 hour, called the uptake time, before emptying your bladder and proceeding to have your scan.  The scan involves lying flat with knees supported and arms resting above your head.  You will be scanned from head to mid-thigh.  The scan time for the FDG-PET/CT will be approximately 30 minutes.
Patients with localised pancreatic cancer at diagnosis will undergo standard of care FDG-PET/CT scan performed at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital Department of Nuclear Medicine.

We will monitor all participants for adverse events.  Before, during and for 30 days after your PET/CT Scans or until treatment begins you will be asked to report any side effects to your doctor.  

It is hoped that this study will help us to achieve more accurate staging at diagnosis to guide future treatment decisions.
