  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients must be adult females between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive) and
             heterozygous for Fabry disease.

          -  Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease with a documented missense
             gene mutation (individual or familial) and enhanceable enzyme activity (in vitro test:
             presence of residual Gal A activity [greater than or equal to 3% of normal] in
             lymphocytes and greater than or equal to 20% increase in activity after lymphocytes
             are incubated with AT1001).

          -  Patients must be naïve to ERT and other therapies, except for palliative therapies for
             the signs and symptoms of Fabry disease, or must stop ERT for at least 18 weeks.

          -  Patients must have end organ dysfunction, even minimal, demonstrated by either
             evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy documented by abnormal ECG and echocardiogram
             or by cardiac biopsy, or renal insufficiency documented by common clinical assessments
             such as creatinine and glomerular filtration rate or by renal biopsy or brain tissue
             as documented by evidence of stroke (clinically or imaging), or peripheral nervous
             tissue documented by complaints of intolerance to heat or cold, decreased vibratory
             sense and proprioception, decreased ability to perspire, or acroparesthesia.

          -  Patient agrees to be sexually abstinent or practice an effective method of
             contraception when engaging in sexual activity during the course of the study and for
             a period of 30 days following their completion of the study for women of childbearing
             potential.

          -  Patients must be previously untreated by ERT or substrate depletion for Fabry disease,
             or be willing to temporarily stop treatment during this study, and be willing to
             undergo two renal, two cardiac, and two skin biopsies.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to provide written informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>The patient will be excluded from the study if:

          -  She is pregnant or lactating;

          -  She has a history of organ transplant;

          -  There is evidence of significant disease other than Fabry disease (e.g., end-stage
             renal disease;

          -  Heart disease [per clinical history, documented event, testing or class III/IV
             according to the New York Heart Association classification];

          -  Current diagnosis of cancer, except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin;

          -  Diabetes (unless HbA1c less than or equal to 8);

          -  Neurological disease that impairs her ability to participate in the study);

          -  Serum creatinine is greater than 176 umol/L on day -2; QTc interval is &gt; 450 msec;

          -  Pacemaker or other contraindication for MRI scanning;

          -  Taking a medication prohibited by the protocol or any experimental therapy for any
             indication.

          -  Patients who participated in a clinical trial in the last 30 days.

          -  Patients who have any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator would
             jeopardize the safety of the patient or impact the validity of the study results.</exclusivecriteria>
