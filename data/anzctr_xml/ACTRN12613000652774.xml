  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Moderate to severe pain in patients over 18yo presenting to Frankston ED. Pain can be from any cause except as specified by the exclusion criteria. Definition of moderate to severe pain is 6 out of 10 or more (self rated by patient) on a visual analog score, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>fentanyl citrate, concentrated solution of 300mcg/ml.

Dosage will depend on bodyweight. Initially 1.4mcg/kg will be administered intranasally, using an atomiser device attached to a syringe. A subsequent 0.7mcg/kg will be administered 15 minutes after the first dose if the patient is requesting further analgesia. 

If at any point the patient requests further analgesia, they will receive standard emergency treatment such as intravenous morphine.

Study drug will be administered at the time of enrolement, and at 15 minutes if requested by patient. Follow up time points will occur at 30 minutes and 60 minutes. The total duration of the study will be 60 minutes. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain is a common presenting symptom in the emergency department patient population with opioids being the cornerstone of treatment for moderate to severe pain. Fentanyl is a safe and effective opioid drug which is commonly used in adults and children for this indication.
Rapid analgesia is usually effected in emergency patients by administering an opioid via the intravenous route but this can be associated with pain, inconvenience and delay as it requires the insertion of an intravenous cannula. 
The intranasal route of administration of opioids offers an attractive alternative as it is non invasive and does not require intravenous access. It also provides an alternative where intravenous access is difficult or not required and where nausea and vomiting prevent oral drug administration. In a number of patients intravenous access may then be completely avoided. 
The intranasal (IN) route has increasingly been viewed as an alternative route for drug administration. It is commonly used in the paediatric population where more invasive methods of drug delivery (intravenous or intramuscular) may result in significant discomfort, anxiety and increased stress during a hospital visit. The effective treatment of acute pain in children with intranasal opioids such as fentanyl is well documented. There is also evidence in adult acute and chronic pain settings that fentanyl in analgesic doses by the intranasal route provides effective analgesia.
A significant limitation of using IN fentanyl in the adult population in the hospital setting is the inability to access the concentrated formulation (300mcg/ml). This preparation is more expensive than the widely available standard formulation (50mcg/ml) fentanyl and so is not widely accessible for use.  Effective IN analgesia in adults requires the more concentrated formulation of fentanyl due nasal absorption considerations. 
This is a non-randomised single group study of IN fentanyl in 150 adult patients with moderate to severe pain from all causes. Patients presenting with pain greater or equal to 6 out of 10 will be given a dose of concentrated (300mcg/ml) IN fentanyl. Pain scores will be taken at regular intervals over 60 minutes. If there is no response by 15 minutes a second dose of fentanyl will be given. If no appreciable pain relief occurs by 30 minutes, standard IV opioid analgesia will be given. The results of this study will provide information on the effectiveness of fentanyl in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in adult ED patients and will allow us to determine future sample sizes for prospective comparative studies of fentanyl to other pain relievers used in the ED.</summary>
