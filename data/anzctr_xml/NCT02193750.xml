  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigators hypothesize that a novel method for oligosaccharide supplementation, in the
      form of nutritional bars and/or muesli high in fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS),
      will be a safe and tolerable therapeutic intervention in patients with Crohn's disease (CD)
      in remission.</summary>
