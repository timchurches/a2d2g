Analysis of outcomes will be performed on the intention-to-treat population. Some post hoc analysis of data may be performed. Significance level: p&lt;0.05; confidence limits of 95%.
Data sets: Demographic, clinical, outcomes data.
Descriptive data: Frequencies, percentages (categorical data); means, standard deviations, confidence intervals (continuous data).
Comparative data analysis: Students t test for continuous data; Chi square test for categorical data; confidence intervals; linear or logistic regression
Power calculation
The population for an adequately powered RCT was calculated from data of similar studies in migraine prevention.. It is estimated that 60% of subjects in the active study group and 30% in the placebo-control group will report a positive outcome (30% reduction in headache frequency, from baseline). With 80% power and p&lt;0.05, the study population for this RCT is 84 subjects. An interim proof-of-concept (pilot) analysis will be performed when 40 subjects (20 in each group) complete the study, based on guidelines for pilot studies by  Lancaster GA, Dodd S, Williamson PR. Design and analysis of pilot studies: recommendations for good practice. Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice 2004; 10: 307312.

    <summary>Effects on Migraine Frequency using Combined Anti-oxidant Therapy: N-acetylcysteine, Vitamin E and Vitamin C (NEC): The MIGRANT study.

Lay title: Using a combination of anti-oxidant supplements N-acetylcysteine, Vitamin E and Vitamin C to reduce the frequency of migraines.

Summary:
Migraine affects 15% of Western Australians and is a leading cause of suffering and disability in our community. Research suggests that inflammation of the brains coverings (meninges) by nerve cell inflammation and the release of free radicals, is a cause of migraine. N-acetylcysteine, Vitamin E and Vitamin C are powerful anti-oxidants (free-radical scavengers) that reduce brain inflammation and nerve activity. It is therefore possible these anti-oxidants could reduce the number and severity of migraines. We will study 90 subjects to see if a combination of N-acetylcysteine 600 mg, Vitamin E 250 IU and vitamin C 500 mg (NEC) taken twice daily for 12 weeks, will reduce migraine attacks. This safe vitamin-based therapy has never been studied and if effective, will play an important role in migraine prevention.
