  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behaviour - Planning tasks

No Intervention: Control - The control group receives the TPB questionnaires but receives no intervention

Experimental: Implementation intentions - Participants are asked to specify when, where and how they will use condoms in the future. They will be sent weekly email reminders of their implementation intentions.

Experimental: Planning task - Participants will be asked to practice the Tower of Hanoi task four times per week for ten to fifteen minutes.


Behaviour: Planning tasks
Implementation intentions: Participants are asked to specify when, where and how they plan to use condoms in the future.
Executive function training aims to improve planning ability and therefore aims to increase condom use planning.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of the Theory of Planned Behavior in
      predicting condom use among men who have sex with men. It also aims to assess the utility of
      two interventions, one known as "implementation intentions", the other involves the practice
      of a planning task known as "the tower of Hanoi", in increasing condom use in this
      population.</summary>
