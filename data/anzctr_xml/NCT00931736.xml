  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Confirmed active TB during 28 months after randomization - Confirmed active TB during 28 months after randomization will be defined as a positive culture for M. tuberculosis, positive Nucleic acid amplification test for M TB complex, or caseating granulomas in a biopsy from any site. Positive AFB smears will be considered false positive if cultures are negative, but will be considered confirmatory, if cultures failed (for example if contamination or other technical problem occurs).</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Adult (age 18 years and older) with documented positive TST (or in the absence of TST,
             a documented positive QFT) and prescribed 9 months of Isoniazid for LTBI, following
             authoritative recommendations.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients who were contacts of TB cases known to be resistant to Isoniazid, Rifampin,
             or both.

          -  Known HIV-infected individuals on anti-retroviral agents whose efficacy would be
             substantially reduced by Rifampin, unless therapy can safely be changed to agents not
             affected by Rifampin.

          -  Pregnant women - Rifampin and Isoniazid are considered safe in pregnancy but therapy
             is usually deferred until 2-3 months post-partum to avoid fetal risk and the potential
             for increased hepato-toxicity immediately post partum.

          -  Patients on any medication with clinically important drug interactions with Isoniazid
             or Rifampin, which their physician believes would make either arm contra-indicated.

          -  Patients with a history of allergy/hypersensitivity to Isoniazid or to Rifampin,
             Rifabutin or Rifapentine.

          -  Patients with active TB. Patients initially suspected to have active TB can be
             randomized once this has been excluded.

          -  Patients who have already started LTBI therapy.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>On a global scale, tuberculosis (TB) is the single most important infectious cause of
      morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization has estimated that one-third of the
      entire world's population carries latent TB infection. A key TB control strategy is therapy
      of latent TB infection (LTBI). The current standard regimen is 9 months of Isoniazid (9INH).
      This regimen has excellent efficacy if taken regularly, but its effectiveness is
      substantially reduced by poor compliance. Serious side effects, such as hepato-toxicity can
      occur. Three shorter alternatives have been recommended: 6 months INH (6INH), 2 months
      Rifampin - Pyrazinamide (2RIF-PZA) and 4 months Rifampin (4RIF). The regimen of 6INH is less
      efficacious than 9INH, while 2RIF-PZA has been largely abandoned because of serious toxicity.
      Based on some evidence in treatment of LTBI, and extrapolating from extensive experience with
      treatment of active TB, it is believed that 4RIF has similar efficacy as 9INH. Therefore, the
      investigators are initiating the first multi-site international randomized trial that will
      compare the effectiveness of 4RIF and 9INH in preventing active tuberculosis.</summary>
