  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to determine wether local endometrium trauma (LET), applied once during the mid-luteal phase of the cycle preceding in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, can improve the chance of pregnancy for women with recurrent implantation failure.

The primary aim of this study will be the prescence of fetal heart activity seen on transvaginal ultrasound approximately four weeks after embryo trasnfer. 

The secondary outcome will be the effect of the LET procedure on positive pregnancy test two weeks after embryo transfer, ongoing pregnancy, pregnancy outcome and complications up to delivery. Endometrail tissue collected during the LET will be analysed for putative markers of successful implantation.
