  <interventions>
    <interventions>The SupportMe intervention is a simple patient-centered text messaging intervention designed to provide semi-personalized support in clinical and behavioral management and link patients with providers and health services (hospital, community and GP). Messages will provide advice, motivation, information and support on their disease condition and tips to engage in healthy behaviours. The intervention will be individualised based on baseline information and clinical context, for example, non-smokers will not receive text messages on smoking. The 6 months intervention with 4 text messages per week will be sent to participants mobile phone. The message delivery software will monitor delivery of message i.e whether messages are delivered to participants. This will be followed by a 6 months maintenance phase where participants will receive 3-4 text messages per month.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will be patients with coronary heart disease or diabetes receiving standard-of-care. Patients in the control group will continue to receive usual care from their usual clinicians.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 months

SBP will be measured by study staff following the recommendations of the Australian National Heart Foundation (NHF). Patients will be rested in the seated position for 5 minutes, an appropriate cuff size will be selected, and 3 measurements of BP will be recorded, 5 minutes apart using an Omron or equivalent validated automated digital BP monitor. Principles of automated office BP measurements should be applied as practicable, whereby the patient is in a quiet room during BP recording. The primary outcome will be the mean of the 2nd and 3rd BP measurements.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 1000 patients will have 90% power to detect a difference of 3.5 mmHg in the primary outcome between intervention and control groups (Type 1 error 5%, 2 sided alpha, SD 17mmHg). We will recruit at least 500 patients with diabetes. We will stratify by diabetes. For each patient group (CHD or Diabetes) a sample size of 500 would have a 90% power to detect a 5mmHg difference in SBP. This translates to a 14% reduction in cardiovascular events. We expect 30% of patients with CHD to also have diabetes, so 650 patients to have diabetes in the total sample, this would give an 80% power to detect a difference of 0.26% in HbA1c (SD 1.2). This translates to a 5% reduction in diabetes complications.

All analyses of study outcomes will be conducted according to the principle of intention-to-treat. Baseline characteristics will be summarised by treatment groups. Continuous endpoints will be summarised by means/medians, with intervention effects tested by Wilcoxon test that assumes skewed data.  If these data are not acceptably skewed, mixed models will describe the health related QoL, health utility score over time.  
Our primary analyses will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline variables of analyses parameters uses as covariates where appropriate. This approach is recommended for analysing randomised trials of this nature. Heterogeneity of treatment on the primary endpoint will be assessed in pre-defined subgroups of the minimisation factors of ethnicity, baseline BP levels, and background BP lowering therapy, as well as age, time since index event, and presumed medical conditions.  Analyses will be specified a priori in a full published statistical analysis plan.

    <summary>The SupportME is a pragmatic, multicentre, single-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial to determine the effect of mobile phone text messaging intervention on blood pressure for patients with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This study was funded by NSW Translational Research Grant. It aims to recruit 1000 patients with coronary heart diseases and/or type 2 diabetes. Patients will be randomised to text messaging intervention or standard-of-care. The primary outcome is the difference between groups in systolic blood pressure at 6 months.</summary>
