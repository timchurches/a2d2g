    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation is based on a previous study that showed a significant change in IGFBP-1 levels in PCOS patients following metformin therapy. With 14 subjects, the study would have 80% power to detect a 0.42 µg/L change in IGFBP-1 levels at the 0.05 significance level. In prostate cancer patients, the effect size might be smaller compared to patients with PCOS. Thus, with 26 patients, the study will have 80% power to detect a 0.3 µg/L change in IGFBP-1. The effect of metformin therapy will be assessed using a linear mixed model analysis of the cross-over trial including a baseline covariate. Multiple comparison procedures will be used to study contrasts of interest. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effect of metformin on certain growth factors that drive progression of prostate cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 50 to 80 years, with histologically confirmed prostate cancer of early or locally advanced stage, or metastatic prostate cancer with bone involvement only and have been on stable treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the form of a GnRH agonist for more than 6 months. Study details: Metformin is a commonly used medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We have early evidence that the use of metformin may slow down the growth of prostate cancer cells. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown. In this study participants will be randomly allocated (by chance) to start with either metformin or placebo treatment.  Metformin or placebo tablets will be given twice daily over 6 weeks each. You will not know which tablet you are taking until after the trial. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks in order to assess how metfromin affects levels and activity of growth factors involved in prostate cancer progression.</summary>
