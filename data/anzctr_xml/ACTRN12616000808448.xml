  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who complete the study will be asked to come to the lab for one hour. 
Participants will be told a cover story about the study and the researcher will attach electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes to the participants face to measure eye gaze direction, Participants will be asked to complete baseline questionnaires  including demographics, mood and power. They will receive instructions about the position they are to
maintain for the duration of the study (i.e. either gazing forward or gazing downward.
 A calibration process will be carried out within the first minute of the looking period. Then will complete two tasks - one with the head down and one with the head up. 
They will  be presented with the first task; watching a short silent, black and
white film for one minute, and then describe and give their opinion on the film for
five minutes. Their descriptions will later be transcribed by the researcher and
analysed using a Linguistic Inquiry Word Count [LIWC] analysis programme. After the
story, participants will complete VAS reports on positive, negative, overall mood and
comfort, AVI, and the questionnaire on power. Participants will be allowed to return
to their natural posture for five minutes while receiving instructions about the second
part of the study. For the second part of the study, participants will resume gazing
either forward or downward and adopt the head position they have not yet
experienced. They will then do the second task and repeat the measures. Once both
parts of the study have been completed, the researcher will disconnect and remove
the electrodes from the participants face. They will be thanked for their participation
and will be free to leave. The calibration will be performed while the head is in the first position. It will be repeated for the second task. The angles of the eyes is determined by placing the screen either at eye height when sitting normally or near the ground so the participant has to look down. Head angle is determined by asking the person to rest their head on a ball placed under the chin - a big ball for head up (12.5 cm diameter ) and a small ball (7cm diameter) for head down. The participant will be supervised by the researcher to ensure the instructions are adhered to.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>The study will have a mixed 2 by 2 experimental design. In the proposed study, 72 participants will be randomised to two groups (eye gaze forward or down) and then they will do two similar visually-based socially-situated tasks under two different conditions (head
tilt forward, and head tilt down). The order of the tasks will be counterbalanced.

    <statisticalmethods>Repeated measure ANOVA with between subjects factor of eye gaze direction will be used and within subjects head position factor.
DSouza (2014) found an effect size of partial eta squared = .05, of eye gaze direction on high arousal positive affect. G power indicates that to find a similar effect, using power of .80, alpha of .05, and a repeated measures between factors ANOVA analysis, 72 participants would be required overall. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to investigate whether eye gaze direction (looking forward or
downward) can affect emotion and cognition independently of head tilt. The investigators hypothesise  that looking down will result in lower high arousal positive affect and that looking down will result in lower feelings of power, lower overall mood, reduced peripheral eye gaze, fewer words spoken, and more singular personal pronouns than gazing forward, independent of head tilt.
