  <interventions>
    <interventions>Parkinson's disease is a chronic and progressive neurological condition affecting the basil ganglia deep within the brain leading to a reduction in the size and speed of sequential movements. The disease results in significant cost to the health care system including medication and medical and allied health services. This
prospective cohort study will evaluate primary and secondary clinical, health related quality of life and cost data over a 12 month period for people with Parkinson.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Before service provision models for the management of the complex array of disorders of movement, cognition and autonomic function associated with Parkinson can be comprehensively evaluated, there is a need for preliminary investigations to determine the best measurement tools to quantify therapy outcomes and program costs. Further data are also needed to map disease progression in a sample of people with Parksinon, providing a frame of reference against which inter-disciplinary therapy outcomes can later be evaluated. This study aims to address these needs as the first step in measuring the outcomes and costs of an inter-professional team model for the comprehensive management of people with Parkinson.</summary>
