    <interventions>Deep neck infection is defined as infection in the potential spaces and fascial planes of the neck. Although the incidence of deep neck infection has decreased significantly with the wide use of antibiotics, this condition is still common and present a constant challenge as it may lead to lethal complications such as descending mediastinitis, airway obstruction, jugular vein thrombosis, pericarditis, pleural empyema and arterial erosion. The diagnosis was confirmed by clinical symptoms, imaging studies, needle aspiration, and surgery. 130 patients diagnosed as deep neck infection in our hospital were observed,and  their demographics, etiology, bacteriology, disease comorbidity, imaging, treatment, complications and prognosis were analysed. The patients were observed since they got hospitalization till they were discharged from hospital after recovery or died.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:  The study aims to summarize our experience of deep neck infection and compare with cases ever reported as well as to estimate incidence trends in China.
Methods:  Patients diagnosed as deep neck infection in the Division of Otolaryngology in the first Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from 2001 to 2011 were screened retrospectively for demographics, etiology, bacteriology, disease comorbidity, imaging, treatment, complications, duration of hospitalization, and outcomes.
Results:  A total number of 130 patients were enrolled (60.8% male, 39.2% female). Average age was 32.9 +/-
 22.8 years. 47 (36.2%) were under 20 years old. 45 were children (&lt; 18 years of age). 27 patients (20.8%) had associated disease, 63.0% (17/27) of them had diabetes mellitus (DM). The parapharyngeal space (29.6%) was the most common involved space and 26.2% of patients had two or more involved spaces. Pharyngeal infections and odontogenic infections were the top two most common causes of deep neck infection (36.2% and 27.6% of the known causes, respectively). The etiology remained unknown in 72 patients (55.4%). Streptococcus viridians (49.0%) was the most common pathogen in this study. 86 (66.2%) patients underwent surgical drainage. 9 of 31 patients (23.8%) who had complications received either tracheotomy or intubation. 1 (mortality rate, 0.8%) died of sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
Conclusion:  High level of drug-resistance makes deep neck infection unusual and complicated because it may make children predisposed for deep neck infection in China. Cervicothoracic contrast-enhanced CT scans are necessary for deep neck infection patients caused by cervical foreign body because they are easier to get descending mediastinitis. Needle aspiration and high dose intravenous antibiotics are sufficient in selected cases with good response to antibiotics, small abscess and no lethal complications.
