    <summary>An experimental drug called EZN-3042 targets survivin, a protein expressed in leukemia cells
      at relapse that promotes the leukemia cells to grow. The main goal of this phase I study is
      to find out the dose of EZN-3042 that can be safely given without serious side effects both
      alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy drugs during re-induction.</summary>
