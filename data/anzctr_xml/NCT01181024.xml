  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, 3 part study will assess the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of RO5303253 in healthy volunteers and patients with
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1. In Part A, cohorts of healthy volunteers will be randomized
      to receive single ascending doses of RO5303253 or placebo. In Part 2, healthy volunteers will
      receive a single dose of RO5303253 or placebo in a cross-over design (with a washout period
      of at least 7 days) to assess food effects on pharmacokinetics. In Part 3, patients with
      chronic hepatitis C will be randomized ro receive either RO5303253 or placebo for 5 days.</summary>
