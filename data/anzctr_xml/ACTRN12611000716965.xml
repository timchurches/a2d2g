  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants receive 4 x 1hr of nutrition education and counselling.  In groups of 2-4 participants learn about the energy density of foods, the sizes of portions/serves, and how to use food labels on processed foods, Individually participants learn about their energy and nutrient needs, how to manage serve sizes from the different food groups and managing food choices when eating out.  Participants follow either one of two dietary interventions for weight loss, either a low energy diet for gradual weight loss over a longer time frame, or a very low energy diet for rapid weight loss over a shorter time frame

1) The first 30 people accepted to take part in the study are allocated to follow a portion controlled reduced energy diet of 5,000-6,000 kJ/d for 12 weeks.  Their diet is developed  under the guidance of a dietitian and based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.  For the first four weeks participants attend weekly to monitor weight change and well being, and to discuss dietary issues.  Thereafter, these participants attend fortnightly for monitoring to the end of their weight loss period of 12 weeks.  This concludes their participation in the trial.

2) The second group of 30 people accepted to take part in the study are allocated to follow a very low energy diet of 3,000 kJ/d for 4 weeks using commercial meal replacements.  These participants attend weekly to monitor weight change and well being, to discuss dietary issues and to receive a week's supply of meal replacements.  For the first two weeks these participants consume meal replacements as prescribed by the suppliers of the meal replacements.  For the next two weeks, these  participants gradually phase out meal replacements and phase in meals while maintaining an energy intake of 3000 kJ/d.  This group of participants then completes 8-10 weeks of weight maintenance to monitor weight stabilisation after rapid weight loss.  This concludes their participantion in the trial.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of % change in weight from baseline between the two groups using a calibrated balance beam scale to measure weight.  An individual weight reduction of -5% is the desirable target</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at 12 weeks for the low energy diet.
Baseline and at 4 weeks for the very low energy diet.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Examine possible correlations of personality traits with weight reduction of -5% (or more) and dietary weight loss strategy.  The Five Factor Model of personality (McCrae &amp; Costa, 1987), is used to measure three of the personality facets, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness and Extraversion.  The Tangney Self Control Scale (Tangnery, Baumeister &amp; Boone, 2004) is used to measure the personality facet, Self Control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The personality questionnaires are completed by all participants at baseline.

Correlations of personality and weight loss are computed at 12 weeks for the low energy diet and at 4 weeks for the very low energy diet.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of % change in fat mass from baseline between the two groups using biolectrical impedance assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at 12 weeks for the low energy diet.
Baseline and at 4 weeks for the very low energy diet.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants recruited from the general public through the media.  Participants are weighed and complete a short health questionnaire to ensure that inclusion criteria are met.

Initially all participants applying commence the low energy diet for 12 weeks.  Subsequently, when target sample size for the low energy diet is met, all of the participants applying commence the very low energy diet for 4 weeks until target sample size is met.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Weight loss can be difficult to achieve and maintain and long term dietary adherence rates are low.  A major challenge for successful weight management is tailoring programs to meet individual needs, that is matching personal attributes and behaviours to a particular dietary weight loss strategy.  This study investigates the matching of personality traits to compatible dietary weight loss programs for optimal weight loss</summary>
