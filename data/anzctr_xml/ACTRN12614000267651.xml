  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Pilot bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing three formulations of doxycycline with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, doxycycline belongs to a class of medicines called a tetracyclines that are used to treat a wide range of organisms and work by killing or stopping the growth of bacteria, which cause infections or make acne worse.  </healthcondition>

      <conditioncode2>Research that is not of generic health relevance and not applicable to specific health categories listed above</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of doxcycline (1 x 90 mg (Test 1) on one occasion and 1 x 90 mg (Test 2) on one occasion) and the innovator formulation of doxycycline (1 x 75 mg ) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of doxycycline.

Each dose will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 
Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance can be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the healthy of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing.

    <comparator>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of doxycycline (1 x 90 mg (Test 1) and 1 x 90 mg (Test 2)) on one occasion each and the innovator formulation of doxycycline (1 x 75 mg ) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator formulation of doxycycline. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the pharmacokinetic of doxycycline (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the three formulations. All plasma samples will be assayed for doxcycline using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines. It is unlikely however that bioequivalence of the test and reference formulations will be demonstrated with twelve participants.  However, data obtained in this study will provide valuable information in the design of the pivotal bioequivalence study.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) and the elimination half life (t1/2). Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. T1/2 = 0.693/Kel where kel is the terminal elimination rate constant. </outcome>
