  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Nilotinib, Pegylated interferon alpha-2b, Imatinib

Experimental: Nilotinib or Imatinib with Peginterferon - Nilotinib 300mg twice daily for 24 months. Pegylated interferon alpha-2b 30-50 micrograms subcutaneously once weekly for maxium 21 months (3 months after trial registration).
Patients intolerant of nilotinib may be switched to appropriate doses of imatinib


Treatment: drugs: Nilotinib, Pegylated interferon alpha-2b, Imatinib
All patients joining the study will receive treatment with oral nilotinib at 300mg twice daily. This will be given as monotherapy for 3 months initially, prior to commencement of combination therapy with Pegylated interferon alpha-2b added to nilotinib. Patients intolerant of nilotinib will have the option of switching to imatinib.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The treatment of CML and the expected survival has been revolutionised since the introduction
      of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as nilotinib. Despite their effectiveness, these
      drugs will never totally remove CML affected cells from the body. In order to achieve this
      goal, and potentially enable CML patients to live without the daily need for TKIs, other
      features of the patient's immune system may need to be harnessed. One possibility is using
      externally administered interferon (IFN) to augment the response induced by the TKI.

      This study will assess the response in terms of length of survival, detection of minimal
      disease levels and time until disease worsens in patients with chronic phase CML who are
      taking nilotinib and pegylated Interferon. Patients will commence taking nilotinib for 3
      months, and once tolerated, will simultaneously be treated with injected pegIFN for up to 2
      years. Patients can continue taking nilotinib beyond this time providing they are receiving
      benefit. Options are available for patients to decrease or increase their dose or to switch
      to another TKI, imatinib, to ensure a balance between drug effectiveness and minimal side
      effects is achieved.</summary>
