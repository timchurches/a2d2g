  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will arrive at the CNRC for further screening to determine study eligibility, having abstained from food or stimulants for at least an hour. Those who are required to consume regular medication will do so prior to their clinic visit. The timing of their last medication or supplement intake will be documented in the case report form. Anthropometric measurements of height, weight and waist circumference will be obtained prior to clinic BP measurements. 

Volunteers with clinic BP less than 160/100mHg will then proceed to have their dementia status assessed using the Australian Version of the Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MS). Those scoring below 78/100 (considered an indicator of suspected dementia) will be excluded from this study. 

Volunteers will then be fitted with a headpiece supporting an ultrasound probe on each temporal region. The investigator will adjust the probes until a measurable blood flow signal is obtained in each MCA before CVR to hypercapnia in the MCA is obtained. If the investigator is unable to obtain a blood flow signal in either MCA, the participant will then proceed to do the neuropsychological tests. Volunteers with detectable blood flow signal will have continuous recordings of changes in mean blood flow velocities in their MCA during the neuropsychological test battery recorded (CVR to cognitive stimuli). 

The investigator will then readjust the ultrasound probes to locate the posterior cerebral arteries [either the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) or the basilar artery (BA)] on either side of the temporal window. Due to the anatomical depth of the BA, the transforaminal (occipital) window is usually the site of insonation; however, it may be possible to detect a blood flow signal from the transtemporal window (same window as the MCA). In the event that the BA cannot be detected, the PCA will be located. Studies have confirmed that CVR to hypercapnia is similar in the PCA and BA and therefore can be interchangeable. Once a suitable blood flow signal is located (on either or both sides), CVR to hypercapnia in the posterior arteries will be obtained. Volunteers will NOT be excluded if no blood flow signals from the posterior arteries are detected. Only volunteers with successful blood flow signal on either side of the PCA/BA will undergo the hypercapnic assessments. 

Following the cognitive test assessments, participants will undergo a short battery of physical performance tests and complete six paper-based questionnaires that will measure various subjective perceptions on their current mood states, pain levels, sleep quality, quality of life and menopause-related symptoms on-site. The investigators will then provide the volunteers with their assigned supplements and a diary prior to their departure from the CNRC. The anticipated duration for this visit is estimated for 2.5 hrs. 

Weeks 0 to 14 supplementation
Volunteers will be required to consume their allocated supplement capsules twice a day with meals and note the time of consumption in their supplement diary. Placebo and active capsules are identical in shape and colour. Enrolled participants will be required to consume 2 capsules daily (one in the morning and one in the evening), each containing 75mg of resveratrol or matching placebo. Every four weeks, they will also complete the questionnaires relating to sleep quality and menopausal symptoms to facilitate compliance. A study investigator will contact the volunteers midway through their intervention to check their well-being and to monitor compliance with treatment. 

Visit 2
Participants will refrain from consuming their supplement on the day of their scheduled visit. They will also return the bottles and all remaining capsules. A study investigator will count the leftover capsules to determine compliance. All assessments of clinic BP, CVR to hypercapnia and neuropsychological test battery, physical performance test and questionnaires of mood, pain, menopausal symptoms, sleep quality and QoL will be repeated at the end of the 14 week intervention. </interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the sustained effects of resveratrol supplementation on:

Clinic SBP, DBP and HR (Cardiovascular Profiler).

Method of assessment: 
An appropriately sized blood pressure cuff will be placed firmly around the upper-left arm of the participant, centered over the left brachial artery to assess BP. After resting quietly in a seated position for 10 min, four consecutive BP and heart rate readings will be taken at 1 min intervals by a single observer using a Cardiovascular Profiler (Cardiovascular Profiler CR2000). The first reading will be discarded and an average of the remaining measurements recorded for analysis.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the sustained effects of resveratrol supplementation on:

Blood flow velocity changes in the MCA in response to a battery of neuropsychological tests (CVR to neuropsychological tests).

Method of assessment:
Changes in mean blood flow velocity in the MCA during cognitive assessments will be recorded continuously using the TCD device. The neuropsychological test battery will consist of the Cambridge Semantic Memory Battery, visual spatial working memory,  Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory) and the Trail Making Task (measure of attentional and executive functions, which becomes impaired with age). </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the sustained effects of resveratrol supplementation on:

Basal cerebral blood flow velocities, pulsatility index in the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation.
Anterior circulation to CVR to hypercapnia at the level of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
Posterior circulation to CVR to hypercapnia at the level of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) or basilar artery (BA).
Differences in anterior and posterior circulation to CVR to hypercapnia.

Method of assessment: 
Increases in blood flow velocity in the MCA and PCA/BA in response to vasodilator stimuli reflect endothelial dilatation in downstream anterior and posterior vascular beds respectively. Basal cerebral blood flow velocities for 10 cardiac cycles will first be recorded to determine the blood flow velocity (peak systolic, end diastolic and mean) at rest. The measures of cerebral pulsatility and resistive indexes will also be recorded simultaneously. During CVR to hypercapnia, participants breathe carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O2) for 150 seconds and the peak increase of blood flow velocity is recorded. This procedure is done in triplicate with a resting interval of at least 2min between each recording. CVR is calculated as follows: [(peak blood flow velocity during hypercapnia  resting blood flow velocity)/ resting blood flow velocity] x 100. 
Note: these are composite outcomes.</outcome>

Physical function (Physical Performance Battery).

Method of assessment:
The physical function test battery is a validated measure of functional performance of activities of daily living in community living older adult consisting of nine items. Volunteers will be given up to two chances to complete each task. Assistive devices are permitted in the locomotive task items. Volunteers will be asked to write a legible sentence, stimulate eating by picking up kidney beans with a teaspoon from a bowl and putting them in another bowl; lifting a heavy book (2.5kg) from the table and placing it on a shelf; put on and remove a jacket; pick up a coin from the floor; sit to stand and pivot 360 degree; walking 15m and climbing flights of stairs. They will be timed for each task. Higher scores will equate better physical performance. </outcome>

      <outcome>To assess the sustained effects of resveratrol supplementation on:

Mood as measured by Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale questionnaires. 

Method of assessment
Volunteers mood states will be assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) Questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The POMS questionnaire consisting of 65-adjectives that the participant will rate on a 5-point scale. Participants will be required to rate the level at which they have been feeling in the last week and including today according to the 1-5 Likert Scale (1 being not at all and 5 being extremely). The POMS Standard has proven to be an excellent measure of mood states and their fluctuations. The CES-D scale is a commonly used tool to characterize depressive symptoms in the general population. The 20-item self-administered scale measures the major depressive symptomatology, including depressive mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite and sleep disturbances. These will be administered on paper at the conclusion of the neuropsychological test battery. </outcome>

Safety: number of adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE)

Medical assistance is readily available on site in the unlikely event of AEs and SAEs. The study coordinator will inform the Principal Investigator of all AEs and SAEs in the first instance, who will then follow the CNRCs Emergency Unblinding Procedures, if necessary, and notify the relevant bodies. Depending on the nature of AEs or SAEs, it may be necessary for treatment to cease and/or for the participant to be withdrawn from the study.  Any participants experiencing AEs or SAEs on site will be referred to the consulting physician immediately for further medical evaluation. The Principal Investigator will follow-up with the consulting physician to determine the relationship of the AE or SAE to the study product. 

All SAE, including pregnancy that may be related or unrelated to the investigational product will be documented in the SAE Forms and in the Case Report Form. There are no known AE or SAE reported for the use of resveratrol at the dose that we are giving to the volunteers. An AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity in a subject involved in a biomedical research project administered an investigational product whether or not considered related to this product or study-related procedure and reported by the subject or observed by the investigator. A SAE is any AE that is: 

 - fatal (results in death)
(note: death is an outcome, not an event)
 - life-threatening
(note: the term life-threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe)
 - requires or prolongs hospital stay
(note: in-patient hospitalisation refers to an unplanned, overnight hospitalisation)
 - results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
(note: the term means substantial disruption of ones ability to conduct normal life function)
 - a congenital anomaly or birth defect
(note: congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis)
 - an important medical event
(note: Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be considered serious.) </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Menopause is a natural transition in every womans life, marking the end of fertility. Some women transit with little or no symptoms, while others suffer from the mood swings, hot flushes, insomnia and brain fog, which can last for many years. Eventually, these menopausal symptoms will disappear or lessen in intensity post-menopausally but there is nothing to celebrate. This is because women will no longer have the heart protective benefits of estrogen (a hormone that regulates menstruation). Reduced production of estrogen increases a womans risk of osteoporosis, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke and dementia. These disease conditions are closely related to poor blood circulation; estrogen targets the blood vessels to promote blood flow to tissues and organs like our heart, lungs and brain. 

Our brains require the effects of estrogen to increase blood flow to specific regions responsible for memory and learning. When circulating estrogen levels fluctuate they alter blood flow to the brain, triggering mood swings, irritability and poor mental performance (brain fog). It is believed that a persistent decrease in blood flow to the brain marks the start of brain function decline. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or estrogen therapy, is effective in reducing menopausal symptoms; some post-menopausal women continue HRT indefinitely. Estrogen can positively affect mental abilities such as concentration, memory, reasoning and reaction time. 

Resveratrol is an ingredient found in grapes and berries that has multiple benefits for heart health. It can work through multiple mechanisms including mimicking the action of estrogen on blood vessels to improve circulatory function, thereby having the potential to increase blood flow in the brain and enhance mental abilities and mood.
We aim to determine if regular resveratrol supplementation can enhance blood flow response to cognitive demands in specific regions of the brain and thereby improve mood and mental abilities such as short-term memory and the ability to concentrate better in postmenopausal women (at least 6 months after ceasing menstruation). Blood flow to the brain will be measured non-invasively with ultrasound. We will also use surveys to monitor their mood, sleep, quality of life (including chronic pain) and menopausal symptoms during the study. </summary>
