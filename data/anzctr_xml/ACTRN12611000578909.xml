    <interventions>The Encode system will be used at the time of implant restoration. This system does not involve the removal of the healing abutment or placement of an impression coping. An impression of the healing abutment is taken which is then scanned at the laboratory. Patients attend for 5 standard treatment visits (over a 6 month period) plus 2 further review appointments at yearly intervals (standard procedure).</interventions>
    <comparator>The conventional implant restoration involves additional procedures including removal of the healing abutment, placement of an impression coping and then replacement of the healing abutment. The restoration is then fabricated using conventional techniques in the laboratory. Patients attend for 5 standard treatment visits (over a 6 month period) plus 2 further review appointments at yearly intervals (standard procedure).</comparator>

Note: Surgical placement of the implant is not part of the study and restorations will be fabricated for implants placed as part of normal procedure. However, it is possible that surgical factors may have an impact on the ease-of-use of either restorative system, therefore the practitioner placing implants for subjects who have consented to be part of the study will collect relevant surgical information via questionnaire.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if the Encode implant restoration system allows for faster and simpler treatment compared to traditional implant restoration systems. the Encode system uses computerised scanning of the dental impression and does not require the use of impression copings.</summary>
