    <scientifictitle>For trigger points (TrPs) positive low back pain referred to the leg patients and TrPs-positive healthy volunteers as compared to TrPs-negative low back pain referred to the leg patients and TrPs-negative healthy volunteers, will dry needling provoke vasomotor reactions in the pain area and, thus, confirm the influence of sympathetic nerve activity on trigger point pain propagation.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Forty chronic low back pain radiating down  patients (experimental group) will be recruited to the study from Poznan GP doctors and the University Pain Clinic. Thirty healthy volunteers will be recruited by press announcement.
Experimental group  will be examined towards TrPs presence within the gluteus minimus. After that subjects will be assigned to four groups; group I: TrPs-positive experimental (n=20), group II: TrPs-negative experimental (n=20), group III: TrPs-negative control (n=15), and group IV: TrPs-positive control  (n=15).
 Each of the participants will draw his/her pain on a diagram and define the pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS). 
Before the Infrared Thermovision camera (IRT) session, the presence of active TrPs for experimental and control within the gluteus minimus muscle will be re-examined. After that IRT side-to-side comparison of the lower limb will be performed and then all participants will receive the dry needling (DN) session (2x 5 minutes with the 30 second break) and post-dry needling observation at rest (six consecutive minutes) under IRT control. DN will be performed within the gluteus minimus muscle into: two TrPs (group I and group IV) or two the most tender points (group II and group III). The area to be observed by IRT will be chosen according to the gluteus minimus referred pain pattern. Additionally, during DN participants will be asked to report the area of referred pain (thigh, calf, foot). The participants and IRT camera operator will not be aware of the myofascial pain diagnosis results. During IRT, the dry needling specialist will not be aware of the IRT camera results. 
The dry needling under IRT control will be conducted once.
Diagnostic criteria of active TrPs for experimental group: active TrPs will be confirmed if referred pain typical of the gluteus minimus muscle (anterior/posterior fibers) will be evoked digitally and by needle from tender points within that muscle and the patients will recognize that referred pain as their daily complaint. If a patient of the experimental  is needle-positive only but he/she does not recognize referred pain evoked by the needle as familiar, the presence of active TrPs will also be confirmed but with the note likely TrPs as additional description. 
For healthy volunteers (control), only latent TrPs are possible to be present. Diagnostic criteria for the control group: latent TrPs within the gluteus minimus muscle will be confirmed if digital pressure of the most tender point within that muscle provokes referred pain typical of gluteus minimus muscle TrPs. Similarly to the experimental group, when only the needle-evoked referred pain occurs likely TrPs (latent form) will be confirmed.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator: the control group will be non-TrPs healthy volunteers and non-TrPs low back pain radiating down subjects. They will receive the same dry needling procedure but in the most tender point which will not fulfil the criteria for TrPs confirmation.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>According to William Cochrans assumption for x2 test, to conduct the test the quantity of n=5 is required. It is assumed that in the examined group four subgroups will be present, namely group I: TrPs-positive experimental, group II: TrPs-negative experimental, group III: TrPs-negative control, and group IV: TrPs-positive control. Among non-TrPs subjects (experimental and control) the needle sensitive participants will be analyzed.  As a result, the information about the minimal size of the sample will be obtained (6 features* 2 types of vasomotor responses*the quantity of n=5 per subgroup; n=60). However, for the strong evidence of data the examined group will be n=70.
For the strong evidence of data presented, the significance level will be set based on exact tests, not on the default asymptotic method. Exact two-way Mann-Whitney U tests will be performed in order to ensure that data are representative of the whole population of possible data values. Tests will be applied to compare the differences for maximum, minimum and average skin temperatures and the percentage size of expected autonomic phenomena for the state after dry needling and, secondly, for the post-observation state. Pearson correlation with a two-tailed significance test will be applied to define the dependency of the autonomic phenomenon occurrence. All comparisons will be completed, with trigger points co-existence being the differentiating criterion. 
Values, figures and tables in the text will be expressed as + standard error of the mean (SEs). Significance level will be set at p&lt;0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20".</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The presence of the vasomotor reaction in the area where trigger points refer pain was presented. Short-term vasodilation after dry needling under IRT control of active TrPs was recorded but available data have some methodological weaknesses (e.g. the lack of randomization and control group)
The aim of this study is to evaluate the response to dry needling under IRT control of low back pain radiating down patients compared to control group regarding TrPs presence.</summary>
