  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most commonly reported side effects of chemotherapy is fatigue (tiredness).  The impact of fatigue in cancer patients varies from mild (where there is no impact on daily living) to severe (which can interfere with every aspect of daily living).  Recently, moderate to severe cancer patient fatigue experiences have been compared to that of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) experiencing similar issues (i.e. problems of concentration and motivation, reduced physical activity, emotional health problems and pain).
Clinical trials in a group of CFS patients showed a marked increase in 2 types of amino acids (basic building blocks of proteins), as they were excreted in the urine.  This means that proteins in the body were being broken down too quickly.  By breaking down the proteins too quickly, specific cell processes may be affected and less energy is available which means that you become tired quicker and maybe for longer periods of time.  In another open clinical trial amino acid supplements were given to CFS patients and 75% patients showed a relief in the symptom of fatigue.
Cancer patients, prior to chemotherapy treatment, are provided with basic education and information on how to manage fatigue.  However, some patients experience fatigue at a moderate to severe level that needs to be treated by supportive drug therapy by your doctor (i.e. antidepressants for emotional distress &amp; sleep disturbance, blood transfusions for anaemia).  When specific causes of fatigue cannot be identified, then other non-medical therapies may be suggested (i.e. introduction of an exercise program).
The aim of this study is to determine whether administering specific amino acid supplements to cancer patients who will be undergoing chemotherapy will reduce the symptom of fatigue.</summary>
