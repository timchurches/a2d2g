  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this of this study is to compare the use of Self Expanding Metal Stents (SEMS)
      to plastic stents for the treatment of benign biliary strictures secondary to chronic
      pancreatitis as it pertains to stricture resolution rates, complication rates and number of
      ERCP procedures during 24 months.

      Statistical testing will be performed to determine if the rate of stricture resolution for
      the metal stent is non-inferior to the plastic stent group.</summary>
