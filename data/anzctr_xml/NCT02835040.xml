  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pneumonia is the commonest illness requiring hospitalization in Australia. Elderly patients
      account for most admissions and incur highest costs due to longer hospitalizations, higher
      readmission risks and poor functional outcomes. Previous clinical trials show a number of
      medical and allied health interventions can effectively shorten hospitalization or reduce
      readmissions, but these have been poorly and inconsistently applied in practice. This
      proposed research builds on previous studies by applying these interventions as a
      standardized combined package, evaluating their effectiveness in a "real world" Australian
      setting and quantifying effects on both clinical outcomes and health service costs.</summary>
