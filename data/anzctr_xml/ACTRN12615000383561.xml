  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intermittent energy restriction (IER), type 2 diabetes, 12 months. IER is any short period where energy is restricted. For the purpose of this trial energy will be restricted using a very low calorie approach 500/600kcals/day, for two consecutive days/week - fasting days. Ad librium eating will be followed for the remaining 5 days/week - non-fasting days. Calorie advice will be provided for the fasting days with both serve suggestion and example meal plans and compliance will be monitored via food diaries at fortnightly visits for the first 3 months and then monthly visits thereafter with the study dietitian. </interventions>
    <comparator>Continuous energy restriction (CER), type 2 diabetes, 12 months. CER refers to the standard method of energy restriction used for weight loss. For the purpose of this trial CER will be limiting daily caloric intake to 1200-1700kcals/day. Calorie advice will be provided via serve suggestion and example meal plans and compliance will be monitored via food diaries at fortnightly visits for the first 3 months and then monthly visits thereafter with the study dietitian. </comparator>
