  <interventions>
    <interventions>The statin chosen for this trial, simvastatin (SIM), is a well-known and widely available 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and ischaemic heart disease. Simvastatin or placebo is the trial intervention. 

Simvastatin will be given as a 40 mg capsule taken daily for 90 days, starting 1 week prior to first radiation dose for standard Preoperative chemoradiation (pCRT). 

capsules, Simvastatin will be encapsulated in Swedish orange size DB AA capsules, filled with microcrystalline cellulose powder. Patients will be asked to return unused drug and empty drug containers at the Week 13 visit (6 weeks post-pCRT). The number of capsules remaining will be counted by trial research staff and recorded to confirm adherence.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Based on MRI 68 weeks after preoperative chemoradiation, an analysis of inter-observer agreement on mrTRG between site radiologists and a central
radiologist will be repeated on all remaining patients at the conclusion of the trial or prior to any publication of results.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to compare the effect of simvastatin with placebo on the effectiveness and side effects of pre-operative chemoradiotherapy treatment prior to rectal cancer surgery, and on the body's inflammatory response to cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma or high grade dysplasia with radiological evidence of invasive tumour, for which pre-operative chemoradiotherapy treatment is planned.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the active simvastatin treatment in addition to their planned chemoradiotherapy treatment, or to receive an inactive placebo in addition to their planned chemoradiotherapy treatment. Participants will take the allocated treatment capsule once daily for 90 days starting one week before chemoradiotherapy. The study will last 3 years and participants will be asked to visit the clinic on nine occasions for clinical examinations and they will also have blood tests and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Tumour tissue removed at the time of surgery will be assessed in the laboratory.

It is hoped that if the study showed  a positive outcome, then it may ultimately lead to patients in the future benefiting from adding simvastatin to chemoradiotherapy. </summary>
