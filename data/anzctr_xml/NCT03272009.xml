               -  Documented positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and

               -  Documented HBV DNA &gt; 1000 IU/mL

          3. Is anti-HBV treatment naive or treatment experienced (see also exclusion criterion
             #3).

          4. Gender: male or female.

          5. Age: 18 to 65 years inclusive.

          6. Body mass index (BMI): 17.0-35.0 kg/m2 inclusive.

          7. Has clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis tests within normal,
             allowable limits (with the exception of alanine aminotransferase [ALT]); see inclusion
             criterion #10); if there is an out of range value, the result must be considered
             clinically non-significant by the investigator in order to be eligible.

          8. Vital signs after at least 5 minutes resting in supine position at screening within
             the following ranges:

               -  systolic blood pressure: between 90 mm Hg and 145 mm Hg

               -  diastolic blood pressure: between 45 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg

               -  heart rate: between 40 bpm and 100 bpm

          9. Have no clinically significant abnormal 12-lead automatic electrocardiogram (ECG)
             (incomplete right bundle branch block can be accepted) at screening: PR interval
             between 120 ms -and 210 ms, QRS-duration &lt; 120 ms, QTc-interval (Fridericia's) = 450
             msec.

         11. Agrees to abstain from all medication, including non-prescription and prescription
             medication for 28 days prior to the Day 1 study visit, except for authorized
             medications (such as hormonal contraceptives for females, vitamins prescribed per
             label dosages and paracetamol). On a case-by-case basis, regular co-medication either
             as defined on the medication exception list or as documented by written approval from
             the sponsor as acceptable prior to randomization, will not be considered as a
             deviation from this criterion.

         12. At screening, females must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, or of non-childbearing
             potential (either surgically sterilized or physiologically incapable of becoming
             pregnant, or at least 1 year post-menopausal [amenorrhea duration of 12 consecutive
             months); non-pregnancy will be confirmed for all females by a pregnancy test conducted
             at screening and at follow-up visit.

         13. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, with a fertile male sexual partner, should
             be willing to use adequate contraception from screening until 90 days after the
             follow-up visit. Adequate contraception is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or
             an intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of
             contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in
             accordance with the lifestyle of the subject, is acceptable.

         14. Male subjects, if not surgically sterilized, should be willing to use adequate
             contraception and not donate sperm from the Day 1 visit to the clinical research
             centre until 90 days after the follow-up visit. Adequate contraception for the male
             subject (and his female partner) is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or an
             intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of contraception:
             a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in accordance with
             the lifestyle of the subject is acceptable.

         15. At screening, has no recent (&lt;3 months) history of any clinically significant
             conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the safety of
             the subject or impact the validity of the study results.

         16. Willingness to abstain from alcohol from 48 hours prior to each study visit to the
             clinical research centre.</inclusivecriteria>
