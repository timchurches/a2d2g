  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - Etoposide
Treatment: other - Radiotherapy

Experimental: Arm A - Conventional radical radiotherapy in this trial means that those patients with microscopic disease receive a dose of 50Gy using daily incremental fractions of 2Gy over 25 fractions and those with macroscopic disease receive 54Gy in 27 fractions.


Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
During radiotherapy: Carboplatin (AUC2) commences on day 1 of radiation and is repeated at weekly intervals on days 8, 15, 22 and 29 (of radiation).
After radiotherapy: 3 weeks after completing radiotherapy, 3 cycles of 3 weekly carboplatin (AUC4.5) intravenously on day 1.

Treatment: drugs: Etoposide
After Radiotherapy: 3 weeks after completing the radiation therapy, 3 cycles of 3 weekly etoposide (80mg/M2/day) intravenously days 1-3

Treatment: other: Radiotherapy
Microscopic Disease: 50Gy delivered in 2Gy doses over 25 fractions
Macroscopic Disease: 54Gy delivered in 2Gy doses over 27 fractions
