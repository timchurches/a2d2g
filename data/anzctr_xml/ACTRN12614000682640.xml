  <interventions>
    <interventions>Side posture spinal manipulation commonly referred to as a hypothenar transverse push procedure will be applied unilaterally to the L5 region of ther lumbar spine. The manipulation will be provided by an experienced chiropractor with 15 years of clinical experience. The duration of the procedure is approximately 1 minute and will be performed once. </interventions>
    <comparator>Comparing the effect of lumbar spinal manipulation when applied to either the left or right hand side of the spine. One group will receive the manipulation on the right (group 1) and one group will receive the manipulation on the left (group 2). </comparator>

    <sequence>Upon meeting the criteria outlined in section, participants will be randomly assigned to a group. Using a random number generator a randomisation list consisting of equal numbers of 1s and 2s representing the group allocation will be created by a researcher not taking outcomes measures or applying the intervention. The group assignment will be placed in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed, envelopes. The researcher who will apply the intervention, will use these envelopes to allocate participants to their respective groups. Group 1 will receive the intervention on the right, while group 2 will receive the intervention on the left.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to investigate whether manipulation of the lumbar spine effects measures of deep and superficial pain intensity at local and remote locations, for up to 30 minutes post manipulation. We also aim to investigate whether, if differences exist, these changes follow a segmental or non-segmental pattern, and whether the side to which spinal manipulation (SM) is applied creates asymmetrical changes in pain intensity.</summary>
