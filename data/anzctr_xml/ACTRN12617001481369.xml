    <interventions>This will be a single centre, double-blind, randomised, crossover study. Patients with severe OSA will be randomly assigned to receive an intravenous ketamine or a placebo infusion in the sequence given below, during an in-lab, overnight polysomnogram (PSG).

        Sequence A  infusion of ketamine during PSG 1 and a placebo infusion during PSG 2.
        Sequence B  placebo infusion during PSG 1 and ketamine infusion during PSG 2.

A ketamine dose of 100micrograms per kilogram per hour as an infusion with a maximum dose of 12mg per hour for patients weighing over 120kg will be administered to the study participants. Target duration for the infusion is 8hrs. The infusion will be stopped at 8 hours, excluding times the infusion was interrupted for any reason. Infusion duration will be less if the patient wakes up earlier than expected or cessation of infusion due to side effects.
The total volume of trial infusion administered and the duration of the infusion will be recorded by the investigators.

Minimum of a 7 day washout period will be included between the two infusions for every participant.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We require 22 patients with severe OSA to have a probability of =80% to detect a before and after relationship in the dependent variable at a two-sided 0.05 significance level, looking for a =10% change in the dependent variable ODI. 
Our sample size is based on the data from 47 consecutive patients newly diagnosed to have severe OSA at the Westmead Hospital Sleep Laboratory. The PSG for these patients will be equal to a PSG with a placebo infusion in our study. The mean ODI during sleep in these patients was 50.84 events/hr with a standard deviation of 12.9. 

There are insufficient data in the literature on ketamine infusions used in crossover trials and its effect on ODI values. Hence these data needed to be predicted. Each patient in the Control data was assumed to decrease their ODI value by 0  25% after the ketamine infusion. The amount of change for each patient was allocated by a random number generator. The mean of the predicted infusion data: 45.51.

The actual correlation between the control data and the predicted data was 0.9. Hence it is a reasonable approach to use a conservative correlation of 0.7.

Statistical Analysis 
A per-protocol analysis will be carried out at the end of the study. Hence, data from the participants who drop out before completion of the second PSG will not be included in the analysis.

Analysis method for the primary outcome
The variation in the oxygen desaturation index in an individual during sleep will
be compared to the placebo PSG and the ketamine PSG using a paired t-test.

Analysis methods for secondary outcomes
Comparison of the individual variation between the placebo PSG and the ketamine PSG for AHI, Central apnoea rate, Time spent below 90% oxygen saturation, Oxygen saturation nadir, Mean saturation, Mean REM TcpCO2 and Mean slow wave sleep TcpCO2, will be assessed using a paired t-test.
Percentage change in the mean chin EMG activity during REM sleep, the percentage change in the mean chin EMG activity during N3 sleep, the amount of REM Sleep achieved as a percentage of total sleep time and the amount of Slow Wave Sleep achieved as a percentage of total sleep time will be assessed using the relevant non-parametric tests (e.g. McNemars test, direction of change analysis)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project intends to investigate the respiratory effects of a low dose ketamine infusion in patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

Recent studies have shown that over 25% of patients undergoing surgery may be suffering from Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). An estimated 80% of patients with OSA would undergo surgery without a diagnosis. Due to the epidemic of obesity on the rise, the prevalence of OSA, which is common among overweight people, is expected to increase over time. 

Ketamine is a medication different from the morphine family of medications (opioids), that is used as an adjunct to opioids in pain management following surgery. Low-dose ketamine infusion results in reduced opioid requirements, less sedation, a lower rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting with no change in breathing patterns. Previous trials, both in volunteers and postoperative patients not suffering from OSA, has shown improved oxygen saturation and a lower carbon dioxide level in the blood when ketamine was used with opioid medications.

  Hypothesis:
 Based on results from previous trials involving ketamine, we anticipate this medication to have a beneficial effect on breathing during sleep in patients suffering from OSA. 

The results of this study will enable us to identify whether ketamine is a suitable medication for use in patients suffering from OSA. This will help create accurate guidelines on the management of patients with OSA undergoing surgery.

 Design: 
We will administer either low-dose ketamine or a placebo (normal saline) as an infusion to volunteers suffering from severe OSA and conduct a standard in-lab sleep study to assess the blood oxygen level,
breathing pattern and sleep pattern. Each patient will receive both a ketamine infusion and the placebo infusion in a random order with a period of one week between the two sleep studies.
This will be a single centre, double-blind, randomised, crossover study. Patients with severe OSA will be randomly assigned to receive either ketamine or a placebo in the sequence given below, during an in-lab, overnight polysomnogram (PSG).

        Sequence A  infusion of ketamine during PSG 1 and a placebo infusion during PSG 2.
        Sequence B  placebo infusion during PSG 1 and ketamine infusion during PSG 2.

Sample size: 22 patients

Study duration: 12 months

Aim: 
To identify whether a ketamine infusion significantly affects the ventilation of OSA patients during sleep, when given in doses used for pain relief following surgery.

Primary endpoint:
Oxygen desaturation index of the patients will be compared between the PSG with a ketamine infusion and the PSG with a placebo infusion.</summary>
