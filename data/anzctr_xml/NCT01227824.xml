  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HIV-1RNA &lt;50 Copies (c)/Milliliter (mL) Through Week 48. - Percentage of participants with plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) with &lt;50 c/mL was assessed using the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "snapshot" algorithm. The algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data as non-responders, as well as participants who switch their concomitant Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) prior to Week 48 as follows: background ART substitutions not permitted per study; background ART substitutions permitted per study unless the decision to switch was documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success or failure will be determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the subject was on-treatment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4+ Cell Counts Over Time - CD4 lymphocyte cells (also called T-cells or T-helper cells) are the primary targets of HIV. The CD4 count and the CD4 percentage mark the degree of immunocompromise.

      <outcome>Number of Participants With the Indicated Post-baseline HIV-associated Conditions and Progression, Excluding Recurrences - Clinical disease progression (CDP) was assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV-1 classification system. Category (CAT) A: one or more of the following conditions (CON), without any CON listed in Categories B and C: asymptomatic HIV infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV infection. CAT B: symptomatic CON that are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or that are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection; and not included among CON listed in clinical CAT C. CAT C: the clinical CON listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition. Indicators of CDP were defined as: CDC CAT A at Baseline (BS) to a CDC CAT C event (EV); CDC CAT B at BS to a CDC CAT C EV; CDC CAT C at BS to a new CDC CAT C EV; or CDC CAT A, B, or C at BS to death.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AUC(0-tau) of DTG - AUC is defined as the area under the DTG concentration-time curve as a measure of drug exposure over time. AUC(0-tau) is defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time tau over a dosing interval at steady state, where tau is the length of the dosing interval of DTG. The predicted individual AUC(0-tau) were obtained from the final population PK model by an empirical Bayes estimation. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments were collected at pre-dose (within 15 minutes prior to dose) at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48 and 1 to 3 hours post-dose or 4 to 12 hours post-dose at Week 4 and Week 24. If 1 to 3 hours post-dose was completed at Week 4, then the 4 to12 hour post-dose must be obtained at Week 48, and vice versa. AUC was estimated using population PK modeling based on PK data from all visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cmax and Ctau of DTG - The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctau) of DTG were assessed at Week 48. The predicted individual Cmax and Ctau were obtained from the final population PK model by simulation of the concentration-time profiles. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments were collected at pre-dose (within 15 minutes prior to dose) at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48 and 1 to 3 hours post-dose or 4 to 12 hours post-dose at Week 4 and Week 24. If 1 to 3 hour post-dose was completed at Week 4, then the 4 to12 hour post-dose must be obtained at Week 48, and vice versa.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the non-inferior antiviral activity of GSK1349572 50
      mg once daily versus RAL 400mg twice daily over 48 weeks; non-inferiority will also be tested
      at Week 96. Both GSK1349572 and RAL will be given in combination with fixed-dose dual NRTI
      therapy (ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC). This study will be conducted in HIV-1 infected ART-naïve adult
      subjects.</summary>
