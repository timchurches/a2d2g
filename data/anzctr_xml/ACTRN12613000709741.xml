  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those randomised to the methoxyflurane arm will be given extra instructions on the use of the Penthrox inhaler. They will then be asked to inhale the methoxyflurane for approximately 2 minutes as a pre-medication from one, 3mL dose in a Penthrox inhaler. Since methoxyflurane has a sweet tasting smell, patients will be advised to breathe in a stepwise fashion (from shallow to deep) over that 2 minute period. Once the colonoscopy has commenced, patients will be encouraged to take an adequate inhalation of methoxyflurane to provide sufficient analgesia. Patients are then allowed to self administer as much methoxyflurane as they feel they require within the safety limit as recommended by the manufacturer (6mL /day). Furthermore, they will be instructed to self administer further doses of methoxyflurane by the endoscopist if the endoscopist anticipate potential loops which may cause discomfort.</interventions>
    <comparator>Those in the control group will receive an initial bolus of fentanyl and midazolam before the procedure based on their age. A further bolus of these medications will be given during the procedure at the discretions of the endoscopist: 1-2mg midazolam every 10-15 mins, and 25-50mcg fentanyl every 10-15 mins (AMH 2009).  
Recommended initial dosage of midazolam and fentanyl for colonoscopy stratify by the patients age (ref_AMH 2009) is as follows:

Age &lt;60 dose: Midazolam =2.5mg and Fentanyl=100mcg
Age  equal to or &gt;60 dose: Midazolam =1.5mg and Fentanyl=50mcg</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study will be conducted as a randomised controlled multi-centre trial in adult participants requiring analgesia associated with a planned colonoscopy. Patients will be recruited for this study from either an outpatient setting or through the Endoscopic suite. Together with the appointment form for the colonoscopy procedure, the study Information Sheet will be sent to suitable patients to invite them to participate in the study. This should allow enough time for the patients to read and understand the study prior to the procedure time.  These patients will then be approached in the Endoscopic Unit prior to colonoscopy regarding participation in the study. If they are agreeable to the study, they will be randomised to receive either methoxyflurane or conventional sedation (midazolam and fentanyl) in anticipation of incident pain associated with colonoscopy, in 1:1 ratio.
The patients are assigned a patient number when they are recruited into the study. On the day of their procedure, these numbers are then plugged into the random number generator of the computer program Graphpad Prism which randomly assigns a group allocation to each number. In this way, allocation is concealed as the person recruiting the subjects has no way of knowing which group the subject will be allocated to.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method used to generate the sequence in which the subjects will be randomised will be done using the computer program Graphpad Prisms random number generator, which is seeded with the time of day, so it works differently each time you use it. Each day, the numbers of the subjects who have agreed to undergo the trial is plugged into the program, then the program first assigns each numbered subject to a group nonrandomly. Then the assignment of each subject is swapped with the group assignment of a randomly chosen subject. This process is repeated twice to ensure true randomness.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations have been made based upon the results of the pilot study, published in JGH 2008, A227. Using the endpoint of mean patients discomfort score and related standard deviation, power calculation with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, power of 90% and assuming that a difference of 1.0 in mean discomfort score is clinically important, the trial will need to recruit a minimum of 112 participants per treatment arm. Taken into account of the 30% drop-off rate from enrolment, the FINAL required sample size would be 299, which is an odd number for 1:1 randomization. Therefore, the minimum sample size of 300 was chosen.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim is to investigate the efficacy and safety of methoxyflurane as a patient controlled analgesia in colonoscopic procedures, as compared to the traditional endoscopist provided analgesia/sedation.

Hypothesis
Methoxyflurane is as effective and safe in providing adequate analgesia for patients undergoing colonoscopic procedures as conventional intravenous sedative/analgesia with midazolam and fentanyl.
Patients prefer patient controlled analgesia, compared with endoscopist administered analgesia.
