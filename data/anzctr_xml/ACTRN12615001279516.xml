  <interventions>
    <interventions>A text message package (called MINT) based on Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (Segal et al., 2002), was developed.  MINT is an adjunct to treatment as usual by the Early Intervention Psychosis team. Participants will received two text messages a day to encourage them to practice the mindfulness skills learnt in therapy at home. MINT lasts for 8 weeks. Weekly measures will be collected at baseline, during the intervention, and post-intervention. Home-based mindfulness practice is supported by the text message package (MINT), short mindfulness practices are suggested in-line with the TAU mindfulness skills learnt in existing therapy. Examples of these text messages are: "Placing your hand on your stomach, feeling it rise and fall with your breath. ", "Placing a flower by your bed so you can see it when you wake up. Next time you see the flower, smile and breathe deeply 3 times.", "Taking 3 minutes, focusing on the breath, sit or lie comfortably. Breathing in... breathing out. "</interventions>

    <designfeatures>A single case design approach, with ABA and multiplebaseline
features will be used to evaluate the intervention.
The single case approach is useful in real life settings, as it can monitor changes in participants behavior (Engel &amp;
Schutt, 2013). This type of approach seeks to demonstrate that the intervention has an effect on behavior compared
to functioning before the intervention was administered (Mitchell &amp; Jolley, 2001). </designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>In ABA design, the baseline is measured to establish the level of behavior (A), then the intervention is given and the behavior measured (B) and then the intervention is withdrawn and behavior measured again (A) (Mitchell &amp; Jolley, 2001). Using a nonconcurrent
multiple baseline approach is suitable for comparing more than three participants and if consistent results are found the likelihood that change is due to an external event is reduced (Engel &amp; Schutt, 2013). By exploring small numbers of individuals in a real life setting, rich data can be gathered that may be lost in larger group trials (Engel &amp; Schutt, 2013). This exploratory research in a clinical setting is likely to obtain between 12 and 20 participants and
therefore the ABA approach is suitable. No statistical assumptions or sample size calculations were undertaken as this is no appropriate for a single case design, where the mode of analysis is visual analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate whether a mindfulness-based text message package, delivered as an adjunct to existing therapy, can help to improve levels of home-based mindfulness practice and increase mindfulness skills for patients involved in Early Intervention Teams. A text message package, called MINT, based on Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) has been developed by the researcher. Clinical participants will be recruited from
the Early Intervention Teams (EIT) clinical psychologists in Auckland, New Zealand, based on their clinical evaluation of their patients suitability for inclusion. The EIT intensive treatment consists of long periods of rapport building, followed by MBCT based skills, with therapy typically lasting for 2 to 3 years. The EIT provides its own crisis management, and monitors the risk of their patients on a weekly basis. It thus provides an excellent opportunity to
evaluate the effect of MINT, in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), with the lowest possible risks. The intervention will consist of 8 weeks, where participants will be receiving two text messages daily, containing focus mindfulness information and suggesting mindfulness practices. The research design will follow a single case method structure with a multiple baseline ABA approach. The EIT clinicians will be collecting a range of quantitative measures during baseline, intervention and postintervention periods. These will include a question about the number of days of Mindfulness practice in the previous week, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale  Revised (CAMSR; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson, &amp; Laurenceau, 2007), and the Patient Health Questionnaire  4 (PHQ4; Kroenke, Spitzer, Williams, &amp; Lowe, 2009). At the end of the trial, participants and clinical psychologists
experiences of using the text message package will be explored using a questionnaire specifically designed for this purpose.</summary>
