  <interventions>
    <interventions>Metformin XR - 7 days at 500mg followed by 7 days at 1000mg, followed by 7 days at 1500mg and then to a total daily dose of 2000mg  for a duration of 12 months.
Saxagliptin - oral tablet at a total daily dose of 5mg  for a duration of 12 months. 
Dapagliflozin - oral tablet at a total daily dose of 10mg  for a duration of 12 months.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomized to usual care (sequential/control) arm will initially receive metformin alone (increased to a total daily dose of 2000mg daily).  Saxagliptin (5mg once daily) followed by dapagliflozin 10mg daily will be offered to the patients if HbA1c remains above 7.5% throughout the study period. 
Treating endocrinologist will make the decision to begin saxagliptin if HbA1c remains above 7.5% for the first three months, then begin dapagliflozin if HbA1c remains above 7.5% for another three months (i.e. at the 6 month timepoint). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Beta cell function assessed using a mixed-meal challenge test (MMCT).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The MMCT will be undertaken using high-protein boost concentrate of 1 g/kg carbohydrate equivalent, at baseline and at 12-month post randomization. Patients will fast for 12 hours before the test, and all hypoglycaemic agents will be withheld for 24 hours before each testing. Glucose and C-peptide will be measured from blood samples at baseline (before the ingestion of the mixed meal) and then 8 times over the 4-hour test (15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 240 minutes). 

Insulin secretion will be estimated using the area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and C-peptide (total, incremental, 0- 30 minutes and 0-maximal production) and then determining C- peptide to glucose ratio to estimate insulin production. Insulin sensitivity will be calculated using the C-peptide based Matsuda index.
</timepoint>

This is a pilot study and the data from this study will be used to determine the sample size calculation for a larger multicenter study. Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics.
Demographic, medical history, and baseline data will be summarised by treatment group and analysed for comparability across groups using Students t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for pairwise comparisons.  A p-value of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant.
Unpaired student t tests will be undertaken to determine differences in the change in HbA1c from baseline until the end of the study between the two groups of patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the majority of people with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, the standard medical treatment starts with metformin, followed by the addition of other medications if blood glucose levels remain elevated.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible risks and the effectiveness of using three different tablets together to normalise blood glucose levels in adults with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes, compared with starting treatment with one tablet, and adding the other two tablets sequentially if blood glucose levels remain above normal.  All of the tablets are already available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the use of all 3 together in newly diagnosed diabetes has not been studied.
Participants will be randomly assigned by a computer to receive treatment with metformin, saxagliptin and dapagliflozin together at the onset of the study, or to commence treatment with metformin, and add saxagliptin and dapagliflozin sequentially if their blood glucose levels remain above normal. 
Approximately 20 volunteers will be recruited to participate in the study. Participants involvement in the study will last 12 months, and include 5 study visits at the research site.  Participants will have an initial medical assessment, and receive information about blood glucose self-monitoring, diet and lifestyle habits. They will then be randomly assigned to receive metformin 2000mg daily, saxagliptin 5mg daily and dapagliflozin 10mg daily either concurrently, or sequentially over 12 months.
Participants will visit the research site every 4 months during the treatment period for monitoring. During these visits, participants will be weighed, have their blood pressure checked and blood glucose readings reviewed, and have a fasting blood and a urine test.  At the beginning and end of the 12 month treatment period, participants will be also be asked to undergo testing of their blood glucose levels in response to a meal.
Once all participants have completed the study, the study results will be analysed and released.
