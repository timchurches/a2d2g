  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive one additional session to their usual therapy regimen, for the provision of physical activity education and counselling. This will be a 15-45minute session, based in the Community Rehabilitation Centre and conducted by the research co-ordinator or a Grade 2 Community Rehabilitation Physiotherapist. 
The education element will focus on the health benefits of cardiovascular exercise. The counselling will be targeted to the participant's stage-of-change in relation to exercise, as assessed by the Exercise Stage of Change Assessment. The therapist delivering the intervention will match advice to stage of change in accordance with the guidelines outlined in:
Jordan PJ &amp; Nigg CR. 2002. Applying the transtheoretical Model: Tailoring interventions to stages of change. Chapter 6. Promoting exercise and behavior change in older adults: Interventions with the Transtheoretical model. Burbank PM &amp; Riebe D.
The intervention will be aimed at increasing long term physical activity levels.

Those in the intervention group will also be provided with one of the two booklets of written educational material to match their age:
 &lt;65 years:  Department of Health. 2014. Make your move- Sit less- Be active for life! Australian Government  or
65 years+:  Department of Veterans Affairs &amp; Department of Health &amp; Ageing. 2005. Choose Health: Be Active- A physical activity guide for older Australians. Australian Government. 

They will also be provided with a personalised written walking program. Advice regarding duration and frequency of daily walks will be based on the participant's current and previous levels of physical activity, as discussed during the interview, The aim will be to gradually grade up a walking program to assist the participant to meet the Physical Activity guidelines of 30minutes of moderate intensity exercise, at least 5 times per week. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care from their treating therapists with the addition of provision of a government physical activity educational handout matched to their age:

      <outcome>Feasibility of the intervention in this population, including; number of eligible participants, number of participants recruited to the trial, number of participants receiving the intervention and number of participants followed up at 3 months. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 month follow up from the delivery of the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Daily physical activity levels as measured by GENEActiv activity monitor,
GENEActiv is a waterproof activity monitor to be worn by participants on their wrist for a period of seven days. Data collected from the activity monitor will include; sedentary time and time spent in very light, light, moderate and vigorous physical activity (composite data).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured at baseline (at discharge from community rehabilitation) and at three months following the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life will be measured on the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQOL) 6D questionnaire. This tool encompasses the domains of independent living, mental health, coping, relationships, pain and senses. This self-reported measure is valid and reliable for use in the community rehabilitation population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured at baseline and at 3 months following the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage-of-change in relation to exercise will be measured on the Exercise Stage Assessment questionnaire. This scale asks participants to rate their intention to engage in regular exercise by selecting one of five statements which best reflects their current intention or behaviour related to participating in regular exercise.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline and at three months following the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy will be measured using the Self- Efficacy for Exercise (SEE) Scale. The SEE asks participants to rate their confidence to exercise under 11 different conditions on a 10 point scale. The SEE has been validated for use in older adults. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed at baseline and at three months following the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clients attend Alfred Health Community Rehabilitation Program for goal-oriented rehabilitation following a change in their health status (i.e. stroke, joint replacement, falls). Many of these clients are elderly and/or suffer from one or more chronic health conditions (i.e. osteoarthritis, diabetes, heart disease). 
Rehabilitation is targeted to address current goals and concerns, however no formal education is given about the benefit of adherence to a long-term physical activity program. 
This study will assess the feasibility of delivering a single session intervention of physical activity education and counselling, geared towards encouraging long-term physical activity. The intervention will be delivered at the end of the clients community rehabilitation program encounter.
On completion of baseline measures, clients will be allocated to either the intervention or usual care group. Usual care group clients will receive standard care with the addition of being provided with written physical activity educational material.
The intervention group will receive one additional session to their usual therapy regimen, for the provision of physical activity education and counselling. They will also be provided with written educational material and a personalised written walking program. The intervention will be tailored to the participant's stage of change and self efficacy in relation to exercise. These items will be assessed using questionnaires, completed both at baseline and at three-month follow up.
The primary outcome will be assessing the feasibility of this intervention, considering the rate of recruitment, completion of the intervention, and follow up rates.
Physical activity levels will be assessed using an activity monitor at baseline and three-month follow-up. Participants will need to wear the activity monitor armband for one week at each assessment point. This will collect data about energy expenditure, sedentary time and time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity. Quality of Life will also be assessed, using a questionnaire.
