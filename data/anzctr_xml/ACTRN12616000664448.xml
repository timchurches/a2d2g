  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1: In addition to usual care (see control below) patients who do not respond will receive another message in four weeks time. This message will be slightly different to the first, but will ask them to respond. A third message will be sent to patients who do not respond in another four weeks. The second and third messages will be different in that it will acknowledge that we have already sent a previous text and this is a follow-up and it will enable people to opt out of further messages.

Intervention 2: In addition to usual care (see control below) patients will receive a text message with a hyperlink to the YouTube video will be sent to patients  four weeks after the usual care text message. A GP from one of the study practices will record a brief (30-60 seconds) motivational message to patients who smoke. The motivational message will contain the following: a brief introduction by the GP recording the message, including a short message on the benefits of quitting and then an offer of support to quit, including a brief description of the support available. The video will be uploaded onto YouTube. A template will be designed that will help GPs to deliver this message. </interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: A single SMS text message sent to current smokers asking them to (a) confirm current smoking status and (b) ask if they would like help in stopping smoking in the following way

Hi [PAT_FIRSTNAME], [PAT_PROV]s nurse updating our records. Are you still smoking, would you like help to quit? Reply what suits best. Help me quit. Not ready to quit yet.  Quit in the last year. Quit over a year ago.

      <outcome>'Proportion of smokers who respond with "help me quit" to a question asking if they would like help in stopping smoking through SMS text message'</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three months after the first SMS usual care text message is sent.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of smokers who respond to the message.

The proportion of smokers who respond to the message will be measured by collecting incoming text messages.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within three months after the first SMS usual care text message is sent.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient feedback on the intervention.

Patient feedback on the intervention will be assessed by asking patients to respond to two text messages:
(a) Was it appropriate to receive the message from your doctor? (Reply Y or N)
(b) Did it increase your motivation to quit? (Score range 0 not at all to 5 extremely)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three months after the first SMS usual care text message is sent.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Whilst personal, face-to-face interventions are the gold standard, not all patients visit their GP over the course of a year. The tobacco health target now focuses on the entire enrolled population and so ways to engage all patients are needed. Many PHOs have invested resource in telephoning patients who smoke to offer support to quit. Whilst effective in engaging smokers these calls can be time and resource intensive. Technology, such as mobile phone messaging and the Internet, offers potential low cost solutions. PHOs have been sending single text messages to known smokers to support practice efforts in encouraging their patients to quit. This appears to have some success.

However, it is possible that multiple messages sent out over an extended time frame will prompt a greater response than a single message. Provision of a more emotionally salient offer of help to quit (e.g. a short video message from the patients GP) and more detailed information on what is available may make patients more likely to accept this offer of help to quit.

This study examines the effects of two innovations to delivering an offer of support to quit smoking to current smokers enrolled with a primary health care organisation. The study objectives are:
1.	To compare the response rate of increased frequency of SMS text messages that offer support to patients who smoke to quit with a single SMS text messages (current best practice).
2.	To compare the response rate of a SMS text messages containing a link to a YouTube video of a GP making an offer of support to quit smoking with a single SMS text messages (current best practice).
3.	To assess patients acceptability of the messages.
