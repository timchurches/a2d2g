  <interventions>
    <interventions>A novel code game enuresis alarm which needs a code word for sensing wettness. The sensor is secured in a pad and can be worn inside the child's underpants. This alarm will emit an audio signal to wake the child. The participant will be using this alarm until cure or for a maximum of 4 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bedwetting affects 10% school aged children and 2% adults. It impacts on sleep, concentration, learning and self esteem. First line treatment is with a bedwetting alarm. The Childrens Hospital at Westmead has designed a bedwetting alarm which is more effective, including in those who had previously failed alarm therapy. This alarm incorporates the latest technology with a new concept in treating bedwetting. The predicted success rate is 80-95% (compared with 65-75% for standard alarms).We aim to further refine the proof of concept alarm and compare it to standard alarms.</summary>
