  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) plus laser treatment versus laser treatment alone for diabetic macular edema, to determine whether intravitreal steroids will be beneficial if they are used earlier in the course of DMO in conjunction with laser treatment.
we propose that pretreatment with intravitreal triamcinolone of an eye with macular oedema will allow laser treatment to be applied more accurately and with lower power, resulting in greater reduction of oedema and better visual outcomes. Laser treatment after the instillation of the triamcinolone will also reduce the risk of the oedema recurring as the steroid wears off.
Study treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone or placebo will be administered within one week of the baseline angiogram and OCT and on the day of the baseline visual acuity measurement. Triamcinolone (0.1 ml Kenacort 40, 40mg/ml triamcinolone acetate, Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals, Australia) will be injected into the vitreous. 
All eyes will receive laser treatment according to a standardised protocol 6 weeks after the injection of triamcinolone or placebo based on the distribution of the leak that was demonstrated by the baseline fluorescein angiogram. Treatment will be applied irrespective of whether the macular oedema is still present or not.
The duration of the patient follow-up is 2 years and the duration of the entire study is 3.5 years.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After signing the informed consent form, each patient will be randomized to receive study treatment using a series of serially numbered, opaque envelopes containing an assignment to treat or placebo. Treatment assignments will be compiled using a list of computer generated pseudo-random numbers in permuted blocks of variable size. The identification of patients will consist of a code made up of the patientâ€™s initials and number. Observers assessing best corrected visual acuity will be masked to treatment allocation, as well the investigator who performs laser treatment and decides whether further treatment is indicated or not. The surgeon performing the injections will be unmasked to treatment allocation. The photographer and OCT operators need not be masked.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients are randomized to receive study treatment using a series of serially numbered, opaque envelopes containing an assignment to treat or placebo. Treatment assignments will be compiled using a list of computer generated pseudo-random numbers in permuted blocks of variable size. In patients with only one eye eligible for the study, the eye will be randomised to receive treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone or a placebo sub-conjunctival injection. In patients with both eyes eligible for the study, the right eye will receive the treatment assignment in the envelope and the fellow eye will receive the reverse treatment.</sequence>
