    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Overall Response (OR), Defined as Those Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), Assessed Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 and Cutaneous Lesions - RECIST-based response assessment was done at Weeks (Wks) 4 and 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Cutaneous disease assessment was done at Wk 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. OR was evaluated when the skin and RECIST assessments coincided. Per RECIST, CR is the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD. Cutaneous disease contained non-measurable and measurable skin disease, which was assessed by skin assessment tools.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Median Duration of Response,Defined as the First Documented Evidence of CR or PR Until the First Documentation of Disease Progression - RECIST-based response assessment was done at Wks 4 and 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Cutaneous disease assessment was done at Wk 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. OR was evaluated when the skin and RECIST assessments coincided. Per RECIST, PD is &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesion and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Cutaneous disease contained non-measurable and measurable skin disease, which was assessed by skin assessment tools.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria:

        Specific information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events,
        and other pertinent information on the investigational product that may impact patient
        eligibility is provided in the pazopanib IB and lapatinib prescribing information (or the
        lapatinib IB).

        For Cohort 1 of this study, eligible patients met inclusion criteria outlined in the
        original version of the protocol and protocol amendment 1.

        For Cohort 2 of this study, eligible patients must meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Patients must have evaluable Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) substantiated by all of
             the following prior to randomization:

          -  History of invasive breast cancer documented by a biopsy and accompanying pathology
             report

          -  Current photographs* (global view and close-up views of all skin lesions) submitted at
             screening demonstrating unequivocal evidence of IBC as determined by either the
             medical monitor alone or in consultation with one or more of the study Principal
             Investigators.

          -  All patients must have photography at screening. Canfield Scientific Inc. will provide
             centralized monitoring, tracking, and collection of patients' photographs throughout
             the study. Screening photographs must be uploaded to the Canfield Scientific Inc
             website and approved by Canfield Scientific Inc, as the central photography vendor.
             The photographs, along with the completed Inflammatory Breast Cancer Skin Assessment
             Tool (IBSAT), must be reviewed and approved by GSK before a patient can be randomized.
             Sites should allow a minimum of 3 business days for this process. Sites submitting
             quality photographs and IBSATs on a regular basis will receive an exemption from this
             requirement for future patients.

          -  Patients with secondary IBC are eligible.

          -  Measurable lesions (cutaneous or radiographic) may be in the field of prior standard
             or palliative radiation therapy; however, there must be at least a 4 week period
             between the last radiation treatment and the baseline scan documenting disease status
             for the lesion to be measurable. If the irradiated lesion is the only site of disease,
             documented progression of the irradiated lesion is required.

          -  Disease progression or relapse following treatment for invasive breast cancer, which
             must have included a chemotherapy regimen. In regions where trastuzumab is available
             with no barriers to access*, patients must have received prior trastuzumab in addition
             to chemotherapy in order to be eligible. * (Barriers to access may include financial
             considerations.)

          -  Unequivocal ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer, defined as 3+ staining by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC), or 2+ staining by IHC in conjunction with ErbB2 gene
             amplification by FISH/CISH, or ErbB2 gene amplification by FISH/CISH alone (in
             subjects whose tumor blocks were not assessed by IHC). ErbB2 gene amplification is
             defined by: &gt; six (6) ErbB2 gene copies/nucleus for test systems without an internal
             control probe or an ErbB2/CEP 17 ratio of more than 2.2.

        Sites must submit a copy of the laboratory report demonstrating unequivocal ErbB2
        overexpression, if testing performed at a local laboratory, with the screening worksheet.
        Archived tumor must be provided for all patients for ErbB2 FISH testing by the central
        laboratory. Patients will remain on study based on local ErbB2 expression results. If
        archived tumor is not available, a biopsy must be obtained at screening and sent to TMD
        Laboratories for ErbB2 FISH testing.

        - Patients must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific
        procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.
        Procedures conducted as part of the patient's routine clinical management (e.g., blood
        count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be utilized for
        screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the
        protocol.

        Note: Informed consent may be obtained prior to the protocol-specified screening window
        (i.e. Day -14 to Day -1).

          -  Females age = 18 years, except in Tunisia. In Tunisia, patients must be = 20 years to
             be eligible for this study.

             eligible.

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction within the institutional range of normal as measured by
             echocardiogram. MUGA scans will be accepted in cases where an echocardiogram cannot be
             performed or is inconclusive or where MUGA scans are the accepted standard. Patients
             with known history of uncontrolled or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive
             heart failure are not eligible.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant),
        including any female who has had:

          -  A hysterectomy

          -  A bilateral oophorectomy (ovariectomy)

          -  A bilateral tubal ligation

          -  Is post-menopausal

          -  Patients not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must have experienced total

             estradiol value &lt; 40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L).

        Patients must discontinue HRT prior to study enrollment due to the potential for inhibition
        of CYP enzymes that metabolize estrogens and progestins (See Section 8). For most forms of
        HRT, at least 2-4 weeks must elapse between the cessation of HRT and determination of
        menopausal status; length of this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. If a
        female patient is determined not to be post-menopausal, they must use adequate
        contraception, as defined immediately below.

        Childbearing potential, including any female who has had a negative serum pregnancy test
        within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment, preferably as close to the first
        dose as possible, has used adequate contraception since the pregnancy test and agrees to
        use adequate contraception as described below. GSK acceptable contraceptive methods, when
        used consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions of the
        physician, are as follow:

          -  An intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.

          -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female patient's entry and is the
             sole sexual partner for that female.

             investigational product, through the dosing period, and for at least 21 days after the
             last dose of investigational product.

          -  Double-barrier contraception (condom with spermicidal jelly, foam suppository, or
             film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and diaphragm with spermicide).

        Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug drug interactions.

        Female patients who are lactating should discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of
        investigational product and should refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and
        for 14 days following the last dose of investigational product.

    <summary>The double blind part of the study is being conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of
      pazopanib in combination with lapatinib with that of lapatinib alone in subjects with
      inflammatory breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the ErbB2 protein. There is also an
      Open-label pazopanib arm to this study designed to test whether pazopanib given alone and
      lapatinib given alone would be safe and effective to treat patients with inflammatory breast
      cancer.</summary>
