    <interventions>Physiotherapy treatment A. Participants will receive 1 x 45-minute physiotherapy assessment plus 12 x 30-minute physiotherapy treatment sessions over a 6-month period. All participants will be treated by qualified and registered physiotherapists at one of four private physiotherapy clinics throughout Melbourne, Australia. To protect trial blinding, the nature of the physiotherapy treatment is being withheld from the registry but has been provided privately to ANZCTR staff and will be made publically available at the conclusion of the trial. Treatment fidelity will be monitored by the submission of the physiotherapist's treatment notes to the researchers for every patient. </interventions>

treatment program that you undertook in this trial? If so, please explain".) 
2) Treating physiotherapist reporting at each treatment session recorded on clinical notes ("Please record any adverse events reported by the participant since the last treatment session, or during today's treatment session").  </outcome>

Statistical analysis
Analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis, with missing data accounted for using maximum likelihood estimation within repeated measures linear mixed models. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken using multiple imputation for missing data. Alpha will be set at 0.05 using a two-tailed hypothesis. Between-group treatment effects for continuous data will be derived from the group x time interaction of the linear mixed models. The models will adjust for the baseline score of the outcome of interest, and the stratification variable (treatment location). Ordinal data (relating to some secondary outcome measures) will be analysed using the Mann Whitney U test. 

Cost-effectiveness analysis 
A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken from the healthcare perspective, with costs associated with work absence considered separately. Health benefits will be calculated using the EuroQol-5D (primary measure) and the AQoL-8D (secondary / sensitivity measure).. Cost data will be calculated from participant questionnaires (see outcome assessment relating to healthcare utilisation, number of work days missed, and medication consumption). 

Differences in incremental health outcomes and incremental costs between the groups will be calculated using linear mixed models. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) will then be derived, to indicate the cost to gain one additional quality adjusted life year. Uncertainty will be evaluated using bootstrapping, plotting on a cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain that persists for longer than 6 months is an expensive and troublesome problem for individuals and society. In this randomised controlled trial, volunteers with persistent low back or leg pain (&gt; 6 months duration) will all receive 1 x 45-minute physiotherapy assessment plus 12 x 30-minute physiotherapy treatment sessions (over a 6-month period) and complete outcome questionnaires over a 12-month period. 

The trial compares two different physiotherapy treatment approaches. Participants will not know what the two treatment approaches are, and they will not know the study hypothesis. Treating physiotherapists will not know what treatment participants in the other group are receiving, Information about the two treatment approaches has therefore been withheld from the registry to maintain blinding, but full details have been uploaded to the registry and will be released at the conclusion of the trial. </summary>
