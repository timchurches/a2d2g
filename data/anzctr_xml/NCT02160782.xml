  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a long-term, open-label study with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized
      drug withdrawal period in children with ALGS designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      LUM001. The study is divided into 5 parts: a 6-week open-label, dose escalation period, a
      12-week stable dosing period, a 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled drug
      withdrawal period, a 26-week long-term stable dosing period, and an optional 52 week
      follow-up treatment period for eligible subjects who choose to stay on treatment with LUM001.
      Subjects' participation in the optional follow-up treatment period will continue until the
      first of the following occur: (i) completion of 52 weeks of additional treatment (Week 100),
      or (ii) in the event that a new study of LUM001 opens to enrollment.</summary>
