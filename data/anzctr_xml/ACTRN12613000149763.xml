  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Context:
Dexmeditomedine infusion in oncology pediatric patients is used to perform repeated lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration.

Objective:

We hypothesized that dexmetomedine could be effectively used as a sedative/analgesic agent for children requiring the above procedures,We designed our study to compare the effects of dexmedetomidine infusion versus propofol infusion on perioperative hemodynamics, sedation, pain, and recovery scores  for invasive procedures in pediatric oncology patients.
 
Design: Randomised double blind study

Patients or other participant:
Forty ASA 1 or 2 children, 612 yearsr of age, with hematological cancer , were randomized to receive either propofol infusion ( Group A)or dexmedetomidine infusion (Group B) during anesthesia for diagnostic or prognostic short duration procedures .

Intervention(s) :
Patients  were assigned to receive either  Propofol infusion started at a rate of 2mg/kg over 10 min then the infusion rate of 50 ug/kg/min were adjusted until patient fall a sleep and reach a sedation score 5-6 according to Ramsay sedation score Or to receive , Dexmedetomidine infusion started at a rate of 0.5ug/kg intravenously for 10 min, Then a continous infusion of  0.5ug/kg/hr was adjusted until patient fall asleep and the sedation score became 5-6 and be able to be positioned. In both Groups, Immediately before the procedure 0.5 mg/kg Ketamine was administered intravenously .
