    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female adult subjects with an established diagnosis of severe to profound
             sensorineural hearing loss audiometric threshold of 80 dB HL or poorer at 500 Hz that
             meets the criteria for cochlear implantation and the subject has already chosen to
             undergo cochlear implant surgery.

          2. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, ear examination, drug
             administration plan, auditory and laboratory tests, study restrictions, and all study
             procedures.
