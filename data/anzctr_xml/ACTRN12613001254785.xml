    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Foreknowledge of the upcoming allocation to order of treatments was completely prevented by use of a method equivalent to the examples provided (central allocation, sequential numbering of identical containers).

As each participant arrived for their first testing session, internet-based software was used to generate a random number from 1-10. The random production of an odd versus an even number determined their order-of-treatment allocation (rather like tossing a coin). This process occurred subsequently to assessment of their eligibility and enrolment into the study and it was repeated for each participant. It was thus impossible that anyone could have foreseen participant assignment at the time of enrolment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The order in which the participants received the procedures was determined at their enrolment for the study by random number generation of an odd or even number (simple randomisation created by computer software).</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Participants were not told that one condition was designed as a control. Participants faced away from experimenter during measurement of sway to reduce possible body language transmission of expectation.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>2-way analysis of variance or non-parametric equivalents.

Prior to the study sample size required to detect change in sway measurements of an effect size of 1.5 (centre of pressure length changes = 20 mm), and with 80% statistical power, was calculated to be 6. Additional participants were recruited to allow for withdrawals from the study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to explore the effect of cervical spine manipulation on the postural sway of individuals with neck pain. Neck pain has been shown to increase postural sway and a specific manipulation technique (high velocity, low amplitude) has been shown to elicit neurological changes which we hypothesise will reduce sway.</summary>
