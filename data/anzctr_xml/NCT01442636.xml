  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this clinical evaluation is to evaluate the immediate and long term (up to
      12 months) outcome of the XIENCE PRIME Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (Abbott
      Vascular) in a controlled prospective investigation for the treatment of patients with
      critical limb ischemia due to the presence of lesions between 3cm and 10cm in length at the
      level of the below the knee arteries. Specifically the trial aims to illicit angiographic and
      ultrasound patency, clinical improvement, and adverse events associated with the use of this
      stent. The trial design is single armed, prospective, controlled trial run over 12 months of
      follow-up.</summary>
