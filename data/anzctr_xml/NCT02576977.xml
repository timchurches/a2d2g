    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of pomalidomide and low dose
      dexamethasone with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) to that of pomalidomide and low dose dexamethasone
      without pembrolizumab in terms of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in participants with
      refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (rrMM) who have undergone at least 2
      lines of prior treatment.</summary>
