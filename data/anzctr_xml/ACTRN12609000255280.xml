    <concealment>We planned to enroll 300 patients as it is statistically foreseeable that around half diabetic subjects will be Helicobacter pylori positive. These positive patients  will be divided into two groups with a placebo/treatment (75 patients per treatment arm). Allocation will be concealed by sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Helicobacter pylori (HP) is the most common cause of bacterial chronic infection and is known to influence different metabolic pathways. It has been demonstrated that HP positive type 2 diabetic subjects present a 4-fold increased risk of developing coronary heart disease with respect to HP negative subjects. Starting from these data, we retain that the eradication of HP, at least reducing the inflammatory status, can improve the metabolic assessment in diabetic patients. The aim of this study is to verify the effects of the eradication of HP in diabetic subjects on the main cardiovascular risk factors including insulin resistance, lipid profile, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammatory status and hemocoagulative system.</summary>
