  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial comparing a CPAP recruitment maneuvre in very preterm infants &lt; 32weeks gestation who are being extubated to nasal CPAP. Eligible infants randomised to a CPAP recruitment maneuvre will be extubated to a CPAP pressure of 6cmH2O.This will be increased to a CPAP pressure of 8cm H2O and then 10 cm H2O over 5 mins. The infant will be maintained at 10 cm H2O for 15 mins before being returned to CPAP pressure of 6cmH2O. This maneuvre will only occur once post extubation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Regional lung volume and tidal ventilation will be measured using GoeMF II Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system (Cardinal Healthcare, Gottingen, Germany). Electrical Impedance Tomography is a non-invasive, radiation-free tool that allows real-time imaging of global and regional lung function and allows assessment of tidal ventilation on a breath-by-breath basis within different regions of the lung. It is based on the measurement of electrical voltages resulting from the injection of very small electrical currents continuously measured on the thoracic circumference using 16 conventional surface electrodes. The difference in the voltage between the transmitting and receiving current represents the impedance change and is proportional to change in lung volume.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (while intubated) then during extubation and then at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95 and 120mins from extubation and commencement of CPAP.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in end-expiratory lung volume, tidal volume, thoraco-abdominal synchrony and work of breathing will be measured using Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography (RIP) (Non-invasive Monitoring systems Inc, Tampa, FL, USA). This involves placing 2 sinusoidal shielded wires embedded in elastic material (Respiband Plus, Sensor Medics, CA, USA) placed around the rib cage (at nipple level) and abdomen (at umbilical level). Oesophageal pressure (Poes) will be measured as a proxy for trans-pulmonary pressure. Poes will be measured using a balloon pressure transducer either embedded into a stand-alone 5FG or 6FG neonatal oesophageal catheter or a dual-function 7FG feeding tube/oesophageal catheter (Bicore, Cardinal Healthcare, Netherlands). Choice of catheter will depend on infant size.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (while intubated) then during extubation and then at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95 and 120mins from extubation and commencement of CPAP.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Very preterm infants are particularly susceptible to ventilator induced lung injury and methods of non-invasive respiratory support, the commonest being CPAP are known to reduce the risk of lung injury. However, the optimal pressure levels remain to be determined. 

Will very preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome who are being extubated to CPAP initially need higher CPAP pressures than are usually used in order to restore and maintain lung volume?

Our hypothesis is that infants extubated to nasal CPAP will initially need higher CPAP pressures than the mean airway pressure delivered by the ventilator prior to extubation in order to restore and maintain lung volume</summary>
