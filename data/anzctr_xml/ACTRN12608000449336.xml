    <interventions>Two arm randomized placebo controlled phase II/III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combined low-dose oral celecoxib and concurrent weekly intravenous cisplatin chemoradiation in patients with locoregional nasopharyngeal carcinoma
Fifty eligible patients with pathologically proven nasopharyngeal carcinoma are enrolled.
Study arm: 
chemotherapy consisting of intravenous cisplatin 30 mg/m2 every 7 days concurrently with radiation therapy (70 Gy, 10 Gy/week) for seven weeks, followed by sequential chemotherapy with intravenous cisplatin 70 mg/m2 plus 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) 750 mg/m2 every three weeks for three cycles. There is two weeks resting period between the completion of chemoradiation and  starting the cycles of sequential intravenous chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-FU. These patients receive oral celecoxib 200 mg/day during chemoradiation and up to 3 months following completion of chemoradiotherapy.
The duration of intervention is 20 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control arm:

These patients receive oral starch capsule as placebo from the first day of chemoradiation to 3 months following completion of chemoradiotherapy.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a special entity in which the location does not lend itself to curative surgery. NPC is highly radiosensitive, and radical external beam radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for this neoplasm and its regional lymph node metastasis. Concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation with or without sequential adjuvant chemotherapy is currently the standard care for  locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients with NPC tend to have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Locoregional and systemic failures are high in these patients and contribute to the poor survival. More effective chemotherapeutic regimens and other systemic therapy are needed to decrease the rate of locoregional and distant failure and improve survival. COX-2 inhibitors are among the promising agents. Celecoxib is a potent radiosensitizer and anti-inflamatory agent which can potentially  enhance the effect of radiotherapy and reduce the radiation-induced mucositis.</summary>
