  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), once thought to be a rare condition, is now known to be
      common in people with nutritional deficiencies or alcohol dependence. The primary cause of
      WKS is thiamine deficiency, and more than 90% of cases are reported in alcohol dependent
      patients because alcohol dependence predisposes to severe nutritional deficiency. WKS may
      lead to significant, long-term brain dysfunction with severe effects on work, personal and
      social function. Whilst effective treatment may greatly reduce severe disability and the
      human and social costs of this illness, almost no evidence exists on optimal dosing regimens.
      This project proposes to develop quality evidence for effective treatment of WKS in an
      Aboriginal setting.</summary>
