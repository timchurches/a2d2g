  <interventions>
    <interventions>Enrolled subjects will receive hematoma evacuation using microsurgical techniques plus decompressive craniectomy. A part of ipsilateral temporo-fronal skull with the anterioposterior diameter of 10-15 cm will be removed in the surgery. External ventricular drainage will be applied for the subjects with the hematoma extending into lateral ventricles. An intracrnial pressure monitoring probe will be implanted in the surgery. The surgery will take approximate 120-180 minutes. Cranioplasty will be performed at 4-6 moths after the first surgery, which will take about 45-60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects will receive hematoma evacuation alone using microsurgical techniques. Bone flap will be returned in the surgery. External ventricular drainage will be applied for the subjects with the hematoma extending into lateral ventricles. An intracrnial pressure monitoring probe will be implanted in the surgery. The surgery will take  appromiate 120-180 minutes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hematoma evacuation is regarded as a life-saving procedure for a fraction of patients with a large hypertensive intracranial hematoma. Additional early decompressive craniectomy may play a positive role in the surgical management of the disease due to better control of postoperative intracranial pressure. This study compares clinical outcomes between the patients with hematoma evacuation plus decompressive craniectomy and those with hematoma evacuation alone.</summary>
