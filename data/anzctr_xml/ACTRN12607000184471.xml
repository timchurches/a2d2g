  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be randomised to either treatment or control groups. Total time on study for each subject will be 12 weeks.
Treatment group will initiate at 50% of approved dose of interferon beta-1a (Avonex) (15 micrograms once weekly) into the muscle for weeks one and two. They will then receive 75% of the approved dose (22.5 micrograms) for weeks three and four. Subjects will then switch to full dose therapy at week five (30 micrograms once weekly) and will receive this dose for a further eight weeks (weeks 5-12 inclusive).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will initiate interferon beta-1a (Avonex) into the muscle at full dose (30 micrograms once weekly) from the outset and will be monitored for twelve weeks.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Clinically definite Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) who are ambulatory, able and willing to use liquid AVONEXÂ® (hereafter to be referred to as AVONEX) formulation and who have consented to participate in this study. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects will be excluded if they have contraindications to interferon-beta therapy, or other significant medical conditions which, in the opinion of the PI would exclude the subject from participating, including clinically infectious illnesses within 30 days prior to randomisation. Subjects who have previously, or are currently, receiving interferon-beta therapy are eligible for this study provided they have not received AVONEX therapy within 3 months prior to randomisation.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is intended to investigate whether starting at a fraction of the full dose of interferon beta-1a (Avonex) treatment for relapsing and remitting Multiple Sclerosis and increasing up to the full dose over a month produces fewer flu-like symptoms than starting at the full dose of the same treatment</summary>
