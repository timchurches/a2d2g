  <interventions>
    <interventions> Arm 1: Computer Determined Insulin Dosage, insulin dose calculation by computer model, timing of blood glucose measurements determined by computer model.

The computer model is available on a computer tablet at the cot side. Medical staff will input the following data parameters: Gestational age, weight, current nutrition (IV dextrose and enteral feeds) and current blood glucose concentration. Using this data the model calculates current insulin sensitivity for the individual baby. Further calculations by the model will produce a suggested insulin dose which will most likely result in achieving a blood glucose concentration within the appropriate target range of 5-8 mmol / L. The model will also advise the staff when to measure the next blood glucose concentration.
Duration of intervention: for the time period the baby is receiving an insulin infusion.

 Arm 2: Bedside Titration, insulin dose calculation by medical staff, timing of blood glucose measurements determined by computer model.

Medical staff will use the current standard practice for prescribing insulin. Standard practice is supported with local protocols and clinical experience. The clinicians will decide a suitable dose of insulin to be prescribed. The computer model will only be used to advise when the next blood glucose concentration should be measured.
Duration of intervention: for the time period the baby is receiving an insulin infusion.


 Arm 3: Standard Care, insulin dose and timing of blood glucose measurements determined by medical staff.

Medical staff will use the current standard practice for prescribing insulin. Standard practice is supported with local protocols and clinical experience. The medical staff will also decide when the next blood glucose concentration should be measured.
Duration of intervention: for the time period the baby is receiving an insulin infusion.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome of hypoglycaemia will be analysed initially by chi square test. This will be followed by a logistic regression analysis, including potentially confounding variables such as sex, birth weight z score and gestational age. Continuous data will be compared by Students t test or the Mann-Whitney U test if the data are not normally distributed and cannot be converted to near-normality by simple transformation.  Data with repeated points, such as continuous glucose monitoring data will be compared by repeated measures ANOVA.  Significance will be set at the 5% level. The data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis.

Sample size calculation:
In our previous study, 58% of babies in the tight glycaemic group with a target BGC of 4-6 mmol/L experienced hypoglycaemia, compared with 38% of babies receiving insulin with a target BGC 8-10 mmol/L21. We estimate that 50% of babies receiving insulin with a target of 5-8 mmol/L will experience hypoglycaemia. Previous work with CDD has shown an incidence of hypoglycaemia of 22% in preterm babies on insulin. To reduce the incidence of hypoglycaemia from 50% to 22% with 80% power, alpha 0.05, two tailed testing requires 46 babies in each group x 3 groups = 138 babies.
National Womens Health has 150 potentially eligible babies a year, of whom approximately 50 will become hyperglycaemic; assuming 60% recruitment based on our previous trial = 30 babies/year. We estimate that our four collaborating centres: Middlemore Hospital, Wellington Hospital, Dunedin Hospital and Waikato Hospital, will each recruit 5-10 babies/year= 30 + 30 = 60 babies per year; this will require 2.5 years of recruitment

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neonatal hyperglycaemia is common in preterm babies and is associated with an increased incidence of mortality and major morbidity, which may lead to a poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Neonatal hyperglycaemia often is treated with an insulin infusion. However, there are limited data for this practice in the preterm population with no data on long-term outcomes. Furthermore, insulin increases the risk of hypoglycaemia, which is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm babies. Thus, on the one hand hyperglycaemia in preterm babies may be associated with adverse outcomes, but on the other hand the most common treatment for hyperglycaemia, insulin therapy, increases the risk of hypoglycaemia, which also may increase the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.
A computer model that determines insulin dosing based on insulin sensitivity and nutritional intake in hyperglycaemic preterm babies has been developed by bioengineers at the University of Canterbury.  This technique has been shown to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia compared with historic controls and is now in routine use at Christchurch Womens Hospital NICU. However, further testing is required to show the model is effective before it is incorporated into clinical practice throughout New Zealand and internationally.
We propose a randomised, controlled trial of computer determined insulin dosage in hyperglycaemic preterm babies to determine if this technique reduces the risk of hypoglycaemia, and improves neonatal growth and long-term outcome.  If this technique is proven to be successful this could provide a safer way of administering insulin in vulnerable preterm babies, potentially improving neurodevelopmental outcome.
