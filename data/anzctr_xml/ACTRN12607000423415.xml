  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial with randomisation at the level of practices. After baseline data collection from 32 practices and their staff, practices will be randomized into the intervention or the control group (16 in each group). The intervention will be undertaken by the researchers for the practices, and by clinician, for the patients (health check).


METHOD:
Six-month intervention driven by the Project officers from the Divisions will provide support to participating practices to implement the health check. The intervention will focus on : 
1) Clinician awareness and use of motivational interviewing/stages of change to provide appropriate brief interventions during the health check
2) Clinical staff awareness of 5As and opportunities for intervention.
3) Patients requiring follow up with the GP are either recalled to the practice by a systematic method, or are provided with their next appointment at the time of consultation.
4) Regular and comprehensive assessment and monitoring is carried out;
5) A systematic approach to maintaining patient registers;
6) Comprehensive recording of SNAP (S= quit Smoking, N=better Nutrition, A=moderate Alcohol, P=more Physical activity) risk factors and interventions in a searchable electronic format;
7) Maintaining an up-to-date directory of linkages with health professionals or organisations for SNAP-related referrals, and a systematic approach for updating this;
8) A systematic approach to providing patient education and resources (paper or electronic);
9) Practice support by identification the potential for expansion of the roles and responsibilities of non-GP staff to support prevention and strategies to do this;
10) Practice support in billing systems which include the health check</interventions>

    <concealment>After baseline data collection on the practices and their staff, practices will be randomized into the intervention or the control group (cluster randomiization of  practices to early or delayed intervention).

    <sequence>Permuted block design will be used to randomise participating practices into intervention and control groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the impact of recalling patients to general practice for a visit to assess their risk of chronic disease and to help them to lower their risk by changes to smoking, diet, alcohol consumption and physical activity behaviours as well as pharmacological management of their blood pressure and cholesterol. Practices in the intervention group will receive training, practice visits, resources, and referral pathways to enable them to invite eligible patients to attend the practice for an assessment and management of their risk factors. This will include provision of education materials, support for behaviour change, referral to diet education and physical activity program and follow up.</summary>
