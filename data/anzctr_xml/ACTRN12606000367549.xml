  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once entered into the study, patients will be randomised to either enteral feeding via the stomach using a nasogastric tube, or post pyloric via a smaller, Corflo tube. 

The tube will be inserted using a standard technique

Patients in the post-pyloric group will also receive a gastric tube to allow for aspiration of stomach contents

If a post-pyloric tube cannot be inserted, a gastric tube will be placed and the patient fed according to our standard protocol

Once placed, feeds will be initiated immediately. The current ICU feeding protocol will be used to escalate feeds to target 

The nutritional requirements for each patient will be calculated using a standard formula 
 
Patients will remain in the study until they are able to eat or are discharged from ICU</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early enteral feeding is recognised as an important contributor to patient outcome in critically ill patients. This goal can be hard to achieve as patient often have difficulty tolerating nasogastric feeds. This is due to the tendency for seriously ill patients to develop a gastric ileus. One option is to begin intravenous feeding. However, parentral feeding is expensive and associated with a number of complications including sepsis. 
The insertion of post-pyloric tubes has been advocated for a number of years to overcome the problems with gastric feeding. Unfortunately, these tubes are difficult to place blindly, often requiring the assistance of gastroenterologists or radiologists. This often leads to delays instituting feeds, negating the benefits of early feeding. A number of centres have described protocols for placing small bowel tubes but with limited success. 
Recently, a simple technique with a relatively high success rate was described by a group of researchers. Our ICU has adopted their protocol and over the past few months have noted a success rate of nearly 100%. The implications are that by using this method, we are able to entrally feed virtually all our patients from day one. 
The aim of our study is to compare gastric and post-pyloric feeding in ventilated, critically ill patients. Our primary end-points include: time to insertion of feeding tube, time to reaching goal feeds and total nutrition received over ICU stay as proportion of calculated ideal. As part of the analysis we intend to compare complication rates between groups.</summary>
