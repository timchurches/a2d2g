  <interventions>
    <interventions>Temperature taken with:
digital thermometer, electronic thermomater, tympanic thermometer
temperatures will be taken at the allocated care time of each neonate.
Each thermometer will be used one after the other. 1st the digital thermometer, which takes between 2-3 minutes, 2nd tymapnic thermometer, which takes 2 seconds, and 3rd the electronic thermometer which takes 10 seconds.
Duration of the study will be 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Temperature taking:
Each neonate will have his/her temperature monitored with the 'control' thermometer - digital.  This is the thermometer the neonatal unit is currently using for nurisng observations.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accuracy, the Bland and Altman will measure the two devices against the 'control' thermometer.  This is a statisticall method for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Temperature taken in a 24 hour period.  The maximum times the temperature is taken within a 24 hour period is 4 times.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Enviromental influences, this means what environment the neonate is nursed in, open cot, heated mattress, incubator and incubator with humidity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hour period.  This will be within the first 24 hours of birth.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Measuring temperature is an essential part of nursing care. It has been widely
accepted as an indication of a neonates wellbeing. It can give an early indication of
sepsis, which can be fatal in the neonate.
A comparative descriptive design will be used in preterm and term neonates from
24 to 40 weeks gestation. Three groups will be used&lt;28 weeks,&lt;36 weeks and
&gt;36 weeks. The sample will include any neonate admitted to the unit.
Non-probability convenience sampling will be used. the study will compare the BD
digital thermometer with two trial devices, the Genius 2 infrared tympanic
thermometer and the SureTemp Plus 690 electronic thermometer. Each neonate
on the trial will have thier temperature taken at the allocated 'care time', firstly
using the tympanic thermometer then taking the axilla temperature using the
electronic and digital thermometers.</summary>
