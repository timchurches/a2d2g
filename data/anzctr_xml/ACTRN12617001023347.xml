  <interventions>
    <interventions>The groups were randomly and equally identified by drawing group names from an envelope prior to anesthesia induction. Heart rate (HR), mean systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (SAP, DAP, MAP), peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2) of the patients who were taken to the operation were monitorized. A 20-gauge (G) branule was used to enable intravenous access, and 0.9% sodium chloride (5-10 mL/kg/h) was infused. To induce anesthesia, the patients were given 1 mg of lidocaine (Aritmal, 2%, Osel), 1 µg/kg of remifentanil (Ultiva, 5 mg, GlaxoSmithKline), 8 mg/kg of thiopental sodium, and 0.6 mg/kg of rocuronium bromide intravenously. After a three-min preoxygenation with 100% O2 administration through a face mask, orotracheal intubation was performed when sufficient muscle relaxation was observed. Then, patients were ventilated with a Drager anesthesia instrument (Luebeck, Germany), with tidal volume set to 10 mL/kg and frequency set to 12/min. Soda lime (Sorbo-lime, Berkim, Turkey) was used as a CO2 absorbant. For anesthesia maintenance, patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in the first group received  inhalation of 6 % desflurane in  60% O2, 40% air  (Forane, Abbott Lab., England). Patients in the second group received 2% sevoflurane in 60% O2, 40% air. Patients in both groups received remifentanil infusion (0.25 µg/kg/min) to maintain anesthesia. At the end of the surgery, all patients received 0.5 mg atropine and 1.5 mg neostigmine for decurarization. In all groups, patients received 0.5 mg atropine when heart rate was &lt;40; 10 mg of ephedrine when MAP was &lt;50, and the infusion dose was lowered. Patients received intravenous tramadol (1 mg/kg) and methochloropropamide (10 mg) 30 min before the end of surgery. 
Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters (SAP, DAP, MAP, HR, SpO2, etCO2) were recorded before induction, after induction, after entubation, and during extubation. Blood samples were collected before induction (T1), and after extubation when aldrate score was 10 (T2). Blood samples were collected into aprotinin and EDTA-containing tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and plasma samples were aliquoted in polypropylene tubes, and stored at -80 C until further analysis. Five cc of venous blood samples were used to analyze nesfatin-1 levels, by using a commercial ELISA kit according to the vendors instructions. (Ray- Biotech, Norcross, GA, USA; catalogue no. EIANES-1).

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis was performed by using IBM SPSS Statistics version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Shapiro Wilk test was used to determine whether the distributions of continuous variables were normal or not. While categorical data were shown in number of cases and percentages, descriptive statistics for continuous variables were expressed in mean +/- SD or median (min-max), where applicable. Categorical data were analyzed by the continuity corrected chi-square or Fisher's exact test, where appropriate. The mean differences between the groups were compared by Students t test, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the mean ranks. Wilcoxon sign-rank test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between pre- and post-operative nesfatin levels. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Sample Size Estimation 
The primary aim of this study was to compare by means of differences in nesfatin measurements between the groups. A total sample size of 42 (21 in each group) was required to detect at least 30.6-U difference with a power of 80% at 5% significance level. The difference of 30.6 was taken from both pilot study and clinical experience. The sample size estimation was performed by using G*Power 3.0.10 software (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Forty patients with the American Society Anesthesiology (ASA) Class I-II who were scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy between 01.03.2017 and 01.04.2017 were included in the study.
The groups were randomly and equally identified by drawing group names from an envelope prior to anesthesia induction. For anesthesia maintenance, patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Patients in the first group received 40% O2, 60% air and desflurane (MAC 6%) (Forane, Abbott Lab., England). Patients in the second group received 40% O2, 60% air and sevoflurane (MAC2%). Patients in both groups received remifentanil infusion (0.25 microgram/kg/min) to maintain anesthesia. 
At the end of the surgery, all patients received 0.5 mg atropine and 1.5 mg neostigmine for decurarization. 
Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters (SAP, DAP, MAP, HR, SpO2, etCO2) were recorded before induction, after induction, after entubation, and during extubation. Blood samples were collected before induction (T1), and after extubation when aldrate score was 10 (T2). Blood samples were collected into aprotinin and EDTA-containing tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and plasma samples were aliquoted in polypropylene tubes, and stored at -80 C until further analysis. Five cc of venous blood samples were used to analyze nesfatin-1 levels, by using a commercial ELISA kit according to the vendors instructions. (Ray- Biotech, Norcross, GA, USA; catalogue no. EIANES-1).
In the present study, we aimed to analyze the changes in nesfatin levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on postoperative surgical stress responses, and to compare the effect of two different inhaled agents on peripheral nesfatin levels.</summary>
