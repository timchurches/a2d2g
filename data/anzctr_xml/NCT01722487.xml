    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ibrutinib
Treatment: drugs - Chlorambucil

Experimental: Ibrutinib - Ibrutinib will be supplied as hard gelatin 140-mg capsules for oral (PO) administration. Ibrutinib 420 mg (3 x 140-mg capsules) is administered orally once daily. The first dose will be delivered in the clinic on Day 1, after which subsequent dosing is typically on an outpatient basis. Ibrutinib will be dispensed to patients in bottles at each visit.

Active Comparator: Chlorambucil - Chlorambucil will be supplied as 2-mg tablets for PO administration. Chlorambucil is administered orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.The starting dosage (Cycle 1) is 0.5 mg/kg. If well tolerated, the Chlorambucil dose can be increased starting at Cycle 2, with increments of 0.1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each cycle to a maximum of 0.8 mg/kg.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PFS (Progression Free Survival) - The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Ibrutinib compared with Chlorambucil based on the independent review committee (IRC) assessment of PFS
Progressive disease according to 2008 IWCLL guidelines was defined as:
Group A
Lymphadenopathy, increase =50%
Hepatomegaly, increase =50%
Splenomegaly, increase =50%
Blood lymphocytes, increase = 50% over baseline
Group B
Platelets counts, decrease of = 50% from baseline secondary to CLL
Hemoglobin, decrease of &gt; 2 g/dL from baseline secondary to CLL</outcome>
