    <scientifictitle>In people positive for Blastocystis carriage in their stools is their any difference in the specific Blastocystis subtypes found between patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and their asymptomatic human and animal household members and do their gastrointestinal symptoms change after therapy with metronidazole or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.</scientifictitle>

    <healthcondition>Response of symptomatic patients positive for Blastocystis to 14 days of therapy with metronidazole 400 mg three times daily or sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim 160mg/800mg twice daily.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms positive for Blastocystis carriage in their stool were treated with 14 days of either oral metronidazole 400 mg three times daily or oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (Bactrim)  160/800 mg twice daily.</interventions>
    <comparator>Faecal samples were collected from symptomatic patients before and within 48 hours of cessation of antibiotic therapy and again at Day 28 and 56 after therapy. The patient pre-treatment is acting as his/her own control.</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of Blastocystis in stool samples before and after antibiotic therapy as assessed by fresh faecal smears, faecal culture and PCR analysis of both faecal specimens and faecal cultures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sample time points were baseline (0-2 weeks before therapy), Day 15, 28 and 56.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess how many asymptomatic human and animal household contacts of symptomatic patients were also positive for Blastocystis in their stool and to assess if there was any difference in Blastocystis subtypes between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Faecal samples were assessed at Day 15 in these groups with fresh faecal smears, faecal cultures and PCR analysis of both faeces and faecal cultures.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Blastocystis is a common enteric parasite but it is not known if it pathogenic. Many reports suggest that Blastocystis causes Irritable Bowel-like symptoms. In this study we treated 11 patients with gastrointestinal symptoms who were positive for Blastocystis in their stool in order to determine if this therapy made any difference to their symptoms. We also compared Blastocystis subtypes between symptomatic patients and their asymptomatic household contacts (human and animal). We used PCR subtyping tools to assess faecal carriage of Blastocystis which is a more accurate tool than simple smears or culture.</summary>
