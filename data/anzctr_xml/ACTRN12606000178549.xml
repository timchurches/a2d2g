  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a tailored intervention drawing on the best evidence in four key domains: 1) preparing patients for potentially threatening procedures, 2) tailoring to the specific needs of the individual, 3) emphasising self-care, 4) psychosocial support. The intervention group will receive chemotherapy education from an experienced nurse prior to their first chemotherapy which may last up to one hour. The second intervention is a telephone call 24-48 hours post chemotherapy and then the third (and last) intervention is prior to the 2nd cycle of chemotherapy to encourage self-care measures. This last session may take up to fifteen minutes and is scheduled dependent on the chemotherapy regime the patient is receiving(it could be two, three or four weeks post the first cycle of treatment). </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For the patients in the intervention group to demonstrate a significant reduction in anxiety and depression prior to the commencement of cycle 3 of their chemotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The final questionnaire is given to the patient on the day of their third cycle of chemotherapy. The cycles of chemotherapy are dependent on the treatment regimen, they could be every two weeks, every three weeks or every four weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other outcomes include reduction in self-reported distress associated with common effects of chemotherapy, reduction in perceived needs and improvement in perceived confidence in coping with cancer treatment and side effects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaires are delivered to all patients prior to randomisation, at the commencement of chemotherapy and at the beginning of the 3rd cycle of treatment. The final questionnaire is given to the patient on the day of their third cycle of chemotherapy. The cycles of chemotherapy are dependent on the treatment regimen, they could be every two weeks, every three weeks or every four weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to test a new way of providing patients with information about chemotherapy. Previous experience has shown that many patients feel anxious before starting chemotherapy treatment, and would like the opportunity to discuss their concerns about treatment, treatment related side effects and ask questions. Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either the usual chemotherapy education program or the new chemotherapy education program we are testing. The two groups will be compared on measures of psychological distress, symptoms/side effects of chemotherapy, confidence in dealing with side effects of chemotherapy and unmet needs.</summary>
