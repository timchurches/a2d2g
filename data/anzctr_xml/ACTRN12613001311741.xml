  <interventions>
    <interventions>No specific intervention or treatment. All participant homes will have environmental sensors and medical devices installed for health, wellbeing and activity monitoring and a corresponding support tablet PC and application over a period of 6 months.  

Environmental sensors are:
*Motion sensor  detects indoor movements
*Power sensor  detects power usages of electrical appliances
*Reed switch  detects open/close of doors including front/back doors, kitchen cabinets, wardrobes
*Temperature/humidity  detects changes in temperature or humidity in bathroom or kitchen
*Circuit meter sensor detects power usages of kitchen stoves
*Accelerometer  detect movements on beds, such as tossing and turning during sleep
*Acoustic sensor  detect water flows inside kitchen taps
Medical devices are:
*Withings scale  measures human body weight
*FORA D40  measures blood pressure
*FORA D40  measures blood glucose level
*Oricom NFS100- measures body temperature

Information from sensors will be collected and made available to participants for a period of 6 months in an easy to understand format on iPads to provide an overview of their health, well-being and activity levels. Furthermore, data will be analysed to assess for correlations with episodes of illness and to determine a new way of scoring daily activity for health and wellbeing monitoring purposes. 

A corresponding Internet portal application will be provided to their family, friend or relative assigned by the participant.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Family Quality of Life  staged evaluations to determine the wider impact of sensory monitoring systems and their application, upon the wellbeing of family and carers of project participants, utilising qualitative data collected via interview/narratives with nominated family members/carers and quantitative data collected via survey/questionnaire with previous ethics approval.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>At final stages of project timeframe (6 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Understanding residents perceptions. Qualitative interviews to assess perceptions of monitoring system based on established procedures (eg. Wild et al 2008 J Appll Gerontol 27(2):181-200).
Within the first month, participants will be asked how they feel about each senor/device and if they have any concerns about it. They will then be asked to rate it on a true false scale. They will then be presented with a modified version of Microsofts Desirability Toolkit and asked to choose the adjectives that describe their experience with the technology. The interview will be repeated in 6 months with the same questions. Transcripts will undergo content analysis. Scales will undergo quantitative analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month and 6 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of the study is to develop a home monitoring solution to enable people to remain safely and independently in their own homes for longer. 
Through the use of remote monitoring via non-invasive, passive sensors and medical devices, it will be possible to monitor a persons overall activities of daily living for example whether they are sleeping well, eating enough and staying active; their social interactions, their home environment such as temperature and humidity and, as required, monitoring of their physical health, especially for those who are living with a chronic disease. This information gathered will be  analysed for presentation that would be easy to understand format to help a person manage their own health and well-being, and, if they so choose, to also provide that information to their families or carers or even health service providers, to enable appropriate support to be provided when and as needed. 
We also wish to further enhance participants wellbeing by providing easy access to high quality videoconferencing technology, to keep them connected socially but also to service providers when required. The solution will also be assessed for its capability to allow for remote consulting with care providers, providing the clinician with a comprehensive picture of the person and their overall health and wellbeing over a period of time. 
This solution is made possible by the National Broadband Network, which enables reliable transmission of large amounts of data and makes uninterrupted videoconferencing possible.
