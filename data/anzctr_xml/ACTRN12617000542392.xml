  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a dose finding study to determine the dose response to increasing amounts of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist mirabegron (outcome measurements listed subsequently).

Participants will be screened and given a medical assessment by a physician. If cleared for participation the physician will approve a prescription for participants to partake in the drug trials described below.

Participation will involve visiting the laboratory on 4 separate occasions, with each visit involving an oral dose of the drug mirabegron in a multiple ascending dose manner, each separated by between 3-14 days (based on participant availability). The 4 doses will be 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.

Measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and energy expenditure (via indirect calorimetry) will be collected before and at 30 minute intervals after drug ingestion for 3 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy expenditure via indirect calorimetry</outcome>
      <timepoint>Energy expenditure will be assessed by measurement for 10 minutes  before administering the drug dose, then for 10 minutes, every 30 minutes (eg, from 20-30 min, 50-60 min, 80-90 min, and so on) until 3 hours (from 170-180 minutes) post dosing. While multiple measurements will be obtained, the primary endpoint comparison will be between pre-drug ingestion and 3 hours post ingestion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>heart rate via an automated sphygmomanometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>Heart rate will be assessed by measurement before administering the drug dose, then every 30 minutes post dosing for 3 hours. Each individual measurement will take approximately 30 seconds. While multiple measurements will be obtained, the primary endpoint comparison will be between pre-drug ingestion and 3 hours post ingestion. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increasing energy expenditure to reverse obesity may be possible using beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist drugs, however it was not until recently that such drugs have been available under prescription. These approved drugs were developed for purposes other than treatment of obesity, so they have never been studied in this context.

In this proposal, we will conduct a pilot study to determine the effects of multiple doses (the highest prescription dose of 50 mg, plus 100, 150 and 200mg) of the beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist, mirabegron, on whole body energy expenditure and cardiovascular responses. This will be a dose finding study for which the purpose is to obtain data in order to inform a larger trial which will be conducted subsequently. We aim to determine the highest dose which will maximise energy expenditure without effects on the cardiovascular system.</summary>
