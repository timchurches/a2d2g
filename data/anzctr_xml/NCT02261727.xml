  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Theophylline
Treatment: drugs - Prednisone
Treatment: drugs - Placebo (for prednisone)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo (for Theophylline)

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Placebo theophylline, one tablet twice daily, and Placebo prednisone, one tablet once daily

Active Comparator: Low-dose theophylline arm - Theophylline 100 mg twice daily

Active Comparator: Theophylline and Prednisone arm - Theophylline 100 mg twice daily plus prednisone 5 mg once daily


Treatment: drugs: Theophylline
Theophylline is an oral methylxanthine which relaxes smooth muscle through its action as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor

Treatment: drugs: Prednisone
Prednisone is an oral glucocorticosteroid which has anti-inflammatory properties

Treatment: drugs: Placebo (for prednisone)
Arm 1 : Theophylline Placebo 1 tab twice daily and Prednisone placebo 1 tab once daily
Arm 2 : Theophylline 100mg 1 tab twice daily and Prednisone placebo 1 tab once daily

Treatment: drugs: Placebo (for Theophylline)
One tablet twice daily in arm 1 (theophylline placebo 1 BD + prednisone placebo 1 once daily)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this multi-centre, double blind, randomised, controlled trial (DBRCT) is to assess
      the effect of low dose theophylline, singly and in combination with low dose oral prednisone,
      on COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) exacerbations, quality of life and secondary
      clinical outcomes compared with usual therapy and placebo over 48 weeks of treatment.
      Approximately 2400 symptomatic patients with COPD will be recruited in China for comparison
      of low dose theophylline versus placebo and low dose theophylline + low dose prednisone The
      primary end-point for this study is the difference between the three treatment groups in

        -  COPD exacerbation rate

        -  Time to first severe exacerbation requiring hospitalisation or death</summary>
