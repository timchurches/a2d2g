  <interventions>
    <interventions>Routine testing of blood glucose for all patients admitted to hospital through Emergency Departments, who have blood taken.
Measurement of HbA1c if blood glucose &gt;=14 mmol/L.
Notification of Diabetes Services if blood glucose &gt;=14 mmol/L so that patient can receive early assessment by the diabetes team during the period of their inpatient admission.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if the intervention leads to improved detection and diagnosis of diabetes amongst hyperglycaemic people admitted through Emergency, who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes

Criteria for primary outcome:
Admission BGL elevated (greater than or equal to 14 mmol/L)
And documentation in notes of the likely diagnosis and there is plan for follow-up (eg; with GP, diabetes educator or Endocrinologist)
And one or more of the following:
i) HbA1c greater than or equal to 6.5% (where the normal range is 4-6%)
ii) Another fasting BGL greater than or equal to 7.0 during admission
iii) Another random BGL greater than or equal to 11.1 during admission
iv) Meeting WHO criteria for diagnosis of diabetes upon follow-up testing post-discharge
v) Requiring regular anti-diabetic medication at discharge</outcome>
      <timepoint>During hospital admission</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if the intervention leads to lower mean length of stay for hyperglycaemic patients who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes as recorded in the NSW Admitted Patients Data Collection</outcome>
      <timepoint>During hospital admission</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if the intervention leads to fewer care complications (eg infection occurring in hospital, acute renal failure occurring in hospital, acute coronary syndrome occurring in hospital) for hyperglycaemic patients who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes as recorded in the NSW Admitted Patients Data Collection</outcome>
      <timepoint>During hospital admission</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if the intervention leads to a lower hospital readmission rate within one year (for any condition) for hyperglycaemic patients who had not previously been diagnosed with diabetes as recorded in the NSW Admitted Patients Data Collection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within one year of discharge</timepoint>

A random list of randomisation codes were generated off site by a statistician. This was paired against the participating hospitals listed in random order which was independently computer generated, with stratification into district and tertiary hospitals. Thus hospitals were allocated to intervention or control.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This health services research study aims to evaluate, using a single blind, cluster randomised control design the novel system of routine blood glucose testing amongst all patients admitted to hospital via Emergency, followed by automatic notification of the relevant hospitals Diabetes Services for those who are hyperglycaemic, to assess related improvement in diabetes case detection and subsequent implementation of diabetes care.</summary>
