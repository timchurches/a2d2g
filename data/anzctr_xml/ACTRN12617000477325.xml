  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two parts for this study. Healthy female volunteers for both these parts will be screened within 28 days prior to commencement of dosing.

Part A (Topical Application) consists of 3 cohorts, each cohort consisting of 8 participants with 6 participants receiving (Z)-Endoxifen topical and 2 participants receiving placebo topical. Three dose levels of topically applied (Z)-Endoxifen (2mg, 6mg, and 10 mg) will be investigated in the 3 cohorts. Participants will be admitted in the clinical facility on Day-1 and will receive the IMP in pre-sealed sachets for topical application on Day 1. They will be discharged on Day 2 and supplied with study drug sachets and asked to self-administer daily one sachet to each of the breast for 28 days.
Participants will return to the clinic weekly for PK sampling and assessment, as well as on Days 4, 31, 33 and 35.

Part B (Oral Administration) consists of 3 cohorts, each cohort consisting of 8 participants with 6 participants receiving (Z)-Endoxifen capsule and 2 participants receiving placebo capsule. Three dose levels of orally administered (Z)-Endoxifen (1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg) will be investigated in 3 cohorts. Two participants (Sentinels) will be dosed 24 hours prior to the remaining participants. One sentinel will be dosed with (Z)-Endoxifen and the other with placebo. The remaining six participants will only be dosed if no safety concerns are identified in the sentinel participants. There will be no sentinels in the other two cohorts.
Participants will be admitted in the clinical facility on Day-1 and will receive the oral capsules on Day 1. PK blood draws will be performed, prior to discharge on Day 2. Additional PK sampling and safety assessments will be performed on Days 4 and 6. 
On Day 8 participants will commence daily administration of (Z)-Endoxifen capsules or placebo capsules for 14 consecutive days (Days 8-21) and will be supplied with study drug capsules and asked to self administer daily. Participants will visit the clinical facility on Days 11, 14 and 17, prior to dose administration, for PK blood draws and safety assessments. On Day 21, participants will return to the clinical facility prior to dose administration to allow for the collection of PK blood draws and safety assessments, and discharged the following day. Participants will return for PK blood draws and safety assessments on study Days 24, 26, and 28.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety and tolerability of (Z)-Endoxifen when administered as a topical application to the breast or orally as a capsule to healthy female volunteers and will include recording the incidence and severity of adverse events, vital sign parameters, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram parameters and clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis).
The most common AEs from taking (Z)-Endoxifen include hot flushes, headaches, coagulopathies, insomnia etc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The safety assessments mentioned above are composite primary outcome and will be done at each of the visits i.e. Part A - weekly for a month and on days 4, 31, 33 and 35 while for Part B - on days 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, 21, 24, 26 and 28.
The blood pressure and pulse will be assessed by pulse oximetry while respiratory rate, physical examination will be assessed clinically. Temperature will be assessed by using a tympanic thermometer while an ECG will be recorded by an instrument which involves the placement of electrodes on the chest wall.
Blood will be collected for hematology, coagulation and clinical chemistry lab assessments while urine will be collected for urinalysis. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of (Z)-Endoxifen when administered as a topical application to the breast or orally as a capsule to healthy female volunteers.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic study of (Z)-Endoxifen escalated doses in healthy female volunteers.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a healthy female aged between 18 and 65 years of age.
Study details:
This is a placebo controlled, dose escalation study. The study will be conducted in two parts in a total of 6 cohorts. In Part A, each participant will receive twenty eight doses of (Z)-Endoxifen or placebo as a topical application to the breast. In Part B, participants will receive fifteen doses of (Z)-Endoxifen or placebo capsules orally. Three different dose levels of (Z)-Endoxifen will be investigated in each part of the study. In both parts, sequential cohorts will be exposed to increasing doses of (Z)-Endoxifen.
By substituting Tamoxifen treatment with Endoxifen the study will help in providing an improved approach towards treating patients with breast cancer because it bypasses the CYP2D6 enzyme that is required for metabolic activation of Tamoxifen.
