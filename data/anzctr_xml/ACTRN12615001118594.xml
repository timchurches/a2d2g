  <interventions>
    <interventions>The potential satiety ingredient, Oxifend Red Grape Extract (RGE) is sourced from New Zealand Extracts Ltd. The aim of this study is to compare 3 formulated beverages, without RGE (control), with low dose RGE (1.25g in 250mL serve) and with high dose RGE (2.5g in 250mL serve), on subjective appetite and blood glucose responses when consumed and over 4 hours. The study design will be double-blinded, placebo controlled, crossover, randomised and completely balanced. Participants will be randomised to consume the 3 formulated beverages (each beverage once during a single morning, taken 30 minutes before standard breakfast), with a washout period of 3 days to 1 week between beverages. The standard breakfast meals will be provided to the participants, which comprises of 60g Sanitarium toasted muesli and 150 ml  skim milk. The sessions will be held at the Human Clinical Facility at Plant &amp; Food Research, Palmerston North (meeting room), where participants will be comfortably seated and could bring their work or reading material to the sessions. The study investigators will be administering the intervention, who are also trained to collect finger-prick blood samples for glucose measurements. We have detailed procedures in place to ensure adherence to the intervention. Participants are provided with the study information sheet and requirements (e.g. fasting from 10pm onwards on days before each session) and procedures explained to them during face-to-face meeting.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo - control beverage without the red grape extract. Other ingredients are water, sugar, soy protein isolate, inulin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, blueberry flavour, potassium citrate, tricalcium phosphate and food colourings.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significant differences in the subjective appetite ratings (composite primary outcome) between beverages - without, with low dose, with high dose RGE. Appetite ratings for feelings of hunger, fullness, satiety, desire to eat and prospective food consumption are measured using 100 mm visual analogue scales (VAS). For example, beverage with the high RGE dose may contribute to lower hunger, higher fullness, higher satiety, lower desire to eat and lower prospective food consumption ratings (analysed as repeated measures) than the control beverage.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (before consuming beverage), at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 minutes after consuming the beverage. Standard breakfast is consumed at 30 minutes timepoint. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences in the change in blood glucose responses between beverages - without, with low dose, with high dose RGE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (before consuming the beverage), at 30, 60, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180 minutes after consuming the beverage.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine the effects of red grape extract (RGE) in breakfast beverages on subjective appetite and blood glucose responses. We hypothesise that RGE increases satiety effect of the beverage through the strong GLUT2 transporter inhibitor thus eliciting an ileal brake effect by inhibiting the uptake of glucose, which is measured by blood glucose concentrations. </summary>
