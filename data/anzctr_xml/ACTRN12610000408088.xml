  <interventions>
    <interventions>The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program is available online at www.ecouch.anu.edu.au. This program is designed to prevent and reduce symptoms of generalised anxiety and includes information and exercises on psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation and physical activity. Classes randomised to the intervention condition will deliver the e-couch Anxiety &amp; Worry program during one class period (50-60 minutes) a week for 6 weeks. Students will be provided with a step-by-step guide for the program each week, which will provide information on the components of the program to be completed each week. Classroom teachers will go through this guide with students prior to completion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control (usual classes). The wait-list control condition will be offered the e-couch Anxiety &amp; Worry program at the conclusion of the trial (after the 3-month follow-up questionnaire).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the current project is to test the effectiveness of the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program (www.ecouch.anu.edu.au) in preventing and reducing adolescents levels of generalised anxiety. The e-couch GAD module is an Internet-based program that provides evidence-based information and strategies for anxiety. The trial will delimit the likely range of the benefit of using this intervention as a universal, active school-based prevention program. Secondary aims of the pilot trial are to evaluate the programs effect on participants depressive symptoms, mental health literacy, anxiety stigma, and help-seeking behaviour, attitudes and intentions.</summary>
