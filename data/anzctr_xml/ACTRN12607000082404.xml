  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Certain patients are at high risk of developing secondary, or metastatic, prostate cancer, after radical prostatectomy. These are patients whose prostate biopsy shows that they have a high Gleason grade, or aggressive prostate cancer, patients whose PSA level is high (&gt;10ng/mL) or whose prostate feels abnormal on digital rectal examination.
The standard treatment approach for men with this high risk of secondary prostate cancer is close observation by their treating doctor and appropriate treatment if prostate cancer returns. This study aims to compare this standard approach with giving patients the combination of a drug called zoledronic acid (also known as Zometa®) a drug called docetaxel (also known as Taxotere®) and luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogue also known as hormone  therapy.

Zoledronic acid, docetaxel and hormone  therapy are routinely used in men with prostate cancer that has spread to the bone or other parts of the body (metastatic disease). Zoledronic acid is used in this situation to prevent bone complications from the cancer including fractures. Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that is used in this situation to control symptoms and prolong survival.  Both drugs are routinely used in a variety of other cancers for the same reasons. Hormone  therapy used to reduce testosterone production. Testosterone stimulates the growth of prostate cancer.

An additional, non-compulsory part of the study will be to look at the usefulness of examining patients prostate tumors to determine reasons why some tumors respond to therapy and others do not.. You will be given a second Plain Language Statement regarding this additional study.</summary>
