  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) The fluticasone group: Receiving active nebulized fluticasone (0.5 mg/2ml; four times a day for one week) and placebo tablets (for seven days).
2) The methylprednisolone group: Receiving active methylprednisolone tablets orally (1 mg/kg/day for 4 days followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for three more days) in addition to placebo nebules (2 ml; four times a day for one week).
The overall duration of the intervention will be 1 week. 
The monitor adherence to the intervention will control by drug tablet return and regular admission to the hospital for the clinical and laboratory evaluation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of Pulmonary Index Scoring between the fluticasone and methylprednisone group</outcome>
      <timepoint>sequential evaluations of Pulmonary Index Scoring will done at the 1st, 4th, 8th, 12th and 24th hours at ER. After 24 hours, if PIS decreased more than 50% of the baseline value, the patient then will discharged and re-evaluated for PIS measurement at 2nd and 7th day. if PIS has not decreased more than 50% patients assessment will be made after 3 hours again and the patients will discharged from the study. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes of total symptom/medication scores: the scoring system was based on a 3-point grading (1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for severe). The same grading system will used for the short acting beta2-agonist requirement.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we will compared the clinical and immunological efficacy of nebulized corticosteroid (CS) to systemic route during treatment of moderate asthma attack in children.
Treatment responses will assessed by monitoring clinical and immunological parameters including; scores of pulmonary index (PIS) and total symptom/medication, peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate as well as cytokine responses and percentages of Treg cells.</summary>
