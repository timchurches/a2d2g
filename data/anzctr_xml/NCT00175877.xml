  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Adverse Event (AE) From First Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) Dose up to Approximately 7 Years - An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or trial subject that is administered a drug or biologic (medicinal product) or that is using a medical device. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage.
First dose of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) was at Baseline of the preceding double-blind study [NCT00152386] for subjects randomized to CZP, or at Entry Visit (Week 0) of this study for subjects randomized to Placebo.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE) From First Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) Dose up to Approximately 7 Years - A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is as infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardise the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above

      <outcome>Change From Baseline of the Preceding Double-Blind Study to Week 96 in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) - The mTSS quantifies the extent of bone erosions and joint space narrowing for 44 and 42 joints, respectively, as assessed by x-rays of the hands and feet. The score ranges from 0 to 448 with higher scores representing greater damage. A negative value in mTSS change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline of the Preceding Double-Blind Study to Completion/Withdrawal Visit in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Total Score - The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty experienced in eight domains (Dressing and Grooming, Arising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Gripping, Other Activities) of daily living activities using 20 questions. The HAQ-DI is calculated by summing the domain scores and dividing them by the number of domains. It ranges from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). Negative values indicate an improvement from Baseline to the Post-Baseline Visit with larger negative values showing a better improvement.</outcome>

A negative value in duration of morning stiffness change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline. The higher the negative value the better the improvement.</outcome>
