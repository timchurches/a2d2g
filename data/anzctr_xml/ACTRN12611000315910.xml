  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will undergo a single sequence 3 treatment period as outlined below. Treatment periods are without overlap and with at least 5 days seperating each treatment period.

There will be three treatment phases. 
Treatment 1 (Period 1  5 days) 
Elingrel at a dose of 150 mg twice a day for 5 days.

Treatment 2 (Period 2  10 days) 
atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg once a day for the first 5 days followed by 
Elinogrel at a dose of 150 mg twice a day and atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg once a day for the last 5 days. There will be no evening dose on the last day. 

Treatment 3 (Period  3  10 days) 
atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg once a day for the first 5 days followed by 
Elinogrel at a dose of 150 mg twice a day and atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg once a day for the last 5 days. There will be no evening dose on the last day.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control/comparator for the study. This is a single group trial. The same intervention is applied to all subjects in the study.

All subjects undergo all 3 treatment periods, one after another (consecetivley) with at least 5 days seperating treatment periods.
All subjects are adminstered atorvastatin and elinogrel at the same dose in the same sequence during the same treatment periods</comparator>

      <timepoint>PK blood samples will be drawn using a needle and a cannula from just prior to the morning dose given on day 10 of treatment period 2 to 24 hrs after the morning dose</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 45 (inclusive), and in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening and baseline. All evaluations must be within normal range for age and gender, or considered not clinically meaningful if outside the normal range.

Body mass index (BMI) must be 18  30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and subjects must weigh at least 50 kg.
Vital signs (after 3 minutes in seated position) must be within stated ranges.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>PT (INR), aPTT, platelet count, bleeding time (in excess of 10 min), stool occult blood and microscopic hemoglobinuria, at screening or baseline are outside the normal range of the laboratory. INR below the lower limit of the local laboratory normal range isacceptable (but no lower than 0.9) at the investigators discretion.
 
Facial or head trauma, intraocular hemorrhage, fractures within 30 days of Screening.

History of any prior ischemic stroke or TIA within the last 5 years or intracranial hemorrhage, neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, bleeding disorder or coagulation disorders which is considered clinically significant by the investigator.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Elinogrel is under the development for the treatment of patients with chronic coronary heart disease and acute coronary syndrome. Patients treated for these conditions are likely to be on a statin therapy such as atorvastatin in addition to other anticoagulants such as Elinogrel. Hence the need to investigate the potential drug interaction between Elinogrel and atorvastatin</summary>
