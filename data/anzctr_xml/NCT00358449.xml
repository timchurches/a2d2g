      <outcome>Number of Participants Achieving a Reduction in Peak Esophageal Eosinophil Count to &lt; 5 Cells Per High Power Field (HPF) at Week 12 - A responder was defined as a participant achieving a reduction in esophageal eosinophils to &lt;5 cells per HPF as the highest count of eosinophils per HPF in all the esophageal sites biopsied at Week 12, confirmed by biopsy at Week 12 or at an early withdrawal visit prior to Week 12. A worst case (WC) approach was considered, if a particiapant withdrew prematurely : If a particiapnt dropped out of the study without having a biopsy taken, due to lack of efficacy or an adverse event, their response was imputed as not achieved. Participants who withdrew, without a biopsy, for other reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up) were considered non-evaluable for the primary analysis. For participants who withdrew early from the study and had a biopsy, the biopsy was used to determine their response.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Pain in Stomach Severity Scores - Par.and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A severity score of 0 was assigned for days on which pain in stomach was not experienced. If pain in stomach was reported, severity of pain was assessed as: 1=hurt a little, 2=hurt somewhat, 3=hurt quite a bit, and 4=hurt a whole lot.

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Maintenance of Response - Participants who achieved a response of &lt;5 esophageal eosinophils/HPF at Week 12 by worst case analysis, were evaluated for maintenance of response of &lt;20 cells/HPF at Week 24. Response categories were defined as: non-responder (did not respond at Week 12 or Week 24); delayed responder (did not respond at Week 12 but responded at Week 24); relapsed (responded at Week 12 but not at Week 24); maintained (responded at Week 12 and Week 24). The following assumptions were made for worst case: if a Participant dropped out of the study due to lack of efficacy or an adverse event and had a missing response, their response was imputed as not achieved (i.e. failure). However for Participants withdrawn for other reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up) with a missing response (i.e. did not have the biopsy) the response was made as missing and not imputed.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply. Inclusion criteria pertain to all subjects in both cohorts (treatment and
        observational) unless otherwise stated.

          -  The subject signs and dates a written assent form (age appropriate) and the
             parent/guardian signs and dates a written informed consent form prior to the
             initiation of any study-related activities, including discontinuation of any
             prohibited medications.

          -  Male or female subjects aged 2 to 17 years (from 2nd birthday up to and not including
             18th birthday), who weigh &lt;=84.9kg (males)/ &lt;= 72.5 (females) and who have a BMI
             between 5 and 85% for age, who speak, read and write English as age appropriate and/or
             parent/guardian.

        NOTE: If subject is within weight requirements but close to the upper or lower limits at
        screening and the investigator anticipates that during the study the subject's weight will
        change a become outside the weight requirements, the subject should be excluded from the
        study.

          -  To be eligible for entry in the treatment group of the study, a female subject is
             eligible to enter the study if she is:

          -  - Not pregnant or nursing

          -  - Of non-childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as a
             pre-menarcheal female who has not yet entered puberty as evidenced by lack of breast
             development (palpable glandular breast tissue); or a female who has documentation
             (medical report verification) of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  - Of childbearing potential. These females subjects must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at the screening visit, and agree to consistent and correct use of one
             of the acceptable methods of birth control from at least the commencement of their
             last normal period prior to the first dose of study medication and to continue until
             the first normal period after treatment or after the Week 24 Follow-up visit,
             whichever is longest.

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and current evidence on biopsy
             of isolated eosinophilic esophagitis defined as:

          -  - Peak esophageal eosinophil counts (highest count of eosinophils per HPF in at least
             one of all esophageal sites biopsied) of 20 or more eosinophils in a minimum of one
             HPF at 400X magnification on histology of esophageal biopsies from distal and
             mid-esophagus within two weeks of commencing study medication, as determined by the
             central histopathologist.

        and

          -  - Inadequate response to or intolerant of therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis

          -  - -The individual investigators will apply their clinical judgment to define whether a
             clinical response to therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis is inadequate. As guidance,
             inadequate response might consist of persistence under current or recent prior
             therapy, of symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis such as eosinophilic
             esophagitis-related pain in stomach, chest or throat; regurgitation; vomiting; pain or
             difficulties associated with drinking fluids or nutritional supplements; or pain or
             difficulties associated with eating. An inadequate response might also consist of
             persistent eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, in the presence or in the
             absence of eosinophilic esophagitis-related symptoms.

          -  - Similarly, the individual investigators will apply their clinical judgment to define
             whether a patient is intolerant to therapy. For guidance, intolerance to therapy for
             eosinophilic esophagitis may consist of undesirable side-effects of long-term therapy;
             or side-effects of long-term therapy that are difficult to manage; or marked
             non-compliance to therapy or rejection of therapy by the individual patient, or by the
             parent/guardian, which in the opinion of the investigator interferes with the
             patient's optimal disease management.

        The criteria used by the investigator to define inadequate response to or intolerance of
        therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis will be collected in the CRF.</inclusivecriteria>
