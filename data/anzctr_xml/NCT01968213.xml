    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Rucaparib
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Rucaparib - Oral tablets administered twice daily with 8 oz (240 mL) of water on an empty stomach or with food; 28-day cycles of treatment. Doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible, preferably at the same times every day. Tablets should be swallowed whole.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Oral tablets administered twice daily with 8 oz (240 mL) of water on an empty stomach or with food; 28-day cycles of treatment. Doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible, preferably at the same times every day. Tablets should be swallowed whole.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Confirmed diagnosis of high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary
             peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

          -  Received =2 prior platinum-based treatment regimens including platinum based regimen
             that must have been administered immediately prior to maintenance therapy in this
             trial.

          -  Received no more than 1 non-platinum chemotherapy regimen. Prior hormonal therapy will
             not be counted as a non-platinum regimen.

          -  Must have had at least a 6-month disease-free period following prior treatment with
             the penultimate platinum-based chemotherapy and achieved a response.

          -  For the last chemotherapy course prior to study entry, patients must have received a
             platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimen and have achieved a CR or PR (as defined
             by RECIST) and/or a GCIG CA-125 response.

          -  Have sufficient archival tumor tissue for analysis.</inclusivecriteria>

          -  Required drainage of ascites during the final 2 cycles of their last platinum-based
             regimen and/or during the period between the last dose of chemotherapy of that regimen

    <summary>Patients enrolled into this study will be stratified into 3 groups based on gene mutations
      identified in their tumor tissue. The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient response
      to maintenance treatment with rucaparib versus placebo. Response to treatment will be
      analyzed based on homologous recombination (HR) status of tumor samples.</summary>
