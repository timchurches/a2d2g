  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Quadpill will be a single gelatin capsule containing 1/4 standard doses of 4 common blood pressure lowering medications (Irbesartan 37.5 mg, Amlodipine 1.25 mg, Atenolol 12.5 mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg). Participants are randomly allocated to intervention or control therapy during the first cross-over period. Participants allocated to intervention will take one Quadpill orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2 week wash-out period and then a 4 week period where they will receive an identical looking tablet that contains placebo. Participants allocated to control first will receive the above in reverse. 
There are no additional strategies to improve adherence to the intervention. Adherence will be monitored by drug tablet return and self-report.    </interventions>
    <comparator>The trial drug will be evaluated against Placebo. However due to the cross over design all participants will receive intervention (Quadpill) and Control (Placebo) at different time-points during the study. Placebo will appear identical to the intervention and be a single gelatin capsule containing sugar pills instead of active ingredients.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systolic blood pressure: Patients will be rested in the seated position for 5 minutes, an appropriate cuff size will be selected, the cuff wrapped around the upper arm and the bladder centred over the brachial artery and 3 measurements of blood pressure will be recorded using an Omron automated digital blood pressure monitor. The monitor will be validated every 6 months and serviced at least once every 12 months according to the Heart Foundation recommendations</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks of active treatment</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety profile - through monitoring of blood and urine test (Electrolytes, Renal function, liver function, blood sugar); clinical follow-up using standardised questionnaires asking about side effects/ adverse effects. The questionnaire has been designed to evaluate side effects/ adverse effects that can be associated with the trial medications. For example participants will be asked if they have suffered any side effects, dizziness, blurred vision, syncope/ collapse, chest pain/ angina, shortness of breath, cough, wheeze, pedal edema (ankle swelling), skin rash, itching and other. If other they are asked to specify in a free text field. In addition blood and urine tests will be monitored as described above and any abnormalities recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety is assess throughout both active and control treatments at 4 weeks and 10 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability - will be assessed using standardised questionnaires. The questionnaire is not a named questionnaire but the questionnaire has been designed for this trial and uses questions from other polypill trials on acceptability. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adhererence is assessed on pill counts and self-report e.g. have you missed any doses in the last 7 days. </outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified from the community through advertising and through general practices. We will use advertising in community media (e.g. local newspapers), community radio or posters/ flyers. We will also identify potential participants by approaching general practices. 
Randomisation will be 1:1 and conducted through a central, computer-based randomisation service. Treatment allocation will be blinded to both study staff and participants. Patients will be randomised to hypertension polypill i.e. 'Quadpill' or placebo in treatment period 1 and then to the opposite, ie control or Quadpill in the treatment period 2.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To establish the feasibility, patient acceptability, effect on blood pressure and thereby overall potential of a simplified treatment strategy with 'hypertension polypill', which includes four common blood pressure lowering medications each at 1/4 strength dose.
This pilot study will be double blind randomised placebo- controlled crossover trial of 50 patients with established hypertension not on any medical therapy. Subjects will be randomised into two arms - intervention (Quadpill) and control (placebo)- for a period of four weeks. They will undergo office blood pressure as well as 24 hour ambulatory BP assessment at baseline and in 4th week in addition to safety monitoring blood tests. Thereafter there will be a 2 week washout phase prior to crossing over to opposite arm of the study. The patients will undergo another baseline blood and 24 hour ambulatory BP assessment.  The study will conclude at 10 week with repeat measurements.  The outcomes assessed will be change in the mean blood pressure, safety, tolerability  and acceptability. </summary>
