    <interventions>The aim is to assess the implementation of a novel HIV prevention intervention (PrEP or pre-exposure prophylaxis) at Auckland Regional Sexual Health Service (ARSHS) clinics to individuals at high risk of HIV infection. The purpose is reduce new HIV infections in participants. 
Specific objectives are to investigate:
a) Acceptability of PrEP for those invited into the study; by measuring adherence; duration; retention; 
b) Risk behaviours on PrEP including sexual partnering; condom use; STI and HIV incidence; 
c) Factors (socio-demographic and attitudes) associated with PrEP acceptability, adherence, retention and behaviours;
d) The views and experiences of PrEP users including disclosure; stigma; sexual negotiation.

Design: Open-label single-arm treatment evaluation study
Gay and bisexual men who fit the behavioural inclusion criteria of being considered high-risk for acquiring HIV will be invited to participate. Participation will require written informed consent. All participants will be prescribed a fixed-dose co- formulation of tenofovir 300mg/emtrictabine 200mg(Trade name Truvada) for daily administration orally. Participants will be followed up 3 monthly for HIV and STI testing and assessment for possible adverse effects. Participants will also be rquired to complete an on-line behavioural survey at baseline and every 3 months to assess any possible behavioural impacts of taking PrEP. 
The sample size will be limited to 150 participants due to requirements that implementation of the study should not adversely impact on operational and budgetry requirements of the Auckland regional Sexual health Service.There will be no control group as previous studies have shown this intervention to be effective and this is intended to be a demonstration project. WHO is encouraging countries to undertake demonstration projects  to facilitate understanding of the safety, effectiveness and sustainability of daily oral PrEP and its use as an addition to existing HIV prevention efforts.

    <statisticalmethods>Recruitment will continue until 150 participants have been enrolled or 12 months from the initiation of the study-whichever occurs sooner- to allow for a minimum of 12 months of follow-up time. The proposed sample size is limited by available funding and the requirement that the sexual health service be able to absorb the anticipated demand within its current contracted volumes; however it is large enough to achieve the study aims for an open-label single-arm treatment evaluation study as no randomization and blinding procedures will be used and therefore do not need to be accounted for in analyses.
 It is important for reasons of equity and access that participants are representative of the Auckland region community of Takataapui, gay and bisexual men who have sex with men. Previous studies have found that non-European ethnicity is associated with lower rates of retention and adherence to medication and follow-up. Therefore recruitment of the 150 participants will be in quotas: 75 European, 75 non-European (30 Maori, 30 Pacific, 15 Asian). 

Power calculation 1: We will have 85% power to detect if retention of non-Europeans at 48 weeks is 60% or lower vs 80% in Europeans if non-Europeans comprise half (n=75) the entry sample.

Power calculation 2: We will have 81% power to detect a change in high risk behaviour from 10% at baseline to 21% at 48 weeks if 120 participants (80%) are retained. 

Power calculations were informed by the following data. In a US PrEP demonstration project, patient retention at 48 weeks was 79%, being lower (63%) among African American GBM.18 In a UK PrEP demonstration project, 10% of patients on PrEP at baseline reported 10+ condomless sex partners in the prior 3 months, increasing to 21% at 48 weeks.
 The participants demographic data will be reviewed when 50% of the sample has been enrolled into the study. Specific community engagement will be arranged to increase and encourage uptake by specific sectors of the community, for example of Tatataapui, Asian or Pacific participants if quotas are not fulfilled.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of prescribing a medication called Truvada daily to a sample of gay and bisexual men at high risk of acquiring HIV to prevent them acquiring HIV infection.
Objectives are to assess the acceptability of daily PrEP by measuring adherence to medication, average duration of taking PrEP and average study retention time for participants.  
We also wish to assess the behavioural impact of taking daily PrEP including sexual partnering and condom use on participants.
This will involve following participants 3 monthly for STI and HIV testing, assessment of adherence to medication, recording adverse effects and will involve participants completing a behavioural on-line survey at baseline and 3 monthly.
The sample size will be 150 participants and the study duration will be over 24 months.</summary>
