  <interventions>
    <interventions>A dental inspection will confirm each individuals suitability for the study and baseline screening tests will be performed including a medical history, dietary assessment, and measurement of weight and height. Separation elastics will be placed by a dental surgeon to allow for a reversible separation of the teeth.  This appointment should take 30-45min. When adequate separation of the teeth is achieved after 2 weeks of continuous use of the elastics, a dental impression will be taken to allow for the manufacture of the dental device. This appointment should take 30-45min. The device is cemented to four of the patients upper and lower teeth by a dental surgeon. It consists of stainless steel orthodontic-type metal bands wrapped around four posterior teeth. A closed magnet and its keeper are attached to the upper and lower bands, which then restricts mouth opening. It is estimated that device fitting will take 1-2h per patient. A safety-feature allows the disengagement of the device in case of an emergency (e.g. vomiting). 
Instead of eating solid food, the subjects will be given a liquid diet for 28 days. The 4-week low calorie diet (LCD) consists of 1200kcal/day (4 Fortisip bottles per day, plus some extra low calorie liquids such as tea, coffee and diet lemonade). During this 4-week phase participants will see a dietitian on a weekly basis to discuss acceptability of the liquid diet and fill out food diaries to monitor adherence to a low-calorie diet.  This appointment should take 30-45min.
During the study, ten participants will receive dental, dietetic and medical supervision before, during and after device placement. Subjects will be reviewed 24 hours and at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the device has been placed.  The comfort and tolerability of the device will be assessed, together with the resultant weight loss, at each time point. During the feasibility study, qualitative and quantitative data will be collected on: tolerance of the device, effect on oral health, weight loss, and acceptability to patients. These will be assessed using standard and modified Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires. Data collected will inform further development and modification of the device, if needed. The device will be removed after 4 weeks.
