  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oxygen (2 litres/min) via nasal cannulae from a concentrator during sleep (approximately 6 to 8 hours per 24 hours), every night for 4 weeks, with an overnight sleep study on day 28.

Subjects then have a two week washout period and crossover to receive the sham intervention, as below, for a further 4 weeks, and then another sleep study on day 70.  
Note: the order of these two arms will be random so as to ensure blinding for subjects and investigators.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is aimed at looking at the physiology of sleep in patients with lung fibrosis.  Investigators are particularly interested in those people whose oxygen levels fall during sleep, and the role of giving supplemental oxygen in such cases.

The hypothesis is that supplemental oxygen during sleep improves a number of health domains, including quality of life, sleep quality, blood flow in the lungs and strain on the heart.

Subjects will receive oxygen (or air) during sleep via nasal prongs for 4 weeks.  They will then undergo an overnight sleep study.  After a two-week "washout" period, they will then receive air (or oxygen) through nasal prongs for 4 weeks, followed by another sleep study.</summary>
