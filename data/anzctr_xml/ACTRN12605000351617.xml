  <interventions>
    <interventions>The proposed project addresses the major problem of chronic disability caused by occupational back pain and its escalating associated costs. This is a randomised, assessor blinded two-arm trial that tests the efficacy of the provision of evidence-based information regarding barriers to return to work and injury management recommendations to the treating doctor and insurer case managers, in reducing the number of sick days lost for workers with back pain when compared to usual care. 
QBE insurance case managers recruit subjects at their usual weekly file review.    Subjects are randomised into either experimental (KNP assessment) or control group (usual injury management care).  The Key Needs Profile (KNP) is an assessment tool that provides injury management recommendations based on a systematic analysis of physical, psychosocial and workplace barriers to return to work for workers with chronic back pain.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is time to return to full duties. Workers will be considered to have returned to full duties if they are working full time/full duties and there is no insurer make-up pay.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of days off work</outcome>
      <timepoint>All outcome data will be collected from the insurers database and workers files, based on entries and invoices from workers or service providers obtained 26 weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of days on suitable duties</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The inclusion criteria are that each worker have a new claim for a back injury of minimum 12 and maximum 26 weeks from date of first symptoms reported, be over 16 years of age with workers' compensation claim forms lodged by employer and worker, and a WorkCover medical certificate relating to the back injury certifying him/her unfit for work or fit for suitable duties.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>Not stated</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>We exclude workers who are diagnosed with specific conditions such as tumours, tuberculosis, spinal fractures, ankylosing spondylitis or infection as the cause of their back pain, or who are pregnant at the time of referral.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Opaque envelopes</concealment>
    <sequence>A stratified randomisation method will be used to ensure that workers are as similar as possible across the study groups.  Duration of back pain symptoms (less than or longer than 6 weeks) will be prestratified.  Workers will be blindly and randomly allocated to a KNP (experimental) or management as usual (control) groups based on a computer-generated list of random numbers.</sequence>
