  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an online cognitive behavioural program for bulimia nervosa - called Bulimia Online. The program includes 12 modules which participants are given 12 weeks to complete. It is estimated that participants will engage in approximately 1 hour of online reading and approximately 1-2 hours of offline activities per week. Modules cover topics including food monitoring, regular eating, meal planning, mindfulness, self-esteem, thoughts and behaviours related to shape and weight, perfectionism, assertiveness and relapse prevention.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions; (1) BO with therapist assistance (BO-TA); (2) BO automated self help (BO-ASH); or (3) a wait-list control (WLC) group. Participants in the BO-TA condition will be allocated an online therapist (who will be a fully or provisionally registered psychologist) who will email them once per week and whom they can email as often as they wish. Participants in the BO-ASH condition will be sent a weekly automated email reminding them to complete the modules and encouraging them to think about important points from each module. Participants in the WLC condition will have access to the BO-ASH condition after three months.</interventions>

    <concealment>“Potential participants can choose to visit the Anxiety Online website (www.anxietyonline.org.au) and will need to read and consent to the standard Anxiety Online Terms and Conditions of Use to undertake the online psychological assessment (e-PASS). If they receive a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and meet other inclusion criteria , they will be offered the opportunity to participate in the current study evaluating Bulimia Online. These potentially interested participants will then be presented with the Bulimia Online RCT explanatory statement and then asked to the provide their informed consent online. Participants will also need to provide the name and contact details of their general practitioner (GP). An individual’s GP would only be contacted in the event that they are believed to be at risk of harm to themselves or others. After providing consent, the participant’s e-PASS assessment will be manually reviewed to ensure that they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants who have endorsed an item on the e-PASS assessment indicating that they have recently experienced suicidal thoughts will be sent an email requesting that they complete a brief online risk assessment so that investigators can obtain more detailed information about the risk of suicide or self harm. Based on their responses to this assessment, those individuals who indicate that they are at high risk of suicide or self harm will be offered alternative treatment options via a telephone call from the student investigator. Those individuals whose risk level is deemed to be low will be randomly allocated to one of two active conditions (who will receive immediate access to Bulimia Online) or a waitlist control condition (who will have access to Bulimia Online after three months).” To ensure that allocation of participants is masked an independent researcher will consult a random numbers table to inform the researcher in charge of allocation which condition the participant is assigned to.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BO program; an internet-based CBT program for BN. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions; (1) BO with therapist assistance (BO-TA); (2) BO automated self help (BO-ASH); or (3) a wait-list control (WLC) group. Participants in the BO-TA condition will be allocated an online therapist (who will be a fully or provisionally registered psychologist) who will email them once per week and whom they can email as often as they wish. Participants in the BO-ASH condition will be sent a weekly automated email reminding them to complete the modules and encouraging them to think about important points from each module. Participants in the WLC condition will have access to the BO-ASH condition after three months.

Participants randomised to the intervention conditions (BO-TA and BO-ASH) will complete online assessments at pre, post- and 3-month follow-up. Participants randomised to the waitlist control condition will complete online assessments at pre and post waitlist, as well as post and 3- month follow-up BO.  

This study is a repeated measures design with three time points. We will employ multi-level modelling to allow for the comparison of the two BO programs and waitlist control condition in terms of changes in clinical diagnosis, BN specific symptomatology, general psychological functioning and quality of life, drop-out, and program engagement while controlling for and testing for any important participant variables such as age, gender and education. In addition, pre-, post- and follow-up variables will be subjected to correlational and multiple regression analyses to determine significant correlates of treatment adherence and attrition and potential predictors and discriminators of successful intervention outcome.</summary>
