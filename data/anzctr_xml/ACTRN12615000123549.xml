  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aims of this study are to (1) evaluate the differences in the inflammatory cytokine response to burn injury between women and men (2) determine if obesity/ adiposity contributes to the inflammatory cytokine response to burn injury. 

This trial does not involve a true intervention/ exposure.

This trial will recruit women and men with burn injuries involving at least 15% total body surface area. 

A 10ml blood sample is obtained during a routine laboratory blood draw at approximately 72 hours post-injury.

The extent of adiposity among male and female burn patients are measured using body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat calculation. The patients weight and height are recorded to calculate the BMI (weight/height2). Skin fold caliper measurements are taken at three points (chest, abdomen and thigh in men; triceps, supra-iliac region and thigh in women) to measure subcutaneous fat thickness (Jackson/Pollock 3 Caliper Method) and converted to a body fat percentage using a freely available online calculator http://www.linear-software.com/online.html.

Participants are observed from the time of their admission until discharge from hospital.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Differences in cytokine levels between men and women are compared using bivariate analysis after correcting for differences in age and burn size. Multivariate analyses are performed to assess interactions between sex, burn size, cytokine levels, adiposity, clinical markers of outcome and burns survival.

This is a small pilot cohort study expecting to recruit approximately thirty patients per year. As a small pilot single cohort study, results may or may not reach statistical significance. Outcomes will be compared with published literature.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this study are to (1) evaluate the differences in the inflammatory cytokine response to burn injury between women and men (2) determine if obesity/ adiposity contributes to the inflammatory cytokine response to burn injury. 

We hypothesise that (1) a quantifiable difference in inflammatory cytokines exist between women and men with burn injury, and this correlates with clinical markers of outcome (2) obesity/ adiposity influences the inflammatory cytokine response to burn injury, and this correlates with clinical markers of outcome and survival.
