  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thirty-two subjects diagnosed with COPD were enrolled, received each study treatment and
      completed the follow-up assessments. During each of the four study periods, subjects were
      admitted to the clinic on Day -1 and housed overnight until after the last spirometry
      measurement. Serial pulmonary function tests were performed and PK (pharmacokinetics) samples
      collected up to 25 hours. Subjects were discharged from the clinic on Day 2 after
      evaluations.</summary>
