  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administering a screening for substance use and if patient screens at high risk of substance use disorder a nurse administers a 3-10 minute counselling session.  
The questionnaire is an independently validated existing tool called Alcohol Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) in a shortened version most appropriate for the busy Emergency Department (ED) setting, called ASSIST-Lite.  Questions are about use of selected substances within the past 3 months.  ASSIST-Lite is a one page written questionnaire that the patient can fill out themselves.  It will be handed out and collected by a Registered Nurse (RN).  The counselling is motivational interviewing aimed at reducing use, it is a single stand alone session requiring no follow up for the patient. </interventions>

      <outcome>Number of patients who screen at risk of harmful substance use who receive an intervention.  Risk score is different for different substances and is a score of either 2 or 3 depending on substance, the intervention is provided for the persons highest scoring substance if any score above 2 or 3.  The intervention is a 3-15 minute motivational interviewing session aimed at reducing substance use.  Outcome will be assessed by an audit of the patient charts for qualitative data (how often is the screening and intervention happening).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The misuse of substances (alcohol and other drugs) is a major health issue in New Zealand.  In 2007/8 5.4% of all deaths in persons aged less than 80 years old were attributed to alcohol consumption. The use of other drugs is also a substantial problem with harmful effects including addiction, physical and mental health problems and financial and social harm.  The use of substances brings people repeatedly to the emergency Department (ED) however usually nothing is done to address the problem.  Screening and brief intervention (SBI) is the process of asking screening questions about substance use then if indicated providing motivational counselling aimed at reducing use.  SBI has been shown by many studies to reduce substance use and to be effective in the (adult) Emergency Department.  No research has been done on the feasibility of providing SBI in an NZ ED, and the proposed research aims to investigate this.  Eight Registered Nurses (RNs) will be trained to provide SBI, and for a period of one month all their patients between ages 18 and 80 (who fit medical inclusion criteria) will be given a written screening form and if indicated receive a brief intervention (counselling) from the RN.  After the trial period, the charts will be reviewed to see how often the components of SBI were done, and the nurses will be interviewed about their experience.  If SBI can be provided using existing staff it could be a cost effective health measure, and reduce ED utilisation.  </summary>
