    <interventions>Cerebral near-infared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring during surgery.  In the study two NIRS sensors will be placed on the participants' foreheads to measure cerebral deoxygenation.  We will place the NIRS sensors pre-operatively and record NIRS measurements pre, intra and post operatively until the participant fully awakes.  We will be enrolling children who are expected to undergo surgery of at least 30 minutes duration.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Perioperative period (pre, intra and post-operatively).
We will record the NIRS for a short period pre-operatively (5-10 minutes) while the participant is awake and resting quietly.  We will record NIRS post-operatively until the participant fully awakes (or up to a maximum of 30 minutes).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure readings will be recorded using a manual sphygomanometer pre and post-operatively.  We will use an automatic sphygomanometer to record blood pressure intraoperatively.  Where possible, we will also record intra-arterial blood pressure to allow high frequency analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Several blood pressure readings will be recorded over a 5-10 minute period pre-operatively when the child is awake and resting.  Blood pressure readings will be recorded every 2.5 minutes pre-operatively.  We will also collect blood pressure readings post-operatively until the child fully awakes (or up to a maximum of 30 minutes).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is largely driven by what is logistically feasible. Initially we wish to aim for recruiting 240 subjects. 
The first analysis is simply to identify the recruitment rate and note difficulties in placing the NIRS and obtaining artifact free data. Theatre is an electronically busy environment so it is important to establish that we can record substantial amounts of artifact free recording before planning larger studies. The next analysis is to record the frequency of deoxygenation. Depending on the frequency of deoxygenation we should be able to perform regression analyses to explore the association between risk factors and deoxygenation.
In a subset of children we shall have high fidelity invasive blood pressure data. In these children we shall collect data that may be used in future to determine greater details about the relationship between blood pressure and NIRS to help identify autoregulatory thresholds.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgery and anaesthesia in infants is associated with a small but definite increased risk of brain injury. The reasons for this are very unclear. One reason may be that the infant does not receive enough oxygen to the brain during the operation. This in turn may be because the blood pressure is not optimal  the blood pressure often falls during anaesthesia in infants. This study hopes to use a new technology known as NIRS (near infrared spectroscopy) to try and see which infants are at risk and why. NIRS consists of a device that shines a red light through the infants skull into their brain. The amount of light reflected back gives an indication of how much oxygen is in the brain tissue. 
In this study we shall attach the NIRS to infants having routine surgery to see if the brain oxygen levels fall and what tends to make the levels fall. We also hope to be able to compute how blood pressure is related to levels of brain oxygen in infants during surgery. Eventually we hope this technology will help develop techniques to ensure brain oxygen levels are kept optimal and hopefully the risk of brain injury reduced.
