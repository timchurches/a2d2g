  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A unique multinational study was conducted simultaneously in the USA, England and Australia.
      The goals of the study were to answer two questions: Does psychosocial support for the family
      enhance the effectiveness of drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease? Is the added value of
      psychosocial support the same in all 3 countries?</summary>
