  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (containing 20 mg artemether+ 120 mg lumefantrine in each tablet) will be given twice daily for three days according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14 kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. The total target dose ranges are 5-24 mg/kg bw of artemether and 29-144 mg/kg bw of lumefantrine.

All treatments will be given orally under direct supervision by the health worker. The patient will be followed up for 28 days

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
The assumed treatment failure rate to artemether/lumefantrine in the area is 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per site. 

Analysis of data
WHO excel software program will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 282, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Zhob of Balochistan province and Khyber Agency of FATA, Pakistan

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of new alternate First line treatment policy 
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine  for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.

Study Sites:  District Headquarter Hospital in district Zhob of Balochistan province and Rural Health Centre Ali Masjid in Khyber Agency FATA, Pakistan

Study Period: From September 2017 to June 2018 

Study Design: Single arm prospective study.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 months and above excluding 12-17 old female minors and unmarried females aged 18 years and above, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The female minors and unmarried females will be excluded as it is culturally inappropriate to ask this group pregnancy test.  

Sample Size: 88 patients will be enrolled in each site, totally 176 patients for both sites.

Treatment(s) and follow-up: artemether+lumefantrine  (20/120) oftwice daily dose for three days , administered under direct observation, will be evaluated. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will be determined.

Secondary endpoints: (i) the frequency of adverse events, (ii) proportion of polymorphism of molecular markers for Sulfadoxine /pyrimethamine and artemisinin resistance (K13).
