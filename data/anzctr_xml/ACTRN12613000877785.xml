    <interventions>Assessing the difference in the fill volumes inserted into a tissue expander and the final volumes on removal of the tissue expander. A descrepency has been noted that will effect the size of the second stage implant that is inserted into the sub-pectoral pocket and thus the cosmetic outcome.
Type of Tissue expanders studied: 133MV Allergan style tissue expanders
The tissue expander is assessed at the time of second stage reconstruction which is usually anywhere between 3-4 months after the initial insertion.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference in the volumes noted effect the size of the implant that is inserted into the sub-pectoral pocket. Surgeons should be aware of this descrepency and have a wide range of implant sizes available at the time of the second stage reconstructive surgery.
The fill volume is based on the total amount of normal saline inserted into the tissue expanders by the surgeon (intra-operatively at the 1st stage and at office based insertions
The final volume is measured in 2 ways; by volume displacement by placing the removed TE into a graduated beaker containing 500ml of fluid as well by weighing the TE itself.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is a pilot study of 32 tissue expanders evaluated in a 6 month period. An extension is planned.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The fill volume is based on the total amount of normal saline inserted into the tissue expanders by the surgeon (intra-operatively at the 1st stage and at office based insertions
The final volume is measured in 2 ways; by volume displacement by placing the removed TE into a graduated beaker containing 500ml of fluid as well by weighing the TE itself.
To postulate the cause of this decrepency - we assessed the biochemistry of the fluid within the tissue expanders at the 2nd stage surgery to determine if there was ingress of plasma into the normal saline that was inserted and we did find small amounts of plasma constituents; this points towards a defect in the valves. Other investigators have also assessed the valve mechanisms, osmotic gradients across the membranes and colloid osmotic swelling.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate tissue expander fill and final volumes in women undergoing breast reconstruction. Who is it for? This study included women who underwent tissue expander/implant based breast reconstruction following mastectomy. The surgeries were conducted over a 6 month period in 2012. Trial details All participants in this study underwent breast reconstruction surgery with tissue expander. The tissue expander fill volume inserted at the time of first implant was compared to the final volume on removal of the tissue expander at the time of second stage reconstructions (about 3-4 months later). A discrepancy between these values affects the size of the second stage implant and thus the cosmetic outcome.
