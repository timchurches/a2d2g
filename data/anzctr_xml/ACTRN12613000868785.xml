  <interventions>
    <interventions>An ethics approved before and after study evaluating changes to routine clinical practice for patients admitted to an acute hip fracture inpatients unit for surgical intervention of a hip fracture.  Observed and reported barriers to nutritional care were identified; improvements to routine nutritional care were then identified, developed and implemented by the treating team as part of usual service improvement practices using an action research framework.

The new multi-disciplinary, multi-modal nutritional model of care was then developed by the multidisciplinary treating team and embedded into routine clinical practice for all patients. Key improvements implemented were adopting a medicalisation of nutrition approach (medical scripting of supplements, supported medical diagnosis of malnutrition and patient education, consideration of whether enteral tube feeding was considered in the patients best interest), a coordinated multidisciplinary approach including delegation of activities to nutrition assistant staff, enhancements to the hospital foodservice system, and multimodal strategies to improve staff and patient knowledge and awareness. These changes were then evaluated using the same measures conducted during the first phase.  

The duration of assessment of the model of care changes was over two 10 week periods; however the total duration of data collection for the entire multiphase study including identification of barriers to intake was conducted from September 2011-July 2012. Pragmatic outcomes measures were only included that were collected as part of routine clinical practice audit; nil additional measures or interventions apart from those applied as changes to routine clinical practice were undertaken. Strategies used to monitor adherance were not applicable in response to the pragmatic trial design.

    <comparator>Comparator recruitment occurred between April and July 2012 for randomly selected patients admitted to the same dedicated orthogeriatric unit located within a metropolitan teaching hospital with a diagnosis of fractured neck of femur requiring surgical intervention.   Standard treatment was applied with all patients placed on a high protein, appropriately textured diet from admission and nutritionally at risk/malnourished patients received individualised nutrition care in line with routine clinical practice. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected between September 2011 and July 2012 to identify barriers to nutrition from the same source.</comparator>

    <concealment>This pre / post study examined changes to routine clinical practice.  A random selection of patients admitted to a hip fracture unit for surgical intervention had observational data recorded as part of an audit of routine clinical practice (n=60 baseline data).  Changes to routine clinical practice were then made by the treating team.  Following embedding of the new model of care, a random selection of patients (n=60) admitted to a hip fracture unit for surgical intervention had the same observational data recorded as part of an audit of routine clinical practice for comparative purposes. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined using a two sided, two sample means to identify an alternate difference in group means of 25kJ/kg between groups, assuming a standard deviation within groups of 45kJ/kg using a power of 0.8. Pearsons chi-squared or Fishers exact tests were used to investigate relationships between categorical data and independent sample t-tests or equivalent non-parametric t-tests were applied for continuous variables. Binomial logistic regression was used to assess the ability of the intervention to predict improvements in patient outcomes identified using bivariate analysis whilst allowing for confounding variables. Statistical significance was determined using a p-value of &lt; 0.05. A statistician was consulted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>More than one third of hip fracture patients are likely to be malnourished; these patients routinely fail to meet energy and protein intake requirements after surgery. Malnutrition results in poor nutritional, patient and healthcare outcomes. International trials targeting strategies to adequately address these issues are inconsistent and data relevant to the Australian context is lacking.

Baseline data on patients admitted for surgical intervention of an acute hip fracture has suggested a number of barriers to nutritional assessment, diagnosis and delivery in this population. This study will aim to define barriers to nutrition care; the treating team will then collaboratively develop and implement changes to usual clinical practice to overcome these. Before and after measurements will be used to evaluate the success of these changes to routine clinical care. A positive outcome may lead to significant improvements in nutritional, patient and healthcare outcomes.</summary>
