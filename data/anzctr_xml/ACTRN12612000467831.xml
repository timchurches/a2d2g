  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study with two arms.
Arm 1: Whey protein drink (500mL) with a protease enzyme (43mg).
Arm 2: Whey protein drink (500mL) without the protease enzyme.
This study will be carried out to assess the effects of consuming a whey protein drink with and without a protease on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), physical performance, inflammation, and amino acid availability. Participants will be assigned in random order to receive the 2 treatments. There will be a 4-week washout between treatments. The beverages will be consumed for 4 days before exercise and 4 days following exercise. On the exercise day the beverage will be consumed immediately following exercise. For the exercise component each participant will complete a 30 min downhill run on a treadmill with a -10% grade at 70% their maximal heartrate.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eccentric exercise such as down hill running can cause muscle damage and soreness, which typically peaks after 2-4 days. This is referred to as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Supplementation with proteases (a group of biologically active enzymes) may reduce this damage, possibly by reducing inflammation. This project will compare the effects of a protease supplement versus a placebo on delayed muscle soreness, physical performance and inflammation following a bout of eccentric exercise. A secondary aim of this project is to assess the uptake of amino acids from a whey protein supplement with and without (placebo) the addition of a protease.</summary>
