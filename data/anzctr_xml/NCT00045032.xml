No Intervention: Observation Arm - Participants who have completed definitive surgery and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy will be observed for efficacy and safety until 10 years from individual randomization and for survival until 10 years after enrollment of the last participant. No Herceptin will be provided.

Experimental: Herceptin 1-Year Arm - Participants who have completed definitive surgery and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy will receive Herceptin for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs first. Participants will be observed for efficacy and safety until 10 years from individual randomization and for survival until 10 years after enrollment of the last participant.

Experimental: Herceptin 2-Year Arm - Participants who have completed definitive surgery and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy will receive Herceptin for 2 years or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs first. Participants will be observed for efficacy and safety until 10 years from individual randomization and for survival until 10 years after enrollment of the last participant.


Treatment: drugs: Herceptin
Herceptin will be given as a loading dose of 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) via intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg via IV infusion 3 weeks later and thereafter every 3 weeks.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Disease-Free Survival (DFS) Events in Herceptin 1-Year Arm Compared to Observation: 1-Year Median Follow-Up - DFS events included loco-regional or distant recurrence of breast cancer, development of contralateral breast cancer or second non-breast malignancy other than basal or squamous carcinoma of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or death from any cause. The percentage of participants with at least one DFS event was reported. The analysis of the Herceptin 1-Year Arm against the Observation Arm after 1-year median follow-up, as reported below, was performed by the Sponsor in 2006 following database cleaning. The analysis of the Herceptin 2-Year Arm against the Observation Arm was performed for an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) in 2005 at a time the Sponsor was blinded. Therefore, these data are reported under a separate Outcome Measure.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Restricted Disease-Free Survival (RDFS) Events in 1-Year Versus 2-Year Herceptin: 8-Year Median Follow-Up - RDFS events included loco-regional or distant recurrence of breast cancer, development of contralateral breast cancer, or death from any cause.

      <outcome>RDFS Rate According to Kaplan-Meier Analysis in 1-Year Versus 2-Year Herceptin: 8-Year Median Follow-Up - RDFS events included loco-regional or distant recurrence of breast cancer, development of contralateral breast cancer, or death from any cause. The percentage of participants free of RDFS events (i.e., the RDFS rate) and corresponding 95% CI were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis based on available data at the time of the 8-year median follow-up analysis.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Primary Cardiac Endpoint Events Compared to Observation: 10-Year Maximum Follow-Up - Primary cardiac endpoint events included the occurrence of any of the following between randomization and new therapy for recurrent disease: symptomatic New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart failure (CHF) confirmed by a cardiologist with a drop in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at least 10 percentage points from Baseline and to a value less than (&lt;) 50%, and documentation of definite or probable cardiac death. Definite cardiac death included CHF, myocardial infarction, or primary arrhythmia. Probable cardiac death included unexpected sudden death within 24 hours of a cardiac event (syncope, cardiac arrest, chest pain, infarction, arrhythmia) without documented etiology. The percentage of participants with at least one primary cardiac endpoint event was reported. The 95% CI was calculated by the Pearson-Clopper method for a one-sample binomial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Baseline until time of event (maximum up to 10 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Secondary Cardiac Endpoint Events Compared to Observation: 10-Year Maximum Follow-Up - Secondary cardiac endpoint events included NYHA Class I or II CHF with a drop in LVEF measured by multiple-gated acquisition or electrocardiogram, unless the subsequent assessment of LVEF indicated a return to levels that did not meet the definition of a significant LVEF drop. A significant LVEF drop was defined as an absolute reduction of at least 10 percentage points from Baseline and to a value &lt;50%. The percentage of participants with at least one secondary cardiac endpoint event was reported, excluding those with both a primary and secondary cardiac endpoint event. The 95% CI was calculated by the Pearson-Clopper method for a one-sample binomial.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate Herceptin treatment for 1 year and 2 years (versus
      observation/no Herceptin) in women with HER2-overexpressing primary breast cancer who have
      completed (neo-)adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, definitive surgery, and radiotherapy, if
      applicable. Efficacy and safety will be assessed for 10 years from randomization for each
      participant. All participants will continue to be followed for survival until 10 years after
      enrollment of the last participant.</summary>
