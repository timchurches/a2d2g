    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      plus chemotherapy vs placebo plus chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy and pembrolizumab vs
      placebo as adjuvant therapy in participants who have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      After a screening phase of approximately 28 days, each participant will receive neoadjuvant
      study treatment (Pembrolizumab + Chemotherapy OR Placebo + Chemotherapy) based on the
      randomization schedule for approximately 24 weeks (8 cycles). Each participant will then
      undergo definitive surgery 3-6 weeks after conclusion of the last cycle of the neoadjuvant
      study treatment. After definitive surgery, each participant will receive adjuvant study
      treatment (Pembrolizumab OR Placebo) for approximately 27 weeks (9 cycles). Following
      adjuvant study treatment, each participant will be monitored for safety, survival and disease
      recurrence.

      The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab is superior to placebo, in combination
      with chemotherapy, as measured by the rate of Pathological Complete Response (pCR) and/or
      Event-free Survival (EFS), in participants with locally advanced TNBC.</summary>
