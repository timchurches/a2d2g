  <interventions>
    <interventions>Slow aquatic therapy (Ai Chi) is an exercise protocol based on the principles of Tai Chi, that uses rhythmic, breathing and movement patterns for the whole body. Research 'subjects' will undertake a single sessions of slow aquatic therapy (Ai Chi) of approximately 50 mins. Subjects will participate within a group (8-10) for slow aquatic exercise.  They will be measured pre / post the exercise intervention by a researcher who is "blinded" to their exercise format; Ai Chi (Slow) or Conventional (fast). there is then at least a one-week washout period, after which the subjects will be allocated to other intervention (control) exercise protocol. this will again be in a small group (8-10) and again be measured pre / post by the research assistant who is blind to their randomized Exercise protocol.</interventions>
    <comparator>the control intervention is a single session of fast aquatic therapy (conventional), for the standard time of approximately 50 mins. It involves fast aerobic and balance exercises followed by a cool down period, i.e. it is the standard exercise class. the research subject will participate in the group (8-10) for the exercises and will also be measured pre / post intervention by the research assistant who is blind to their randomized exercise protocol. </comparator>

Randomisation will be performed by sealed opaque envelopes and administered by a staff member not involved in the study.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Normality of data will be investigated and if normal then Analysis of Variance 2x2 will be applied. Kruskall-Wallis will be used if data is non parametric. Sample size calculation was performed. Twenty four participants will be recruited for this study considering a calculation of 10% difference in volume between the two exercise protocols. For that, a SD of 10%, power of 0.8, alpha of 0.5 and drop-out rate of 20% were used for calculation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Project aim: to compare the changes in upper limb volume between a low speed aquatic exercise protocol and a conventional aquatic exercise protocol in women with secondary lymphoedema. We anticipate that slow aquatic exercise (Ai Chi) will have a greater reduction in arm volume than fast aquatic exercise. </summary>
