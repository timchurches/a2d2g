  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The composite primary outcome analysis will be based on intention to treat, comparing the survival in the intervention group to the survivial in the control group using cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for age and level of frailty at baseline. Mortality will be determined through two sources- direct contact with next of kin of men unable to be contacted and through mortality register linked data. Residential care admission will be ascertained through next of kin and hospital records as required.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>In both the primary and secondary analyses, we expect that the intervention effect will differ in the men who were pre-frail and the men who were frail at baseline and we will formally test this by fitting an interaction between the intervention variable and baseline frailty. Sample size calculation - we conservatively expect to recruit and randomise 200 men in each arm of the trial. We obtained ABS life tables that estimated the annual age-specific mortality risk by individual age. From AIHW we obtained the number of incident admissions to residential aged care facilites(RACF) by individual age in 2014 and together with ABS estimated resident population counts by individual age, we estimated the age specific risk of RACF admission. From these, we estimated that 55% of participants would be event free (alive and not in RACF) after three years of follow up. Given this, we expect the event risk in Contol arm to be 45% with our expected sample size (200 in each arm) we used Freemans' sample size calculation (Freedman, 1982) for the logrank test to estimate we would have 80% power to detect and event risk of 31% ( i.e. a 30% relative reduction) in the Intervention Arm at the 5% levle of significance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Frailty is a common syndrome in older adults caused by a decline in reserve capacity of the body's systems used to maintain health. We are interested as to whether interventions for frailty work BEFORE the involvement of clinical services. We propose to undertake a trial of community dwelling older men to determine whether a simple package of interventions can combat this syndrome.</summary>
