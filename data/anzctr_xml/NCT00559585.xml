Treatment: drugs - Intravenous (IV) Abatacept

Active Comparator: Subcutaneous (SC) Abatacept - Participants received 125 mg weekly SC abatacept injections (with an intravenous [IV] abatacept loading dose on Day 1, based on weight). A double-dummy design was used to protect the blind, thus, participants also received IV injections of placebo (IV Placebo) with the exception that on Day 1 a loading dose of IV abatacept replaced the IV Placebo treatment.

Active Comparator: Intravenous (IV) Abatacept - Participants received IV abatacept infusions on Days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days, thereafter. A double-dummy design was used to protect the blind, thus, participants also received SC injections of placebo (SC Placebo).

        An Anti-TNF Failure Sub-study was initiated (recruited separately from Main study) using
        the same treatment as the Main study in order to assess the immunogenicity and safety in
        the Anti-TNF Failure population. The Sub-study terminated due to low recruitment and
        participants were permitted to roll into the LT Open Label Period.</exclusivecriteria>

      participants with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to current methotrexate
      therapy.</summary>
