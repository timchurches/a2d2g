    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrollment - Upon confirming the diagnosis of AD, brief review of the patientâ€™s notes will be undertaken to ensure that the patient is eligible based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Potential study participants will be approached in person by the study investigator and if convenient, a brief summary of the intended research will be given. If the patient is open to taking part in the study, a more detailed overview will be given. 

Allocation will occur centrally at the hospital pharmacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>Screened patients who consent to enrolment in this study will be randomised, with the aim of allowing allocation to the antibiotic and placebo groups in a 1:1 ratio. The actual process of patient randomisation will be achieved using a computer-based random number generator. Heterogeneity will be dealt with by the randomisation process, and post hoc stratification analyses will be undertaken as a secondary outcome.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The study investigators have undertaken a retrospective review to enable a well-informed power calculation for this randomised control trial. This review examined all admissions for AD at Auckland City hospital over an 18 month period. There were 204 cases of uncomplicated cases of AD during this time, with a mean length of stay of 88.9hrs (SD 70.6) per episode. 20 of these patients were subsequently found to have had poor outcomes (longer hospital stay or need for procedural intervention). We aim to identify the patients who are at high risk for poorer outcomes through our exclusion criteria, which will slightly reduce our pool of potentially eligible patients.
Using these data, a power calculation was performed in order to determine the number of participants required in order to determine non-inferiority of the intervention. The distribution of these data was symmetric under a logarithmic (base 10) transformation (with SD 0.245).
A change in length of stay of 24 hours would be clinically significant for the patient and for hospital services. Assuming a non-inferiority margin of 24 hours, an independent-samples t-test on log-transformed length of stay data and common SD of 0.245 it was determined that 89 patients would be required in each arm to achieve 80% power and one-sided alpha-error of 0.025 . 
We expect the rate of participation to be modest given that this is a trial of acutely unwell patients. After taking rate of participation and the potential for patients to drop-out into account, we aim to recruit 94 patients in each arm  188 patients in total. As the retrospective study of a single centre carried out over 18 months yielded 204 potentially eligible patients, this is a feasible number to recruit over the same study duration over 3 centres, even after accounting for patients who will be excluded for being at increased risk of poorer outcomes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim
To determine whether the administration of an intravenous and oral antibiotic regimen is more effective than a placebo for reducing length of hospital stay, pain and symptoms of uncomplicated AD.

Hypothesis
That patients given the placebo will have a similar resolution of symptoms (as measured by patient reported scores) as those treated with antibiotics without an increase in recurrence or complications.

Primary Objective
To determine whether antibiotic administration results in a difference in length of hospital stay when compared to a placebo.

Secondary Objectives
To determine whether antibiotic administration results in a difference in; patient-reported symptom scores, length of stay, occurrence of complications, readmission within 30 days, symptoms of AD, and serum markers of inflammation when compared with patients receiving placebo.
