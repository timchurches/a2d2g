  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This investigation is designed to evaluate the performance (treatment and leak), comfort
      (subjective feedback), stability (subjective feedback, leak) as well as the participant's
      overall acceptance of the Saturn mask amongst OSA participants. An important factor in this
      investigation will be the testing of our two different seal sizes on the participants (small
      and medium size). A total number of 15 participants who currently use nasal or nasal pillow
      masks will be recruited for the trial. A subset of participants have been selected based on
      their anthropometric measurements collected in previous trials using nasal and nasal pillow
      masks at this site (CIA-103). Participants from previous NZ trials may be recruited into this
      trial with their consent. All the participants will be recruited by WellSleep, Wellington.

      Participants will use the trial mask in home for a period of 7 ± 3 days. Baseline data will
      be collected from the participant during the first visit, the prior 7 days of CPAP usage data
      will be downloaded and stored for our analysis. The participant will use the trial device on
      their usual CPAP/APAP setting and device for the duration of the trial.

      This study will be conducted in accordance with ICH/GCP guidelines. No deviation from the
      protocol will be implemented without prior review and approval of the sponsor except where it
      may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research participant. In such case,
      the deviation will be reported to the sponsor as soon as possible.</summary>
