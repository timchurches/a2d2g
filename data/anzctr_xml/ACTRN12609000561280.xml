  <interventions>
    <interventions>Measurement of resting energy expenditure (REE) in healthy community-dwelling older adults. 
REE will be measured by indirect calorimetry using a metabolic measurement cart with a ventilated hood system. Measurements will take place between 06.00 and 09.00, following an overnight fast, in a thermo-neutral (23 degrees celsius) and humidity controlled, quiet, semi-darkened environment. Participants will be placed under the ventilated hood in a relaxed and supine position. Measurement of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production will occur continuously for a total of 30 minutes, after 10 minutes of acclimatisation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to prevent weight loss it is essential that energy intake and energy expenditure are in balance. Resting energy expenditure (REE) accounts for 65-75% of total energy expenditure, and is principally determined by body mass, therefore variations occur with body weight, body composition, age and gender. In order to reliably estimate energy requirements it is necessary to be able to assess REE accurately. Numerous equations have been developed for this purpose, and validated in different populations; however there is a lack of equations specifically for use in older adults. There is also little evidence available regarding the effects of ageing on REE, although it is known that there is a reduction in metabolically active tissue which is likely to result in a decrease in REE. This study aims to develop and validate prediction equations which will result in more reliable estimates of REE in older adults. This will enable Dietitians to provide appropriate nutritional support and therefore optimise nutritional status.</summary>
