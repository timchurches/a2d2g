  <interventions>
    <interventions>In addition to the same feedback and printed resources offered to women in the control group, women allocated to the intervention group will receive a specifically designed "USB pedometer". The pedometer is designed to be worn during waking hours, especially during exercise, and will allow the user to upload their data in to a tailored web based program that offers tips, ideas and motivation to the participants over the 3 month intervention. The user will be encouraged to log on weekly and will receive weekly goals, feedback on their walking progress, and messages and tips regarding diet and excercise, targeted at diabetes prevention. The program content will  be designed  in collaboration with the University of Michigan, where a similar project was performed in 2009 incorporating an exercise intervention without the dietary component. 

The participants in this arm of the study will also receive a Nutritional Coaching course run by  Dieticians. This  consists of one individual session with a dietician for baseline dietary assessment and a personalised program, followed by 4 monthly group sessions informed by evidence based behavioural modification concepts with monthly followups by phone at a mutually agreed time.  SMS text messaging will also be utilised if available as a contact point for reinforcement of health promotion messages. 

To assess longer term effects,  the intervention group participants will be offered a maintenance program for a further three months immediatley following the intervention. This will consist of monthly face-to-face consultaion and weight for 3 months.  After this additional time they will be re-evaluated, where  anthropometric observations, fasting blood tests and questionnaires relating to diet, activity and lifestylewill be repeated.</interventions>

      <outcome>Weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a spring balance scale. Height will be measured with a wall mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.5cm. Body composition will be determined using a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analyzer, with a measured resistance at a fixed frequency of 50Hz.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome will be objective measurement of physical activity, which will be assessed objectively using pedometers, worn only by the intervention group. The control group do not wear pedometers.These data will be supplemented with self-reported physical activity (for the same time period as the MTI assessment) using the Australian Women's Activity Survey (AWAS).</outcome>

      <outcome>Another secondary outcome measure of this data will be changes in insulin resistance in the Control and Intervention groups will be compared using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR).</outcome>

      <outcome>Changes in diet quality change will be measured through the admiistration of validated tools such as the Fat, fibre Index . The Fat and Fibre behaviour Index will provide information realting to diet quality .</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in  well being and lifestyle change will be measured through the admiistration of validated tools such as the Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10). K10 is a scale measuring non-specific psychological distress and consists of 10 questions seeks to measure the level of current anxiety and depressive symptoms a person may have experienced in month prior to the interview .</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of Gestational Diabetes (GDM) in Australia is approximately 5%-8%, with up to one third of all parous women who develop type 2 diabetes having a previous history of GDM . Research to determine strategies to delay or prevent the development of or progression to diabetes is vital, particularly in population groups that are at higher risk, such as GDM, and obese women (BMI.&gt;25). A pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted at Mater Mothers Hospital  suggested that a post partum intervention designed to increase physical activity in women with previous GDM may be feasible. A recent study in the United States recruited women with recent GDM into an RCT where the control group received usual care and the intervention group received a web based pedometer program. Dietary intervention has been proven to increase probability of weight loss, so a strategy of combining both a pedometer and nutrition based program may prove to be more successful in long term improvement in a healthy lifestyle to prevent type 2 diabetes.  

The aim of this study is to develop long term statergies for women who develop GDM during their pregnancy and are overweight  (BMI &gt; 25) to improve their lifestyle to possibly prevent Type 2 diabetes.   This randomised controlled trial  is a pedometer - based inervention to encourage physical activity , combined with nutrition coaching, and  will possibly result in an increased weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and increased physical activity when compared with standard care.  This project aims to take another step towards the larger scale issue of providing adequate, evidence based follow up care for women who develop GDM in their pregnancies.</summary>
