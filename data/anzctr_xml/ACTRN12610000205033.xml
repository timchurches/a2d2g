  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 orthodontic miniscrews are to be placed in the palate of the upper jaw which is joined to an expansion appliance cemented  to the patient's upper posterior teeth.
4 orthodontic miniscrews - 2 on each side joined by a plate - will be placed in the lower jaw. The patient will be required to wear class II elastics from the upper appliance to the lower joined miniscrews. This procedure is expected to take approximately 1 hour.
The miniscrews and expansion appliance will be placed at the start of treatment and is expected to stay in the mouth for approximately 9 months. Miniscrews will only be replaced if they fail. Current research literature states a 80-85% success rate for orthodontic miniscrews.
At the end of 9 months of treatment, all miniscrews and the expansion appliance will be removed from the patient</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the results of a new functional appliance which aims to correct skeletal 2 malocclusions. Currently, controversy exists on the efficacy of functional appliances at stimulating mandibular growth. This is because the tooth movements rather than changes in facial growth have found to be mostly responsible for the improvement seen in the dental arch relationships. This appliance will be attached to orthodontic miniscrew temporary anchorage devices aimed at  achieving maximal skeletal correction of their malocclusion and minimising dentoalveolar effects.</summary>
