    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants' singing is assessed using two simple singing tasks (sing a note for as long as possible, and singing "happy birthday song"). Participants' singing is recorded using a Zoom Handy Recorder (H4), Sound Pressure Level Meter (Rion NL-06) and a calibrator (B&amp;K 4231).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Singing has been shown to be beneficial for chronic respiratory conditions. Singing is not merely a vocal expression; it involves a physical transformation. Singing requires well-controlled breathing and good posture. The lungs and abdominal muscles are fully engaged to produce sounds. Classically trained singers demonstrate more efficient respiratory capacity.

Previous research also indicates that singing can improve quality of life, reduce anxiety, and enhance self-esteem. Lets Sing Out! is an innovative research project to enhance the physical and mental health of young people with CF. Eight half-hour individual singing sessions include learning diaphragmatic breathing, and singing favorite songs in a supportive environment.</summary>
