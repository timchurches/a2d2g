  <interventions>
    <interventions>A cross-sectional double blind study will be done on patients with suspected OSA receiving diagnosis with cardio-respiratory poligraphy.
Study will be conducted in an outpatient service of the public health system;
informed consent will be signed before recruitment; hypoglossal and
glossopharingeal neurodynamic non invasive tests will be performed by a physiotherapist, blinded from
pneumologist diagnosis consecutively to the visit. The neurodynamic tests approximate duration will be of 1 minute each. Neurodynamic tests will be conducted on a single occasion only. Neurodynamic tests will be conducted within 10 minutes of pneumologist diagnosis. 
  </interventions>
    <comparator>Results of neurodynamic tests will be compared to the pneumologist diagnosis. 

Pneumologist diagnosis will be performed after assessment of the polysomnography results. 
Polysomnography needs a recording of the sleeping during an entire night through some wearable devices. Data recorded need to be downloaded from the devices and analized through a PC software (10 minutes). Pneumologist interpretation of the software results and the diagnosis formulation needs approximately 20 minutes.

The neurodynamic tests approximate duration will be of 1 minute each and will be conducted on a single occasion only.

Correlation between pneumologist diagnosis and physical therapist assessment will be assessed using Pearsons Rho Test and statistical significance is set to P = 0.05.
Accuracy will be assessed calculating Sensibility, specificity, Likelyhood positive and negative values</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aim is to investigate validity of craniofacial Neurodynamic tests on diagnosis of
respiratory disturbance in OSA patients.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by the collapse of the upper
airway during sleep. The most effective treatment for OSA is continuous
positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP), but it is poorly tolerated by some.
Many studies revealed a connection between respiratory episodes and muscular dysfunction of the jaw and the neck muscles. However, no studies have evaluated the responsiveness to a noninvasive neurodynamic test in OSA patients, performed by passive gentle motion of craniocervical district with patient lying supine on the couch.
