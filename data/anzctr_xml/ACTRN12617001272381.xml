  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants sign a consent form to confirm in writing they agree to take part in the trial and  provide contact details to the study team. Once received, trial staff will phone participants to obtain demographic information about gender, age, schooling, place of birth, family situation (who they live with), whether they have any important medical conditions and any cancer history of their immediate family. Participants will be emailed a link to an online survey comprised of 2 questionnaires online which they are required to complete within 28 days . We anticipate time to participate and complete all aspects of the trial will take individuals a total of 30-40 minutes. </interventions>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>The OCNI (Offspring Cancer Needs Instrument) 47-item questionnaire and Kessler 10 questionnaire will be utilised to measure offspring needs. Demographic information of the offspring and details of the mothers disease and treatment will be obtained. The incidence of types and severity of psychosocial needs will be reported as the primary endpoint. Factors including offspring demographics, the patients disease stage and treatment received at the time of study will be analysed for which variables are predictive of a higher likelihood of needs experienced in the offspring.
 Consenting offspring will be asked to complete the OCNI and Kessler 10
 Demographic details of offspring will be collected
 Information on patient demographics, disease details, treatment received and breast cancer status will be collated.

Consecutive study participants over a 6-month will be included in the study sample. It is anticipated that up to 100 participants will be recruited. Participants must complete both the OCNI and the Kessler 10 questionnaires to be included in the sample size</statisticalmethods>

Study details
Study staff will phone participants to obtain demographic information about gender, age, schooling, place of birth, family situation (who they live with), whether they have any important medical conditions and any cancer history of their immediate family.

We anticipate time to participate and complete all aspects of the trial will take individuals a total of 30-40 minutes.

Information collected will be analysed with the aim of identifying what the needs and the best types of support that can be provided to help other young people who also have mothers with cancer.</summary>
