  <interventions>
    <interventions>Over 12 weeks participants receive 200ml/day of orally administered cherry juice containing 186mg/L anthocyanins (ORAC 59 TE/g). The sweet, 100% Bing cherry juice is produced using a novel method that aims to retain the phenolic bioactives, developed by a research company (Agritechnology) based in Orange, NSW, Australia. Adherence to the intervention was assessed using a self reported diary check box and monitoring of returned juice bottles.</interventions>
    <comparator>Over 12 weeks participants receive 200ml/day of commercially produced apple juice containing 0.02mg/L Anthocyanins (ORAC 15.5 TE/g). The apple juice is produced by Appledale, Orange, NSW, Australia.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess whether further cognitive decline can be delayed or prevented in people with mild to moderate dementia through the consumption of flavonoids in cherry juice over 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included anti-inflammatory effects, changes in functional and physical ability and depressive symptomatology. </summary>
