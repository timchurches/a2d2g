  <interventions>
    <interventions>Specifically, within a six hour day (9am-3pm) the intervention will involve services implementing continuous free indoor/outdoor play for children. The only time when an opportunity for outdoor free play will be unavailable for children is when structured activity is occurring. At all other times, children will be free to move between indoors and outdoors as they wish. All other service activities will remain unchanged. The duration of the intervention period will be approximately 3 months.
Services will be supported by a childhood physical activity consultant with experience working with childcare services to implement the intervention. Support will be provided via service visits and telephone calls. Adherence will be monitored by the external consultant who will ensure the intervention is delivered as per protocol (unless inclement weather, special events or offsite activities)

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Childcare services (long day care services and preschools)
For a service to be eligible it will be within the Hunter New England geographic region of NSW Australia and have a minimum total number of children enrolled aged 3-6 years of at least 25.

Children
For children within the service to be eligible to participate they will be aged 3-6 years, have parental consent and attend care during any of the days of designated data collection.

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Childcare services (long day care services and preschools)
Services serving special needs populations will be excluded from participating in the trial given the specialist care required for such children and the likelihood of a differential effect in this population group. Services already implementing continuous indoor/outdoor play within the core hours of 9am to 3pm will be deemed ineligible.

Children
Children at the service with special needs will be excluded from participating in the trial.

    <concealment>Childcare services
A current list of all childcare services in the Hunter New England region which have licensed places for 3 to 6 year olds will be obtained from the NSW Department of Health. The Nominated Supervisor of eligible services will be sent a letter informing them about the study and requesting permission to recruit parents through their service. Within two weeks from the initial information letters being sent, a study research assistant will telephone a Nominated Supervisor to answer any questions they may have and to confirm their eligibility, consent or otherwise.

Children
A member of the research team who will not be involved in intervention delivery will arrange for recruitment packs (one per parent of each enrolled child 3 to 6 years) to be delivered to each participating service. Distribution of these packs to parents will occur via methods considered most effective and appropriate by the Nominated Supervisor in engaging parents (e.g. placed in childrenâ€™s pigeon holes or lockers, or handed directly to parents at drop-off or pick-up). The recruitment pack will contain an information sheet, consent form and return envelope. The information sheet will explain the study to parents and their opportunity to participate. Parents will be asked to return the consent form in the envelope provided to a drop-box at the service (supplied by the research team). Parents will have two to three weeks to return their consent form. Parents will be provided the direct phone number of a member of the research team to ask questions regarding research participation. One to two weeks after delivery of the recruitment packs, staff will be present at the childcare service, reminding parents of the study and the opportunity to participate. Staff involved in recruitment of long day care services and children will be blind to the group allocation. Allocation to groups will be conducted by an independent statistician, at a centralised location using a computerised random number function. Random allocation of services to groups will occur following baseline data collection of children from childcare services. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>A statistician with no involvement in the study procedures will allocate services to either the intervention or control condition in a 1:1 ratio using a computerised random number generator. Randomisation of services will be stratified by the socioeconomic status of the area where the service is located based on evidence of an association between services locality and services physical activity policies and practices. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Changing the scheduling of existing programs in childcare centres may represent an effective strategy which is suitable to scale-up for population-wide implementation. Unstructured outdoor free play (as opposed to structured, staff-guided play) has been consistently associated with greater child physical activity.
The study hypothesises that when compared to children attending control services, where continuous indoor/outdoor play is scheduled, children attending intervention services will spend an additional 10 minutes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day at childcare. An increase of 10 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in preschool-aged children has been found to have clinically important effects on fat mass and peak bone mass.
