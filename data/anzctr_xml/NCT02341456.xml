    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - AZD1775
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel
Treatment: drugs - carboplatin

Experimental: AZD1775 - AZD1775 will be administered orally as a single dose on Day 1 Cycle 0. Following a 5±2 days washout period, AZD1775 (5 doses BID over 2.5 days) will be taken in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in each 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Following 6 cycles of combination treatment, patients may continue on AZD1775 monotherapy (5 doses BID Day 1 to Day 2.5 in each 21-day cycle) at the investigator's discretion.

Experimental: Paclitaxel - Commercially available paclitaxel will be administered at a dosage of 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour IV infusion on Cycle Day 1 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles.

Experimental: Carboplatin - Following the paclitaxel infusion, carboplatin will be administered at a dose of AUC 5 as an IV infusion on Cycle Day 1 of a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. According to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Information Letter Regarding the AUC Based Dosing of Carboplatin, the maximum carboplatin dose should not exceed the target AUC (mg*min/mL)*150 mL/min, but it may be less (Ivy et al 2010). For this study, the maximum dose of carboplatin cannot exceed a total dose of 750 mg.


Treatment: drugs: AZD1775
AZD1775 is a highly selective, adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) competitive, small-molecule inhibitor of the WEE1 kinase that sensitizes tumour cells to cytotoxic agents and is being developed for the treatment of advanced solid tumours and p53 pathway deficient malignancies. Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog used as chemotherapy.

Treatment: drugs: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel is a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy ; it and docetaxel represent the taxane family of drugs.

Treatment: drugs: carboplatin
Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug used against some forms of cancer (mainly ovarian carcinoma, lung, head and neck cancers as well as endometrial, esophageal, bladder, breast and cervical; central nervous system or germ cell tumors; osteogenic sarcoma, and as preparation for a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of AZD1775 in terms of AEs, labs, vitals, ECGs and conc. med use. - To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD1775 when a single monotherapy dose is given orally to patients with advanced solid followed by multiple oral dosing of AZD1775 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.</outcome>
      <timepoint>through end of Cycle 6 + 28 day follow-up period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recommended dose of AZD1775 - There will be a minimum of 2 days between conduct of the last patient assessment required for the SRC review from one cohort and the start of dosing in the subsequent cohort. There will be no intra-patient dose escalations. Once the recommended combination dose is defined, additional 3 to 6 patients may be recruited to the same cohort where the dose is defined for further evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and PK and/or pharmacodynamics of AZD1775</outcome>
      <timepoint>through end of Cycle 1</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PK profile of AZD1775 after single dosing and at steady state after multiple dosing in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel - To characterize the PK profile of AZD1775 after single dosing and at steady state after multiple dosing when given orally to patients with advanced solid tumours in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Timing of PK samples may be adjusted during study, dependent on emerging data, in order to ensure appropriate characterisation of the plasma concentration time profiles. Total volume of blood taken from each patient during Cycle 0, day 1 and Cycle 1, days 1 and 3 will not exceed approximately 250 mL. PK parameters determined for AZD1775 for Day 1 Cmax C8hr (AZD1775 only) Time to Cmax (tmax) Time of last detectable concentration (tlast) Terminal half-life (t½?z) Area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 hours (AUC(0 8)) (AZD1775 only), from 0 to time of last measurable concentration (AUC(0-t)), from zero to infinity (AUC(0-8)), and from zero to 12 h (AUC(0-12)), Day 3 Accumulation on day 3 compared to day 1 for Cmax and AUC(0-8)</outcome>

      <outcome>PK profile of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin and AZD1775 - To characterize the PK profile of paclitaxel in combination with AZD1775 and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumours.

These venous blood samples will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 before paclitaxel infusion and at 1.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours post start of infusion. For paclitaxel and total platinum the following parameters will be calculated on day 1:
