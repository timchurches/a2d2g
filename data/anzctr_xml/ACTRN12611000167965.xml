  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 groups:

Group 2: Independent home exercise program (reliant on pt compliance)
This group is designed to investigate whether physiotherapy led rehabiltation is required post THR.
Standard post THR ex program provided to all patients, instructed to continue these 3x daily independently as per in hospital ad to continue on discharge from hospital; exs focus on lower limb ROM &amp; strengthing.
Patients choose to follow instructions on ex sheet which are as follows (time frame for completion of each session is patient dependent; 6 exs min x10 reps till 3 months then 8 exs recommended):
- You must exercise at least 3 times daily. Repeat each exercise slowly at least 5-10 times.
-Exercises 3 to 8 should be continued following discharge from hospital. Exercise 9-10 can be commenced at 3 months.
The exercises are indicated on the sheet to continue till 3months and then an additional two exercises are shown that are able to be commenced after 3 months but their is no emphasis for how long the program needs to continue post 3 months. 
The re assessment intervals do continue till 6 months ( 5, 12 &amp; 26 wks as documented)</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 1: Supervised exercise class (Standard care)
Provided in group setting led by physiotherapist
Circuit program 60min involving lower limb strengthening, ROM &amp; gait retraining stations

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be identified at their pre admission clinic appointment if they want to participate by the interviewing nurse.
The senior orthopaedic physiotherapist will then be available to explain the study, recruit the patient and complete consent. Following consent participants will be asked to complete several forms and receive the patient information sheet.
Following their surgery, in hospital physiotherapy and care will proceed according to the standard protocols.
When the participant is ready for discharge they will be assigned to intervention group 1 or 2 by opening of a randomisation envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be by permuted blocks to assist with maintaining equivalent  sample size in both groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rehabilitation after total hip replacement is important for recovery; at the Canberra hospital physiotherapy provides this rehabilitation.  As physiotherapists we dont know yet how long, what kind or when rehabilitation is most effective. Our own survey showed that only 50% of Australian hospitals offer rehabilitation for hip replacements at all. 
The project aims to see how effective rehabilitation is by measuring patient outcomes after their total hip replacement surgery. 
This is a randomised controlled trial with division into two groups after total hip replacement. Group one will receive rehabilitation in the form of the current supervised exercise class and group two will receive a home exercise program to be performed independently. 
We hypothesise that rehabilitation provided via a home based exercise program without formal supervision after hospital discharge, relying on patient compliance, will produce similar outcomes to those produced by the current method of rehabilitation for total hip replacement patients after hospital discharge, which is that of a centre based program with formal supervision.</summary>
