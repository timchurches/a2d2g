Patients with Grade 3-4 Octreotide-avid disease concordant with FDG avid sites, may be suitable for consideration of Lutetium-177 Octreotate PRRT with and without infusional 5FU (as a radiation sensitiser) in consultation with the Nuclear Medicine Department. 
Among patients who proceed to PRCRT, toxicity will be assessed as per the NCI CTCAE (version 4.0),2 based on bloods being taken for haematology and biochemistry at prior to  Lutetium-177 Octreotate PRRT, weekly during the 5FU infusion (where used) and 2 and 4 weeks post therapy as well as clinical review at these time points.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to estimate the treatment effect of Everolimus in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNET). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years and have newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) of intermediate grade. Trial details All participants will receive treatment with Everolimus. This is a drug that can block activity of a protein called mTOR, and can slow the growth of different tumours including pancreatic NETs in the laboratory. Large studies in patients with pancreatic NET have shown that Everolimus treatment decreased the rate of tumour growth and increased patient survival. Two tablets of 5 mg Everolimus will be given daily for 6 months. Participants will be assessed regularly throughout the treatment period, and every 3 months after treatment has stopped in order to determine treatment effect. CT and PET scans will be used to measure tumour response and questionnaires will also be supplied to patients to assess symptomatic response to treatment.</summary>
