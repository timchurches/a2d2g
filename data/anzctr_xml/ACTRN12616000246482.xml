    <studytitle>Delivering a very early nutrition intervention for patients with upper gastrointestinal and lung cancers at home using technology: a pilot randomised trial.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For patients newly diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal or lung cancer, will an early intensive nutrition intervention delivered via an e-platform, as compared to early intensive nutrition intervention delivered via the telephone versus standard nutrition treatment, improve health-related quality of life and nutritional status.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an early and intensive nutrition counselling delivered via an e-platform on an iPad using an app called myPace. This App is installed on the iPad and provides a medium for nutrition information materials, nutritional advice via email and text reminders to be accessible by participants at home via text messages. The iPad also contains a repository of resources such as diet tips and how to manage symptoms such as nausea via dietary changes. Relevant resources can be emailed to the patient by the dieititian. who tailors advice  to each participant with an emphasis on addressing current and anticipated nutrition-related symptoms. Participants will also be able to ask questions to the dietitian via this medium. The patient self monitor their weight and symptoms and  send then via the App directly to their dietitian. The dietititan can respond each week via email or text and each counselling session takes 15-30 minutes depending on the complexity of the advice provided. 
The telephone intervention is similar in content to the e-intervention but delivered by regular weekly phone calls and written resources posted via the mail to the patient. 

The duration of these interventions are approximately 18 weeks from shortly after diagnosis and throughout the cancer treatment journey which is individualised. The participants will be able to access the mobile device for 26 weeks  although dietetic contact via the e-platform will cease at about 18 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be a comparator treatment and also a control group assigned for this study.

The comparator treatment is early and intensive nutrition counselling delivered via the telephone. Participants assigned to this group will receive nutrition assessment and advice from the dietitian via weekly telephone calls which last between 10 and 30 minutes each. Participants would also receive face-to-face contact with the dietitian when they were admitted for treatment. The nutrition approach will be tailored by the dietitian to each participant with an emphasis on addressing current and anticipated nutrition-related symptoms. Participants will receive nutrition information materials and provided forms to order supplements when deemed necessary by the dietitian.

The duration of this intervention is approximately 18 weeks from shortly after diagnosis and throughout the chemotherapy/surgery treatment trajectory with a follow up at 26 weeks.  



Control group

The control group will receive standard nutrition treatment. Participants will only receive nutrition intervention from the dietitian if they are screened by a health professional and deemed to be at risk of malnutrition upon commencement of treatment. Participants will be seen by the dietitian and assessed whether they will require nutrition information materials and nutritional supplements. The duration of standard nutrition treatment will vary depending on the dietitian's assessment of the participant's progress. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the impact of early nutrition counselling delivered electronically on health-related quality of life and nutritional status in patients diagnosed with stomach or oesophageal or lung cancer compared with both early nutrition counselling delivered via the telephone and standard nutrition care. 

 You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer or lung cancer and are being treated at Monash Health and your consultant is agreeable.

Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of three groups. Participants in one group will receive early nutrition counselling delivered electronically via a mobile device (ipad). Participants in another group will receive early nutrition counselling delivered via telephone. Participants in the third group will receive standard nutrition care as deemed necessary by their health professional. Participants with early nutrition intervention will receive contact from the dietitian for the first 18 weeks of the study. Health-related quality of life and nutritional status will be assessed by questionnaires throughout the study up to 26 weeks. </summary>
