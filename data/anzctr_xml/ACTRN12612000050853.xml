    <interventions>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) brain imaging will be used in this study. This involves an hour long brain imaging scan that will be used to examine brain neurochemistry within insomnia sufferers. The overall experiment will take three hours to complete.

Participants will be grouped according to responses provided on the hyperarousal questionnaire - with those high on this scale being included in the insomnia with hyperarousal group. A control group will also be determined by this scale. Those who have insomnia but a low score on the hyperarousal scale will be included as controls.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective is to investigate whether there are differences between insomnia sufferers who have a specific type of insomnia (hyperarousal insomnia) and those who suffer from general insomnia but do not have elements of hyperarousal. As a result, this study will use a brain imaging technique called Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in order to attempt to find differences in brain neurochemistry between these two different types of insomnia sufferers.</summary>
