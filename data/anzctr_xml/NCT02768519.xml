          7. Use of prescription medications (with the exception of contraceptives),
             over-the-counter medications (with the exception of paracetamol [&lt; 2 gm/day] or

             extracts within 14 days prior to the first dose.

          8. Positive results on illicit drug test or alcohol breath test at screening or at
             admission.

             the drug's half-life, whichever is longer, or current participation in any
             investigational protocol.

         11. Participants who, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or delegate, should not

             confirm eligibility.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the indicative bioavailability of a single oral
      dose of OTS167, and to evaluate the effects of food on OTS167 pharmacokinetics (PK) after
      oral dosing.

      Eleven male and female healthy participants aged 45 years and over will be entered into this
      phase 1, single-centre, double-blind, randomised, cross-over study. The trial is designed to
      evaluate the bioavailability of OTS167, and the effects of food on pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      OTS167 when administered by the oral route. Correlative studies include evaluation of safety
      endpoints and examinations, and adverse events. This study involves 3 cohorts to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of oral dosing from lower dose.</summary>
