          -  Has a medical condition or extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might compromise the subject's ability to comply with protocol
             requirements, the subject's wellbeing or safety, or the interpretability of the
             subject's clinical data.

          -  Is currently participating in another natural history study</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a natural history study for children up to 18 years of age who have been diagnosed
      with Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB (MPS IIIB, also known as Sanfilippo Syndrome Type B).
      Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a severe neurodegenerative disorder. The information
      gathered from this trial may help inform the design and interpretation of subsequent
      interventional studies. No clinical intervention or study drug is provided by BioMarin in
      this study.</summary>
