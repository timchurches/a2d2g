  <interventions>
    <interventions>An ultrasound guided femoral nerve block will be placed using 1% ropivacaine. We are testing it's ability to provide pain control for patients with fractured neck of femurs.
Any emergency registrar or consultant who has been enlisted as an investigator and has undergone the training session is able to enrol patients and administer the block. After written informed consent has been obtained by the patient the groin area is prepared with sterile technique. An ultrasound vascular probe is placed to locate structures anatomically: the main structures being the femoral nerve itself, the femoral artery and vein, the fascia iliaca. Then under real time ultrasound guidance via an out of plane approach 15ml of 1% ropivacaine is injected around the femoral nerve as visualised. A two person technique is employed with the needle attached to the syringe of ropivacaine via a 90cm minimum volume extension set. There is the probe and needle operator and the an assistant injecting the anaesthetic. Digital pressure is then placed for 30 seconds just distal to the injection site. The entire procedure takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Objective measure of the nerve block is assessed at 30 minutes by testing sensation over the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both the study and control group will receive regular oral tablet paracetamol 1g every 4 to 6 hours to a maximum dose of 4g/ in 24hours and parenteral (intravenous) morphine as required for pain control. The study group will also receive a ultrasound guided femoral nerve block. We will compare morphine usage in both groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morphine use in patients for both groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>We are assessing morphine usage over the first 24hours of their hospital admission. That is from the time of presenting to the emergency department. Any morphine given by the ambulance service will also be included in this first 24hour period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain scores and subsequent pain scores will be looked at in each group and compared over the first 12 hours. The score will be from 0 to 10, 10 being the worst pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain scores in both groups will be assessed: at enrolment into the study, 30 minutes after enrolment or after nerve block has been given then at 4 then 8 then 12 hours after enrolment.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Patients need to have radiological proof of fractured neck of femur. They also have to be able to provide their own consent. They are then approached by an investigator and the study and it's purposes discussed. If they are willing to participate - an envelope is randomly taken out of a randomisation box. Inside the envelope is the decision as to which group the patient has been randomised to. The box contains equal numbers of envelopes for the randomisation to both the study and control groups.
The patient will not be blinded to which group they have been allocated to.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients who are willing to be involved will be enrolled as they are diagnosed with radiological proof of fractured neck of femur. Each will be randomised to either the control or study group throughout the study period.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are examining pain management in those patients who present to the emergency department with a fractured hip. Current practice in St Vincent's hospital emergency department is regular paracetamol and parenteral morphine. The POTENTIAL side effects of morphine are well known particularly in the older age group and include such effects as: drowsiness and/or confusion; nausea and vomiting; clinical significant slowing of breathing and lowering of blood pressure. Particular in those who receive significant amounts of morphine. 

Our aim is to show that patients who receive an ultrasound guided femoral nerve block AS PART OF their pain control management will require clinically significant less morphine than those who do not. In fact we are hoping to show these patients use 50% less morphine. If this is the case we will be supporting the idea of introducing ultrasound guided femoral nerve blocks to current clinical practice guidelines for managing pain in fractured hips.</summary>
