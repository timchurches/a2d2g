  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a randomised crossover study involving five visits on five days. On three days, participants will receive breakfast at 8am consisting of a different preload on each day (water, kiwifruit, portion of rice-based meal) followed half an hour later by a rice-based meal. Blood will be sampled via cannula at intervals over two-and-a-half-hours following consumption of the preload. On the other two days, participants will receive a standard breakfast at 8am after which participants will be permitted to leave the facility and asked to return for lunch at 12pm. At lunchtime, the same protocol as described previously (one of two preloads, water and kiwifruit followed by a rice-based meal) will be used. On each test day, the amount of carbohydrate in the preload plus rice meal will be standardized. Subjective appetite ratings will be taken via questionnaire.

The preloads will comprise 2 kiwifruit (24g available carbohydrate; 400kJ); apple segments (24g available carbohydrate; 380kJ); sugar (24g; 400kJ); or water.
The meal following the preloads will comprise cooked white rice (250g containing 50g avail CHO; 840kJ) garnished with leafy green vegetables in soy sauce.
On the days of lunch testing, a standard breakfast will be served comprising noodles (200g containing 40g avail CHO; 600kJ) in beef stock.
The washout will be one week between treatments.
All meals will be eaten under supervision to ensure the preloads and meals are fully consumed. The preload will be eaten within 10 minutes of starting. The test meals will be consumed within 15 minutes of starting.
</interventions>
    <comparator>A water preload will be used as the comparator/control; participants will consume a larger rice meal in one sitting after the water preload, this is to keep carbohydrate amount equal across all test meals. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is important to control the glycaemic and hormonal response to food both for people with normal and impaired glucose tolerance. The purpose of the proposed project is to investigate whether glycaemic and hormonal responses to carbohydrate-containing food can be manipulated by providing meals in two stages (a preload given half an hour before the main meal) compared with meals containing the same amount of carbohydrate given in a single sitting. Our hypothesis is that a beneficial effect of lowering the glycaemic response without adversely affecting the insulin or satiety hormone responses will be observed when a preload containing carbohydrate is given before either breakfast or lunch.</summary>
