  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1:
Radical intervention (radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy based on patient and physician preference) within 90 days of randomisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: 
Active surveillance (monitoring your cancer closely or 'watchful waiting') with radical intervention at the time one or more of the following occur:
* Biochemical progression
* Grade progression
* Clinical progression</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-specific survival. This is defined as the time from randomisation to the time of death from prostate cancer or death with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer or death from disease and protocol treatment complication. Cause of death will be reviewed by a blinded endpoint review committee. The disease specific survival experience of patients in both treatment groups will be described by the Kaplan-Meier method. A stratified log-rank test, adjusting for the stratification factors (except centre) will be used as the primary method to compare the overall survival between the two arms, as well as confidence intervals for the estimated hazard ratio.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up after the completion of the assigned treatment strategy is every 6 months for up to 5 years or until the time of death from prostate cancer or death with metastatic hormone refractory prostate cancer, or death from disease and protocol treatment complication.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival. This is defined as the time from randomization to the time of death from any cause or last follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up after the completion of the assigned treatment strategy is every 6 months for up to 5 years or until the time of death from any cause or last completed follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life will be assessed using a short version of the EPIC-26, RAND SF-12, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory instruments.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparisons between the quality of life of men randomised to immediate treatment compared to those randomized to active surveillance will be assessed with a questionnaire completed &lt;= 30 days before randomisation, followed by an after randomisation questionnaire every 6 months whilst on active surveillance, with timing as follows if recieving radical intervention on either arm: 

Surgery: The completion of surgery is the last day of hospitalisation. Quality of life questionnaires should be completed prior to discharge and patients given the 2 and 4 months forms at that time.

Brachytherapy: The completion of brachytherapy is the day of treatment. Quality of life questionnaires should be completed approximately one week after the procedure.

External beam: Treatment completion is the last review session. Quality of life questionnaires should be completed at the last review session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distant disease-free survival.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is measured from the time of randomisation by Radiology (bone scan, chest x-rays, CTs) and Serum PSA (blood tests). Radiology will be conducted as clinically indicated. Serum PSA (blood tests) will take place every 3 months for 2 years post-randomisation then every 6 months during active surveillance, and every 6 months during and post any radical intervention until the detection of distant metastases or death.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PSA relapse/progression after radical intervention. This is defined as the following:

After Radical Prostatectomy:  
A rise in PSA to greater than 0.4 (ng/ml or ug/L) post prostatectomy.

After External Beam Radiation: 
Rising PSA with or without palpable tumour. A rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir PSA (defined as the lowest PSA achieved). The date of failure is the date of the 2ng/mL or more rise above the nadir PSA. 

After Brachytherapy: 
Rising PSA with or without palpable tumour. Three consecutive rises above nadir. The date of failure is calculated at the midway between the PSA nadir and the first rise.</outcome>
      <timepoint>PSA relapse/progress after radical intervention is assessed post radical intervention (radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation, brachytherapy) every 6 months during and post any radical intervention until the detection of distant metastases or death.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Initiation of androgen deprivation therapy.  Androgen deprivation therapy is defined as LHRH analogues, orchiectomy or anti-androgen monotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is the time from randomisation to the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients on the active surveillance arm receiving radical intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is the proportion of patients on the active surveillance arm who recieve radical intervention at the time one or more of the following occur during the follow-up period: * Biochemical progression (Conducted at randomisation and then, every 3 months for 2 years post-randomisation then every 6 months during active surveillance, and every 6 months during and post any radical intervention until the detection of distant metastases or death). * Grade progression (Gleason pattern predominant 4 i.e. Gleason 4+3 = 7 or higher) in the re-biopsy of prostate conducted at years 1, 4, 7, 10 and then every 5 years during active surveillance until death, and in addition, at the time of radical prostatectomy (if applicable or undertaken). * Clinical progression / Local Progression (Local progression of prostate cancer resulting in urinary retention, gross hematuria or hydronephrosis or evidence of distant metastasis, as defined by radiology/cytology/histology at sites remote from prostate and regional lymph nodes, assessed as per the timepoints for serum PSA blood tests, imaging and biopsy outlined above).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prognostic significance of PSA doubling-time prior to diagnosis</outcome>
      <timepoint>This analysis could be performed after 24 months follow-up is obtained for all participants.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prognostic significance of molecular biomarkers</outcome>
      <timepoint>This analysis could be performed after 24 months follow-up is obtained for all participants.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares the safety and efficacy of two different treatment strategies (active surveillance with selective intervention versus radical treatment) in patients with favourable risk prostate cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have been recently diagnosed with favourable risk prostate cancer and are a suitable candidate for radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. 

Trial Details: 
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. Patients allocated to Group 1 will undergo either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy based on you and your treating doctors preferences. Patients allocated to Group 2 will not undergo any immediate treatment. Rather, a watchful waiting approach will be taken whereby your cancer is monitored closely and treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) is only undertaken if progression occurs. The results of this study will be useful to help guide patients and physicians in choosing the best treatment strategies to manage their cancer.</summary>
