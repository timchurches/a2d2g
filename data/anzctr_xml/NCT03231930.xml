  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - OraQuick HCV Ab test
Treatment: devices - Xpert HCV viral load test

Experimental: Intervention group - Rapid point of care testing will be done using the OraQuick HCV Ab test and the Xpert HCV RNA viral load test. All participants will undergo rapid point of care testing for hepatitis C antibodies using the OraQuick test with oral fluid, followed by point of care testing for the detection of hepatitis C virus RNA using the Cepheid Xpert HCV viral load test on the GeneXpert system. Participants who are found to have current HCV infection will be worked up for treatment at the clinic and referred to appropriate practitioners for HCV treatment. As these tests are not yet licensed for diagnostic use in Australia, confirmatory testing using standard laboratory tests will be performed for all participants.


Treatment: devices: OraQuick HCV Ab test
The OraQuick HCV point of care test involves the collection of oral fluid and provides an accurate result in approximately 20 minutes. The test involves a clinic nurse or community health worker providing pre-test counselling, then providing an oral swab to study participants, then reading the result and counselling the participant about their HCV antibody test result.

Treatment: devices: Xpert HCV viral load test
The Cepheid Xpert HCV RNA test (XpertÂ® HCV Viral Load test) is a reverse transcriptase polymerase-based chain reaction amplification technology (RT-PCR) and provides an accurate HCV RNA load within 2 hours (105 minutes), using a serum sample.
This test will be performed for participants who have a positive OraQuick HCV antibody result.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Rapid-EC pilot study will determine feasibility of providing rapid point-of-care (POC)
      testing for HCV in community clinics, and whether the availability of POC testing increases
      uptake of testing, engagement in care and completion of treatment among people who inject
      drugs.

      The POC tests being utilised in this study are the OraQuick mouth swab test for the presence
      of HCV antibodies, and the Xpert HCV RNA viral load test using serum.</summary>
