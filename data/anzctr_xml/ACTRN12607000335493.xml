  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nonrandomised study. Three marker seeds will be inserted into the prostate before radiation planning. Using sequential portal films, the seeds can be visualised and measurements will be performed to assess set-up errors over the course of radiation therapy.
The marker seeds will stay in the prostate permanently. The course of radiation therapy will be 7 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the feasibility and potential implications for using fiducial markers rather than bony landmarks for realigning patients during treatment.
Every patient will have 7 weeks of radiation therapy treatment. During treatment, they will have daily portal films for the first 2 weeks and then twice per week for the remaining weeks. Measurements of the seeds position will be performed by a medical physicist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The feasibility outcome will be analysed after 20 patients' fiducial markers measurements have been collected.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure organ motion and set-up errors over the course of radiation therapy from sequential portal films with fiducial seed markers implanted in the prostate.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the 7 weeks of radiotherapy, each patient will have daily sequential portal films for the first 2 weeks and then twice per week for the remaining weeks of treatment (i.e. 5 weeks). The portal films will be matched with the planning films to assess organ motion and set-up error.
Outcome will be analysed after 20 patients' fiducial markers measurements have been collected.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To use the data collected to calculate the appropriate conformal margins for the treatment of localised prosate cancer and then allow for safe dose escalation</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of implantation of marker seeds into the prostate to assess the feasibility of using marker seeds to locate the prostate before daily radiotherapy treatment for men with localised prostate cancer.

Who is it for?

You can join this study if you are a man aged 5080 years with localised prostate cancer and you are going to have radiation therapy.

Trial details

Participants will have three marker seeds inserted under local anaesthetic into the prostate before radiotherapy. The seeds are like small rods inserted into the prostate gland and act as landmarks so radiotherapy can be given as accurately as possible.

 All participants will have radiotherapy for 7 weeks. During the 7 weeks of therapy, X-rays will be taken daily for the first 2 weeks to measure the position of the seeds. After that, X-rays will be taken twice a week for 5 weeks to continue to measure the position of the marker seeds.  These seeds will stay in your prostate permanently.</summary>
