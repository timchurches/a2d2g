          3. Target lesion has any of the following characteristics:

               1. Lesion location is within the left main coronary artery, or within 3 mm of the

                  origin of the right coronary artery may be treated.

          4. Target vessel/lesion is excessively tortuous/angulated or is severely calcified, that
             would prevent complete inflation of an angioplasty balloon. This assessment should be
             based on visual estimation.

          5. Target vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus.

          6. Target lesion is totally occluded (100% stenosis).
