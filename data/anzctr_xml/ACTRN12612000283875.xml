      <outcome>Investigation of safety and tolerability using adverse events (for example, changes in skin pigmentation)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be recorded at each visit (from week 2 to week 12) and comparisons will be made between minocycline and placebo to determine differences in the frequency of events.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate minocycline as an adjunctive treatment for unipolar depression. Participants will receive 200 mg/day of minocycline or placebo for 12 weeks with improvements on the MADRS being the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include potential improvements in functioning, quality of life and clincial impressions. Based on previous studies, minocycline should be well-tolerated for the duration of the study, however safety monitoring will also be reported as a secondary outcome.</summary>
