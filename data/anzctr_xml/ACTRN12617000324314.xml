  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a 12-month intervention where patients will be randomised to either intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive prebiotic and probiotics alongside healthy eating for CKD education. Dietary education will be a minimum of 30 minutes in duration and will be based on the Evidence Based Practice Guidelines for the Nutritional Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Individual, face to face sessions will be conducted by an Accredited Practicing Dietitian who specialises in renal nutrition. During these sessions, the patient will be provided with a pamphlet (from Queensland Health Nutrition Education Materials Online) which outlines key information pertaining to healthy eating for CKD. This will be discussed in detail with the patient, allowing for clarification of any unclear messages. These sessions will occur alongside scheduled clinic visits (baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52).

Prebiotic dose = 2 x 10g powder/day. 
Probiotic dose = 450 billion CFU (1 sachet per day) To be taken in cold non-carbonated drinks or food

Intervention fidelity will be monitored through a supplement count and weighing. Adherence to a stable diet will be monitored using 24hr food recalls.Prebiotic dose = 2 x 10g powder/day.
