  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 week group based education.  Three group education sessions (1 hour) every 4 weeks, followed by final one-to-one interview at week 12.  Group sessions will cover motivation, hypo / hyperglycaemia management, blood sugar pattern management, low fat / high fibre food choices, and dietary choices for fasting days.    There will be maximum of 10 participants per group (not including support person) - 2 x 10 participant groups will be run.  The final one-to-one interview (45 minutes) at week 12 will include final data collection point (anthropometric and biochemical measurements) and future requirements for weight reduction interventions.  
Intervention group - Healthy eating + Intermittent fasting diet.  2 days out of 7 consumption limited to 500-600kcal daily; 5 days of out 7 consumption advised low fat, regular high fibre carbohydrate usual portion sizes.  Participants will complete a daily blood glucose diary which includes a weekly fasting-adherence diary.  Three two day food diaries will be completed during the study.  Phone call interviews will be used fortnightly, between group sessions to check blood sugar management and reminders to complete food diaries.

    <statisticalmethods>For this feasibility study a group of participants who represent the general T2DM population under the care of Waitemata DHB Diabetes Services will be recruited.  Sample size and effect size calculations were not undertaken as there are no similar studies on this type of dietary intervention for Type 2 Diabetics on insulin.  Based on the population treated at the Waitemata DHB Diabetes Centre and predicted enrolment rates in the study, forty participants will be enrolled.  As this is a feasibility study there will be no specific sampling of population groups such as Maori.  The data will be performed using SPSS software.   Primary analysis: Weight (kg) will be presented as mean and standard deviation at baseline and week 12 for each treatment arm.   Secondary analysis:  Glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk factors dietary and acceptability will be presented as mean and standard deviation at baseline and week 12 for each treatment arm.  Macronutrient intake over three days will be presented as mean and standard deviation.   It is anticipated that data will be normally distributed and differences between treatment arms will analysed using a two sample t-test and correlation analysis using Pearsons correlation coefficient</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions in New Zealanders. Type 2 Diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and is a cause of considerable ill health and premature death. Weight loss can improve blood sugar control and heart health which can reduce complications of diabetes. One problem is helping people keep to dietary changes that help long term weight loss. This means that health professionals need to investigate new diets and make sure that they are safe for people with diabetes. One new diet is the intermittent fasting diet. This diet has people eat very little on two days a week, and a normal healthy diet on the other five days a week. Initial research shows that this type of diet may be easier to stick to and result in better insulin sensitivity than traditional diets. There has been no research on whether this type of diet is safe for people who have type 2 diabetes and are treated using insulin. This feasibility study will help tell us if this is an effective way to lose weight, and a safe diet for people with diabetes on insulin. Forty people who attend the Diabetes Centre at Waitemata DHB will be recruited for a 12 week intervention study. They will be randomly put in to two groups. One group will follow a healthy eating plus intermittent fasting diet three mealsfor two days a week, and five days a week will be a low fat, high fibre carbohydrate healthy eating plan with participants usual portion sizes. The other group will follow a healthy eating plus portion control eating plan based on Diabetes NZ dietary recommendations. Dietary information, medication dose adjustment and blood glucose patterns will be taught at a monthly group education and support programme. The hypothesis is that following an intermittent fasting diet for weight reduction is a safe and effective weight reduction strategy when compared to current standard practice of healthy eating portion controlled dietary advice.If it is safe and effective diet for people with diabetes on insulin then it could have direct impact on improving quality of life and reducing healthcare burdens.</summary>
