  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomized to the intervention arm will take two cranberry capsules once a day during breakfast from the first day of radiation therapy till 3 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.

Creative Energy LTD is a New Zealand company that will provide the unmarked bottles with cranberry capsules (containing 72mg PACs) each and unmarked bottles with placebo capsules containing colloidal silica, magnesium stearate, cellulose and gelatin. The capsules will be opaque, making them indistinguishable from the cranberry capsules. 

Patients will bring back bottle for counting on Monday of every week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomized to the control arm will take two placebo capsules once a day during breakfast from the first day of radiation therapy till 3 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.

Placebo capsules will contain colloidal silica, magnesium stearate, cellulose and gelatin. The capsules will be opaque, making them indistinguishable from the cranberry capsules. They will be produced by teh same company that makes the cranberry capsules, Creative Energy LTD.  </comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be randomized to either the cranberry arm or the placebo arm. The research radiation therapist will send a randomization request to the PI, Dr Herst who is an academic in Wellington and has no patient involvement. Dr Herst will do the randomizations based on computer-generated random numbers provided by the biostatistician of the University of Otago, Gordon Purdie. Both the patients and the research radiation therapist will be blinded to which arm the patient is on. The cranberry and placebo capsules have been manufactured by the same company and look exactly the same.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary objective: Severity of cystitis using RTOG, IC and RICAS.
The difference between cranberry and placebo for the average severity of cystitis using RTOG/IC will be compared to the difference between cranberry and placebo for average RICAS by comparing the Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistics for the two comparisons.

Based on our previous pilot study, we aim to recruit 100 patients, 50 in the cranberry arm and 50 in the placebo arm. Trial is powered to 80% to detect a statistically significant difference between cranberry and placebo arms (p&lt;0.05) of cystitis incidence and RICAS impact items of pain, nocturia and strength of stream


Secondary objective: Sensitivity of RICAS, RTOG and IC scales.
The severity of non-hamorrhagic cystitis in cranberry and placebo groups will be compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for the RTOG, IC and RICAS scoring systems.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Radiation-induced cystitis is a common acute side effect of radiation therapy for prostate cancer, with no effective treatment. Because radiation cystitis is caused by free radical damage to the bladder lining, anti-oxidants, such as cranberry products, may decrease radiation cystitis severity. Our previous pilot study found that highly standardized cranberry capsules decreased the number of men experiencing radiation cystitis and that these men experienced pain/burning less frequently.
Standard scales (such as RTOG) only distinguish 5 levels of severity from mild (1) to death (5) and are not sensitive enough to measure small differences in severity in mild-moderate cystitis. Non-invasive interventions such as cranberry capsules are not expected to affect the outcome of patients with grade 4-5 cystitis but may be able to decrease the severity of symptoms of mild to moderate cystitis. I therefore designed a new scale (RICAS: radiation induced cystitis assessment scale), which consists of 9 severity items of importance to men (based on our pilot) and the effect each of these has on their day to day life.
We will test both scales on 50 prostate cancer patients who will take 2 cranberry capsules and 50 prostate cancer patients who will take 2 placebo capsules each day for 10 weeks. 

This stage III double blinded placebo controlled trial is designed to answer 2 questions:
1: Are cranberry capsules better than placebo capsules in decreasing cystitis severity?
2: Is RICAS better than RTOG in evaluating cystitis severity?
