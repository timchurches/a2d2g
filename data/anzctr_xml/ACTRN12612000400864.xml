  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individually tailored nutrition planning by a dietitian before discharge from the hospital. The content of the diet intervention before discharge involved dietary counseling to meet the deficit in protein, calorie and other nutrient intake.
Oral nutrition supplements will be prescribed for patients who require them. 
	In the intervention group, outpatient follow-ups and telephone nutrition support will be provided for 5 months. The first follow-up with a telephone call will take place 1 week after discharge from the hospital. Outpatient appointments will be scheduled at the 1st month, 3rd month and 5th month. If patients fail to turn up at the outpatient clinic, home visits will be arranged within one week of the missed appointments. Patients will not receive any home visits if they attend all their outpatient appointments. All the outpatient follow-up at the clinic and home visits will be administered a dietitian on a one-to-one basis and lasts about 30 minutes. Telephone follow-up by a dietetic assistant will be scheduled at the 2nd month, 4th month and every 2 weeks for patients who do not make improvement in oral intake.</interventions>
    <comparator>Simlarly in the control group, individually tailored nutrition planning by a dietitian before discharge from the hospital will be administered. The content of the diet intervention before discharge involved dietary counseling to meet the deficit in protein, calorie and other nutrient intake.
Oral nutrition supplements will be prescribed for patients who require them. 

Appointments for follow-up with the dietitians at outpatient clinic will be provided at the 1st month, 3rd month and 5th month. Reminders will be sent to the participants on the appointments regardless of attendance to match the potential number of "face-to-face" contacts as the intervention group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative model of ambulatory nutrition support services via a randomised controlled trial which will compare combined home visits, outpatient follow-up and telephone nutrition support services with standard hospital outpatient clinics.The hypothesis of this study is that malnourished patients receiving nutrition support post-hospitalisation will benefit from novel ways of nutrition support delivery and hence improve their nutritional,      functional and health outcomes; at the same time reducing unplanned readmission rate, length of hospital stay and mortality and cost.</summary>
