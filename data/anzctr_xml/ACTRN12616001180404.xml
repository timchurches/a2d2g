    <interventions>The aim is to determine whether Cxbladder, a urine diagnostic test is as accurate as cystoscopy current technologies in determining freedom from, or recurrence of cancer in the a group of patients having undergone BCG immunotherapy or Mitomycin C intravesical chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

Hypothesis: The Cxbladder test is accurate at predicting the recurrence status of bladder cancer in patients who have undergone intra-vesical therapy.

Patients are required to provide samples prior to treatment and then at 1,2,3,6 months following BCG or MCC treatment.

Samples are analysed and gene expression scores determined  however no sites are provided with direct patient scores. The study is observational only and results are only provided to the site after the study is closed and for the purpose of collating data for publication.

Samples are analysed and gene expression scores are determined as (but not provided to sites)
1) Normal &lt;0.12
2) Elevated 0.12-0.23
3) High &gt;0.23 (Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 68%. High probability of urothelial carcinoma)



</interventions>
    <comparator>The reference standard is for patients to under go a flexible cystoscopy prior to treatment, then at 1,2,3 and 6 months post treatment. 

Patients (both those under going BCG/MMC treatment and participants who have undergone DMSO /heparin therapy for painful bladder syndrome who act as a control group) provide urine samples and these are analysed and gene expression determined  however no sites are provided with direct patient scores. The study is observational only and results  are only provided to the site after the study is closed and for the purpose of collating data for publication.

In all cases, the urologist will examine the bladder under cystoscopy and bladder tissue is collected (if appropriate) and analysed to presence of urothelial carcimona (grade and stage).

A positive cystoscopy result indicates the presence of urothelial carcinoma.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The aim is to determine whether Cxbladder is as good as cystoscopy in determining freedom from or recurrence of cancer in the group of patients having undergone BCG immunotherapy or Mitomycin C intravesical chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

Specifically, to compare cystoscopy findings (positive or negative for cancer recurrence) with Cxbladder test result (positive or negative for cancer recurrence).

The sensitivity and specificity of the Cxbladder test will be compared to cystoscopy results.</outcome>

Final analysis of performance of Cxbladder will be performed upon completion of sampling for all proposed patients.

    <summary>The aim is to determine whether Cxbladder is as accurate as cystoscopy current technologies in determining freedom from, or recurrence of cancer in the group of patients having undergone  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)  immunotherapy or Mitomycin C intravesical chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

This study aims to investigate the diagnostic test accuracy of Cxbladder for predicting recurrence of cancer in the group of patients having undergone Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy or Mitomycin C intravesical chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 85 years undergoing Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy or Mitomycin C therapy for bladder cancer or DMSO/heparin therapy for painful bladder syndrome at Concord Hospital. 

Study details 
All participants of this study will provide urine samples before they commence treatment and then at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months following completion of treatment. These samples will be analysed using Cxbladder diagnostic test and results then compared with currently used cystoscopy exam results. These findings will not be used in treatment decisions but will help establish if Cxbladder test can be used to predict cancer recurrence in patients undergoing this type of treatment.</summary>
