  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying low-dose vincristine to see how well it works
      compared with high-dose vincristine when given together with different combination
      chemotherapy regimens in treating young patients with intermediate-risk relapsed B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more
      than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving the drugs in different ways and different
      doses may kill more cancer cells..</summary>
