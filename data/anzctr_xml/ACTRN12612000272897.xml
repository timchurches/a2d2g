  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: The experimental group receives a dentifrice -coming in the form of toothpaste- containing nanocrystals of zinc-carbonate-hydroxyapatite, assembled in micro-particles, that have been shown to produce in vitro remineralization of the altered enamel surfaces and to be effective in closing dentinal tubules, thus showing a potential use in desensitising dentifrices (Rimondini et al. 2007, Lee et al. 2008, Roveri et al. 2008). The patients are instructed to brush their teeth for three days, twice a day for at least one minute and not to use any other dentifrice or desensitizing agent.</interventions>
    <comparator>2 Control arms are used. Arm2: a group of patients are treated with a dentifrice containing strontium acetate (active control 1), following the same protocol of the experimental group (for three days, twice a day...)
Arm 3: a group of patients are treated with a dentifrice containing 8% arginine and calcium carbonate (active control 2) following the same protocol (for three days, twice a day...).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Using a double-blind, randomized design, the dentifrice based on nano-crystals of carbonate hydroxyapatite is compared with two active control: a dentifrice containing strontium acetate and a dentifrice containing 8% arginine. Participants DH  was evaluated at baseline and after three days using Airblast, Cold water, Tactile and Subjective tests.</summary>
