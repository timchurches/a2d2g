  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a Double Blind Randomised Controlled Trial ( RCT) where practices are randomly allocated to:
- Group 1 ( intervention with spirometry) For 12 months practices will receive full spirometry intervention and an interpretation of results will be notified to the treating GP
-Group 2  (intervention without spirometry) For 12 months practices will receive spirometry before and after the trial, but no results will be reported to the GP</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 3 (Control) For 12 months practices will provide usual medical care only, which may include peak flow monitoring, but not spirometry</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>General Practices will be included if there is a commitment by the practice to participate, they agree to randomisation, are willing to recruit patients with asthma or COPD from their practices, and are willing to search their medical records database (database search training will be provided to staff if required).  Eligible patients will attend a general practice on the list of divisions of general practice in Melbourne and surrounding regions. 
Patient inclusion criteria: attend a general practice on the list of Divisions of general Practice in Melbourne and surrounding regions, have doctor diagnosed asthma or COPD, must be able to understand English and must be able to provide written consent to participate. </inclusivecriteria>

The intervention will be concealed from GP's up to the time of recruitment and will be kept masked from patients and research staff performing oucome assessments.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study has been designed around the research questions a) do patients with chronic respiratory disease (asthma and/or COPD) managed with lung function testing (spirometry) through general practice have better health outcomes than patients managed without spirometry? and b) to what degree does the use of spirometry influence the way general practitioners manage patients with chronic respiratory disease?

This study aims to trial lung function testing ( spirometry) as an intervention for management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD) in a General practice setting. The main objectives are a) to evaluate the impact of spirometry on health outcomes of patients with asthma and COPD,compared with usual care alone ( no spirometry) and b) to identify the barriers and enablers to spirometry in general practice and primary care.</summary>
