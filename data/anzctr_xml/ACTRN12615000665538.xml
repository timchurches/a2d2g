  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be taught and supported to completed the EXTRA practice protocol for 60 minutes per day, six days per week for four weeks. Each 60 minute practice session will involve 30 minutes of Graded Repetitive Supplementary Program (GRASP) training and 30 minutes of the AbleX program. The EXTRA therapy program will be semi supervised by a qualified occupational therapist in a treatment room or in the patient's hospital room.  The intervention period will extend for four weeks or until discharged from the rehabilitation unit (whichever is first; this study will not influence discharge dates which will be set by the treating rehabilitation team). 

GRASP is an arm and hand exercise program developed for stroke patients with upper extremity impairments and allows patients to undertake a self-directed arm and hand exercise program. GRASP exercises may include functional tasks, fine motor skills and strengthening exercises. Participants will be asked to start the next day where they left off. Every participant will be started at Level 1 and will go up to the next level when they can complete the program in one quarter of the time required (25 minutes). 
The AbleX is a computer based upper limb exercise system shown to be effective in providing repetitive, intense and engaging exercise that improves upper limb function. The AbleX runs thorough a Windows operating system on a laptop. Feedback on performance (accuracy), activity time (adherence) and exercise intensity is automatically captured with the exercise game.

Participants will be asked to record the duration of each practice session. Should participants not complete the required amount of daily practice their reasons for not training will be recorded. Participants can choose for greater or less than the required daily minimum.

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by the investigators through the review of electronic inpatient ward lists and/or their medical record for confirmation of a diagnosis of stroke (screened) and the presence of hemiparesis/hemiplegia (eligible). Potential participants will be approached on the ward by a researcher who has no relationship with the potential participants to determine eligibility. If eligible, the researcher will then explain the study to potential participants and invite them to participate. Written information about the study will be provided to participants.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Repeated measures analyses of variance will be used to compare the changes in outcome measure variables from baseline to Week four. Mean within-group differences (MD) (95%CI) will be calculated. Probabilities of less than 0.05 will be considered significant. Descriptive data will be reported as aggregated data; mea (range) and mean (sd) will both be reported to permit future sample size calculations.

Feasibility will be analysed descriptively. Recruitment rates and proportions will be calculated. Counts for adverse events and an adverse event rate will be calculated. Sensitivity of outcome measures will also be evaluated and recommendations made about the outcome measures for future, larger, trials. 

Because sample sizes are small (typically less than 30 participants) Phase 1 trials are only able to detect the feasibility of the intervention. The number of participants needed to achieve this study objectives was determined by the study design.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arm and hand training is routinely provided within stroke rehabilitation programs around Australia. Arm and hand training for stroke survivors aims to improve the amount a person can move, the control they have during the movement, and the strength of the muscles in the arm and hand. Research has shown that hospitalised patients get between 30 to 60 minutes of hand and arm practice every day. Other research has shown that doing extra leg practice every day is not harmful and can lead to people being able to walk earlier than those who did not complete the extra practice. What remains unknown is whether it is feasible for an inpatient to do extra arm and hand practice than is currently offered in Australian hospitals, and if an inpatient completes extra arm and hand practice, does this also lead to a person being able to move more or earlier than those who only complete their usual therapy.
This study aims to find out if receiving 60 minutes of extra arm and hand practice in addition to usual therapy is safe and feasible after stroke. Participants will be asked to complete a semi-supervised EXTRA practice upper limb therapy package for one hour per day, six days a week for four weeks while an inpatient of Caulfield Hospital.</summary>
