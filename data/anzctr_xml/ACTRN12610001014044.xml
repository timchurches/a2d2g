  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy will be used including 12 sessions for adolescents and 12 concurrent parent education sessions. The adolescent sessions teach cognitive behavioural skills that are targeted to combat anxiety while additionally incorporating social skills and assertiveness training in order to specifically address core HFASD deficits. The parent sessions will provide psychoeducation, and assist them in understanding their adolescents anxiety and the homework activities.  The first 15 minutes of each session will entail parents and adolescents working together, followed by an adolescent-only session (1 hour) and then a parent session (45 minutes). The sessions will be weekly for 9 weeks and then 2 additional sessions, one month apart. Each group will complete intervention  within 6 months.</interventions>
