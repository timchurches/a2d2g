  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to test the addition of a new treatment called denosumab to standard immunotherapies for patients with metastatic melanoma. Denosumab has been used for many years to help treat cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer, but it is not currently used in melanoma. We hope the addition of denosumab to current melanoma therapies will make these treatments work better without adding to the side effects. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread).

Study details
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are approved treatments for advanced melanoma in Australia and overseas. Patients with metastatic melanoma, who are not enrolled in a study, are commonly prescribed nivolumab alone or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab as standard care. However, there is limited information on the effectiveness and safety of these treatments in combination with denosumab. Recent melanoma research in animal models has shown that denosumab can make immunotherapies such as ipilimumab and nivolumab work better. Because denosumab has been used in patients with breast and prostate cancer for a long time and is safe, we now want to test the benefits and safety of adding denosumab to immunotherapies in this study. 

Patients in Arm A will receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV (intravenous) every 2 weeks for 4 doses and denosumab 120 mg SC (subcutaneous) D1, D8, D15, D29. Thereafter, nivolumab 480 mg IV and denosumab 120 mg SC every 4 weeks for a total of 24 months

Patients in Arm B will recieve ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg combined with nivolumab at 1 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses with denosumab 120 mg SC given D1, D8, D15, D29, D57. This will be followed by nivolumab 480 mg IV and denosumab 120 mg SC ever 4 weeks for a total of 24 months.

Responses to treatment and progression will be regularly monitored until the last patient has been in survival follow-up for 5 years. Tumour and blood samples will also be taken to determine possible predictive biomarkers.</summary>
