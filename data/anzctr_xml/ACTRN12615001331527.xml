  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo one of three, 16 week  interventions including:  1)  5:2 diet intermittent fasting diet, 2) supervised high intensity interval training (HIIT)  performed 3 days a week, and 3) a combination of both interventions.  The 5:2 intermittent fasting diet will involve participants fasting for two non-consecutive days of the week, consuming a single meal of 500kcal for women or 600kcal for men and then fasting for 24 hours.  For the remaining five days of the week participants dietary intake is unrestricted.  Dietary compliance will be monitored weekly using a food diary to record intake on both fasting and non-fasting days. The HIIT protocol used involves 3-6 cycles of 20s cycling at 150% VO2Max followed by 40s of active rest, with 3 minutes of warmup and 3 minutes of warm down with no resistance.  The high intensity interval training will be performed in small groups (3-5 participants) supervised by two investigators or personal trainers, and will be performed on bicycle ergometers.  Participants will be required to complete at least 42 out of 48 HIIT sessions, with attendance and performance data (Maximum heart rate and heart rate at the completion of each interval) being recorded at each session using data collection forms.  Body composition, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, aerobic capacity (VO2Max) and quality of life (mood state questionnaire) will be measured at 0, 8 and 16 weeks. Additionally, blood samples will be taken and measured for lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, markers of inflammation and expression levels of microRNA. Participants will also be asked to continue the interventions for a further period of 8 months self-directed, with follow up measurements performed at the 24, 36 and 52 weeks.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes to body composition.  This outcome will be measured/monitored through the use of body weight scales and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.   This research study involves exposure to a very small amount of radiation. As part of everyday living, everyone is exposed to naturally occurring background radiation and receives a dose of about 2 millisievert (mSv) each year. The effective dose from this study is less than 0.03 mSv. At this dose level, no harmful effects of radiation have been demonstrated as any effect is too small to measure. The risk is believed to be minimal.</outcome>

      <outcome>Aerobic Capacity testing (VO2).  This outcome will be measured using a ramped workload protocol using a magnetically braked LODE cycle ergometer until volitional fatigue.  Oxygen uptake (VO2) and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) will be measured every 30 seconds. VO2max will be determined if two of the following criteria were met: respiratory exchange ratio RER = 1.15 and/or RPE score = 19 and/or maximum heart rate within Â± 10 beats of age predicted maximum (HR max). If the criteria are met, the highest level of VO2 will be defined as VO2 max, however if these criteria are not met the highest VO2 will be termed VO2 peak instead.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intermittent fasting (IF) is any strategy where participants severely restrict caloric intake on one or more days of the week with 'normal' eating on non-fasting days, and has recently gained popularity for weight loss. Intermittent fasting compares well with other traditional nutritional interventions such as long term calorie restriction, with higher levels of dietary adherence reported over time. High intensity interval training (HIIT) has also been reported as an effective and time efficient exercise strategy for weight loss, as well as improvements to markers of cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Individually IF and HIIT are effective, however, their combined effects are unknown. This study intends to examine the short and long term impacts of IF, specifically a 2:5 ratio of fasting days to normal eating days, and HIIT on weight loss and cardio vascular and metabolic health. The influence of these interventions will be monitored separately, or in combination, on body composition, metabolic and cardiovascular health, fitness and quality of life. In addition, the study will identify changes in serum miRNAs expression. To achieve these aims, overweight and obese individuals will undergo 1 of 3, 16 week interventions including:  1)  5:2 diet intermittent fasting diet, 2) supervised high intensity interval training (HIIT)  performed 3 days a week, and 3) a combination of both interventions. Body composition, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and quality of life will be measured at 0, 8 and 16 weeks. Additionally, blood samples will be taken and measured for lipid profiles, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance, markers of inflammation and expression levels of microRNA. Participants will also be asked to continue the interventions for a further period of 8 months self-directed, with follow up measurements performed at the 24, 36 and 52 weeks. Effective dietary and exercise interventions that promote long-term adherence and sustained beneficial effects on metabolic and disease markers are required to reduce the increasing rates of obesity.</summary>
