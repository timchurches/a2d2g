  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an education campaign aimed to reduce unnecessary peripheral inserted intravenous catheter use. The educational campaign includes group educational sessions with medical and nursing staff within the department of emergency medicine. The educational sessions will include a powerpoint presentation on appropriate peripheral inserted intravenous catheter use and will remind staff not to place a peripherally inserted intravenous catheter unless they are 80% sure that it will be used. There also will be posters placed in the Emergency Department and clinical champions wearing shirts reminding staff not to place a cannula unless clinically necessary. We will conduct 1X 30 minute sessions per week for 4 weeks. The nursing and medical staff involved in the study will be conducting the educational campaign. The follow-up data collection will monitor whether there has been adherence to the educational campaign.

    <statisticalmethods>The pre-intervention study is powered to ensure that the rate of unused PIVC is estimated with high precision. If the proportion of unused PIVCs is 50%, we require 1068 patients with cannulas to estimate the proportion with precision of 3% and confidence level of 95%. Note that the upper estimate of 50% was chosen as this provides most conservative estimates for sample size calculations. It is estimated that approximately 65% of patients have a cannula placed. Thus, the total estimated sample size in the pre-intervention study is 1644 

Used PIVC (as defined above) will also be the primary outcome for the post-intervention study. However, this study aims to assess whether there has been a reduction in the proportion of unused PIVC after the intevention. It was noted above that we will recruit 1644 patients in the pre-intervention arm to estimate the rate of unused PIVC. We propose collecting data for the same number of patients in the post-intervention study so that the unused PIVC rate post-intervention is also estimated with a high level of precision. It should be noted that this will provide adequate power to detect a difference between the pre and post-intervention groups. Specifically, to detect a reduction in rates of unused cannulas from 50% to 35%, a sample size of 480 cannulated patients (240 patients pre and 240 patients post intervention) will achieve power of 90% and alpha of 0.05. 

Baseline data on the historical control and intervention group will be compared using chi-square and t-tests for categorical and continuous data respectively. To identify whether there has been a difference in the proportion of peripherally inserted intravenous catheters placed before and after the educational campaign, we will calculate the difference in the proportions (and 95% confidence intervals of the difference). A Chi-square test will also be conducted to compare the proportions of catheters placed in the historical and intervention groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripherally inserted intravenous catheters (PIVC) are commonly used in Emergency Departments, however their use is not without cost or risk. Current literature suggests that a considerable proportion of PIVC placed in the emergency department remain unused, thereby increasing the number of patients who are unnecessarily exposed to the risks of PIVC including increased risk of infection.

We will conduct a historically controlled trial that has two major aims. The first is to provide accurate baseline data on PIVC placement and PIVC use in patents in a tertiary emergency department (ED). The second is to assess the effect of an educational campaign on reducing the number of PIVC placed and the number of unused PIVC in ED patients. 

Within the Department of Emergency Medicine, we will collect data on the number of PIVC placed and used before an educational campaign. We will then run an education campaign that aims to reduce unnecessary PIVC use. We will then collect data on the number of PIVC placed and used one month after the education program to identify whether there has been a reduction in the number of PIVC placed and the number of unused PIVC in patients presenting to the Emergency Department.
