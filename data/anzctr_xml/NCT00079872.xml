  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, patients will receive either pemetrexed plus irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil
      (5-FU), leucovorin, and irinotecan.

      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  How pemetrexed plus irinotecan compares with 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan in terms
           of efficacy.

        -  The safety of pemetrexed plus irinotecan and any side effects that might be associated
           with it as compared with 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan.

        -  Whether pemetrexed can help patients with colorectal cancer.</summary>
