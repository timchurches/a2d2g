    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Spinal cord stimulation system

Experimental: Spinal cord stimulation - 


Treatment: devices: Spinal cord stimulation system
An implantable pulse generator (IPG) will deliver low-intensity electrical pulses which travel from the IPG through the leads to the electrodes positioned at the selected nerve fibers to provide the therapeutic stimulation.
