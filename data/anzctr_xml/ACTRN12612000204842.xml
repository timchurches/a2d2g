  <interventions>
    <interventions>35min exercise class, twice weekly, for eight weeks exercise program specifically designed for professional orchestral musicians.  This program consists of 5mins of warm-ups, 25mins of progressive exercises targeting common performance-related musculoskeletal injuries and pain regions (ie. cervical &amp; thoracic spine, shoulder &amp; the upper limb, lumbopelvic region). This program will be supervised by an experienced physiotherapist that has also attained clinical pilates qualifications.  

Participants are encouraged to undertake both interventions with a one-month wash out period between the interventions.  Participants have the choice of opting out at the end of each intervention.  The order of intervention at each of the eight orchestra will be determined using an electronic randomisation system.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two groups of comparator to the musician specific exercise intervention.  A group of participants will undertake Alexander Technique intervention for the same period of time as the Musician Specific Exercise Program (35min classes, twice weekly, for 8 weeks).  This program was designed by a qualified Alexander Technique teacher and includes basic skeletal anatomy, postural education from the Alexander principals perspective, movement patterns in activities of daily living and applying principals of Alexander in instrumental playing.  Qualified Alexander Technique teachers with additional training to deliver this specific program will be supervising the classes. 

A group of controls (no intervention) will be used as well.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to trial a specific exercise program to support the musician's playing actions and movement patterns, and examine any effects on pain. Information collected relating to changes in frequency and intensity of Performance-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders will be used to evaluate the effects of the exercise or Alexander technique programs and these results will be compared to the control group. Data obtained on playing postures, playing techniques and perceived exertion will also be evaluated for differences between the pre-intervention and post-intervention conditions.</summary>
