  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective of the study: to verify the efficiency of the balance training, proprioception, and muscle strength exercises concerning the improvement of the functional capacity and quality of life of women with osteoporosis, through validated questionnaires and functional tests.

Hypothesis:
Proprioception, balance and muscle strength trainings are effective in the falls prevention and reduction of its risk factors, improving the quality of life and functional capacity of patients with osteoporosis, through the acceleration of their motor responses, improving therefore the performance of their daily life activities.</summary>
