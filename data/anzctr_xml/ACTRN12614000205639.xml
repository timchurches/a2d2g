  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be self-management.  Self-management involves the stroke survivor (and family/carers as appropriate) working in partnership with their health care provider, both via face to face visits and telephone discussions.  The intervention will be delivered  in 5 face to face visits of 60-90 minutes duration, with phone discussions as required by the partipant, over a three month period, and will commence within the first month following discharge. The visits will occur 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after discharge from hospital. Intervention will consist of the following: 
1. Education about the importance of exercise 
2. Medical clearance to exercise
3. Negotiation of an exercise plan with stroke survivor, family and carers
4. Problem solution, support and encouragement to take up exercise
5. Monitoring and support of behaviour change
Follow-up will occur at 3 months and 6 months.  Adherence to protocol will be documented with each face to face visit.</interventions>
