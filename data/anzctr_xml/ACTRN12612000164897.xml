  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will assess the effectiveness of a fertility awareness-based charting method in increasing the likelihood of pregnancy in a population with unexplained subfertility. 

It is hypothesised that the Sympto-Thermal Method increases the likelihood of pregnancy in the unexplained ovulating subfertile population.</summary>
