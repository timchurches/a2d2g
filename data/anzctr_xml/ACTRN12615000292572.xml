  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective study combining dabrafenib, trametinib and palliative radiotherapy (RT). 

Eligible subjects are patients who have been on dabrafenib (150 mg oral twice daily) and trametinib (2mg oral once daily) for more than 2 weeks, as the current standard management for advanced stage melanoma. 
Palliative RT will be delivered to symptomatic or bulky (&gt;2cm) soft tissue, nodal or bony metastases concurrently with dabrafenib and trametinib. Up to 3 areas of disease can be irradiated at the same time. 
The following dose levels for palliative RT are shown below:
Level 1: 20 Gray in 5 fractions 
Level 2: 30 Gray in 10 fractions
Level 3: 40 Gray in 16 fractions
The RT technique, dose, frequency and duration (ranging from 1-4 weeks) of treatment will be determined by your treating radiation oncologist, depending on the location and size of the lesion(s). 

Following RT, dabrafenib and trametinib alone will be continued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the side effects, safety, and effectiveness of combining dabrafenib and trametinib with radiotherapy in treatment of BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have received dabrafenib and trametinib (for 2 weeks or more prior to enrolment) for treatment of BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma that is either Stage IIIC (unresectable) or Stage IV (metastatic). 

Study details: 
Melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may benefit from radiotherapy to help reduce symptoms from melanoma. Previous studies have shown that melanoma may be sensitive to radiotherapy and that it can help to improve quality of life. All participants in this study will receive palliative radiotherapy concurrently with their dabrafenib and trametinib treatment. The radiotherapy dose, frequency and duration will be determined by your treating radiation oncologist and dependent on the location and size of your tumours. Up to 3 areas of disease can be irradiated at the same time. Regular follow up visits will be performed up to 12 months to monitor patient response and any toxicities experienced. CT scans will also be performed every 8 weeks to monitor response to treatment. </summary>
