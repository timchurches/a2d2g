  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Medications, drugs and devices have to be approved for use by the Australian Federal Government. Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine) is approved in Australia for HIV management in people who are HIV-positive.   Truvada has been recently approved by the FDA in the United States for PrEP in people who are HIV-negative, however it has not yet been approved in Australia for use as PrEP.
New HIV prevention strategies are necessary in Australia because HIV infection rates continue to rise. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), when given as a daily pill and coupled with the consistent use of condoms and regular checks for sexually transmitted infections including HIV, is effective in preventing HIV infection. Several overseas studies have shown that daily tenofovir, or daily Truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine) reduces HIV transmission by about 44% in men who have sex with men (MSM) and by about 70% in heterosexual people at risk of becoming HIV positive. There has been further evidence to show that in MSM who take their Truvada PrEP medication in the prescribed manner, that is one pill every day, that their risk of HIV infection is reduced by 96%. So taking PrEP every day according to the instructions along with using other HIV prevention measures like condoms and regular HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening is the best way to reduce your chances of becoming infected with HIV.
It is now important to examine the results of these PrEP clinical trials in the real world setting to show that PrEP is a feasible, safe and effective method for reducing the risk of HIV acquisition in the Queensland community. The QPrEP demonstration project will address this need.
