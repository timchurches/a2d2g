  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention for Group 1: Each yoga session consisted of 20 minutes of pranayamas (breath-control exercises), 25 minutes of dynamic warm-up exercises, 60 minutes of asanas (yogic postures), and 15 minutes of supine relaxation in savasana (corpse pose).  A single session last for 2 hours.  The Hatha yoga exercise sessions were conducted once per week for six months. Daily home exercise 3  4 times per week for 1 hour in the same Rate of Perceived Exertion was encouraged.

Intervention for Group 2: The conventional physical training sessions consisted of 15 minutes of warm up exercises, 30 minutes of aerobic walking on an outdoor 400-meter track, 20 minutes of body flexibility exercises, 20 minutes of aerobic dance, 25 minutes of games and 10 minutes of warm down exercises.  A single session last for 2 hours. The physical training exercise sessions were conducted once per week for six months. Daily home exercise 3  4 times per week for 1 hour in the same Rate of Perceived Exertion was encouraged.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The fasting blood glucose concentration for each group was determined by using the Reflolux S type 1172115 glucometers.  Total cholesterol, triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were determined by enzymatic methods.  High density lipoprotein was measured after precipitating very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the presence of magnesium ions.  The LDL fraction was calculated by the Friedwald formula.  
Changes in fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline to 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 3  and 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Malondialdehyde concentration in the serum was measured spectrophotometrically.  Protein oxidation is based on the detection of the carbonyl group that appears as a result of the oxidation of lateral chains of certain amino acids.  Plasma carbonyl group levels were evaluated following the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (2,4-DNP) assay.  The superoxide dismutase activity was determined by inhibition of pyrogallin and catalase activity was measured by ultraviolet method, based on the transformation of hydrogen peroxide.
Changes in Malondialdehyde, protein oxidation, super oxide and catalase activities from baseline to 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 3  and 6 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide health problem predisposing to markedly increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.  Lipid abnormalities significantly contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other morbidity in diabetics.  This study investigated the impact of Hatha yoga and conventional physical training exercise regimens on biochemical, oxidative stress indicators and oxidant status in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The study hypothesis is that Hatha yoga exercise as well as conventional physical training exercise has therapeutic preventative and protective effects on diabetes mellitus by decreasing blood glucose and oxidative stress, and improving antioxidant status.</summary>
