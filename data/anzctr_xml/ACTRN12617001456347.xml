  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Low personalisation group -  will receive access to a website tailored to women with a history of gestational diabetes. The materials on the 'Body Balance Beyond' website are predominantly self-directed and designed to promote modest weight loss through supporting participants to make a series of small changes to eating and exercise behaviours and form new healthy habits. Participants will have access to the site for 6 months and can accessed at their discretion. Website usage metrics will be captured using Google Analytics. 

The website contains five sections: 
a) Managing my risk - outlines the risk factors for developing diabetes in the future and actions which can reduce risk.
b) My Plan - participants will be emailed personalised feedback reports on dietary intake and physical activity (generated from the Australian Eating Survey and Godin activity questionnaires) in comparison to national nutrition and exercise guidelines.   This section guides participants through using their reports to set weight-, diet- and exercise-related goals, and strategies for self-monitoring and managing relapses.  
c) Eating - contains information and links to resources to promote healthy eating  (e.g. portion size, energy density, meal planning, label reading, recipes, breastfeeding).
d)  Physical Activity - contains information and links to resources to promote being more active (e.g. types of activity, benefits, suggestions for being active with a family, exercising safely).
e) Wellbeing - contains information and resources on social support, stress management and sleep.
 
2. High personalisation group - access to the Body Balance Beyond website (as described above). In addition, this group receives six video coaching sessions (20-30 mins duration each) with a dietitian (Weeks 2, 5 and 9) and exercise physiologist (Weeks 3, 6 and 10) over first 3 months. The video coaching comprises structured participant-centred coaching sessions to refine participant goals. During these sessions the dietitian and exercise physiologist will personalise strategies to overcome participant's self-identified factors affecting diet and exercise, in addition to review progress and revise goals, and problem solve barriers and revise strategies.  

Text message support is provided over the second 3 months. Three text messages per week will be sent with one consisting of reminders to self-monitor or reflect on goals and two personalised messages (one diet-related and one exercise-related).</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist control group required to not make any changes to their current diet or exercise or attempt to lose weight during the intervention phase. This groups will be provided with the high personalisation intervention at the end of the active intervention phase (6 months).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Once a woman with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) gives birth and her GDM resolves, Little attention is paid to her future risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Women with GDM have up to a 7 times greater risk of developing T2DM than women without GDM. Despite this increased risk, ongoing care or support programs tailored to the unique characteristics on this group are not currently available nor easily accessible. This study proposes to address this gap. We will evaluate the impact of a tailored, self-administered Internet program, with or without individualised video coaching to empower women with a history of GDM to improve their nutrition and physical activity behaviours and reduce their T2DM risk.
