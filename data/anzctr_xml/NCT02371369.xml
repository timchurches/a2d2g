             pathologist at the treating institution or a central pathologist, and (ii) where
             surgical resection would be associated with potentially worsening functional
             limitation or severe morbidity (locally advanced disease), with morbidity determined
             consensually by qualified personnel (eg, two surgeons or a multi-disciplinary tumor
             board).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 3 clinical study, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an
      investigational drug PLX3397 in the treatment of tumour of pigmented villonodular synovitis
      or giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath in subjects, for whom surgical removal of the tumour
      would cause more harm than good. The main purpose of this study is to gather information
      about the investigational drug PLX3397, which may help to treat these tumours.

      The study consists of two parts. In Part 1, eligible study participants will be assigned to
      receive either PLX3397 or matching placebo for 24 weeks. A number of assessments will be
      carried out during the course of the study, including physical examinations, blood tests,
      imaging studies, electrocardiograms, and questionnaires. MRI scans will be used to evaluate
      the response of the tumour to the treatment which will be independently assessed by central
      readers blinded to the treatment assignment. Those subjects, whether assigned to PLX3397 or
      matching placebo, who have completed Part 1 (i.e, complete 24 weeks of dosing and the Week 25
      assessments) will be eligible to advance to Part 2, a long-term treatment phase in which all
      subjects will receive open-label PLX3397</summary>
