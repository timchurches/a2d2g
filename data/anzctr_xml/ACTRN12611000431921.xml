  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise intervention. 
The intervention arm in addition to standard care will receive twice daily, aerobic, resistance and stretching exercises from day one post-operative until discharge home in a group environment supervised by a physiotherapist. This program will take about 30 minutes performed twice a day, every day until discharge home. 

Following discharge the intervention arm will be provided with a home based exercise program (30 minutes of walking, 10 minutes of stretches and 10 minutes of resistance exercises each day). 

Following the 2 week post-operative surgeon review, participants will participate in a twice weekly, 1 hour, supervised outpatient exercise program for eight weeks. 
This will consist of treadmill walking and stationary cycling (30 minutes total of walking and cycling performed at an intensity of "somewhat hard" rating), resistance exercises (individually prescribed to the participant including exercises such as resisted leg press, calf raises (with hand held weights), wall squats (with hand held weights), step ups (with hand held weights), chest press, seated row and triceps extension (with theraband)). The entire outpatient program included all exercises listed lasts for 1 hour performed twice a week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care physiotherapy following a clinical pathway and commencing the day after surgery. 
Participants will sit out of bed and mobilise at least 20 meters on the first day and at least 50 meters on the second day post-operative with assistance as required. Ambulation with the physiotherapist will no longer occur when the physiotherapist assesses that the participant will no longer benefit from specific physiotherapy intervention</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential eligible participants will be screened through thoracic surgery pre-admission clinic by a recruitment therapist. All recruited participants will need to provide written informed consent and undergo baseline outcome measurement prior to surgery. Simple randomisation will be undertaken using an off-site computer generated random number table and sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes prepared and maintained by personnel not involved in the study. For each consented participant, at 8am on the morning after surgery, the next consecutive envelope will be opened by personnel not involved in the study for group assignment and the unblinded intervention therapist will be notified of the allocation. Participants and outcomes assessors will be blinded to allocation throughout the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with lung cancer often feel short of breath and lack energy. Not surprisingly, people diagnosed with lung cancer tend to decrease the amount of activity and exercise they do. However promising new research shows that doing just the opposite can result in improved quality of life and fitness (which can contribute to survival). One way of increasing activity levels in a safe way is taking part in an exercise rehabilitation program, a 8-week program of group exercises led by a physiotherapist. This project is an initial, small scale trial of lung cancer patients participating in exercise rehabilitation after surgery to determine whether a larger scale trial is safe and feasible.</summary>
