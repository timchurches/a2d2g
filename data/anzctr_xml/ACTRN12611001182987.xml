    <interventions>The main object of the study is to compare the effects of i.v. administration of naloxone, methylnaltrexone and normal saline on ratings of dyspnoea during contant work rate treadmil exercise. 30 minutes prior to each test the participant will be administered 5mg of salbutamol in 2.5 of normal saline via a nebuliser. At visit 1( baseline) this test is for maximal incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET) according to the modified Balke protocol. This iCPET  may take up to 25 minutes depending on the participant's endurance but will  be ceased when the individuals perception of dyspnoea or leg fatigue prevents them from maintaining the required minimum speed. 
At the subsequent  4 weekly visits  a constant rate cardio pulmonary exercise test (cCPET) of optimal training intensity, 75%WRmax will be undertaken to exhaustion  with the aim that this will be at least 10 minutes of effort.
Throughout each exercise test and for 30 minutes after  stopping, the participant will be attached to a 12 lead cardiac safety monitor and their blood pressure will be recorded regularly. Ventilatory and metabolic measurements of exercise will be recorded using a portable gas exchange monitor (COSMED model) through which patients will breathe allowing physiologic and metabolic parameters to be recorded in real time.  A medical officer, 2-3 nurses and respiratory technician will be present throughout each visit and the tests will be performed in the cardiology department . 

Arm 1 -  once only dose of naloxone, 0.1mg/kg (10mg maximum) diluted to a standard volume, given intravenously 15 minutes a constant rate cardio pulmonary exercise test (cCPET) of optimal training intensity, 75%WRmax will be undertaken to exhaustion  with the aim that this will be at least 10 minutes of effort.
  
Arm 2 -once only dose methylnaltrexone,0.3mg/kg (30mg maximum)  diluted to a standard volume, given intravenously 15 minutes prior to a constant rate cardio pulmonary exercise test (cCPET) of optimal training intensity, 75%WRmax will be undertaken to exhaustion  with the aim that this will be at least 10 minutes of effort. 


There will be a 7 days wash out period  between each arm and the placebo.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to understand the role of endogenous opioids ( the body's own morphine-like chemicals)  in regulating breathlessness in people with Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease and to answer the question "Does blocking these endogenous opioids during exercise change the perseption of breathlessness.
Trial details
Participants with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Airways (COPD) disease, if eligible will be asked to attend the clinic up to 5 times over the study period and each visit will take about 2 hours. After a baseline exercise test on a treadmill participants will have 4 subsequent standardised treadmill exercise sessions.Each test will comprise of up to 15 minutes on the treadmill with the aim of walking as far as possilbe at a steady pace. Visits will be weeklyand a doctor and nurse will be present  at all times during the proceedure. Bloods will be taken on visit 3 to measure two chemicals that the body routinely makes- beta endorphin and adrenocorticotrophin.
30 minutes before each exercise test the participant will be administered 5mg of salbutamol through an inhaler.
On the 3th,4th and 5th exercise test participants will receive a double blind injection on different visits of each of saline, methylnaltrexone and naloxone, in a random ( by chance) order. 
  During the 15 minute exercise tests, participants will be asked to  record the intensity and unpleasantness of their breathlessness and how tired their legs feel, every minute  by means of a touch pad screen.
Throughout each  test and for 30 minutes after stopping the participant will be attached to cardiac monitor and their blood pressure will be monitored regularly.</summary>
