  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to test and evaluate a response-aiding strategy to facilitate recruitment for a randomised evaluation of an on-going education program (ACTRN12611000076976).

A cover letter advising GPs of an opportunity to participate in an education program and a form allowing GPs to register their interest in receiving further information about the program will be printed on either white or pale yellow paper.  The cover letter and form will be otherwise identical and will be sent to GPs via standard post, enclosed in an envelope identifying the sender as the University of New South Wales.

It is anticipated that all letters will be mailed on the same day.  We will assess outcomes eight weeks' from the date of the mail-out.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of GPs returning the form, either via reply paid mail  or, will be compared between groups. The numerator will be the number of forms returned. The denominator will be the number of GPs per group initially randomised into one of the two groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Eight weeks from the date of the mailout.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of GPs returning the form registering their interest to receive further information about the program will be compared between groups.  GPs whose mail was "returned to sender" will be removed from the denominator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Eight weeks from the date of the mailout.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of GPs enrolling in the education program will be compared between groups calculated by dividing the number of GPs randomised per group by the number of GPs returning a signed consent form to participate in the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Eight weeks from the date of the mailout.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of GPs returning the form registering their interest to receive further information or who have contacted research staff to indicate they have "retired", or are "to be retired within the next 9 months", or are currently or due to be on extended leave (ie maternity or sick leave or recreation leave for more than two months) or whose relatives/practice staff notify research staff of a GP's retirment, extended leave or death.</outcome>

    <concealment>Contact details of GPs, known to be in active practice, will be randomly selected from a national data-base of clinicians.  These GPs will be contacted by mail and will be invited to register their interest in receiving further information for an ongoing study evaluating an education program (ACTRN12611000076976).   This study is therefore a trial of a response-aiding strategy to increase GP registrations to receive further information about the education program, registered as (ACTRN12611000076976).

Contact details of GPs have been forwarded to a statistician, not otherwise part of the research team, to randomly allocate GPs to receive the cover letter and registration form printed on either white or yellow paper.  

This file will then be forwarded to AMPCO who will be outsourcing the mail-out on behalf of the researchers.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each randomly selected GP will be randomly assigned a unique ID code and ordered by this random ID number.  Simple randomisation, whereby each GP has a 50/50 probability of being allocated into one of two groups will be  carried out using SAS.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to approach 2,500 randomly selected GPs. GPs will receive a cover letter and form advising GPs return the form indicating their interest in receiving further information about an ongoing education program.  We propose that half are randomised to receive the cover letter and form printed on white paper and half receive the cover letter and form printed on yellow paper.  Based on results of a Cochrane systematic review, some studies evaluating the effect of yellow versus white paper indicate improved response amongst non-clinician samples.  We wish to trial this easily administered and cheap response-aiding strategy in a clinician sample.
