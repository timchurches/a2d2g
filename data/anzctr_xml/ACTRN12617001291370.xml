  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will receive ultrasonic debridement on their wound weekly for six weeks in a specified specialist wound clinic in the University Health Clinics. The ultrasonic procedure involves the use of a low-frequency ultrasound machine using the Sonoca 185 by Soring. This machine operates at 25kHz and is applied for 20 seconds per 1 cm2 of tissue to attain adequate bacterial kill, at 60-80% intensity, or at 40% and double the time. The use of LMX4 topical anaesthetic cream can be used prior to debridement if required to minimise discomfort. 
A wound swab will be taken prior to debridement, post debridement, and, post antiseptic soak (if in the intervention group). A small piece of tissue scraping can be taken during debridement treatment if able, at week 1, 3, 6 &amp; 12 as well as the wound swab culture.
Those in the intervention group will receive the application of antiseptic PHMB post ultrasonic debridement and in a sustained primary dressing. The antiseptic solution Prontosan contains the active ingredient PHMB and is applied as per the manufacturer guidelines for 15 mins in a soaked sterile gauze square. The dressing product that contains PHMB will be left on the wound until next dressing change. Frequency of dressing change will be determined by exudate amount. Those that require dressing changes between weekly clinic visits will require strict adherence to the regime of the Prontosan soak and continual application of the PHMB dressing product, if in the intervention group.
The debridement therapy will be performed by the Chief investigator/Clinician/Registered Nurse or the Podiatrist in the Wound Clinic who has been trained with the ultrasonic device and debridement techniques. The Registered Nurse has up to 3 years experience with this debridement method and 17 years as a Registered Nurse working with chronic wounds. 
The participants will be followed weekly for a further six weeks post the six weeks of ultrasonic therapy, with either the antiseptic solution and medicated dressing product with PHMB, or if in the control group, a non-medicated dressing, for a total of 12 weeks. 

To assess intervention fidelity, the participant and carer (if applicable) must first understand the importance of adhering to the particular regime and agree to attend weekly clinic visits for 12 weeks. Carers or nurses who will attend to the dressings during the week will be advised and provided with a clear written plan of the dressing trial regime and the importance of adherence. The main clinician in the clinic will ask the participant each week if the correct product was applied and check during the participant's visit. The contact details for the clinician is supplied to the participant, carer and nurses if any queries arise about the trial between clinic visits. Any violation in the protocol will involve cessation of the trial for that participant, When the participant cannot attend a weekly visit due to illness or other event, nine out of 12 visits will be considered acceptable, and will not result in cessation of the trial for that participant. All data will be included, using the intention to treat policy, 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive the same treatment with the weekly LFUD for six weeks, but will not receive any PHMB antiseptic solution as a soak or cleanser, and will have a non-medicated dressing, similar to the PHMB dressing, but with no antimicrobial action on their wound. i.e., the only difference is the use of the PHMB in the intervention group with the cleanser, soak, and impregnated PHMB foam dressing. </comparator>

It was determined that in order to achieve 90% power with an alpha of 5% 23 participants will be required for each group. Allowing for drop outs a total of 50 participants is anticipated to be enrolled into the study,  This number was also based on current clinic patient numbers and days of operation in the clinic. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to determine the effectiveness of one dressing product over another on bacterial levels/counts and wound healing outcomes in a controlled clinical trial that includes the use of ultrasonic debridement therapy for adults with chronic wounds.  

Chronic wounds place an enormous burden on the individual and the health care system. it is well known that individuals with non-healing wounds suffer from a reduced quality of life, experience pain, anxiety, report a financial strain, and attend frequent medical appointments. They often require antibiotics and have an increased risk of infection and further complications. There are a wide variety of dressing products available these days, all of which aim to assist the healing process. One way to assess the effectiveness of one product over another is within a clinical trial. This type of investigation can provide information to help the researcher determine how wound products perform at a cellular level. 

This clinical trial will involve participants being randomly assigned to receive one of two different regimes to find out which one works best. Each participant will receive ultrasonic therapy weekly for six weeks, after that a particular dressing product will continue for a further six weeks, totaling 12 weeks or upon healing. It is hypothesised that the application of ultrasound therapy will assist with reducing the bacterial burden that is common in chronic wounds and furthermore the application of dressing products with antiseptics in combination with the ultrasound are thought to further assist with preventing bacterial burden reformation and promote wound healing. This study aims to assess this hypothesis. </summary>
