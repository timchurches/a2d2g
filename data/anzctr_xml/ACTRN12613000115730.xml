  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will include 6 x 1 hour  face to face counselling and education sessions with an Occupational Therapist that will be focussed on assisting participants to develop and follow through on their own lifestyle goals through use of the 12 weeks to a Healthier Life planner (Swap it dont Stop it, Australian Government, 2011). 

The number and frequency of sessions with the Occupational Therapists will be reduced over the 12 week program (6 visits in total). However, participants will also receive weekly phone calls and daily texts to remind them to wear their pedometers and monitor their 'step' goals. 

Clinicians and NGO support workers will work alongside consumers in between each session wit the Occupational Therapist to follow through on strategies identified.
	
Physical activity goals will focus on: 1) replacing sedentary leisure activities with more active leisure activities and 2) performing more incidental and structured physical activity like walking during every day activities.

Dietary goals will focus on 1) replacing the intake of foods high in saturated fat, added sugar, sodium and alcohol with healthier lower energy options and 2) providing guidance on appropriate quantities of each food group based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. 

Strategies will be individualised and although primarily home based may include referrals to established group exercise programs and or sessions with a dietician. Group education sessions will be run for clinical staff and NGO support workers to ensure long term support for participants in lifestyle goals.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary intake and eating patterns will be through a validated Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies (formally Food Frequency Questionnaire) from the Cancer Council Victoria.  Qualitative assessment of change in dietary behaviour will be analysed based on comparison to the food groups from the revised Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometric Measures:  

Including height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body composition (fat mass and fat free mass) (using air displacement plethysmography [the BOD POD] 

The BOD POD body composition test measures body density and calculates fat and fat-free mass very accurately. It has a fast test time (2 minutes inside BOD POD and about 5 minutes total test time) and it is safe, non-invasive, and ideally suited for frequent testing. For this test participants will be required to wear a pair of swimming trunks and cap to compress hair and skin for the most accurate measurements. It involves sitting for two minutes in a small chamber with a Perspex window allowing you to easily see outside. The unit has an internal emergency button that participants can press to deactivate the chamber door if need be. 

The machine is also in a secure, private room and one of the researchers will be operating the machine during the test at all times. Participants will be supported by Extended Care Team Clinicians to attend the University to have these measures done. 

As food and fluid intake can make a difference to body weight, and hydration status impacts on the BODPOD, the BOD POD assessment will be done within the first hour of waking and before the participant has breakfast.

For the surface anthropometry, participants will have eight skinfolds measurements taken with steel calipers in duplicate by a highly qualified anthropometrist. This procedure involves a double skinfold of skin lifted before the calipers are applied and the measurement taken. This process is quick and painless but some minor discomfort may be felt as the caliper branches are applied. The ultrasound device will measure body fat at the same sites as the surface anthropometry calipers. A hand held probe will measure the depth of surface fat at the same eight skinfold sites.  This is painless, quick and non-invasive.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At commencement and 12 weeks.
Copies of participants standard metabolic monitoring forms will be collected a further 3 months after the program to monitor longer term weight changes and BMI.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) will be used to measure changes in Excercise Behaviours. Physical activity will also be objectively assessed using a record of daily steps using a pedometer from both targeted exercise and incidental activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At commencement and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> The self-efficacy for exercise scale (SEE) is a 13-item instrument listing common reasons for preventing participation in exercise. The scale has previously been tested for reliability and validity, with exercise self efficacy found to be significantly correlated to future participation in exercise.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At commencement and 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical Fitness will be assessment using the 6 minute walk test (6MWT). The 6 minute walk test (6MWT) provides a simple and valid indicator of patient functional capacity that has been associated with better QOL and disease prognosis.  No encouragement will be given to the participants during the walking test so to maximise its reliability. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At commencement and 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The COPM is an outcome measure that is used to detect change in a participants perception of occupational performance over time. This tool will be administered via 30 minute semi-structured interview (pre and post intervention) and the participant will be asked to identify any activities that are difficult to perform across the areas of self-care, work and leisure. The COPM is standardised and has excellent validity and reliability, and has been found to be responsive to clinically important change. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At commencement and 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Mental Health Inventory is a measure that is standard practice and a measure of general psychological distress and well-being. The MHI contains 38 items and summary scores derived from it include a global Mental Health Index score, psychological distress and wellbeing scores and six sub-scale scores representing anxiety, depression, loss of behavioural or emotional control, general positive affect, emotional ties and life satisfaction.   </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the proposed study is to determine whether a home-based individually tailored education program has a positive effect on 1) dietary and exercise behaviours and 2) anthropometric measures (weight, Body Mass Index, body composition) of people with severe and enduring mental health issues who live in a CCU. If successful, the outcome of this project is the potential to improve the quality of life and long term physical health prognosis of not just the participants in this study and but also to improve  usual care procedures for people with severe and enduring mental health conditions.

It is hypothesised that the individuals with severe and enduring mental health issues that participate in a home-based exercise/nutrition education program will exhibit improved dietary and exercise behaviours at six months compared to their usual care.
