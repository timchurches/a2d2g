  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as time from randomisation to disease progression or death whichever occurs first. Assessed by investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1).
Only data collected until the cut-off date for RECIST 1.1 based endpoints (08Jun2013) were considered.
Progression of disease was determined if at least 1 of the following criteria applied:
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters (SoD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest SoD recorded since the treatment started, together with an absolute increase in the SoD of at least 5 mm
Appearance of 1 or more new lesions
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until disease progression, death or data cut-off (08Jun2013); Up to 34 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response (OR) - OR is defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Assessed by investigator according to RECIST 1.1.
Only data collected until the cut-off date 08Jun2013 were considered. Complete Response (CR) for target lesions (TL): Disappearance of all target lesions.
Complete Response (CR) for non-target lesions (NTL): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumour marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis)
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Other factors which add to the overall response of an imaging timepoint as PR are as below:-
CR in TL, but non-CR/Non-PD in NTL leads to PR
CR in TL, but not evaluated NTL leads to PR
PR in TL, but non-PD NTL or not all evaluated NTL leads to PR</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and then every 12 weeks (Up to 34 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best RECIST Assessment - Best RECIST assessment is defined as CR, PR, stable disease (SD), PD or not evaluable by investigator (RECIST version 1.1).
CR for target lesions (TL): Disappearance of all target lesions.
CR for non-target lesions (NTL): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumour marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10mm short axis).
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as references the smallest SoD while on study.
PD: At least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Also, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of a least 5mm. Appearance of one or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post baseline tumour-imaging was performed at Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and then every 12 weeks (Data collected until cut-off date 08Jun2013; Up to 34 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS is defined as time from randomisation to death irrespective of the cause of the death.
For patients who had not died up to the cut-off date (03Sep2013), the date they were last known to be alive was derived from the patient status records, the trial completion record, radiological imaging assessments, the study treatment termination record, and the randomisation date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomisation to data cut-off (03Sep2013); Up to 37 months.</timepoint>
