    <summary>This study will follow-up drivers who have a diagnosis of dementia for a period of 2 years - which is the period after diagnosis in which many people with dementia stop driving.  The primary objective is to identify the factors which are associated with participants deciding to give up driving and also to record how both the participant and the carers feel about the changes in the participants driving over the two year period following a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimers disease.   </summary>
