  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients will be included if they:

          1. Have a DSM-IV diagnosis of a major depressive episode (SCID 11).

          2. Aged 18-85.

          3. Have treatment resistant depression at Stage II of the Thase and Rush classification
             [31]; .e. have failed to achieve a clinical response, or did not tolerate, at least
             two separate antidepressant trials of sufficient dose for at least 6 weeks.

          4. Have a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score of &gt; 20 (moderate - severe depression).
             Including only a severely ill group of subjects limits the placebo response rate [32].
             Moreover, this will allow us to address the application of rTMS methods in the most
             clinically relevant subgroup of patients (in addition helping to constrain group
             heterogeneity, a major issue in depression research).

          5. Have had no increase or initiation of new antidepressant (or other psychoactive)
             therapy in the 4 weeks prior to screening.</inclusivecriteria>

             of a seizure disorder or are currently pregnant or lactating.

          2. In the opinion of the investigator, are a sufficient suicidal risk to require
             immediate electro-convulsive therapy.

          3. Have a current DSM IV diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence disorder, a diagnosis
             of a personality disorder (SCID II) or another axis 1 disorder.

        Please note: several of these criteria (e.g. inclusion criteria 1 &amp; 2, exclusion criteria
        3) have been selected to explicitly constrain the heterogeneity of the sample to increase
        the likely power of the study to detect differences between the groups given the
        potentially subtle difference between the treatment methods.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main treatment option for Treatment Resistant Depression is electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT) which is often effective but complicated by cognitive side effects, need for
      anaesthesia and considerable stigma.

      In recent years considerable efforts have been made to increase public awareness about
      depression and increase access to services. However, the increasing number of patients
      accessing treatment for depression in clinical services is also likely to be accompanied by a
      sizeable increase in the number of patients with TRD. Despite the demand, relatively few
      treatment options are available to such patients. One of the only substantially new
      treatments developed for TRD in recent years has been the advent of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Repetitive TMS has been evaluated in over 20 trials conducted
      over the last 10 years. Previous research indicates that rTMS has antidepressant activity;
      however, the proportion of patients who respond to rTMS and the degree of treatment response
      demonstrated in trials to date is limited. The limitations of these studies include
      relatively small samples and limited duration of treatment (i.e., 2 weeks) as well as a lack
      of long term follow-up. As rTMS is gradually entering use in routine clinical practice (for
      example, recent regulation of its use in Canada), research is urgently required to establish
      ways to enhance treatment response both in regards to the extent of response within
      individuals and the proportion of individuals in whom rTMS has effects.

      Stimulation site is another important treatment factor; thus far almost all of the trials of
      rTMS in TRD conducted have evaluated the utility of high frequency left prefrontal cortex
      (PFC) rTMS (HFL-TMS). In addition, several studies have evaluated the treatment efficacy of
      low frequency rTMS to right PFC (LFR-TMS). In a previously published study we have
      demonstrated that these two approaches have similar therapeutic benefit and both were
      superior to sham stimulation.

      A promising new approach to enhance efficacy involves combining LFR-TMS and HFL-TMS in a
      sequential manner. We describe this as sequential bilateral rTMS (SB-rTMS). We have recently
      published the results of the first substantial evaluation of SB-rTMS showing not only a
      superiority to placebo in TRD but also a therapeutic response that is substantially superior
      to response rates in most of the published studies of unilateral rTMS (&gt;50% of patients
      achieving standard criteria for clinical response compared to usually &lt;30% in most studies).
      In this proposed research study, we will directly test the hypothesis that SB-rTMS produces a
      greater therapeutic response than HFL-TMS and compare both of these forms of stimulation to
      placebo (i.e., sham) stimulation.</summary>
