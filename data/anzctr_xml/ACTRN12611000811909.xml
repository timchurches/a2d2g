    <studytitle>An evaluation of the drug interaction potential of extended-release felodipine in healthy volunteers, using a cocktail approach</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>An investigation of the proportional change in area under the concentration-time curves for five orally administered CYP P450 probes (caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan, midazolam) and one Pgp probe (digoxin) when administered with and without steady-state oral felodipine, in twelve healthy adult volunteers.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Simultaenous administration of single doses of six drugs (caffeine 100mg, losartan 25mg, omperazole 20mg, dextromethorphan 30mg, midazolam 2mg, digoxin 250mcg) on two occasions a week apart. These drugs will be administered orally (as tablets - caffeine, losartan, omeprazole, digoxin; as solutions diluted in water - midazolam, dextromethorphan) with water. Administration of felodipine extended-release 10mg daily, commencing the day after the first administration of the six drug panel and continuing until the time of second administration of the panel. The felodipine will be given as tablets with water.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Probe drug concentrations at various times after administration. Blood will be sampled at the following times - 0h, 0.25h, 05h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 10h and 24h. Plasma drug concentrations will be determined using LC-MS. Clinical assessment and monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure will be used to monitor safety on the days when the six drug combination is given.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>All participants receive the same drugs at the same point in time according to the protocol. There are two phases to the study which occur sequentially. The AUC for each probe drug is determined without felodipine (in phase 1) and then with felodipine (in phase 2). The phase 1 and phase 2 AUCs are compared for each subject and also as a group. This is standard for this type of drug interaction study.</designfeatures>
