  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Clinician-assisted Internet based education for GAD, or; 2) Wait-list control. All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for GAD. All education group participants will complete 6 lessons of Internet based education about management of symptoms of GAD. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Education group participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, will contribute to an online forum moderated by a clinical psychologist, and will receive weekly emails from the clinical psychologist. The duration of the program is 8 weeks, but participants will be contacted 3 months post program and asked to complete follow-up questionnaires. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-education, post-education, and at 3-months post-education. These will take about 20 minutes to complete. The educational materials are based on cognitive behavioural techniques.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a research program examining the efficacy of Internet based education and treatment programs for people with common mental disorders. This project compares the effectiveness of clinician-assisted Internet-based education for GAD vs. waitlist control at reducing the severity of symptoms of GAD. We expect that people who participate in the education program will report more benefit than participants in the waitlist control group.</summary>
