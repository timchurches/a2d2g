  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with HNC and their caregivers will be randomly assigned to receive either standard care plus a selfregulation
intervention or to standard care alone. 
Prior to randomization, after the intervention (3 months), and again 6 months after diagnosis, all patients and caregivers will complete assessments of coping, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. Patients will also complete a health related quality of life questionnaire. 
Those randomized to the self-regulation intervention will participate in three 45minute sessions and a 30minute telephone call, over the space of three months. The sessions will be conducted by a health psychologist and will take place at Auckland Hospital, or in patients homes if necessary. The sessions will be standardised, individually delivered, and individually tailored. Session one will be before treatment, session two during treatment, and session three will be near the end of treatment. The telephone call will take place one month later. The sessions will address patients and caregivers illness perceptions, including causal beliefs, provide education about cancer and treatment, and discuss and normalise concerns. Coping techniques will be taught, including relaxation skills and selfcare. A personal action plan will be developed, with coping strategies and plans for when and where to implement these. Concerns about the future will be covered and referrals to ongoing support will be made if necessary.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment- This involves care from a multidisciplinary team (MDT) at Auckland City Hospital, who are well trained to deal with any issues in head and neck cancer. Members of the MDT include head and neck surgeons, a plastic surgeon, a radiation oncologist, a medical oncologist, an oral medicine specialist, a radiologist, a histopathologist, head and neck nurse specialists, a speech and language therapist, a dietician, and a social worker. 
For this study, standard treatment is defined as standard information and care from the Auckland City Hospital Head and Neck Multidisciplinary team.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using SPSS. Analysis of covariance will be carried out to compare change scores between HNC patients and caregivers in the intervention and standard care groups with respect to outcomes of HRQL, depression, and anxiety (while controlling for baseline measurements).

The AFTER intervention trial found an effect size of d=.7 for reducing anxious pre-occupation in patients with HNC(Humphris &amp; Rogers, 2012). Setting power of 0.80, and an alpha of .05, G-power software  indicates that a total sample of 68 participants would be needed to detect this effect. Since not all patients will have caregivers who can participate, we will aim to recruit a total of 100 patients and 70 caregivers, to give us sufficient power to detect an effect of this size.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether a self-regulation intervention can improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC).

The folllowing hypotheses will be tested:
- A self-regulation intervention will lead to better HRQL, and lower depression and anxiety, in patients with HNC.
- The intervention will lower depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress in the family caregivers of patients with HNC.
- The intervention will cause adaptive changes in illness perceptions and coping strategies in both patients with HNC and their caregivers
- Changes will be maintained over time (three months after the intervention).
- Changes in illness perceptions and coping strategies will be associated with improvements in quality of life and reductions in depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress.</summary>
