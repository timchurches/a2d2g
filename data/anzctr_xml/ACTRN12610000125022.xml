  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) Patients treated with telmisartan-based therapy were first treated with 20mg/day of telmisartan for 4 weeks. If after this time the target BP was not attained it was then subsequently increased up to a maximum dose of 80 mg/day until the target BP was attained.  Additional antihypertensive agents other than renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors were added unless the blood pressure (BP) fell below the target BP.
b) the duration is 1 year. 
c) the mode of administration is oral capsule.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients treated with calcium channel blockers (CCB)-based therapy (control group) were first treated with 20 mg/day of nifedipine, 2.5 mg/day of amlodipine, 5 mg/day of cilnidipine, or 2 mg/day of benidipine, and the doses of the CCBs were subsequently increased until the target BP was attained (up to 60 mg/day of nifedipine, 10 mg/day of amlodipine, 20 mg/day of cilnidipine, and 8 mg/day of benidipine).  If the target BP was not achieved, additional antihypertensive medications other than telmisartan were added.
b) the duration is 1 year.
c) the mode of administration is oral capsule.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arterial stiffness is an independent prognostic predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  This study was conducted to determine the effect of telmisartan on the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), a novel blood pressure (BP)-independent marker for arterial stiffness in hypertensive patients.</summary>
