  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, controlled, cross-over designed trial will be performed to investigate the short-term effects of regular consumption of lupin-containing food (bread, breakfast cereral, pasta and crumbs) on glycaemic control (primary outcome), blood pressure, attention and working memory in type 2 diabetic individuals. A study coordinator and research nurse with experience in the conduct of similar nutrition intervention studies will be responsible for the conduct of the study. 

Participants will be randomly assigned with the use of computer-generated random numbers to 1 of 2 groups: control then lupin or lupin then control. Both lupin and control participants will be required to replace ~1520% of their usual daily energy intake from wheat-based products, with either control or lupin foods, for 8 weeks each. The two 8-week intervention periods will be separated by an 8-week washout period where participants return to their usual diet. Throughout the entire study period alcohol intake, physical activity and medication will be maintained as usual. 

The food, for both the lupin and control foods will be provided. Compliance to diets will be monitored using questionnaires and return of unused foods at biweekly study visits. With the inclusion of several lupin enriched foods and matching control foods, there will be only minor changes to the make-up of the diet (the types of foods consumed). </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Home-measured blood glucose concentrations </outcome>
      <timepoint>All participants will be provided with their own home blood glucose monitor. The home blood glucose monitoring will be performed 4 times per day, on 3 days per week (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) over each 8 week intervention period of the study. The times of day for measuring blood glucose are as specified: fasting upon waking; 1 h post breakfast; immediately before lunch; and 1 h after lunch. In addition, self-monitoring of blood glucose will be performed in the week leading up to each 8-week intervention period (baseline).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Home-monitored blood pressure</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be provided with home blood pressure monitors to measure their blood pressure on 3 days per week (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) during each 8 week intervention period of the study. Participants will measure their blood pressure twice daily on the same days they are required to measure their blood glucose. The first set of readings will be taken approximately 30 mins after waking, but before breakfast. The second set of readings will be taken at the end of the day, just prior to going to bed. Participants will be seated alone in a quiet room where possible. They will then perform 5 blood pressure measurements over a 5 minute period. The first measurement will not be used for analysis. To minimize bias all blood pressure measurements will be stored by the home blood pressure monitor, then downloaded by the study coordinator at biweekly visits. In addition, blood pressure measurements will be performed in the week leading up to the start of each 8-week intervention period (baseline).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting blood measures of glycated haemoglobin, glucose, insulin (and HOMA-IR score calculated from the fasting glucose and insulin)</outcome>
      <timepoint>All these measurements will be performed at week 0, 4, 8, 16, 20 and 24.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulse wave velocity measured using the Sphygmocor (AtCor Medical). </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive function testing to assess the cognitive domains of attention and working memory </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed using the Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System (COMPASS) battery at week 0, 8, 16 and 24.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bowel function assessed by a questionnaire designed for this study that gathers information about bowel health symptoms </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Men and women 40 to 70 years old with moderate to well-controlled type 2 diabetes (glycated Hb &lt; 9%) will be recruited from the general population. The diagnosis of diabetes will be confirmed by either a fasting serum glucose &gt;7 mmol/l, the participants registration with the National Diabetes Services Scheme (which requires a medical diagnosis of diabetes), use of metformin, or confirmation from the participants general practitioner (with a review of relevant clinical data).

The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and the code will be recorded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diet and lifestyle change are key elements of the management of blood sugar levels and blood pressure in those with type 2 diabetes. There is growing evidence that foods containing lupin could make a positive contribution to management of diabetes. Lupin can be used as a novel food ingredient. It is rich in protein and fibre and contains negligible sugar and starch (glycaemic carbohydrate). It can be incorporated into foods such as bread to reduce the glycaemic (blood sugar raising) carbohydrate. We will conduct an intervention study in type 2 diabetic subjects to investigate the effects of regular consumption of lupin-containing foods on short-term control of blood sugar levels, blood pressure and attention and memory.</summary>
