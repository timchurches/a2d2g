  <interventions>
    <interventions>The phonics based reading treatment will train parsing, letter-sound rules, and blending. These skills will be trained using an online reading program and thus, children will complete their reading training at home on their home computers under parental supervision. Children will train for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 3 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study uses a double-baseline control. At the start of the study each child completes the reading and language tests (Test 1). After 8 weeks of NO treatment, they are re-tested on the same tests (Test 2). We then subtract their scores at Test 1 from Test 2 to reveal their test-retest effects on each test. We then subtract these test-retest effects from each child's subsequent improvements on the tests (i.e., at Test 3 after 3 weeks of training, at Test 4 after another 3 weeks of training, at Test 5 after another 3 weeks of training and lastly at Test 6 after the last 3 weeks of additional training). This allows us to determine how much each child improved due to training alone (i.e., excluding test-retest effects).</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phonological recoding subskills (letter identfication, parsing, letter-sound conversion, blending). 
1) Letter identification and parsing will be assessed using paper and pencil tests. 
2) Letter-sound conversion will be assessed using flashcards. The child will be asked to name the letter-sound when shown a flashcard with a letter on it.
3) Blending will be assessed using auditory blending task (similar to the blending task in the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP).</outcome>

    <concealment>Children are screened for their reading accuracy for nonwords and irregular words. If they fall below the average range on nonword reading but within or above the average range on irregular word reading they fit the criteria for the study. There is only one treatment group so no allocation will be required and all participants act as their own control (double-baseline).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This PhD project investigates a phonics based treatment program for Australian children who have severe problems learning to read (developmental dyslexia). In particular these children have difficulty learning to 'sound-out' word and thus have poor phonics skills (phonological dyslexia). The treatment will focus on improving phonics skills (i.e., parsing, letter-sound correspondences, and blending) in these children (50 children). The results of this reading treatment trial will aid Australia's efforts to developing effective treatments of dyslexia.</summary>
