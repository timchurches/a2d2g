  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interactive neurostimulation will be applied using the InterX 5002 device, to the skin anterior to the surgical incision, inferior to the surgical incision and the buttock area. Using a minimal intensity of stimulation, the area will be scanned to identify the area with lowest impedance. At this location, the device will be held stationary and the intensity will be increased until the patient feels a strong but comfortable sensation. The interactive neurostimulation will be administered once a day, in the morning for the five days following the participants total hip replacement, or until discharged. Each session will be 20-30 mins, determined when the device registers an adequate change in impedance level."</interventions>
    <comparator>Interactive Neurostimulation (INS) sham device  The sham group will receive the same treatment protocol using an InterX 5002 sham device, which has an identical appearance to the active device with lights, buzzing and beeps, but does not deliver INS. Participants will be administered the sham treatment once a day in the morning on the five days following total hip replacement or until discharged. Each session will be 20-30 mins.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine the effectiveness of an electrotherapy device called Interactive Neurostimulation (INS), in providing pain relief following a total hip replacement. 

Outcome measures are pain scores, length of hospital stay, analgesic use and/or increase range of movement in the acute period following a total hip replacement.

The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in each variable between the active INS and sham groups five days after surgery.

The research hypothesis is that there will be a difference in each variable between the active INS and sham groups five days after surgery.</summary>
