  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group receives a one off Quitline telephone counselling intervention (using behavioural techniques) and the provision of Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for a period of 8 weeks and the control group receive a one off Quitline counselling intervention only. The duration of the Quitline intervention varies from person to person. The NRT (patches) dose will vary according to the needs of the participants as assessed by the Nurse Practitioner . The needs will  depend upon how many cigarettes the patients smoke per day. Those smoking &gt; 15 cigarettes will receive 21 mg for 4 weeks then 14 mg for 2 weeks and 7 mgs for 2 weeks. Gum will also be given to the intervention group and again will be given to the participants according to their needs. Those smoking &gt;15 cigarettes per day will receive 4mg gum and those smoking &lt;15 will receive 2mg /day.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The Nurse practitioner will recruit potential participants for the study. The participants will be given an information and consent form and after signing the consent form they  will be randomised using random numbers sequence and stratified according to number of cigarettes smoked eg &gt;15 per day and &lt;15 per day. The chief investigator is responsible forthe randomisation and stratification. This person is not associated with either the patients or the data collection and data input process.


Only the chief researcher (not associated with the patients will be responsible for the randomisation and allocation of participants.  The participants and the nurse practitioner responsible for the Quitline referral and giving of Nicotine replacement therapy will be aware of who is in the treatment group. The research assistant responsible for data collection and who will give and take the questionnaires will not be aware of the allocation to intervention or control.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random digits were generated using a randomisation table from a statistics book. A person (statistician) not involved with the study generated the numbers. Seperate numbers were generated  for lighter smokers &lt; 15 cigarettes per day and heavier smokers &gt;15 cigarettes  per day.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The majority of smokers want to quit and support and advice from registered nurses has been proven effective (Rice et al., 2008) . Current literature reports that smokers with chronic hepatitis C have a higher risk of having poor health outcomes such as developing Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and they may also be at higher risk of having a lowered immune response . It is therefore recommended they should be advised to stop smoking before commencing on interferon based treatment (El-Zayadi 2004). This study aims to identify the effectiveness of  evidence based smoking interventions (Quitline counselling intervention and Nicotine Replacement Therapy) which may have an impact on helping smokers quit and which may improve health outcomes for people who attend the RBWH for management of their chronic hepatitis C.  This will be undertaken by conducting a randomised controlled trial of this high risk group of people. The results will inform the Nurse Practitioner for Hepatology, health services and policy makers of interventions which can be used to help smokers in this high risk group quit or reduce the amount of cigarettes they smoke and hence assist with better treatment outcomes for people with chronic hepatitis C.</summary>
