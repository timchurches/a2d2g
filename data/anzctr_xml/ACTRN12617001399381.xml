    <interventions>Participants are to be randomized into 2 treatment groups with sequences composed of 2 sets of 3 administrations (number 1-3 and 4-6), with each set comprising of fentanyl 5 microgram/puff, and placebo- an inactive drug.  Patients in group 1 receive fentanyl in bottles 1-3 and placebo in bottles 4-6. Patients in group 2 receive placebo in bottles 1-3 and fentanyl in bottles 4-6. Patients are instructed to treat 6 episodes of acute shortness of breath using the order the spray bottles are ordered and they are to record their response at set interval.  If symptom persists after 15 minutes, they are to take their usual rescue medication.  Results are then analyzed to determine efficacy and any adverse effects of the treatment. Intra-nasal fentanyl, 5mcg/puff, 2 puffs are administered into each nostril = total dose of 20mcg for each breathlessness episode.  This can be repeated upto hourly. The number of episodes to be treated is six episodes per patient.  This is based on pharmacokinetic study that shows therapeutic concentration is achieved within 2 minutes and elimination half -lives are found to be 29.8 and 31.2 minutes for solution pH of 6 and 8 respectively. (Lim, Sunderland et al 2003). Based on the above mentioned half-lives, the wash out period between fentanyl and placebo is 60 minutes.
Adherence is based on what is reported by patients using study questionnaires that record study drug use. The questionnaires are collected and checked with patients at the final study visit.
 it is expected six breathlessness episodes are very readily achievable over 24 hours to 7 day period in hospice patients who have high symptom burden.

      <outcome>Adverse events are recorded by patients on "episodes' questionnaires" and by investigator during initial and final visits on specified final visit questionnaires and initial visit recording sheets.  Each adverse event is also to be recorded by investigator on subjects' adverse event log. These events are tallied as part of data analysis. All questionnaires are designed specifically for this study.
Previous studies using much higher dosage of intra-nasal fentanyl (50-200mcg per dose) showed the following possible side effects: Nausea, Constipation, vertigo, respiratory depression, nasal symptoms (stinging, itchy), changes in mental status. Of note, there was no respiratory depression observed below a dosage of 100mcg.  Enrolled subjects (after giving consent) are assessed for respiratory depression at initial visits by site PIs. Remaining side effects are listed in "episode questionnaires" which patients are required to fill out for each episode of breathlessness after administration of study drug and the final visit questionnaire.

    <statisticalmethods>Since this is a feasibility study, one could estimate the sample size for this study by taking a percentage of sample size for a phase 3 study designed in a similar way but with an intention to answer the research question definitively. (Abernathy, Currow  et al 2003) This can be done by using effect size of another study that examined a related medication  oral morphine on a similar population for the relief of refractory dyspnoea. The effect size is calculated to be 0.408, mean VAS-D (SD): morphine 40.3 (23), placebo 49.9 (24). Using a of 0.05 and ร of 0.2, and paired sample t-test, the sample size (total number of episodes) in each arm is calculated to be 50. As each patient receives both placebo and treatment, the total number of patients required is 50. As each participant is expected to treat 6 episodes of breathlessness, the number of participants = (50x2) รท6 = 17 patients.
Based on the same study mentioned above, an estimated drop-out rate of 20% is to be factored into the final sample size calculation = 17*1.2 = 20.4 patients. i.e. a sample size of 20 patients for this study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effect of fentanyl applied intra-nasally for the management of shortness of breath in patients with advanced non- malignant disease when their symptoms have become less responsive to treatment of the underlying disease. Intranasal fentanyl is already widely used for the treatment of pain in clinical practice and therefore their side effects are well known. The dosage used in this study is much lower than what is normally used for pain, therefore the risk of adverse events is expected to be lower than expected. Eligible patients enrolled in the hospice programme are invited to participate. </summary>
