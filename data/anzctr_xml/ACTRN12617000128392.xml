  <interventions>
    <interventions>A trained periodontist and a periodontics registrar will undertake the procedures and examination. Both have a Bachelor of Dental Surgery and one holds a Masters in Periodontics.

Baseline  2 x 60mins
Pre-study treatment will occur over 2 appointments and involves the consent procedure as well as alginate impressions and radiography (panoramic or periapical as suitable for the patient) 

Periodontal treatment will occur over 2 sessions for each patient at the following next available times (2x 60 mins)
Use of "air polishing", compressed air with erythritol powder, in combination with ultrasonic and hand instrumentation (EMS ultrasonic scaler, Hu-Friedy Gracey and Universal Currettes) in the initial treatment and supportive treatment of periodontitis

Recall will occur at 3 months (1x60mins) where supportive periodontal therapy will occur and clinical and microbiological measurements 

No adherence measurements will be undertaken, though a record of treatment is always kept for assessment.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Periodontal diseases are chronic, microbially induced inflammatory disorders that affect the structures that support teeth (Philstrom et al 2005) The treatment has traditionally been the thorough mechanical removal of the microbial environment; the biofilm. The aim of this study is to examine the clinical and microbial outcomes by the supplementary use of air polishing with erythritol powder.</summary>
