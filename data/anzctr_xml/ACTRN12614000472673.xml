  <interventions>
    <interventions>The number of interventional treatment arms is one. 
1. Therapist assisted exercises. These are Muscle energy techniques for either anterior pelvic rotation or posterior pelvic rotation (as diagnosed by the physiotherapist). These are applied for 8-10secs and repeated 4-6 times within the one session.
The washout period between interventions will be 10 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). The TENS unit will be on but will not emit any current through the electrodes which will be placed over the buttock region for 10 minutes. This is a sham treatment as it has no treatment value as there will be no output.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The inclusion criteria are the report of pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) during two or more of the following activities: walking, standing, climbing a flight of stairs, turning over in bed or getting out of a chair. Clinical examination will confirm the diagnosis of PPGP based on positive findings on the following tests on the side of the reported symptoms: positive posterior pelvic pain provocation test (P4) and positive active straight leg raise (ASLR). Pain location will be confirmed by drawings filled in by the participant on a body chart.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria are known chronic orthopaedic, inflammatory or rheumatologial disorders, fracture, uncontrolled medical or obstetric condition and complications due to pregnancy,low back pain in past 12 months that is unrelated to the pregnancy, sensory disturbance in the lower limb on one or both sides, unilateral or bilateral lower limb weakness, pain below knee, ataxic gait, stocking like numbness, unexplained incontinence, unremitting and severe back pain not altered by different patient posture or position. </exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pregnancy related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) has been reported to affect 71% of women who are pregnant and receive care at Westmead Hospital (Pierce et al. 2012). Pelvic girdle pain during pregnancy often causes a reduced ability to transfer, stand and walk and is thought to be related to non-optimal stability of the pelvic girdle (Vleeming et al. 2008). People with PPGP are often referred to physiotherapy but few clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatments in this disabling condition (Elden et al. 2005).
The aim of this randomised cross-over repeated measures study is to determine whether there is a measurable difference in outcomes for pain and function in patients receiving therapist-assisted exercises compared to a control intervention. Ethical approval has been granted for this project at Westmead Hospital, Sydney NSW (Western Sydney Local Health District).
This study will directly affect physiotherapy practice by determining the efficacy of a commonly used exercise intervention for the management of PPGP.  </summary>
