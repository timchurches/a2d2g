  <interventions>
    <interventions>The use of room temperature water as an adjunctive method for distension of colon lumen during colonoscopy. Approximately 300ml of sterile water will be instilled into the colon during the colonoscopy procedure. The addition of water will take approximately 2-3 minutes to the overall time of the procedure. Additional gas insufflation (the normal standard of care) will also be used in addition to the water to achieve adequate colon distension to facilitate the procedure. 

Patients will be randomised to either the water assisted group or the standard of care. patients will be blinded to which arm they have been allocated to, but the operator will be unblinded. Standard parameters will be monitored and recorded during the procedure in both arms to assess the effect/difference between the two groups</interventions>

Anticipate that water assisted colonoscopy will allow a 25% improvement in caecal intubation time (6 minutes compared to the standard accepted 8 minutes). 
Allowing for an 80% power and a significance of 5%, this will require 251 patients in each arm.

Intention to treat analysis. It is assumed that both groups will follow a normal distribution. Categorical outcomes will be assessed with chi-square tests and continuous data will be analysed through t-tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CRC is the second leading cause of cancer death, and accounts for approximately 9%  of cancer deaths overall. Approximately one in three people who develop CRC die of this disease. 


Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for screening but requires time, sedation and patients may  experience some discomfort during the procedure. The standard method of colonoscopy uses air to inflate the colon in order for the lumen to be visualized and the instrument to be safely passed to the caecum/terminal ileum. Water assisted colonoscopy has been described to reduce caecal intubation time as well as analgesia requirements. However this technique has not been studied in a wide variety of patients nor in patients typical of a population appropriate for colorectal cancer screening. We aim to investigate the benefit of water assisted colonoscopy to reduce the time of intubation and thereby also allow a reduction in the sedation requirements and overall improve patient experience. We anticipate this will result in reduced procedural times and expense and hence allow more screening to be conducted without adversely affecting patient experience. 

It is speculated that water may decrease friction and lead to a reduction in intubation time and less cramping from air.
