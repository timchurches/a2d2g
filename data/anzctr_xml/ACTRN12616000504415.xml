  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises a mobile app, and wearable fitness tracker to support patients with their physical preparation for and recovery from Total Knee Replacement surgery. The app is provided in conjunction with usual care. The app is used for 16 weeks in total, four weeks prior to surgery and 12 weeks after surgery. The fitness tracker is wrist worn and the trial suggests that it is worn 24 hours per day for the 16 week trial, except when charging. No targets or recommendations for activities are set for participants. Participants are given virtual rewards for steps walked. Awards are won the first time a patient walks, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000 &amp; 10000 steps. Adherence with tracker is used for analysis purposes only.

The TKR app contains information about the TKR procedure as well as hints and tips for surgical preparation, coaching, reminders, video based exercise demonstrations, and visual representations of the data collected through the wearable device. The app is recommended for daily use, to review activity tracking and to complete daily physiotherapy. Participants can use the app as little or as often as they choose. The suggested duration of use is determined by the physiotherapy program set for the individual. In addition to the physiotherapy the participant would spend no more than 1o minutes using the app per day if they interracted with all content and features. Software monitors frequency and duration of use, inclusing use of individual app components. 

The care teams for patients in the intervention group will be able to view patient gathered data through the patient portal and configure the exercise programs (i.e. exercise videos) for each patient.</interventions>

2. &gt;=50 years and&lt;=80 years under going unilateral total knee replacement for the first time on the planned knee. The average age of osteoarthritis patients undergoing TKR surgery is 68 years, therefore 50 to 80 years is an appropriate range for the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate the use of a mobile application (app), and a wearable activity tracking device to support patients in preparing for and recovering from Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery. This study will test whether the TKR program, a mobile guide to surgical preparation and recovery, including a wearable activity tracking device, can assist TKR patients and their carers by delivering
a) information and assistance to patients in their preparation and recovery from Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery,
b) and a portal for clinician care teams (e.g. surgeons and physiotherapists) to support and monitor patient progress.

The project will evaluate the TKR platform through a Randomised Control Trial (RCT), conducted at multiple trial sites in New South Wales and Queensland. The project will compare existing service delivery models with models enhanced by the proposed TKR platform technology. Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be conducted.</summary>
