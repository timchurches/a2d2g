  <interventions>
    <interventions>Massage therapy plus usual treatment for chronic low back pain over two months plus one extra month of follow-up. Massage therapists will be recruited from the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) database and will be qualified massage practitioners with professional association membership and Professional Indemnity Insurance. Consenting therapists will screen prospective clients for inclusion in the study. The massage therapy treatment will be remedial therapy administered at the practitioner's discretion over at least two months of treatment. Treatment duration is anticipated to be 45 minutes to one hour. Treatment frequency will be determined by the massage therapist but it is anticipated to be once per week to once per fortnight. The treatment will take place at the massage therapist's own clinic.
All other treatments, including those from other manual therapists, will be recorded in the Participant Diary each week by the participant and this will be included in "usual treatment". No strategies will be used to improve adherence other than those used by the therapist in their normal clinical practice. Usual treatment is defined as any treatment the participant uses for chronic low back pain other than the massage treatment provided by the participating massage therapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is a retrospective assessment of clinical and cost outcomes of usual treatment for chronic low back pain over the month prior to commencement of massage treatment. The participants will act as their own control such that retrospective assessment and treatment intervention occurs in the same cohort.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>All data will be analysed for intention to treat. The clinical data will analyse the data collected from the patient reported outcomes. The data will be analysed on STATA and will conduct ANOVA and other appropriate statistical analysis. Paired T tests will be conducted on the standard care and the massage treatment as they will be the same person. The cost-effectiveness will be analysed according to the EuroQual (EQ-5D). This quality of life tool has been chosen as it can be used to ascertain cost-effectiveness. Therefore, standard care versus standard care and massage for cost effectiveness analysis will be conducted via analysis of the EQ-5D. Cost of care will be calculated based upon services accessed by the participant as recorded in their participant diary.

A sample size calculation was conducted from the data collected from a literature search on massage for chronic lower back pain. As no cost effectiveness trial on massage for chronic low back pain has been conducted, the sample size calculation was obtained by looking at comparative effectiveness literature. The sample size from these studies varied from 12 participants to 579 with an average of 82 participants. The lower back pain studies were taken from these. The calculator used for this was https://select-statistics.co.uk/calculators/sample-size-calculator-two-means/ . Of this, the confidence level was set at 95%, the power was set at 80%, the hypothesised difference was 15 and the population variance was 550. This gave us a recommended sample size of 39. We also consulted with 5 professional advisors on the sample size and it was concluded that we would aim for 50 with a 20% attrition rate to ensure statistical significance could be achieved.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study design is a comparative effectiveness clinical trial with participants acting as their own controls. The research question is to establish if massage therapy in addition to standard care for chronic low back pain improves clinical and cost effectiveness outcomes compared to standard care alone. Standard care is defined as whatever the participant did for their low back pain over the month preceding recruitment
and their first massage treatment for the low back pain and will be assessed retrospectively. Clinical and cost effectiveness will be assessed using validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and case reports to be completed at recruitment and again after each month of treatment for the prospective two month treatment phase plus one month of follow-up (three months total study duration per participant). 
In addition, participant diaries for recording symptoms, medication and any adverse events experienced over each month will be distributed at recruitment and collected at each subsequent data collection point. Massage treatment will be determined by the participating massage therapists who will be recruited through the Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) and registered with an appropriate professional body. Participating therapists will screen potential clients for inclusion and obtain consent.

The primary research objective will be to substantiate the clinical and cost effectiveness of massage plus standard care for the treatment of chronic low back pain compared to standard care. If this study shows clinical and cost benefits from adjunctive massage therapy it has the potential to enhance clinical management and improve health outcomes for patients with chronic low back pain in Australia and internationally.</summary>
