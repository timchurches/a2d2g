  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 acute crossover interventions with 3 muffins per visit will be consumed at 8am over 15 minutes after a 12 hour fast. A cup of tea or coffee can be consumed with the snack as long as it is consumed in the same way for each test. Each muffin is 100g (raw weight) and each test meal contains 3 muffins. The three sweeteners used are Sugar (63g), Fructose (51g) and Splenda (6g). The test meal containing sucrose also includes 32g cream (35% fat) and the meal containing fructose includes 24g of cream in order to standardise the fat content.  All three test meals contain 66g fat.  Energy content of the Sugar meal is 4.7MJ; the Fructose meal is 4.6 MJ and the Splenda meal is 4.1MJ.  Total carbohydrate is 119g for the Sugar meal, 109g for the Fructose meal and 80g for the Splenda meal. 
Each test will be repeated at weekly intervals and the usual diet will be continued between tests.
An indwelling cannula will be inserted and remain for the 4 hours of the test. Blood samples will be taken at 0,30,60,90,120,150,180,210 and 240 minutes. Blood samples will be used to measure glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids (measured on the Konelab) and the inflammatory
markers IL1, IL6 and CRP (measured by ELISA).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the research is to explore the interaction between different types of caloric and non caloric sweeteners in snack foods on glucose and triglyceride levels to see if there is an optimal sweetener.  High levels of sugars and high fructose corn syrup in particular have been associated with weight gain and type 2 diabetes but it is not clear if it is the type of sweetener or just the increased caloric load that causes this effect. Current tests of the role of fructose use extremely high amounts that would not be found in normal food items. Biscuits, cakes and muffins all contain a much lower amount of fat and sugar, but contain wheat starch and components of food that will moderate the glycemic and triglyceridemic response such as fibre and protein. We need to know if changing the sweetener in this kind of snack alters the response of glucose and triglycerides.</summary>
