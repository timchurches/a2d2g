  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: (Intervention group) will be on oral Metformin 500 mg to 3000 mg per oral in single or divided dosages (2 or 3 times a day) plus Vildagliptin 50 mg to 100 mg per day also to be administered orally for 12 weeks. The dosages of both medications will be determined based on blood glucose levels with the aim of achieving average fasting blood glucose of &lt;7 mmol/l and post-prandial blood glucose of 10 mmol/l or below. Improved adherence will be enhanced by weekly clinic visit and drug tablet return as well as monitoring blood glucose control and progress of the diabetic foot ulcer.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: (Comparator group) will be on given Metformin as described above plus Placebo comprising of lactose 50 mg to 100 mg per day to be taken orally for 12 weeks. The placebo will be identical in appearance to Vildagliptin without the active ingredient.</comparator>

    <sequence>The randomization list will be prepared by an independent statistician by the method of computer-generated random numbers for each treatment. Randomization will be carried out following a 2-week period of stabilization on Metformin mono-therapy as described above. Patients will be randomized to treatment with Vildagliptin + Metformin therapy or Metformin + Placebo therapy. This study will be blinded to both patients and treating personnel. All laboratory tests, the major study endpoints, will be performed by professionals blinded to treatment allocation. An interim analysis will be performed after the recruiting 50% of proposed study participants. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The objective of this trial is to study the effects of Vildagliptin therapy on inflammatory markers in subjects with diabetic foot ulcer. We plan to prospectively enrol 50 patients with proven diabetic foot ulcer and randomize them in a 1:1, ratio to vildagliptin + metformin or placebo + metformin. We expect to show an improvement (defined as &gt;20% serum IL-6 reduction between the baseline and 3-month assessment) that comprise the primary end point in at least 50% of the patients randomized to Vildagliptin and Metformin therapy and in &lt;10% of the patients randomized to Metformin and Placebo therapy. Furthermore, the proposed sample size was calculated to demonstrate a significant improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group with at least 80% power and a two-sided 5% type 1 error. These requirements will be met with a sample size of 44 patients and a 1:1 randomization design to allow for an approximate dropout rate of 10%, 50 patients will be recruited: this will result in approximately 25 patients in the Vildagliptin + Metformin -intervention group and in the Placebo + Metformin -control group.

The data from the study will be pooled and summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics and efficacy and safety observations. Exploratory analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics. Data will be presented for the complete intent-to-treat population (all patients having taken at least one dose of study medication) as well as the per-protocol population (all patients who completed the study without major protocol deviations). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic patients are at a particularly high risk for poor wound healing in general and foot ulcer in particular. The lifetime risk for developing chronic foot ulcer has been estimated to reach about 15-20% (1). Despite considerable advances in diabetic care, foot ulcers continue to be responsible for a high number of lower limb amputations that are associated with decrease in quality of life and increased risk of mortality (2). The major risk factors for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) are polyneuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes induces complex vascular changes, promoting accelerated atherosclerosis and 
hypercoagulability complicating foot ulcer which can be assessed indirectly by a number of inflammatory markers.

Animal studies have suggested numerous beneficial anti-inflammatory effects of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i), well beyond the effects on blood glucose alone (3). Interestingly, investigation on anti-inflammatory property of DPP4i-vildagliptin in human setting is scanty (4). Treatment with a DPP4i may offer an attractive blood glucose reduction with synergistic mechanism of action while exerting additional wound healing properties. Reduction of inflammatory marker levels is of great clinical importance and may correlate with improvement of diabetic wound healing. Therefore, in the present study we plan to focus on possible anti inflammatory properties of DPP4i in subjects with DFU. 

Primary objective: To demonstrate that Vildagliptin therapy is associated with clinically significant reduction in biological markers of inflammation compared to placebo in patients with DFU. Our Primary aim is demonstration of a significant (= 20%) reduction in the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6).

Secondary objectives: Partial or complete closure of foot ulcer or improvement in other biological markers of inflammation including: hs-CRP, platelet reactivity testing, TNF-alpha, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), adiponectin and tissue TGF- beta-1 levels.
