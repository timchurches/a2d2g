  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The left ulnar nerve is stimulated at the wrist with square-wave, default stimuli of 0.2 ms duration, delivered in a train of four (TOF) mode at 2 Hz every 15 s and contraction of the ipstlateral adductor pollicis muscle is measured using acceleromyography (TOF WatchTM, Organon Ltd, Ireland). 
25%, 50% and 75% recovery of twitch 1 (T1) in train-of-four (TOF) and recovery index are all prolonged.</outcome>
      <timepoint>When the ratio of train of four (TOFR) is above 80%, the stimulation will be terminated. This timepoint mean that the spontaneous recovery of the patient's adductor pollicis muscle and the rocuronium is well metabolized and excreted. 
The ratio of train of four (TOFR) is the percentage of twitch 4:twitch 1 (T4:T1)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primnary purpose of this study was to investigate whether the neuromuscular effect of rocuronium is prolonged in patients with obstructive jaundice. 
We hypothesized that neuromuscular effect of rocuronium is prolonged in patients with obstructive jaundice, just as it does in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction.</summary>
