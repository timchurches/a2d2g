  <interventions>
    <interventions>Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging will be performed on patients who were already planned to have a skin biopsy, prior to having the biopsy. The imaging takes from 5-30mins. The patient will have a small amount of oil applied to their skin and then have either a hand-help device pressed against their skin or have a metal ring stuck their skin with a imaging head then attached to this. The imaging and analysis will be performed by a sub-specialised dermatology consultant in a once off intervention occurring in the outpatient dermatology department of the Princess Alexandra Hospital, a tertiary public teaching hospital</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is determine what benefits and costs are associated with integrating Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging into dermatological clinical practice.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you have been identified during the routine dermatological appointment to require a skin biopsy of a lesion suspicious for either melanoma or basal cell carcinoma.

Study details
The study involves a one-off patient visit that will be incorporated within their standard dermatology visit. During the study visit reflectance confocal imaging will be performed on any lesion which has been identified as requiring a biopsy. Skin biopsy will be performed for every imaged lesion. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire reflecting on their experience of both RCM imaging and having a biopsy, their previous skin cancer history and treatments and their willingness to pay for the service.

Overseas centres have analysed the benefit of integrating RCM in clinical practice, however, to date there has not been a study done in Australia to assess this. As the Australian health system, and particularly the public dermatological service, differs from other countries, it will be beneficial to study the specific benefits of using RCM imaging within the clinical practice of a Queensland public hospital dermatology department.</summary>
