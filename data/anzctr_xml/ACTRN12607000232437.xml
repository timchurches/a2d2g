  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: "Low-level intensity laser, cardiac rehabilitation" Laser with wave length ranged from 653-670nm&amp; power of 5mW applied in contact over 6 points on the neck and chest for 5 minutes for each point. Each patient received 2 sessions/ week for 12 successive weeks.
cardiac rehabilitation involved Breathing exercise (3sets each set 3 times with one minute rest in between ) twice a day for 10 days post-operative, Passive range of motion exercises (10 times for each upper and lower limb joints) twice a day for two days post-operative, Active ankle pump (10 times) twice a day for two days post-operative, Active range of motion for lower and upper limbs (10 times for each joint) twice a day from day 2 to 10 post-operative, Calisthenics exercises to upper and lower limb (10 times for each joint) twice a day from day 3 to 10 post-operative, Walking with gradual increase in distance from day 3 post-operative to the end of the 12 weeks of the study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phrenic nerve injury after open heart surgery is a well known complication. This complication interfer with the diaphrgmatic function and affect the vetilatory functions. This study aimed to assess the effect of low-level intensity laser on the recovery of Phrennic nerve and consequently the improvement in the vetilatory functions. The investigators hypothsis was null.</summary>
