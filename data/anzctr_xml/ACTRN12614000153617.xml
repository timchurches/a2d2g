    <interventions>Spinal Cord Stimulation
Subjects will undergo implantation of leads in the epidural space of the spinal column. Electrical stimulation will be applied constantly via an external trial stimulator (TSM) for approximately 7 days to determine if stimulation is helpful in the relief of pain of the upper limbs and/or neck. If the patient and physician feel the stimulation is effective (standard pain assessment tools will be used), the patient will undergo permanent implantation of leads and implantable pulse generator (IPG). The device can be reprogrammed by personnel at the physician's office to optimize therapy. During reprogramming, usage statistics are available to the physician.

Permanent implant surgery:
As with other SCS procedures, a Touhy needle is inserted into the back at a location determined by the physician and the lead is passed through the needle into the spinal space. Once the lead tip is located in the area the physician deems appropriate (based on location of the patient's pain), the lead is anchored and sutured in place. The other end of the lead is then tunneled under the skin to the area of the body the physician deems appropriate for IPG placement. A pocket is created at that location to accommodate the IPG. The leads are connected to the IPG and all incisions are sutured. All system components are implanted. This procedure lasts 30-90 minutes.

Temporary trial:
For the trial phase, a Touhy needle is inserted into the back at a location determined by the physician and the lead is passed through the needle into the spinal space untilthe lead tip is located in the area the physician deems appropriate (based on location of the patient's pain). When the trial is temporary, the leads are not anchored down. The other end of the lead is externalized and connected to the trial stimulator for the duration of the trial. Appropriate steps are taken to ensure sterility. This procedure lasts 30-60 minutes.</interventions>

Subjects that have been determined to be candidates for HF10 SCS therapy will be approached by Investigators/clinical site staff about potential participation in the study. Following consent, subjects will be selected to participate in the study based upon inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this investigational plan. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed based on pain assessments, radiographic studies, pregnancy test (if needed), stability of pain and medication, subject medical records and history, assessment tools, subject interviews, and the Investigatorâ€™s clinical judgment. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, prospective, study to collect data on the commercially available Nevro Senza SCS System. Outcomes will be assessed via standardized assessments (trial and IPG implant procedures are part of routine practice). The purpose of this study is to document and assess safety and effectiveness of HF10 electrical stimulation delivered to the spinal cord in subjects with chronic, intractable pain of the upper limb and neck, as part of the centers routine practice (on-label use of TGA approved/CE marked device).

Data at follow-up visits will be compared to Baseline data collected at the beginning of the study. This study includes extensive data collection (Trial and IPG implant procedures are part of routine practice).

Subjects will participate in this investigational plan that includes entry criteria evaluation, baseline assessments, trial stimulation phase, and post-trial assessment. Subjects with a successful Trial Phase will be implanted a permanent system (i.e. IPG) and leads as per centers routine practice, and undergo 12 months of stimulation delivery with assessments
at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months Post-Permanent Device Activation.

Assessments of pain and adverse events will be made at 1 month and 9 months following Post-Permanent Device Activation. At 3, 6, and 12 months Post-Permanent Device Activation, subjects will be assessed for pain and adverse
events as well as disability, functioning, neurological assessment, medication use, quality of life, depression and sleep. Patient Global Impression of Change, Clinician Global Impression of Change and subject satisfaction will be recorded at 3 and 12 months Post-Permanent Device Activation.
