    <studytitle>An open-labeled, randomized, crossover, multi-dose study in healthy male subjects to test the pharmacokinetics (how your body handles the drug e.g. how it absorbs it and how it eliminates it), safety, and tolerability of investigational drugs taken, with a pharmacokinetics comparison to the combination of the marketed drug Reyataz (Registered Trademark) and Norvir (Registered Trademark)</studytitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be three cohorts of subjects enrolled in this study. Each cohort will receive a different dose level of CTP-298 as follows:
Cohort 1-CTP-298 450mg; 
Cohort 2-CTP-298 550mg; 
Cohort 3-CTP-298 650mg. 

Prior to the start of the first period for each Cohort, subjects in that Cohort will be randomized to one of two treatment sequences:
Sequence A:CTP-298 (period 1) to ATV/ritonavir (period 2;
Sequence B: ATV/ritonavir (period 1) to CTP-298 (period 2).

Each sequence within each Cohort will be treated in two 14-day periods, with an approximate 2 to 4 week washout (a minimum of 14 days) in-between treatments within each cohort. 

For each Cohort, if the first period of treatment is well-tolerated, then the second period of treatment will commence. Subject Procedures will remain the same for each period. 

Consented and qualified subjects will check-in to the site on the evening before dosing. Subjects will fast overnight for at least 10 hours prior to their morning breakfast. Following breakfast, each subject will receive their assigned treatment [either a daily dose of CTP-298 amorphous dispersion dosed as a suspension for 14 days or a dose of ATV 300 mg and a dose of ritonavir 100 mg (dosed as capsules) for 14 days]. Water consumption will be restricted for 1 hour before and 1 hour after dosing for Days 1 through 14; there will be no water restriction on any other study day.

Meal times will be standardized throughout the study period, with a light meal (breakfast) being served around 7:30 AM, lunch around noon, afternoon snack around 4 PM, dinner around 6 PM and a late night snack around 10 PM.
Blood samples (4 mL each) for pharmacokinetics will be collected at specified times as follows: Day 1: Predose (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 24; Days 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: Pre-dose (within 5 minutes before AM dosing); Day 14: Predose (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 48 h.

Safety assessments will be based on continuous monitoring of AEs and periodic 12-lead ECGs and vitals. Additional safety assessments will include laboratory testing at specified time points and continuous monitoring of adverse events.

Note that 7 days following the completion of the last period for a subject, an End of Study Visit will occur, at which a physical examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratories will be collected, as well as collection of adverse events.</interventions>
