  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized pilot clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well giving
      temozolomide and cixutumumab together with combination chemotherapy works in treating
      patients with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cixutumumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving
      temozolomide and cixutumumab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.</summary>
