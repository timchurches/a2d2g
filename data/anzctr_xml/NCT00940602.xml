  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare deferasirox to placebo with regard to event-free survival (a composite primary endpoint including death and non-fatal events related to cardiac and liver function) in low and int-1 risk MDS patient with transfusional iron overload. - The composite primary endpoint (event-free survival) consists of both death and non-fatal events. Non-fatal events include worsening cardiac function based on echocardiographic evidence, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, liver function impairment reflected by elevated ALT or AST and bilirubin values, confirmed liver cirrhosis, and transformation to AML. The composite primary endpoint is defined as time from date of randomization to date when death (irrespective of cause) or any of the non-fatal events has been reached (whatever occurred first). Time is measured in days and is defined as date of event minus date of randomization plus 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years1 year - 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hematologic improvement in terms of erythroid responses during treatment will be assessed - The variable used in the analysis of HI will be the proportion of patients who satisfy the erythroid response criteria, namely  Hemoglobin increase of = 1.5 g/dL OR  Reduction of = 4 RBC transfusions/8 weeks in comparison to pre-treatment values and lasting at least 8 weeks. According to IWG criteria, HI is measured in patients with pre-treatment hemoglobin levels of less than 11 g/dL or RBC transfusion dependence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival - Overall survival (OS) will be evaluated in patients treated with either deferasirox or placebo. The variable used in the analysis of overall survival is time to death measured in days. It is defined as date of death (irrespective of cause) minus date of randomization plus 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients with hypothyroidism - Hypothyroidism will be evaluated by the annual measurement of TSH and free T4. The proportion of patients with normal thyroid function, primary hypothyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism will be determined at each time point (i.e. 1, 2, years after randomization).
Definitions:
normal thyroid function: serum TSH and free T4 within normal limits;
primary hypothyroidism: serum TSH &gt;ULN and free T4 &lt;LLN;
secondary hypothyroidism: serum TSH &lt;ULN and free T4 &lt;LLN;
subclinical hypothyroidism: TSH &gt;ULN and a free T4 within normal limits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Annually</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients with worsening of glucose metabolism - An annual oral glucose tolerance test will be carried out to evaluate changes of glucose metabolism compared to the baseline status. The proportion of patients with an increase in glucose metabolism category (normal, impaired glucose metabolism, diabetes mellitus) based on the American Diabetes Association criteria (American Diabetes Association 2009) compared to their baseline result will be determined at each timepoint, i.e. 1, 2, years after randomization. For this classification, fasting and 2-hour post-prandial plasma glucose levels will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Annually</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease progression - An evaluation of the time from randomization to either MDS progression or progression to AML in the treatment groups will be done based on date of diagnosis of MDS progression or date of first diagnosis of AML minus date of randomization plus 1. MDS progression will be defined as a transition into a higher MDS risk group based on IPSS scoring. Progression to AML will be defined based upon the most current classification guidelines (Vardiman 2009), as 20% or more blasts seen in the bone marrow.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first occurrence of serum ferritin &gt; 2 times the baseline value - An evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of serum ferritin &gt; 2 times the baseline value at two consecutive assessments (at least two weeks apart) will be performed per treatment group based on the following variable:  date of the first of the two consecutive laboratory assessment fulfilling the criterion of SF &gt; 2 Ã— baseline value minus date of randomization plus 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to at least a 10% increase from baseline in LVIDD - An evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of an increase of at least 10% from the baseline value of LVIDD will be performed based on the following variable:  date of echocardiography assessment where a minimum of 10% increase first occurred minus date of randomization plus 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to at least a 10% increase from baseline in LVISD - An evaluation of the time from randomization to the first occurrence of an increase of at least 10% from the baseline value of LVISD will be performed based on the following variable:
 date of echocardiography assessment where a minimum of 10% increase first occurred minus date of randomization plus 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infections - Infections requiring intravenous antimicrobials during the treatment period (until the 28 day follow-up visit) will be evaluated separately for each treatment group. Infections will be determined from the reported adverse events with system organ class "Infections and infestations" and action taken "Concomitant medication taken". The total number of infections will be counted and summarized per treatment group. For this number one patient can contribute more than one infection event. To account for different lengths of observation time in the two groups, the rate of infections will be calculated based on patient-years of follow-up. The relative risk of infection will be calculated as the rate of infection in the treatment group compared with the rate in the placebo group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of Randomization Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients with significant renal dysfunction - Treatment groups will be evaluated regarding the proportion of patients experiencing a significant renal dysfunction. This is defined as a serum creatinine value = 2 times ULN at two consecutive assessments. The two assessments need to be at least 7 days a part.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Annually</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients with severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia - Proportion of patients with newly occurring CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia will be displayed by treatment group. Results will also be provided for annual time intervals.</outcome>

In addition, a statistical analysis of the multivariate (recurrent) major gastrointestinal bleeding data will be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Annually</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to study drug discontinuation due to an AE or laboratory abnormality - An evaluation of the time from randomization to study drug discontinuation due to an AE or laboratory abnormality will be performed. The variable will be based on the date and reason given on the Study Treatment Completion eCRF page.
