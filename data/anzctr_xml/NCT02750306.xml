  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the safety and efficacy of suvorexant (MK-4305) to improve sleep
      in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary hypothesis for the study is that
      suvorexant is superior to placebo in improving insomnia as measured by change from baseline
      in polysomnography (PSG)-derived total sleep time (TST) at Week 4.</summary>
