    <summary>This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled adaptive, dose finding study to
      investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy of single and repeat intravenous
      infusions of GSK315243A in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The study is divided
      into 2 parts: Part A is an adaptive, dose finding phase which will provide safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD on single intravenous infusions. Part B is a repeat dose phase which
      will provide safety, tolerability, PK, PD and efficacy following repeat intravenous infusions
      of a selected dose level.</summary>
