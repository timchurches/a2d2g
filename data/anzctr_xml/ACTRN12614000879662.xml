  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a randomised, crossover feeding trial that requires pre-screening, 1 baseline visit, and 3 feeding sessions. Data collection will be conducted at the University of South Australia.

The baseline visit (1 hour) entails the measurement of body weight, height, body fat % (BIA method), and self-administered questionnaires on habitual food intake, physical activity levels, eating behaviours (Three-factor Eating Questionnaire). Three preloads will be used during the 3 feeding sessions and they are: 1) milk-based jelly with sucrose (100g low-fat milk, 4.7g gelatine powder, 50g sugar, red food colouring); 2) milk-based jelly with artificial sweetener (100g low-fat milk, 4.7g gelatine powder, 20 (1 tablet = 6mg sucralose) tablets of Splenda (registered trademark) sweetener, red food colouring), and 3) milk-based jelly with artificial sweetener and maltodextrin (100g low-fat milk, 4.7g gelatine powder, 20 tablets (1 tablet = 6mg sucralose) of Splenda (registered trademark) sweetener, 50g maltodextrin, red food colouring). All ingredients are commercially available in the supermarket. Preload (1) contains sweet carbohydrate; preload (2) is sweet without carbohydrate; and preload (3) is artificially sweetened and contains non-sweet carbohydrate. The use of these 3 preloads will enable researchers to contrast the sensory (sweet) effects from the nutrient (carbohydrate) effects in this study. 

On the feeding days, participants will arrive at lab (P-108c) in the morning after an overnight fasting of at least 10 hours and have avoided alcohol and strenuous physical activities on the previous day. Upon arrival, participants will be asked to lie down and rest for 30 minutes. After the 30-min rest, baseline resting energy expenditure will be measured for 30 minutes using an indirect calorimeter (TrueMax 2400, Parvomedic Inc.). Following that, participants will be asked to complete an appetite questionnaire (visual analog scales, VAS) before consuming the preload. Participants will be given 15 minutes to consume the preload and 100ml water will be provided with the preload. After the preload, participants will be asked to complete an appetite questionnaire again, plus a questionnaire to assess the palatability and sweetness (VAS) of the preload they just consumed. Next, energy expenditure will be measured for 3 X 30 minute periods, with 2 X 15-min breaks between measurements. Immediately after indirect calorimetry, appetite will be assessed using a VAS questionnaire again. Participants will then be presented with a buffet lunch consists of commercially available foods (Lab P1-38), where they will be instructed to eat until they are comfortably full. Participants will be given 30 minutes to consume their buffet lunch, and they will be asked to complete an appetite questionnaire (VAS) again before they leave. Participants will keep a food diary to record food and beverage intake for the remaining day. Similar protocol will be repeated until all 3 preload conditions are completed, with a washout period of at least 3 days. Each feeding session will take approximately 4.5 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>I hypothesise that, compared to a milk-based jelly preload sweetened with table sugar, similar preload sweetened with artificial sweetener sucralose reduces postprandial carbohydrate oxidation but does not affect energy expenditure. I further hypothesise that artificially-sweetened preload does not increase hunger sensations, subsequent food intake, and total daily energy intake.

Diet products (sugar free) are widely used as a strategy to reduce energy intake by individuals who continuously monitor their body weight and by overweight individuals who are trying to lose weight. This practice is supported by findings from intervention studies that reported greater weight loss in adults and less weight gain in children when diet beverages were supplemented. However, some observational studies failed to observe the beneficial effects of artificial sweetener use on body weight, or have even reported positive association between body weight and artificial sweetener use. While it is possible that the relationship observed may be explained by reverse-causation (overweight individuals included more diet products to assist weight loss), there is evidence proposing a neurobiological explanation to heightened food intake induced by artificial sweeteners, which has been documented in animal studies. According to this hypothesis, increased appetite and food intake may be due to the infidelity between sweet taste signals (hinting the body of potential carbohydrate intake) and absence of carbohydrate after the ingestion of artificial sweeteners. While this hypothesis may be plausible, this effect has yet to be replicated in humans, where human studies have found no effect of diet beverages on food intake or hunger sensations. However, what remains unknown is whether artificial sweeteners promote appetite and food intake when they are added to foods in forms other than liquid and where sugar is the only energy source.</summary>
