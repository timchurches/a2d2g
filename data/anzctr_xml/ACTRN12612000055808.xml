  <interventions>
    <interventions>Topical corticosteroid prednisolone acetate 1.0% (one eyedrop four times daily for three weeks).

Intervention and control study arms will also receive topical ciprofloxacin 0.3% (antibiotic) one drop hourly during waking hours for the first 48 hours, then 2 hourly during waking hours until re-epithelialisation, then four times daily whilst using the study drug (three weeks). 

Study medication will be introduced on day 4 of treatment with at least two days of progressive corneal improvement and will be administered four times a day for three weeks until a study endpoint has occurred (e.g. healing, worsening).

If participants have a bacterial strain resistant to ciprofloxacin, as per usual management, treatment with another suitable topical antibiotic will be instigated.</interventions>

      <outcome>Symptom resolution as assessed by composite score summerizing key symptoms (1=mild to 10=severe) of following six feature; pain, foreign body sensation, epiphoria, photophobia, reduced vision and ocular discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4, 7, 14, 21 and 90 days following study enrolment</timepoint>

      <outcome>Visual acuity.

Best corrected visual acuity with be recorded with a LogMAR Chart.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse effects of treatment (ocular and non ocular) (e.g. temporary stinging, blurred vision, allergic reaction, delayed wound healing or red eye. The following adverse effects may occur with patients on long term steroid eye-drops, but are rarely seen with short term (three weeks) treatments. These include an increase in intraocular pressure, increased risk of cataract formation, scleral or corneal perforation, anterior uveitis, dilated pupil, loss of accommodation, ptosis, headache, and altered taste. 

Paticipants will be monitored for adverse effects by assessment and slit lamp examination during each visit</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serious complications of infection (e.g. corneal perforation, corneal scarring, endophthalmitis).

Possible complications of infection will be assessed at each vists with slit lamp and anterior chamber OCT examination.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bacterial keratitis (bacterial infection of the cornea) can cause permanent scarring of the cornea resulting in visual loss possibly requiring corneal transplant. Scarring is caused in large part by the infection but also by the bodys immune/inflammatory response to infection with subsequent opacification of the cornea. It is thought that suppressing the immune/inflammatory response through the use of topical corticosteroid will reduce the incidence of permanent corneal scarring and minimise visual loss. The proposed study will be randomised, placebo controlled, and double-masked. All participants will remain on topical antibiotics throughout the study; in addition, one group will receive corticosteroid eye-drops, the other an identical placebo eye-drop. Neither the patients nor the investigators will know which treatment is being used until results have been analysed.</summary>
