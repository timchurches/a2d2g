  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease-free Survival (DFS)- Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review - DFS was defined as the time interval (in years) from the date of randomization to the first date of recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy or death. Recurrence refers to relapse of the primary tumor in-situ or at metastatic sites.
Date of recurrence or occurrence: The date of the recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy for the first time, either by blinded independent central review (BICR) or investigator assessment for the respective analyses.
Participants were followed with tumor imaging for recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy for the remainder of the follow-up period unless the patient had withdrawn consent.
According to the statistical analysis plan there are two cohorts: 1.Global Cohort: primary analysis of DFS was performed approximately 5 years after last subject in the Global Cohort is randomized; 2. China Cohort: primary analysis of DFS was performed approximately 3 years after the last subject in China Cohort was randomized.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 12 weeks during the first 3 years and every 6 months after that unless the patient had withdrawn consent. Performed 5 years after LSLV or when approximately 258 events survival status, whichever was later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>DFS- Assessed by the Investigator (Stratified by UISS High Risk Group-Intent to Treat Population) - DFS was defined as the time interval (in years) from the date of randomization to the first date of recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy or death. Recurrence refers to relapse of the primary tumor in-situ or at metastatic sites.
Date of recurrence or occurrence: The date of the recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy for the first time, either by BICR or investigator assessment for the respective analyses.

Participants were followed for AEs from the first day of study treatment until at least 28 days after the last on-study treatment administration, or until all serious or study medication-related toxicities had resolved or were determined to be "chronic" or "stable," whichever was later.

      <outcome>Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)- European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30: Observed Means in Global Health Status / Quality of Life Scale Scores - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), which was a 30-item questionnaire with global QoL scale, 5 multi-item functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, &amp; social functioning), 3 multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, &amp; pain), and 6 single item symptom scales for other cancer-related symptoms (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, &amp; the financial impact of cancer). The questionnaire includes 28 items with 4-point Likert type responses from "not at all" to "very much" to assess functioning &amp; symptoms; 2 items with 7-point Likert scales for global health &amp; overall QoL. All responses were converted to a 0 to 100 scale using a standard scoring algorithm, higher scores represented better level for functioning/QoL &amp; more severe for symptoms.</outcome>

      <outcome>PROs- EORTC QLQ C30: Functional Scale Scores Between Treatment Comparison - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), which was a 30-item questionnaire with global QoL scale &amp; 5 multi-item functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, &amp; social functioning). The questionnaire includes 28 items with 4-point Likert type responses from "not at all" to "very much" to assess functioning; 2 items with 7-point Likert scales for global health &amp; overall QoL.

      <outcome>PROs- EuroQoL EQ-5D Observed Means - Intent to Treat Population - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) by the EuroQoL Group health status questionnaire (EQ-5D), which was a brief self-administered, validated instrument with 2 parts. In this outcome measure, the first part with 5 descriptors of current health state (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, &amp; anxiety/depression) was used; a participant was asked to rate each state on a 3-level scale (1=no problem, 2=some problem, &amp; 3=extreme problem); higher levels indicated greater severity/impairment. The published weights allowed the creation of a single summary score called the EQ-5D index, which ranged from -0.594 to 1; low scores represented a higher level of dysfunction &amp; 1 as perfect health.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cycle 1(Day 1); subsequent cycles (Day 1) and end of treatment/withdrawal (ie, up to 1 year)</timepoint>

      <outcome>PROs- EuroQol European Quality of Life Questionnaire Variable Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) Observed Means - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessed health-related quality of life (QoL) by the EuroQoL Group health status questionnaire (EQ-5D), which was a brief self-administered, validated instrument with 2 parts. The first part assessed the current health state. In this outcome measure, the second part was applied to assess the general health status by using visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS) which measured participant's self-rated health status on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cycle 1(Day 1); subsequent cycles (Day 1) and end of treatment/withdrawal (ie, up to 1 year)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Tolerability Symptoms - Participants were followed for AEs from the first day of study treatment until at least 28 days after the last on-study treatment administration, or until all serious or study medication-related toxicities had resolved or were determined to be "chronic" or "stable," whichever was later.
The treatment was administered to the participants from cycle1/day 1 up to 9 cycles or until relapse, secondary malignancy, death or withdraw for other reasons such as toxicity or withdraw of consent. This table provides the summary of discontinuations de to adverse events. Participants were counted only once in each row.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cycle 1(Day 1 &amp; Day 28); subsequent cycles (Day 1); end of treatment/withdrawal and 28 days post treatment, or until all serious or study medication-related toxicities had resolved or were determined to be "chronic" or "stable," whichever was later</timepoint>
