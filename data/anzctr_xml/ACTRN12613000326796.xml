  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be invited to twenty therapeutic group music sessions (8-10 persons in the group), facilitated by two registered music therapists and supported by the lead researcher in her role as participant observer (also RMT), lasting up to 1.5 hours each. Four blocks of weekly sessions will be held between 2/9/13 and 4/10/13; 14/10/13 and 15/11/13; 25/11/13 and 20/12/13; and 27/1/14 and 7/3/14.   The young people will be engaged in various forms of music activity according to their particular individual and collective interests and strengths. The primary goal will be to build a musical community through collaborative musicking (Pavlicevic &amp; Ansdell, 2004). Musicking involves active and collaborative participation which can lead to a culture of connectedness and the enhancement of mutual relationships (Stige, 2010). The participants themselves will determine the precise activities they will engage with, but they are likely to include listening, singing, song writing, playing musical instruments, and/or moving to music, as well as talking about music, about how music makes them feel, and what music reminds them of. They will be supported to participate and their varying abilities and styles of communication will be respected. </interventions>

</outcome>
      <timepoint>We intend to involve the participants in action research.  Each week they will negotiate what music they will do, why they want to do it, how they will do it, and how they will evaluate their activity.  When they have evaluated their session they will plan the following one. Every five weeks, approximately, the three participating adults will analyse the data drawn from participant observation (of music and talking), and reflective journaling.  The data will be subjected to thematic analysis.  Each evaluation will constitute one cycle of learning. The adults will bring their new understandings back to the young people who will have the opportunity to discuss and renegotiate the findings and plan for the next cycle (four cycles in total).  The adults will undertake a final analysis and meet with the young people to share and negotiate findings.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We intend to engage a group of young people with intellectual disability who are transitioning from school, as co-researchers in an action research project to examine, develop, and describe the therapeutic potential of group music making with this population.  The developmental period of transition from late adolescence to young adulthood is a time of significant change, bringing new opportunities coupled with uncertainties, challenges, and risks, all of which can be intensified for young people with disabilities. Music making is a nonverbal creative medium that is accessible to all, and it is a popular activity with young people. It promotes interaction and collaboration, and can support their efforts to develop individual mastery, independence, self-esteem, and autonomy, and to forge strong connections with each other and the wider community. Action research, like the community music therapy approach in which we will be grounding the work, is highly collaborative and empowering, and by its very nature will contribute to the self-determination that the young people will be seeking. Action research methodology is rarely used with this population, although it appears to be particularly enabling for young people. The young people who will be involved in the sessions are likely to experience improvement in overall wellbeing and to develop skills that that will increase their potential for self-advocacy and their prospects of engaging in other meaningful activity or work. Moreover the articulation of their aspirations and goals in various forms through the research process will inform service providers about what is needed to implement the best services now and into the future, for people of this age.</summary>
