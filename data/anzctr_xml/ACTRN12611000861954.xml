  <interventions>
    <interventions>Five individual treatment sessions by a pelvic floor physiotherapist including a tailored pelvic floor exercise program. The initial session will last one hour, while subsequent visits will be half an hour duration over a thjree month period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Twenty treatments on a extracorporeal magnetic stimulator. These sessions may be two or three times per week, within a three month window. This involves the patient sitting on a neotonus chair, each visit lasting aproximately 25 minutes. Treatment consists of sitting on the chair and for 10 minutes receiving a 35 Hz current, followed by a 2-3 minute rest period, then a second period of stimulation of 10 Hz current for 10 minutes. Women will also be required to do pelvic floor exercises at home. They are provided with brief instruction on pelvic floor exercises and provided with a leaflet at there initial treatment session by a nurse continence advisor.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women with a predominate symptom of stress urinary incontinence will be given a brief outline by the referring doctor and asked if they are happy to be contacted regarding participation in a study. 
If the patient consents they will be contacted by the research cordinator (myself) and given a more detailed outline of the study. If the patient agrees they are then given an appointment to meet and discuss the study, provided with written material, and formal consent is obtained. 
Women are then randomised using a computer generated randomisation code.
At this initial appointment, women will be assessed by the Urogynecology staff specialist. 
Prior to starting treatment they are also given a 24 hour pad test, ICIQ questionaire and 3 day bladder chart to complete.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is two compare the benefit of two different treatments for patients with stress urinary incontinence. This is a condition in which women may leak urine with increases in abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, lifting, walking or running.
The first treatment is five individual physiotherapy sessions. The second treatment is 20 sessions on a special magnetic chair. Patients are assessed prior to starting treatment, at three months after competing treatment, and again at six months.</summary>
