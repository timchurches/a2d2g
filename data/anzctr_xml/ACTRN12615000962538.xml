  <interventions>
    <interventions>TOTS is a six-session, weekly group program running for 2 hours for parents of toddlers. The program aims to teach parents to assist their young child to understand and manage their emotions. TOTS also provides parents with skills in understanding and managing their own emotions thereby reducing the stress of parenting a young child and improving their mental health. The program is delivered using psychoeducation, role play practice, watching DVD material, group discussion, exercises and home activities. The program is facilitated by program authors who are psychologists or parent educators. The program is delivered using a structured manual with fidelity checklists used to ensure maximum adherence to the program. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parenting skills: measured using parent self report on questionnaires (at baseline, post intervention and 12 month follow-up) along with observed parenting skills in a structured parent-child assessment at baseline and 12-month follow up. 

Self-report parenting using two validated measures: 
Parent Emotional Style Questionnaire (PESQ) - 21 items measuring parent emotion-coaching and emotion-dismissing beliefs.
Coping with Toddlers Negative Emotions Scale (CTNES) - 12 hypothetical situations measuring parental behaviours in response to toddlers emotions; yields 7 sub-scales


Observed parenting: A structured assessment is used with validated coding methods:
Parents and toddlers will enter a room with a camera set up and some toys on the floor. Tasks will include: parent and child share free play with toys (5 mins); a building block activity (5 minutes); parent asks toddler to complete a challenging puzzle while the parent completes a questionnaire (5 mins); parent and child enact a story using a dolls house and family characters (10 mins); pack up the equipment (3 mins). Coding will measure emotion coaching/dismissing, emotional responsiveness and child emotion regulation using coding by Baker, Fenning and Crnic, (2011). </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcomes are measured at baseline and 12-months post-intervention (which is approximately 15-months after baseline assessment). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent emotion regulation: measured using parent self report on questionnaires (at baseline, post intervention and 12 month follow-up).

The measure used is the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) - 41 items on parents emotion regulation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and 12-months post-intervention (which is approximately 15-months after baseline assessment). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child emotional and behavioural functioning: measured using parent - report on questionnaires (at baseline, post intervention and 12 month follow-up).

The measure used is:
Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) - 34 items measuring toddlers social and behavioural functioning. </outcome>

    <concealment>Allocation is concealed: Childcare/Maternal Child Health Centres/Playgroups are randomised to intervention or control. Participants do not know their condition status when they enrol in the study and are assigned their condition (intervention/control) once they complete Time 1 assessment. Randomisation is generated using a computer assisted program (Research Randomizer) which is undertaken by Dr Havighurst who is located in a different building than the research team. </concealment>
    <sequence>Research Randomizer is a computer generated software program that is used to generate a list of numbers that are then allocated to the centres.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Cluster randomisation is used not individual randomisation. Centres are randomised into intervention or wait-list control.  This means those in the intervention receive the intervention immediately and then follow-up assessment. Wait list control participants complete all assessment and after the last follow-up measures (15-months after baseline) they receive the intervention.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size requirements and power calculation: 
Using methods proposed by Eldridge et al. (2006) the estimated design effect for the study is 1.30 (based on 40 clusters of average size 7, a coefficient of variation for cluster size of 0.25, and a conservative at worst intra-class correlation of 0.05). The following power calculation incorporates this estimated design effect from clustering, and is done for feasible differential treatment effects at 15 months follow-up, where attrition will be highest. The treatment effect difference is conservatively estimated to result in group differences of about 0.40 SDs for continuous outcome measures. To achieve 80% power at a 5% significance level, the required sample size at follow-up needs to be 100Ã—1.30 = 130 participants in each condition. Based on other studies that we have conducted, including our pilot study, we estimate there will be 10% attrition. This implies that 130/0.90 =144 participants are needed in each condition for the study to have sufficient power.

Recruitment and uptake rate:
We assume an 10% recruitment rate from all parents canvassed and a 90% uptake rate from parents who indicate an interest in being involved in the study, we will require initial recruitment of 288 / (0.85*0.90) = 376 participants in the 40-60 centres (i.e., approximately 9 parents on average per centre) to achieve a final baseline sample size of 288. This number was rounded up to 290 for ease with recruitment.

Once data are collected Multi-level modelling will be used to determine outcome differences. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will evaluate a new parenting program, Tuning in to Toddlers (TOTS), an intervention with goals to prevent the onset of social, emotional and behavioural difficulties in young children. TOTS aims to improve parents emotional responsiveness and emotion regulation in order to assist their child to begin to understand and regulate their emotional reactions and to reduce stress for parent and child. There are few available evidence based programs for parents of toddlers and none have taken an emotion-focused approach despite early childhood being a time of intense emotions for parents and a critical time in toddlers emotional development. TOTS will focus on and promote emotional competencies, strengthening the parent-child relationship that will reduce the likelihood of child emotional or behavioural problems during these early years.

The study will recruit 290 parents of a 2-3 year old child through maternal and child health centres, Playgroups Victoria and childcare services in Melbourne. Participants will be randomised to either TOTS or a wait-list control group. TOTS participants will attend a 6-session parenting program while wait-list participants will be offered the program after a 15-month waiting period (unless they require clinical intervention). Participants will complete measures at baseline, immediately post- intervention (intervention participants only) and at 15-month follow-up. To assess the efficacy of TOTS we will use well validated measures including questionnaires about parenting and childrens functioning; a parent-toddler observation task measuring parental emotion coaching, parental emotional responsiveness and toddler emotion regulation; and hair samples to assess parent and toddler stress levels. TOTS is a manualised intervention and measures will be used to determine program acceptability and fidelity. Statistical analyses will compare participants in the two groups at follow-up. Outcomes will be reported in peer-reviewed journals, at conferences and in a facilitator manual of TOTS that will enable program dissemination.
