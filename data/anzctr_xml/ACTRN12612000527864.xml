    <interventions>A specifically designed continence promotion intervention including  a tailored pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation  exercise program to reduce lower urinary tract , lower bowel symptoms and erectile dysfunction in men receiving radiation therapy with 6 months no-adjuvant  androgen deprivation therapy and men NOT receiving (ADT) prior to beginning radiation therapy. Androgen Deprivation Therapy dose will be standardiesd to Lucrin ( leuprorelin) 22.5 mgs intramuscularly 3 monthly.
The intervention will be delivered one on one with physiotherapist. The protocol will be tailored to men's measured pelvic floor muscle function and adherence to the program will be encouraged using  motivational interviewing principles. Men receiving radiation therapy alone will meet with physiotherapist  for review at all follow-up points which are : immediately radiation therapy  completed ,at 1 and 3 months after radiation therapy . Ongoing contact with the physiotherapist will be undertaken using   men's preferred method-text/phone/email. All men in the intervention group will receive a copy of the DVD - pelvic floor exercises for men that was produced by the chief investigator for the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia. Men receiving ADT will need to exercise  for 6 months prior to their RT . These men will also have adherence encouraged as above.
Exercises will be tailored to baseline so men on ADT will need to visit the physiotherapist fortnightly  for reassessment and progression. Exercise will need to be performed 3 times daily but the number of repetition  each time exercise is undertaken will be tailored to individually to suit the baseline function of men's measured pelvic floor muscle function. The exercise sets will be the number of contractions  that can be  repeatedly held for and indivicually specified number of seconds. The eventual aim would be for each man to to be able to do 10 Maximal contractions each held for 10 seconds, three times a day in sitting lying or standing start postions .  Men will be offered the use of a personal anal perineometer  to provide biofeedback and some resistance to their anal sphincter contractions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Care.
Currently men recieve no  care instructions when undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer except in relation to  having empty bladder and bowels at each radiation therapy session.
Men will be prescribed  Lucrin as hormone therapy. Currently all men prescribed Lucrin are offered the opportunity to take part in a subsidised general fitness exercise plan. All participants in teh Lucrin arm will  offered access to "The Man Plan".
"The Man Plan" is not the exercise program described as pelvic floor muscle exercises.but a general exercise regimen designed for men receiving ADT to maintain general fitness levels that can be affeted by  Androgen Deprivation therapy. "The Man Plan" includes no pelvic floor muscle exercises nor continence promotion advice.
"The Man Plan"  is promoted by Abbott Laboratories   and is not under  jurisdiction of the study Physiotherapists. It is an individually tailored fitness program that includes support, education and exercise options but with no attention paid to continence promotion or pelvic floor muscle function. The program is supervised by local exercise physiologists working within 'The Man Plan Program'and will be tailored to fit with individual  men's requirements and wishes.
The parameters of exercise  frequency and intensity  will be recordede within the study</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to define the variation in endpoint measures in men who are prescribed radiation therapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This will allow the determination of a sample size sufficiently powered to detect such a difference so that a formal randomised controlled trial might be designed. Who is it for? This study is open to men aged 40-90 years with early stage prostate cancer, without any neurological conditions and absent from any other bladder conditions or secondary malignancies. You will not be eligible to participate if you have had any type of abdominal surgery in the past 2 years. You may also be allowed entry to this study if you are currently receiving radiation therapy with 6 months non-adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, or NOT receiving (ADT) prior to beginning scheduled radiation therapy. Trial details: In this study, you will be randomised to one of two treatment arms. For Arm 1, if you are currently receiving radiation therapy with 6 months non-adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or NOT receiving ADT prior to beginning scheduled radiation therapy, you will receive a specifically designed continence promotion intervention including a tailored pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation exercise program to reduce lower urinary tract , lower bowel symptoms and erectile dysfunction. This intervention will be tailored to you and delivered one on one by a physiotherapist. All men in Arm 1 of the study  will receive a copy of a pelvic floor exercise DVD which they will be encouraged to use. If you are receiving radiation therapy alone WITHOUT androgen deprivation therapy, you will meet with a physiotherapist for review immediately after your radiation therapy, and then at 1 and 3 months after it. If you ARE receiving ADT, you will need to exercise for 6 months prior to your scheduled radiotherapy, and these exercises will be tailored to you. For Arm 2, you will receive the current, usual care with no additional instructions when you undergo your radiation therapy, except in relation to having empty bladder and bowels at each radiation therapy session. All men in the study who are  receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy will  be given the option to take part in The Man Plan", an individually tailored general exercise and fitness regimen, which includes support, education and exercise options but with no attention paid to continence promotion or pelvic floor muscle function. The program will be supervised by local exercise physiologists and delivered in a format that suits you best.</summary>
