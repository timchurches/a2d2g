  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) is a structured group intervention for people with mild to moderate dementia aimed at improving cognition and social functioning.

The initial course of CST involves 45-minute group sessions, held twice a week over seven weeks (or weekly with two 45 minute sessions and a 30 minute break). Maintenance CST (MCST) follows on from the initial course and is a weekly 45-minute 24-session group program. The content of the sessions is designed to stimulate mental function by focusing on the retained abilities of people with dementia and by doing so in a varied, interesting and fun way, through group interactions, games and puzzles, and by sights and sounds. 

This project aims to
1. To develop an Australian adaptation of the Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) and the Maintenance Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (MCST) programs
2. To pilot and evaluate the adaptations in an Australian setting.

The project will involve adapting the content to Australian conditions, piloting the CST and MCST programs  and evaluation of both the CST and MCST programs. In addition family members and carers (support persons) will be ask for input and feedback regarding their perceptions of the program's efficacy as well as in the latter part of the maintenance program, being informed what was beneficial and/or enjoyed by their relative/friend.</summary>
