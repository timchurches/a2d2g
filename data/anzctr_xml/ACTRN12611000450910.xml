  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the time-adjusted SPIDs (Summed Pain Intensity Differences from baseline) of the VAS pain intensity scores up to 24 hours after the first dose of study medication among the 4 treatment groups to determine the form of the dose-response relationship.</outcome>
      <timepoint>VAS pain intensity scores will be collected from patients at the following time points:
Baseline (within 6 hours following completion of the surgery)
At 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes (1 hour), 90 minutes, then 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours after the first dose of study medication when participants are staying at the hospital. 
At 8, 14, 20 and 24 hours after the first dose of study medication following discharge from the hospital while the participant is awake, and just prior to the dose of rescue medication (if applicable). As participants are being dosed every 6 hours they may need to be woken for some doses in which case the VAS will be recorded immediately before each dose

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomization will occur at the study site, once participant eligibility for the study is confirmed post-operatively. The randomization will be stratified based on baseline VAS pain intensity score measured at rest (moderate pain [VAS 50-69 mm]; severe pain [VAS greater than or equal to 70mm]) and anaesthesia used for the surgery (general anaesthesia or local anaesthesia). Each eligible participant will be assigned to one of the four strata as listed below:
Moderate pain at baseline and general anaesthesia was used for the surgery
Moderate pain at baseline and local anaesthesia was used for the surgery
Severe pain at baseline and general anaesthesia was used for the surgery
Severe pain at baseline and local anaesthesia was used for the surgery
The randomization number for each participant consists of a-two digit stratum number (i.e. 01, 02, 03 and 04) and a-three digit participant number (e.g. 01001, 01002) According to the baseline VAS pain score and the anaesthesia used for the surgery, each eligible participant will be assigned to the appropriate stratum as listed above and then randomized in a sequential order within each stratum.
The site will receive a set of sealed blinding envelopes for each stratum.  Each successive participant will be assigned a unique randomization number.  Participants will be enrolled into the study until a minimum of 140 participants meeting the criteria for the mITT population are in the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be generated prior to any enrolment by computer, by the study statistician.  The sequence will include stratification for baseline pain and anaesthesia used for the surgery and will be arranged within permuted blocks.  The statistician will maintain a confidential schedule of randomization numbers and drug allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The test product Maxigesic (a combination of paracetamol 500 mg and ibuprofen 150 mg per tablet) has been on the market since Oct 2009 with Medsafes approval. The unit dose determined in each tablet is compliant with the maximum OTC dose for each ingredient as per New Zealand regulatory requirements. However, the side effects of each ingredient are dose related which means taking a higher dose may increase the chance of experiencing adverse effects. Recent regulatory reassessments of NSAIDs in some areas have encouraged treatment to be at the lowest effective dose and as short as possible because of the twin risks of GI bleeding and newly identified thromboembolic events. Therefore, it is important to determine the dose response relationship of this combination to allow more definitive dosing recommendations to be made and limit the risk of experiencing adverse effects. 
The primary study hypothesis is the pain relief effects of these three different combination doses and placebo administered will form a dose response curve.</summary>
