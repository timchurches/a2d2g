  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Non-specific spinal pain of at least one week duration. Spinal pain refers to pain that may be associated with either the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar regions of the spine.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Usual Chiropractic Care: a series of two chiropractic treatments to the spine as deemed suitable by a registered chiropractor. Treatments include one or more of the following: spinal manipulation, mobilisation, drop piece, traction, electro- therapies, ultrasound, soft tissue techniques and other manual techniques offered by the chiropractor. Each treatment will be between 10-15 minutes in duration, and the interval between the first and second treatment must be between one week to two weeks. This treatment approach replicates a common pragmatic approach in the field.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham Group: participants will receive two sessions of de-tuned ultrasound and random spinal de-tuned activator treatment by a chiropractor to the regions where spinal pain is experienced. There is no known treatment benefit from the detuned ultrasound machine; however, it has been established in previous trials as a credible treatment option by patients. For the de-tuned activator we will ensure that the amount of pressure exerted by it is no more than the head of the ultrasound transducer. To achieve this we will wind the activator head force to minimum and then administer the force through a wooden tongue depressor at random locations in the spine near the areas of concern. The dimensions of the depressor are 19 mm wide and 150 mm long, although on average only 600 mm of the length will be in contact with the skin.  This means a surface area of 1140 mm2. We measured the force this will provide to the skin using a force transducer. The mean of 5 measured attempts was 3.7 kPa.   To increase the perceived hands on credibility, the chiropractor will be trained to gently place one hand on the area adjacent to the participants spine while delivering the ultrasound and Activator therapies.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse event (yes/no).
Examples of common adverse which occur during chiropractic include: muscle stiffness, increased pain, referred numbness and tingling, and headache.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two days after each of the two treatment sessions.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain, assessed with the Numerical Rating Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two week follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical function, assessed with the Functional Rating Index and one of either the Neck Disability Index, Oswestry Disability Index or Modified Oswestry Disability Index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two week follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minimum Acceptable Outcome. At baseline, the participants will be asked to indicate on a Numerical Rating Scale the minimum level of reduction in pain they would need to experience at the conclusion of trial in order for them to consider it to be an acceptable outcome. Whether the participants' experienced a minimum acceptable outcome will be determined by comparing the baseline data to the scores on the Numerical Rating Scale at two week follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two week follow-up.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Potential participants must be adults, literate in English, and have had spinal pain for more than 1 week. In addition, potential participants must score at least 3 on the NRS and 12 on the FRI as this allows measurement of a minimal clinically significant difference in the improvement direction.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Potential participants will be excluded if they are unable to tolerate manipulation; mobilisation; Activator (Registered Trademark); flexion distraction therapy; traction; soft tissue massage; trigger point therapy; sacro-occipital technique; ultrasound; interferential therapy; TENS;  and applied kinesiology.

Participants will also be excluded if they have any of the following conditions: spinal pain related to cancer or infection; fracture of the spine; spondyloarthropathy; known osteoporosis; progressive upper or lower limb weakness; symptoms of cauda equina syndrome or other significant neurological condition; disc herniation; cardiovascular disease; uncontrolled hypertension; cognitive impairment; blood coagulation disorder, had previous spinal surgery, or a previous history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks; have a pacemaker or other electrical device implanted;are currently pregnant. 
Finally, participants will be excluded if they have a current compensation claim, a substance abuse problem or if they could not commit to the study protocol</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by the use of newspaper advertisements. Any person who responds to the advertisement by phone will be considered a potential candidate and will receive through the mail the following documents: an information letter; a pain diagram to assess symptom location and distribution; the Numerical Rating Scale on which the patients will score their current overall level of spinal pain; Functional Rating Index; a questionnaire inquiring about the minimum amount of change in pain levels that potential participants would consider to be an acceptable outcome; medical history checklist. These documents will be returned in a reply paid envelope and the information will be used to determine eligibility. 

One of the research staff, excluding the research assistant and statistician, will randomly allocate the participants to one of the two groups. A statistician will generate a set of block random numbers allocating persons to either chiropractic care or the sham group. The group assignment will be written on small cards wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Given the limitations associated with previous studies of adverse events during chiropractic care, it is evident that controlled studies are warranted to develop a better understanding of the incidence of adverse events in chiropractic care. This proposition reflects the findings of a recent systematic review that concluded there were no robust data concerning the incidence or prevalence of adverse reactions after chiropractic and recommended urgent investigations to provide definite conclusions as to its safety profile. 

The principal aims of this study are to establish the frequency and severity of adverse effects from short term usual chiropractic treatment of the spine when compared to a sham treatment group. The secondary aim of this study is to establish the efficacy of usual short term chiropractic care for spinal pain when compared to a sham intervention. This will add to the literature on the efficacy of short term usual chiropractic care.</summary>
