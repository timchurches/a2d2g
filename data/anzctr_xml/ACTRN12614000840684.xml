  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 4-week dietary intervention will be undertaken. Participants will be required to incorporate fresh pork meat into their habitual diet. Females will consume 150g of pork meat five days per week and males will consume 150g of pork meat seven days per week. Participants will be given a 2 week supply of frozen pork meat in a freezer bag at visits 1 and 2 to the University of Newcastle. Compliance will be monitored by the participants completing a pork consumption log. A list of pork recipes will be made available to participants. Consultation with a dietitian is not  a part of the study protocol as the intervention, pork meat, is a commonly available product. However, one of the study investigators has a degree in nutrition &amp; dietetics and if requested can give information to the participant. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This study aims to detect a significant increase in serum irisin levels of at least 10% (approximately 3.0 pg/ml). Assuming a SD of difference = 3.5 pg/ml, 24 participants will provide 80% power to demonstrate a difference at alpha = 0.05. Allowing for an additional 25% for participant dropout and non-parametric analysis, we will recruit a total of 30 participants.
The effects of outcome measures will be analysed by paired t-test with a factor of time (baseline and post-intervention) to test for significant differences. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the research is to determine the effect of pork consumption on serum irisin levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Study participants will be adults (aged 18 to 60 yrs) with type 2 diabetes from the Hunter Region, NSW. Participants will be asked to consume diets containing pork meat for a period of 4 weeks.
Blood samples will be collected at baseline and 4 weeks and analysed for irisin, blood glucose and insulin levels. Data will be assessed for a possible role of pork meat consumption on glucose homeostasis.</summary>
