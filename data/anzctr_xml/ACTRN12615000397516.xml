  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women in the intervention group will be enrolled in a coaching program run by the Get Healthy Service which has been adapted specifically for pregnant women (the GWG module). The coaching program comprises up to 10 calls between 15 - 40 minutes in duration by university qualified coaches (8 during pregnancy and 2 after birth). The length is directed by the participant, and can be flexible.  Similar to the standard GHS, the calls are aimed at healthy eating, physical activity and achieving healthy weight gain during pregnancy. Calls are based on behaviour change principles designed to help with goal setting, maintaining motivation, overcoming barriers and making sustainable life changes. The timing of calls is designed to be flexible based on participant preferences. Generally, the schedule for calls pre-delivery: 3 calls in the first 3 weeks, followed by a call every 2-3 weeks, unless requested otherwise from the participant. For post pregnancy calls: 1 call at 10 weeks, 1 call at 14 weeks post delivery, unless requested otherwise by the participant. 

Participants in the coaching arm will receive 10 calls: 8 during pregnancy, 2 post pregnancy. Fewer calls may be conducted if the woman withdraws from the Service, or delivers before her 7th call. 

Compliance to the study will be monitored by recording the number and dates of coaching calls received by a participant and recording reason for withdrawing from the Service in the case of withdrawals 

Participants in the coaching program will also be provided with evidence based materials including pregnancy specific fact sheets, the Having a Baby Book published by NSW Health and the Get Healthy Information booklet which includes generic advice on healthy eating, physical activity and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. All pregnancy specific content is developed based on nationally and internationally endorsed guidelines such as the Australian Dietary Guidelines and US Institute of Medicine Weight Gain during Pregnancy guidelines. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>In additional to usual care provided by the antenatal clinic, women in the control group will receive the evidence based package of materials described above, including advice on healthy eating, physical activity and achieving healthy weight gain during pregnancy. Usual care for this study is  the routine care women receive as part of their antenatal appointments in the hospitals.  
Participants will receive 1 coaching and information call from the Get Healthy Service coach in addition to their usual care, after referral from her midwife (at or before 22 weeks gestation). It is anticipated that the duration of the call will be between 30 to 40 minutes.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size has been calculated based on the ability to detect a difference of 3 kgs in gestational weight gain between intervention and control groups, at 80% power and with expected attrition rate of 30%. Of the 640 women, approximately 165 in total would fall into the normal category and 475 into the overweight/obese category.

Differences between the two groups in mean weight gain will be tested using the independent samples t-test, and the proportion returning to their pre-pregnancy weight 12 months post birth will be analysed using the X2 test. 
Multivariate regression models will be used to estimate odds ratios for gestational weight gain with age, pre-pregnancy BMI, dietary and physical activity scores, weight gain during pregnancy and the type of intervention as independent variables.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) or weight gain during pregnancy is associated with poor child and
maternal health outcomes, including preeclampsia,
gestational diabetes, complications with labour and delivery,
and babies who are born either small or large for gestational age. There is also an increased likelihood of
postpartum obesity in both mothers and their children, which in turn leads to an increased risk of chronic disease
later in life. Estimates from one off studies indicate the prevalence of EGWG in Australia could lie between 38 and
67%.
The NSW Get Healthy Service (GHS) is a telephone based coaching service available to all adults in NSW aged 18
years and over. The NSW Office of Preventive Health (OPH) and NSW Kids and Families have collaborated to
develop a service enhancement or module for the GHS specifically aimed at supporting pregnant women to
achieve appropriate gestational weight gain. An initial pilot phase for the module is proposed to assess
effectiveness of the coaching program, through conduct of a randomised controlled trial.
This RCT will compare the effectiveness of a telephone based coaching program versus provision of information
alone in supporting pregnant women to achieve appropriate gestational weight gain and prevent postpartum weight
retention. The hypothesis is that compared with participants who only receive information, pregnant women enrolled
in the coaching program will be less likely to achieve excessive gestational weight, and be more likely to have
returned to their prepregnancy
weight 12 months after giving birth.
A stratified cluster randomised design will be used, with stratification by prepregnancy
BMI (normal and
overweight/obese) and clustering by hospital. Four hospitals will be invited to participate, with two allocated to the
control arm and two to the intervention arm. Pregnant women will be invited to participate in the trial on their first
booking visit with a midwife, and allocated to an arm depending on the hospital they attend.
Anthropometric (e.g. weight gain or retention) and behavioural (e.g. fruit and vegetable consumption) outcomes for
each group will be compared at 36 weeks gestation and 12 months post birth. Additionally, qualitative feedback on
the feasibility and acceptability of the module (information and coaching components) will be sought from
participants and midwives.</summary>
