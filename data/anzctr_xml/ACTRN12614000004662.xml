    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We anticipate the proportion of participants in the control group who respond will be between 25 and 50%.  A total of 124 participants (62 in each group) has 80% power at 5% significance to detect an absolute difference of 25% responders.  Recruitment of 138 participants allows for a 10% drop-out rate. 

Logistic regression will be used to test for the difference in response rates defined as the proportion of participants who have greater than or equal to two point improvement in the Investigator-rated Rosacea Severity score at week 8 compared to baseline.

The continuous secondary outcome variables will be analysed using ANOVA with baseline readings as a continuous co-variate. Daily self-reported use will be analysed by Poisson regression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A recent pilot study investigating the use and acceptability of Kanuka honey in Rosacea showed a reduction in severity in 70% of subjects, therefore this study treatment  has the potential to be an effective treatment for Rosacea symptoms. In this study 138 adults with Rosacea will apply either Kanuka honey or Cetomacrogol cream to areas of Rosacea on their face for 30-60 minutes twice a day for 8 weeks.

At baseline and after 2 weeks and 8 weeks the patient's Rosacea will be assessed to look at changes in severity.  Participants will complete a diary for 8 weeks to record their daily treatment applications and weekly severity assessment.  Subjects will complete a Dermatology Quality of Life questionnaire at all visits, to note any changes in quality of life.  A visual analogue scale will be completed to note any improvement or worsening of a patient's rosacea at Visits 2 and 3.

This study will investigate the effectiveness of Kanuka honey in treating rosacea, potentially improving the health outcomes of those with the condition, and will contribute to the knowledge base around the use of honey for the treatment of skin conditions.</summary>
