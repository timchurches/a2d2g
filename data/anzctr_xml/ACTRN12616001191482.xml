    <interventions>The intervention is a fifteen minute one to one training workshop. It uses a simulated defibrillator [ALSi] to practice skills involved in rhythm recognition, defibrillation, cardioversion and pacing.  All trainers are experience critical care physicians who record adherence to ALS guidelines using a data sheet and the logging function of the simulator. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Zap and Run is a ten minute one on one training workshop focused on developing and maintaining skills in use of a cardiac defibrillator for rhythm recognition, defibrillation, cardioversion and external pacing. It utilises the portable ALSi simulator.
This project aims to evaluate the skills of participants while undertaking the workshop. Participants will be asked to rate their training experience and time to treat will be measured using the logging features of the simulator. This evaluation will be used to determine the skills gap and need for training.

The workshop consists of testing the skills of participants using a simulated defibrillator over seven scenarios. The simulator logs the times and actions of the participant. The instructor then explains and corrects any errors and the scenario is run again if necessary to confirm learning before moving to the next scenario. At the beginning and end of the workshop the participant will fill out a workshop evaluation questionnaire.</summary>
