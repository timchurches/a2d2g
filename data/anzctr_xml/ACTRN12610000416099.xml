  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Venous Window Needle Guide is implanted onto the surface of an AV fistula by a vascular surgeon using a surgical technique.  The skin will be closed over the implant.  The duration of the surgical procedure will be approximately 30 minutes.  Access of the AV fistula with a fistula needlle through the implant will be begin approximately three weeks following the intervention.  Patients will be observed for six months post intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will have both intervention and non-intervention A-V fistula access sites.  The non-intervention access site will act as the comparator access site to the intervention access site.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AV fistula access through Venous Window Needle Guide utilizing buttonhole cannulation technique resulting in hemodialysis session within normal pressure and flow parameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful placement of study device, defined as placement of the Venous Window Needle Guide with proper attachment, alignment and palpability on a native A-V fistula in an upper extremity</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of intervention procedure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful cannulation (blood return) of AV fistula through the Venous Window Needle Guide with sharp fistulae needle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 - 5 weeks post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful cannulation (blood return) of AV fistula through Venous Window Needle Guide with blunt fistula needle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 3 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

Buttonhole cannulation technique is appropriate.  4.  AV Fistula is or may be difficult to palpate or cannulate (short length, non-palpable, limited fistula life expectancy, etc.).  5.  AV Fistula does not have flow abnormalities</inclusivecriteria>
