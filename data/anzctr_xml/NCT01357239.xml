      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Behavioral Symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome Using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community Edition (ABC-CFX) Total Score in Stratum I Patients Exposed to AFQ056 100 mg Bid - The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community edition (ABC-C) is a 58-item, caregiver-rated symptom checklist for assessing problem behaviors of children and adults with mental retardation at home, in residential facilities, and work training centers. The assessment was done by attributing to each item a score from 0 ("not at all a problem") to 3 ("problem is severe in degree") and the total score ranks from 0 to 174. The data collected from the full, 58-item ABC-C were analyzed according to the modified FXS ABC-C algorithm (ABC-CFX) for which 55 items and six subscales (irritability, lethargy/withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech and social avoidance) plus the total score were considered, and for which the total score ranks from 0 to 165. Stratum I included patients whose Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene was fully methylated</outcome>

The total score ranks from 0 to 129. The behaviors are grouped into six domains: ritualistic behavior (range 0 to 18); sameness behavior (range 0 to 33); stereotypic behavior (range 0 to 18); self-injurious behavior (range 0 to 24); compulsive behavior (range 0 to 24); and restricted interests (range 0 to 12).
