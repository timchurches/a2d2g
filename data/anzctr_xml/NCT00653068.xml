  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Treatment: other - 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy
Treatment: drugs - methotrexate
Treatment: drugs - leucovorin calcium
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin
Other interventions - filgrastim
Treatment: drugs - carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - thiotepa
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Other interventions - laboratory biomarker analysis

Experimental: Treatment - Within 2-6 weeks after induction therapy or radiation therapy, patients receive high-dose carboplatin IV and high-dose thiotepa IV on days 1 and 2 and undergo autologous PBSC rescue on approximately day 4. Patients also receive G-CSF IV or SC once daily until ANC recovers.
Consolidation therapy followed by stem cell rescue repeats every 28 days for 3 courses (C) and 3D-CRT to the brain (and the spine if needed) 5 days a week for 5-6 weeks (R), the order of which depends on patient age, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy together with 3-dimensional
      conformal radiation therapy and an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant to see
      how well it works in treating young patients with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of the
      central nervous system. Giving high-dose chemotherapy before an autologous peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or
      killing them. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, helps stem cells move from
      the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. Chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy is then given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells
      are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by
      the chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</summary>
