  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Adapt Pericardial Patch (CardioCel) (4 x 4 cm) will be used for the repair of defects associated with Congenital Heart Disease. The research question is to assess whether the patch's integrity is maintained during follow-up (performation or aneurismal formation). CardioCel is comprised of tissue engineered bovine pericardium that is cross linked in diluted glutaraldehyde solution and treated with the ADAPT TEP technology. Only one size of CardioCel is available (4x4cm). CardioCel may be sutured or stapled in place. CardioCel is stored at room temperature, never below 5 degrees celcius or above 25 degrees celcius and away from direct heat source. The implant should not be re-sterilised. No extensive rinsing is required. The patch is immersed in sterile physiological saline to avoid dehydration of the patch prior to implantation. Implantation specifics will be determined at the time of surgery depending on the nature of the repair needed. In general, the surgeon may cut and shape CardioCel to suit the requirements of the procedure. Care needs to be taken when handling the device, for example by using atraumatic forceps, to avoid tearing or otherwise damaging the patch. The device needs to be examined for damage prior to implant. If one side of the patch appears smoother than the other, the device should be implanted with the smoother surface facing the blood flow surface. CardioCel may be cut, folded or layered as required. If layering, it is preferable to cut the material into separate sheets, creating edges rather than folding it, presenting the maximum number of cut surfaces to body tissue, to enhance penetration by cell and blood vessels. CardioCel may be sutured or stapled in place. It will hold sutures easily and firmly and will remain in situ whilst it is incorporated into surrounding tissues. Any unused pieces of CardioCel should be discarded. The solution in which the CardioCel is sterilised/stored should be disposed of using normal hospital chemical waste disposal methods. The surgical procedure time is dependent upon the severity of the condition being treated and any intra-operative complications that may occur. Routinely these type of procedures take approximately two hours. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To confirm the safety profile of CardioCel when used to repair the defect(s) associated with Congenital Heart Disease being studied. Adverse event profile will be assessed intraoperatively, perioperatively and at 30 days.  All adverse events will be recorded throughout the duration of the study.  A cardio echo will be performed at a number of follow up visits (30 days and 12 months post op) to assess the haemodynamic performance of the area around the graft and to detect any clinical abnormalities.  </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate echocardiographic aspect at 30 days and 12 months compared to baseline. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The echocardiograph will be performed at 30 days post op and 12 months post op.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The evaluation of incidence of short and long term calcification of the grated patch and assessment of patch integrity will be by echocardiograph. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evidence of calcification and patch integrity will be confirmed by echocardiograph at 12 months post op.      </timepoint>

    <concealment>Prior to performing any study specific procedure a signed consent form will be obtained for each subject.  As subjects are below the legal age, a parent, legal guardian or person with power of attorney must also sign the consent form. The investigator will conduct the informed consent discussion and will check that the subject and their legally acceptable representative comprehend the information provided and answer any questions about the study.  Consent will be voluntary and free from coercion.  The investigator that conducted the consent discussion will also sign the consent form.  A copy will be given to the patient and their representative and the fact that the subject consented to the study will be recorded in the subjects' medical record.  When all the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been addressed and the eligibility of the subject confirmed, the subject may be scheduled for implant and considered enrolled into the Study.  As this is a non-randomised trial, all study participants will receive the CardioCel and allocation is not concealed.  </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CardioCel is a new method to prepare and treat biological tissues used in human surgical procedures. This means that the tissue (here bovine pericardium) used to close or repair defects associated with congenital heart disease has not been approved for this purpose in Australia or in other parts of the world. This project is going to allow us to show if the CardioCel integrity is maintained. We believe the CardioCel to be equivalent to currently available patches used to repair congenital heart disease</summary>
