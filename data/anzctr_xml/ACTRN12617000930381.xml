    <interventions>Observational management of Cervical Intraepthelial Neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 in women aged under 25 years for 24 months i.e., 6-monthly colposcopy examination with a directed cervical biopsy (histology), and cervical smear (cytology) undertaken by a trained colposcopist at a hospital-based colposcopy clinic for a total of 2 years (or until the woman turns 25 years old, whichever is sooner).

Attention will be paid to ensure the whole transformation zone and lesion are seen and that there is no colposcopic evidence of glandular or invasive disease.  If a lesion persists, representative biopsies must be taken, two if possible and one from each quadrant in larger lesions.  If the colposcopy is normal, we encourage the taking of a biopsy from the transformation zone in the previously affected area.

Treatment is indicated if the patient becomes symptomatic, there is colposcopic or cytological suspicion of invasive or glandular disease, the colposcopy is unsatisfactory and abnormal cytology persists, the histology is reported as invasive or glandular disease, the patient requests treatment, turns 25 years old without demonstrating persistent regression, or is unable to attend further follow up and the lesion persists.  If treatment is performed a trial Completion Form is filled in and the patient subsequently managed as per normal practice.

If CIN2 or 3 persists, or cytology is reported as ASCH or HSIL, colposcopy should be repeated at 6 monthly intervals to 2 years.  If CIN2 or 3, or ASCH or HSIL cytology persists, at this point, the patient should be treated.  At this point, a trial Completion form is filled in.

Regression is:
- normal colposcopy, normal/low grade cytology, no biopsy taken OR
- normal colposcopy, normal/low grade cytology, normal/low grade histology OR
- low grade colposcopy, normal/low grade cytology, normal/low grade histology OR
- CIN 2 colposcopy but normal/low grade cytology, normal/low grade histology
 
Regression is not confirmed:
- CIN 3 colposcopy but normal/low grade cytology, normal/low grade histology
- if a lesion is present and a biopsy not taken 
- if cytology is ASCH or worse or 
- a smear is not taken or unsatisfactory

If regression is documented women must have a follow-up at 6 months with;
- a repeat colposcopy and smear and
- a biopsy if a lesion is present 

If following the repeat colposcopy, criteria for regression is again met, the lesion has demonstrated persistent regression.

Following persistent regression and after discussion between the colposcopist and the woman, the patient may be discharged from the colposcopy clinic.  If this is the case, a trial Completion Form is filled and follow-up is then as per National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP) guidelines following high grade abnormality with a smear in 6 months (by primary smear taker).  If the woman is not discharged from colposcopy clinic, a repeat colposcopy occurs at 6-12 months and completion form is filled at follow-up visit 24 months following initial biopsy.  Management should be based on the NCSP guidelines.

If regression is demonstrated at the 24 month follow up for the first time, the colposcopist will discuss either immediate treatment or follow up at 6 months.  However at this point, a trial Completion form will be filled in, and the patient subsequent management should be based on the results of this colposcopy and the NCSP guidelines.

If following apparent regression, at the next follow up CIN2 or worse is seen or cytology is reported as ASCH or worse, 6 monthly follow up must continue unless the woman elects to be treated or continues on the trial protocol</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants whose lesions regress to CIN1 or less.

Regression is defined as return to normal/low grade cytology and histology, and persistent regression is defined as regression on two or more successive 6 monthly visits.</outcome>

      <outcome>Proportion of participants who progress to microinvasive or invasive cancer.  

Cervical cancer is staged by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system.  Microinvasive cancer (also known as Stage 1A) is a lesion in which neoplastic cells invade the stroma, in one or more sites, with a maximum depth of 5.0 mm below the base of the epithelium and maximum width of 7.0 mm, without lymphatic or blood vessel involvement. The depth of invasion should be measured from the base of the epithelium, either surface or glandular, from which it originates. Microinvasive cancer (stage IA) can be further subdivided  into stages 1A1 and 1A2. Stage 1A1 encompasses stromal invasion &lt;3.0 mm in depth and &lt;7.0 mm in width, while stage 1A2 encompasses stromal invasion &gt;3.05.0 mm in depth and &lt;7.0 mm in width.  

Invasive cancer (&gt;Stage 1A) is a lesion in which neoplastic cells invade the stroma with a depth greater than 5.0 mm.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary outcomes will be understand the natural history of CIN3 in young women and will include proportions of participants whose lesions regress, progress or persist (remain CIN3) over 24 months.  

Correlation of clinical factors with regression, including age, smoking, gravidity, ethnicity, colposcopic impression, lesion size.

Correlation of cytology/pathology factors with regression, including referral cytology, cytology at first visit, cytology at first follow up, HPV type at first visit, HPV type at follow up, immunohistochemistry at first visit.

Descriptive statistics, life table analysis, univariate and multivariate regression analysis will also be performed.  

While there is evidence from an older mean age group (mean age 38 years, range 21-74) that 20-31% of women with CIN3 who received diagnostic punch or wedge biopsy but no adequate treatment will develop invasive cancer of the cervix or vaginal vault within 10 years, it is more difficult to predict the rate of progression in a solely younger age group within two years.  However, if we require that the study should be terminated if microinvasive squamous carcinomas are diagnosed &gt;2% of study participants, n=200 would be needed to identify a mean 2% progression to invasive cancer rate (95% CI 0.008  0.050).  Including an additional n=10 to account for loss to follow-up (maximum acceptable rate of 5%), we will aim to recruit n=210.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In 2018, the NZ cervical screening age will increase from 20 to 25 years.  This will lead to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of high grade cervical abnormalities in young women of up to 5 years.  Cervical cancer is rare in young women and cervical screening in women aged 20-24 has been shown to have little to no impact on rates of invasive cervical cancer up to age 30.  Despite this, currently, ~1100 NZ women aged 20-24 years are diagnosed with high grade cervical cell abnormalities (CIN2 and 3) each year.  Usually these women are treated and we have a poor understanding of the impact of deferred diagnosis on these lesions.  However, there is growing evidence that a high proportion of CIN2 lesions naturally resolve in young women.  In contrast, data regarding CIN3 regression rates are lacking and the impact of delayed CIN3 diagnosis and treatment in young women is poorly understood.  The study will investigate the natural history of CIN3 in young women via a large multicentre prospective study of CIN3 observational management (CIN3MA) in women aged &lt;25 years over 24 months.  Women &lt;25 years with biopsy-diagnosed CIN3 (including CIN2/3) will be identified in large colposcopy centres in NZ and invited to participate.  Pathology and cytology specimens will be reviewed at a multidisciplinary meeting.  Provided they meet eligibility criteria, n=210 consenting women will undergo observational management (i.e., repeat colposcopy, cytology, and cervical biopsy performed every 6 months for up to 24 months).  Treatment is indicated if the patient becomes symptomatic, there is suspicion of invasive or glandular disease, the patient requests treatment, the patient completes 24 months follow-up or at their first follow-up after their 25th birthday (whichever is sooner) without demonstrating persistent regression.  Regression is defined as two consecutive colposcopy follow-ups showing CIN1 or less.  The trial will be terminated prematurely if; invasive carcinoma of the cervix (&gt;1a) is diagnosed in any study participant; or microinvasive squamous carcinomas are diagnosed &gt;2% of study participants.  Primary outcome measures: Proportion of participants 1) whose lesions regress to CIN1 or less, 2) who progress to invasion, 3) who require treatment, and 4) who are lost to follow up.  Clinical and cytology/pathology predictors of outcome will also be investigated (e.g., HPV genotype, smoking, lesion size, other immunohistochemical markers, etc.).  We hypothesise that CIN3 observational management (CIN3MA) can be safely performed for women aged &lt;25 years in a large multicentre trial and in fact, a significant proportion will regress.  </summary>
