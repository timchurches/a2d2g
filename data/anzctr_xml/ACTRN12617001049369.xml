    <interventions>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common problem affecting significant number of preterm infants with devastating long-term outcome.
Different contributing etiologies have been studied to explain the cause of IVH.
Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) are routinely used interchangeably in preterm infants for central venous access.
The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of IVH-PVH in preterm infants using UVC versus those with PICC.
200 preterm infants admitted to NICU, Dubai Hospital will be enrolled prospectively in this study with 100 infants in each arm (UVC group and PICC group).
Gestational age of infants will be ranging from 24 to 30 weeks with a mean of 27 weeks.
The protocol of NICU is to insert UVC or PICC routinely after stabilization of sick preterm infants for proper administration of medications and parenteral nutrition. UVC or PICC insertion is done after admission to NICU by A well trained neonatologist registrar on call and kept for a total duration of 7-10 days for the UVC and for 2-3 weeks for PICC.
Cranial ultrasound scan will be carried on all infants in the two groups as per NICU policy, first scan on day 3  7, second scan on day 10-14 and third on 34-36 weeks GA and or before discharge.
IVH-PVH grading and associated complications of periventricular leukomalacia PVL and post- hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation PHVD will be recorded for both groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common problem affecting significant number of preterm infants with devastating long-term outcome.
The etiology of IVH is multifactorial and attributed mainly to disturbance of cerebral blood flow.
Placing UVC shortly after birth would keep ductus venosus opened and simulate the unique preferential blood flood flow of fetal circulation via inferior vena cava to the right atrium and then patent foramen ovale PFO to the left atrium. This would directly influences the cerebral blood flow stability in that subset of infants with a limited cerebral autoregulation.
This does not happen under physiological conditions with drop of pulmonary blood pressure soon after birth and reverse of shunt through PFO from left to right.
In sick preterm infants with RDS and variable degrees of hypoxemia, the pulmonary pressure remains at higher levels for considerable time with occasional right to left or bidirectional shunt.
On the other hand, placing PICC instead would avoid the direct pathway through PFO to left atrium and eventually to the brain. Accordingly, in this way it could theoretically reduce the incidence of IVH by avoiding the swinging of cerebral blood flow.
This  prospective study will be conducted at NICU, Dubai hospital. Dubai, UAE.
200 preterm infants with gestational age ranging from 24 to 30 weeks (mean GA 27 weeks) and weight range from 500 Gm to 1500 Gm. will be enrolled in the study, 100 infants in each arm (UVC group and PICC group). NICU registrar on call will  open a sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelope indicating the treatment arm, either UVC or PICC insertion.
Demographic data including GA, weight, gender, antenatal steroids, mode of delivery, Apgar score, resuscitation, mode of ventilation support, hemodynamic stability, and surfactant administration will be considered equally on assignment of infants to either group.
Routine cranial ultrasound will be carried out by trained neonatologists according to NICU policy, first scan on day 3  7, second scan on day 10-14 and third on 34-36 weeks GA and before discharge.to check the presence of IVH, the grade, and associated complications PVL or post -hemorrhagic ventricular dilatation.
Statistical analysis of collected data comparing the two groups will be carried on to answer the question if central lines insertion is superior to UVC in decreasing the incidence of IVH in sick preterm infants in the first 2 weeks of life.as primary outcome .
