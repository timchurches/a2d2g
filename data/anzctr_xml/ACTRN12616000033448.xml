  <interventions>
    <interventions>Over the course of the protocol participants will take a single dose of each drug:

A 10mg single dose of zolpidem administered orally via a capsule before bed; 

A 10mg single dose of temazepam administered orally via a capsule before bed.

There are four groups: Placebo, temazepam and zolpidem are woken during the first slow wave sleep episode after sleep onset. Another placebo group is woken during the first rapid eye movement episode.

The wash out period between treatments is 7 days. </interventions>
    <comparator>There are two placebo treatments:

Placebo group 1 is woken during the first slow wave sleep episode after sleep onset. 

Placebo group 2 is woken during the first rapid eye movement episode after sleep onset.

The placebo capsule contains microcellulose.

Each placebo capsule is identical to the zolpidem and temazepam capsules. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is a composite of speech characteristics. These are the following speech characteristics:

pause length;
speech rate;
changes to fundamental frequency;
variability to fundamental frequency;
change in pitch;
pitch variability;
intensity. 
These outcomes are assessed by computer analysing speech samples elicited by reading passages, sustaining vowel sounds, and free talking.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately three hours before habitual bedtime. Habitual bedtime is determined using a combination of participant sleep diary and data from an actigraph (a sleep/wake-measuring device).</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A randomisation process has been used to order the four conditions for each participant. A crossover design ensures every participant is exposed to all four conditions: temazepam, zolpidem and two placebo conditions. Allocation concealment is in place as all drugs for all four conditions are received in numbered vials. The allocation of the drugs to vial number is only known by the dispensing pharmacist. The allocation of the drugs to vial number was noted on a slip of paper and placed in a sealed envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>The software Randlist was used to generate a list which randomises the sequence the four conditions are presented to each participant. </sequence>
