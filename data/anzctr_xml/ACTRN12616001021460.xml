  <interventions>
    <interventions>Combination of sodium valproate and metformin will be administered as oral tablets.
Three dose levels of the drugs are planned. First level  a fixed dose of Met and VPA at 500 mg twice daily will be given to the participants. If no dose limiting toxicity is seen in this cohort I (N=3), after the 4 weeks of drug administration, participants will be next dosed at level 2 dosing where the starting dose is 500 mg twice daily for both drugs. In this cohort II (N=3), Met dose alone will be increased to 1000 mg twice daily from week 2 onwards while VPA dose will be maintained at 500 mg twice daily. If no dose limiting toxicity is seen in this cohort II, subjects will be dosed at next dose level. Subjects in this cohort III (N=6) will have both the drug doses increased from the starting dose of 500 mg twice daily to 1000 mg twice daily sequentially. Dose escalation will not proceed beyond the 1000 mg twice daily schedule. Participants in cohort I will receive 4 weeks on Met and VPA 500mg each twice daily; cohort II week 1 Met and VPA 500mg each twice daily then Met 1000mg and VPA 500mg twice daily from week 2 -4; cohort III week 1 Met and VPA 500mg each twice daily then Met 1000mg and VPA 500mg twice daily from week 2; then Met 1000 mg and VPA 1000 mg twice daily week 3-4. All study drugs will be ceased at least 48 hours but no more than 7 days prior to surgery. Participants will be requested to return any left over tablets.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Metformin (MET) in combination with sodium valproate (VPA) for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer for which radical prostatectomy is planned within the next 6-8 weeks.

Study details
Participants enrolled in this trial will receive a combination of MET and VPA in increasing doses depending on the cohort they are enrolled in. The study drugs will be administered for a total of 4 weeks just prior to the planned surgery for removing the prostate

It is hoped that this trial will provide information on the optimal dose of MET plus VPA to administer to prostate cancer patients, which may be an effective treatment which is safe and tolerated by patients.</summary>
