  <interventions>
    <interventions>Reduced Facebook use for two weeks. Participants were asked to "restrict [their] Facebook use as much as possible for two weeks and were told During this time, please avoid using Facebook, including through mobile phones, tablets, and computers.

Adherence was measured by asking participants whether they had used Facebook Much more/more/same/less/much less than usual.

Study involvement lasted 4 weeks. Two weeks of intervention followed-up by two weeks of control (or vice versa, due to the crossover design). There was no washout period.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were randomised on a rolling basis after completing online informed consent form. Unpredictability of the allocation sequence was ensured by using a computerised random number generation process by the investigator. Furthermore, at randomisation, no data other than the participant’s email address had been collected. Participants were not blinded to group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>rand() function in Excel. Simple randomisation using a 1:1 ratio was used: those with a value of less than 0.5 were allocated to Group A, those with a value of 0.5 or more were allocated to Group B.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The statistical significance of the primary outcome (differences in WEMWBS scores between the intervention and control period) was calculated using a paired t-test. Only participants who completed both sets of questionnaires were entered in this analysis.

In a sensitivity analysis, all observations were entered into a regression analysis using Statas clustered sandwich estimator (vce(cluster) function) to allow for within-participant correlation in data with repeated observations on individuals, and to minimise missingness.

For secondary outcomes, we stratified analyses by gender (female vs. male) and relationship status (single vs. in a relationship).

All analyses were done in Stata, version 12.1. Observations were entered according to group allocation, following an intention-to-treat approach. Statistical assumptions for paired t-tests were tested using a histogram of the differences in scores and by plotting differences in scores against average scores.

The sample size of 78 was calculated assuming a power of 0.8, an alpha of 0.05, a minimal detectable difference in means of 2 points in WEMWBS score, a 20% dropout rate, and a standard error of measurement (SEM) of 2.78 (mean of the five SEMs reported in Maheswaran et al. 2012, Health and Quality of Life Outcomes)</statisticalmethods>
