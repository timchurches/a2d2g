  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Compumedics Somnilink SPAP - Auto-titrating CPAP
Treatment: devices - Resmed Autoset S8 - Auto-titrating CPAP

Active Comparator: Autoset S8 - Single night auto-titrating CPAP treatment using the reference device (Resmed Autoset S8) with polysomnographic monitoring

Experimental: Somnilink SPAP - Single night auto-titrating CPAP treatment using the test device with polysomnographic monitoring


Treatment: devices: Compumedics Somnilink SPAP - Auto-titrating CPAP
Subjects will undergo the auto-titrating CPAP treatments in the Monash Sleep Centre with the test and reference devices during two nights in random order. There will be an interval of at least seven days between the two treatments to eliminate the carryover effect.
Full polysomnographic (PSG) recording will be conducted during both treatment nights. The recorded physiological signals during PSG will include signals identical to those used during the baseline diagnostic PSG. The patients fill KSS questionnaire immediately after the PSG study.
All PSG recordings (both treatment studies and the baseline diagnostic study) will be scored according to the AASM rules by the same sleep technician blinded to the presence and type of auto-titrating CPAP treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) difference between test and reference APAP treatment - AHI is the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AHI difference between test treatment and baseline - AHI is the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep.
This endpoint is introduced to further demonstrate effectiveness of the test treatment in addition to the body of knowledge deduced from historical evidence for the reference treatment and selection conditions of the margin of non-inferiority</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Arousal Index (AI) differences between the test and reference APAP treatments and between the test treatment and baseline - AI is the number of occurrences of arousal events per hour of sleep.
AI differences will be tested between test and control as non-inferiority, and between test and baseline as superiority.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) differences between the test and reference APAP treatments and between the test treatment and baseline - RDI is the number of respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas) and respiratory event related arousals (RERA) [39] per hour of sleep.
RDI will be tested between test and control as non-inferiority, and between test and baseline as superiority.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep Efficiency (SE) differences between the test and reference APAP treatments and between the test treatment and baseline - SE is defined as the ratio of sleep time to the time in bed.
SE will be tested between test and control as non-inferiority, and between test and baseline as superiority.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oxygen desaturation index (DI) differences between the test and reference APAP treatments and between the test treatment and baseline - DI is defined as the number of oxygen desaturations &gt;= 3% per hour of sleep.
DI will be tested between test and control as non-inferiority, and between test and baseline as superiority.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) difference between the test and reference APAP treatments. - KSS is a simple questionnaire for subjective momentary evaluation of sleepiness/alertness [41]. A recent clinical trial [34] included subjective evaluation after polysomnography (PSG) as one of the secondary outcome measures. The KSS difference between the test treatment and baseline will not be estimated because KSS is included into the standard diagnostic PSG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The patients fill KSS questionnaire immediately after each PSG study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Test treatment AHI - The study will test the hypothesis of the test treatment AHI being below a threshold of 9 that is within the range 5-10.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks after study completion</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition of disordered breathing characterised by
      intermittent partial and/or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep. The participants,
      naive to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), recently diagnosed with OSA, will
      undergo two automatic CPAP titration studies with collection of polysomnographic (PSG) data.
      The data will be analysed to assess effectiveness of Compumedics auto-CPAP device in the
      normalisation of sleep disordered breathing in OSA patients, with respect to another
      auto-CPAP device.</summary>
