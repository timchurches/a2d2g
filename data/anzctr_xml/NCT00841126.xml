          5. (a) Subject receiving phosphate binder medication(s) at screening, must have been on a
             stable regimen (dose and medication) for at least 1 month prior to screening and will
             remain on this regimen until entry into the washout period OR(b) Subjects (i) is not
             currently receiving any phosphate binding medication at screening (or medication
             likely to act as a phosphate binder) and (ii) must not have done so for at least one
             month and (iii) has sustained hyperphosphatemia.

          6. Willing to abstain from taking any phosphate binder or oral magnesium-, oral aluminum-
             or oral iron-containing products and preparations other than the study medication.

          7. If required to take &gt;6000 mg/day of fermagate, the subject will be willing to have at
             least three meals per day.

             Specifically, for randomization and inclusion into the treatment period, one of the
             following criteria must be fulfilled:

          8. (a) Is not receiving phosphate binding medication at screen and has a screen serum
             phosphate value above 3.0 mmol/L (9.3 mg/dL)OR(b) Has a serum phosphate value of =1.94
             mmol/L (=6.0 mg/dL) at Washout Visit 2 to 4 or above 3.0 mmol/L (9.3 mg/dL) at visit 1

    <summary>Magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate is a phosphate binder that absorbs phosphate from food,
      reducing the amount that the body can absorb.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate in
      subjects requiring hemodialysis, compared with a marketed phosphate binder, lanthanum
      carbonate and placebo.</summary>
