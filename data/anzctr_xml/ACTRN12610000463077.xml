  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project seeks to investigate how an online intervention is being used. Specifically, the project seeks to determine which user characteristics affect attrition. If differences in characteristics can be identified, this knowledge may assist in creating a more tailored individualised treatment programs.

The Mindfulness Online program will be placed on Swinburne Universitys eTherapy Unit website. People visiting the website will be invited to participate in the project. Mindfulness Online consists of three sessions designed to make an individual more mindful or being aware of moment-to-moment experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, images, sensations); simply accepting what is there and not wanting it to change it in any way. Participants are recommended to spend a week on each session before moving onto the next session so as to practise and to reinforce material learnt. Each session will last approximately 20 minutes. Participants will be given activities (five minutes per day) to complete offline to practise the principles of mindfulness and asked to provide feedback on this practise at the next session.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Swinburne University of Technology is currently running a research trial to indentify which people use Mindfulness Online, an internet-based program designed to teach you skills to improve mental and physical wellbeing. We are interested in how often they use and for what reasons do they stop using the program.

Swinburne University of Technologys eTherapy Unit and National eTherapy Centre (NeTC) have developed internet-based treatment programs that are available for the general public. These programs can be used to treat clinical conditions (Anxiety Online) and to promote health and well being (Living Well Feeling Well). As part of developing effective programs, information on users and their usage of such programs is needed. The current project seeks to predict which user characteristics influence adherence and attrition in Mindfulness Online, an online intervention targeting well being. The results of this research will be used to improve the way internet-based interventions are developed and offered to the public.</summary>
