  <interventions>
    <interventions>At least 6 weeks with subcutaneous enoxaparin only, dosage 1.5mg/kg daily. Duration of treatment will be determined by the treating physician in accordance with American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Guidelines with consideration of individual patient clinical profile and risk factors and the results of follow up ultrasound. Most patients will receive treatment for three months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: subcutaneous enoxaparin injections dosage 1.5mg/kg daily commenced immediately after diagnosis and commencing oral warfarin within a couple of days. Warfarin doses will be adjusted according to International Normalised Ratio (INR) blood tests. Once INR is in the range of 2.0 to 3.0 (usually 5 to 10 days) enoxaparin will be ceased and warfarin continues for at least 6 weeks. Warfarin dosage will be individualised for each patient and is expected to be within the range of 1mg-10mg per oral daily.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To show that the average time patients receive therapeutic warfarin dosing, is at least 25% lower than the average time patients treated with enoxaparin spend in therapeutic range. Time in therapeutic range for warfarin group will be calculated from INR results using Rosendaals' linear interpolation method. In the enoxaparin group therapeutic treatment will be measured by determining  the number of missed doses of study drug as recorded in patient diaries and records of the number of pre-filled syringes used. An anti-factor Xa test will be conducted on day 14 (4 hours post injection time) to confirm that the treatment dose results in therapeutic anti-coagulation in that individual.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate patient expectations and satisfaction with enoxaparin compared with standard warfarin treatment using the PACT-Q (Perception of Anticoagulant Treatment Questionnaires).</outcome>
      <timepoint>After the first six weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the cost of treating a calf Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) with enoxaparin than costs associated with warfarin including drug costs, laboratory costing and health care professional time. Resource utilization will be estimated by way of hospital records and patient diaries for both treatment groups. Resource data to be targeted will include doctor visits, drug costs and drug administration costs eg nurse visits, laboratory tests. Adverse reaction (e.g. recurrent Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Embolism (PE), bleeding event or post thrombotic syndrome) incidence and treatment costs will also be estimated. Hospital and government information sources will be accessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout the first six weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore whether enoxaparin is as effective as warfarin in terms of clot resolution and bleeding events. A follow up ultrasound will be conducted at the week 6 visit unless symptomatic recurrence has occurred prior to 6 week visit. Recurrent VTE is defined as a thrombus in the contralateral leg, another deep vein of the same leg, or in the same venous system with a proximal extension of at least 5 cm above the original thrombus. Changes on ultrasounds from baseline will be rated by an independent blinded adjudicator. In addition patients will be asked to report any worsening signs or symptoms of Venous Thromboembolism (eg leg swelling or pain, shortness of breath etc.) up to 12 weeks after randomisation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is a research study into an alternative treatment for calf vein blood clots (Deep Vein Thrombosis).The purpose is to investigate whether treatment with Enoxaparin produces better outcomes than standard treatment with Warfarin. We will be looking at how much of the time patients are receiving optimal doses of each of the drugs (therapeutic dose), patient satisfaction with each of the treatments and the costs associated with each of the treatments. 

The patients who participate in this trial will be randomised to receive either;
1. Warfarin treatment group: Patients receive tablets of Warfarin but you will also receive Enoxaparin (fine needle injections) for the first few days while their body adjusts to Warfarin. The dose of Warfarin needs to be customised for each patient. This is done with blood tests called INR tests every few days to start with and then once per week or once per fortnight depending how your body responds to the warfarin. This is standard treatment and will probably be managed by their general practitioner (GP).

2. Enoxaparin group: patients assigned to the Enoxaparin group will receive daily injections with a very fine needle into the skin of their abdomen or legs. Most patients will be able to learn to give themselves these injections. Alternatively we could teach a friend or relative to give them to the patient, or in some cases we may be able to provide someone to come to their house to give them the injections.

We think that treatment of symptomatic calf Deep Vein Thrombosis with enoxaparin may result in a higher chance of receiving therapeutic treatment (resulting from their being less variability in how patients bodies respond to be drug), a higher level patient satisfaction due to the decreased number of doctors visits, blood tests and dietary restrictions, and lower costs to the health care system than treatment with warfarin.</summary>
