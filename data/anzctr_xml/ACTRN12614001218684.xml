  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fitbit one worn on the dominant hip 
Fitbit wristbands worn on the left and right wrist
Jawbone UP worn on the left and right wrist
Garmin Vivofit worn on the left and right wrist
All devices will be worn throughout the exercise tests and the activities of dailiy living, this will be observed by the investigator. 
Exercises to be performed treadmill walking at 4.8 k/h, cycling at 1.5 W/kg body mass each of which will last for 6 minutes.
The activities of daily living (whisking eggs, folding clothes, sweeping the floor, making a sandwich, playing on an iPad and typing) will each last 5 minutes.
All exercises will be completed during 2 trials (exactly the same- separated by at least 24 hours), to determine the reliability of the measures on all devices. All the devices will be worn at the same time by all participants during all activities on both trials. The total time for each trial will be 90 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>All devices will be compared to the oxygen cost of the exercise measured via an expired air sample (Cortex Metalyser 2) for energy expenditure and accelerometry (actigtaph GT3-XPW).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Commercially available activity wristbands such as Fitbit, JawBoneUP and Garmin Vivofit are becoming increasingly popular as a method of monitoring physical activity and energy balance. However, it is not known how accurate these devices are at measuring energy expenditure or number of steps taken. Therefore, this study aims to measure the accuracy of these devices with validated measures of energy expenditure (oxygen consumption) and activity (accelerometry). It is hypothesised that these devices will underestimate the energy expenditure of exercises but overestimate the energy expenditure of actvities of daily living. </summary>
