  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Cool Kids and Adolescent Health program is an individual 10 session psychological treatment. The program is administered face to face or via Telephone or Skype. The program runs over 10 x 1 hour weekly sessions.
The program is based on a cognitive and behavioural therapy approach. Children and adolescents will be introduced to:
- Breathing exercises
- Behavioural therapy skills - including exposure/behavioural exercises
- Cognitive therapy and problem-solving skills.

The program is manualized and includes both a child/adolescent and parent workbooks, as parents will be involved in the treatment sessions 

The therapy sessions will be conducted by trained psychologists.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomly allocated to either the:
1) CoolKids and Adolescent Health program or
2) 10-week wait list control condition. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The overall approach to the primary study aims is an experimental 2 x 2 factorial design [Treatment (immediate start vs. wait-list(WL)) x Time (T1-T2)]. Given participants in the WL condition will receive the intervention after the 2nd assessment (following a 10-week wait period), the longer-term follow-ups will assess retention effects for participants who receive the intervention. 
Data will be analysed with HLM/mixed models, using repeated measures. Intent-to-treat analyses, using multiple imputations will be conducted. Statistical power is based on the average, moderate effects reported in the  limited number of studies that have tested psychological interventions using an RCT design to manage functional somatic syndromes in the paediatric literature. Utilizing a medium effect size with repeated measures, and based on our proposed sample size of N=120 [i.e. N=60 per condition] we have power of .80 to detect significant interactions between conditions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One-third of youth presenting to GPs and paediatricians complain of physical/somatic problems (e.g., recurring headaches, stomach-aches) that have no physical cause. These complaints are termed functional somatic syndromes (FSS). Importantly, up to 80% of youth with FSS also experience emotional disorders. However, to date, FSS interventions have solely focused on pain management, whilst overlooking the co-occurring anxiety and depressive disturbances. This is problematic given these children are at high-risk for experiencing chronic psychopathology into adulthood. 
The aim of this RCT is to test the efficacy of the CoolKids and Adolescent Health (psychological therapy) program which is a newly developed program specifically tailored for distressed children (7-17 years) struggling to cope with somatic-health complaints. Given the CoolKids and Adolescent Health program is also designed to concurrently manage both somatic and anxiety/depression symptoms, it is hypothesized that this program is expected to:
i)	lead to significant reductions in somatic, anxiety and depressive symptoms and improvement in quality-of-life compared to a wait-list control group.
ii)	The effects will be retained at 6-months and 9-months follow-up.
