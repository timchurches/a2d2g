  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Exercise
Other interventions - Usual practice

Placebo Comparator: Control (usual practice) - 

Experimental: Exercise - 


Other interventions: Exercise
The subjects will be given 2 x 30 minute sessions of exercise per day consisting of either passive, active, active assisted depending on level of sedation and stability of condition.
According to level of sedation and stability they may also perform sitting exercises

Other interventions: Usual practice
These patients will not receive exercise early in their intensive care admission

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fat free mass ie muscle mass (lean tissue) - Fat free mass will be measured by Multi-Frequency Bioelectrical Impedance Spectroscopy (BIS) (ImpediMed SFB7, ImpediMed Ltd, Brisbane, Australia).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change from baseline to one week, then change from baseline to two weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Interleukin 6 - 5mls blood from arterial catheter, centrifuged at 1,500 for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. The supernaturant will be collected and stored at -80 degrees C. The marker will be analyzed by an enzyme-linked immuno-assay.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) - 5mls blood from arterial catheter, centrifuged at 1,500 for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. The supernaturant will be collected and stored at -80 degrees C. The marker will be analyzed by an enzyme-linked immuno-assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change from baseline to measurements taken daily for 7 days</timepoint>
