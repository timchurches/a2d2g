  <interventions>
    <interventions>Double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a mineral and vitamin supplement (EMpowerplus) with a placebo followed with an open-label extension. The intervention consists of a micronutrient formula called Empowerplus containing 36 ingredients: 14 vitamins, 16 minerals, 3 amino acids and 3 antioxidants. A list of the ingredients can be found on the companys website, Truehope.com. Patients swallow 15 capsules a day divided into three doses of 5 pills each dose for a total of 8 weeks. They then enter an open label trial for a further 8 weeks with the same dose of EMpowerplus.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo: The placebo consists of riboflavin, fiber acacia gum, Maltodextrin, and cocoa powder. Patients swallow 15 capsules a day divided into three doses of 5 pills each dose for a total of 8 weeks. They then enter an open label trial for a further 8 weeks with the same dose of EMpowerplus (ingredients described above).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been proposed that some vitamins and minerals (together known as micronutrients) might help people with mood instability to stabilize their mood. When a new idea such as this comes along, it must be studied first in a variety of people (referred to as case series), and then in a controlled trial. The case series that have been carried out on EMPowerplus suggest that it might help to stabilize mood and help with some symptoms of ADHD. Often when people participate in trials, such as an open-label trial, they get better simply because of the contact with a health professional, the care they receive and the belief that they will get better. An RCT will help determine with more confidence the effect these pills have on the symptoms being measured.</summary>
