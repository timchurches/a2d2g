  <interventions>
    <interventions>50 healthy individuals will be recruited to undergo an experimental laboratory protocol following a screening visit and after obtaining informed consent. One week of actigraphy and sleep-wake diary and indoor-outdoor activity logs, will be performed prior to the test visit to measure sleep hours and activities at home, and participants will be advised to observe regular sleep hours with 8-hours in bed. 

The experimental protocol visit consists:
- baseline sleep study followed by 28 hours of extended wakefulness challenge (EWC) with detailed assessment including:

Primary performance outcomes measure
-Three 90 minute computerised AusEd driving simulator tasks measured at Time 1 (9.30am, 3.5 hours awake), Time 2 (2.30am, 20.5 hours awake) and Time 3 (8.30am, 26.5 hours awake)

Secondary performance outcome measure
-10 minute psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) measures every 2 hours throughout the EWC starting from midday.

Primary Predictor Variables
-Baseline sleep study is performed from 10pm-6am (EEG data will be subjected to spectral power analysis as part of data processing/analysis)
-Auditory Event Related potentials (ERP) data will be collected at between 8.30-9.30am (baseline assessment only)
-Resting awake EEG during a 7 minute Karolinska Drowsiness Test measure every 2 hours throughout the EWC startinf at midday
-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/Diffusion Tensor Imaging occurs within 1 week prior to laboratory EWC visit (assessed at baseline only)

Secondary Predictor Variables
-mRNA expression profiles from baseline to end of EWC (blood/mRNA samples collected at 6.15am upon awakening and 6.15am the following morning after 24hours of wakefulness
-Posture/Balance control assessments measured every 2 hours throughout the EWC starting at midday
-Peripheral Blood Pressure measures every 2 hours throughout the EWC starting at midday
Computerised performance tests measure every 2 hours through out the
EWC starting at midday :
- Working memory (N-back 1,2,3)
- Visuomotor skills (Digit Symbol Substitution Task)
- 4 Choice Reaction Time Task
- Letter Cancellation Task
- Emotion Perception Task
- Thermal sensation scale
- Central Blood Pressure and Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA) measures every 2 hours throughout the EWC starting at midday
- Statistical Learning Task measured at baseline (8.30pm prior to baseline sleep study) and at 8.30pm 24 hours later.
- Actigraphy variables (actigraphy data collected 1 week prior to EWC)
- PSG sleep study variables (collected during the baseline sleep study just prior to EWC)
- Genetic polymorphisms (genetic analysis from blood samples collected at start and end of EWC will occur at the completion of the study)
- Inflammatory marker profiles (from blood sample analysis collected at start and end of EWC will occur at the completion of the study)
- Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) is collected at baseline only at 7.30pm prior to baseline sleep study
- State anxiety questionnaire administered every 2 hours throughout the EWC starting at midday
- Karolinska Sleepiness Scale administered every 2 hours throughout the EWC starting at midday

    <statisticalmethods>The necessary sample to achieve an accurate estimate of the normal cut-offs for driving simulator performance is based on our previous study (Vakulin et al, J Clin Sleep Med 2014;10(6):647-655) where  participants underwent the driving simulator task using the same length drive (but different time of day). Data from 20 participants gave a mean+/-SD of lateral steering deviation of 36.5+/-9.2 cm. Thus, the upper limit of normal (mean+2SD) was 54.6 cm with a 99% confidence interval around the 2SD limit of 4961 cm. Assuming a similar mean+/- SD in the proposed project, a sample size of 50 will provide approximately half the 99% confidence interval around the 2SD limit to 5158 cm. Doubling of sample to 100, for example, provides little further improvement in 99% confidence interval to 52-57 cm, thus we believe that 50 individuals will provide robust normative data for driving simulator performance in this study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This neurobehavioural dysfunction, such as impaired driving ability, has a critical impact on health and society. Many individuals underestimate their impairment and there is wide inter-individual variability in how individuals are affected by sleepiness and its consequences. For example, some may report few symptoms while others with apparent mild disease exhibit severe sleepiness. Unravelling this problem of interindividual variability demands better assessment tools as conventional metrics such as sleep studies are uninformative. In this study, simulated driving and other performance tasks will be administered during a load of prolonged wakefulness extending throughout the night to unmask variation in neurobehavoural function. Performance under these conditions will be used to assess individual risk of vigilance failure such as impaired driving, and aid in the development of practically deployable biomarkers for predicting vulnerability to vigilance failure.
