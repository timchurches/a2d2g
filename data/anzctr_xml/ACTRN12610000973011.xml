    <interventions>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be invited pre-operatively to participate in this study. At the time of extubation and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in the ICU post-operatively, patients in the intervention arm will be randomised to receive oxygen therapy for a period of 24 hours via nasal high flow (Optiflow system, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, NZ Ltd) at 45 L/min. Fraction of inspired oxygen will be titrated to acheive oxygen saturations of &gt;93%. Study treatment will be discontinued at 1000hours post-operative day 2 and need for ongoing oxygen therapy assessed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be invited pre-operatively to participate in this study. At the time of extubation and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in the ICU post-operatively, patients in the control arm will be randomised to receive standard care i.e. oxygen via nasal prongs or a simple face mask. Fraction of inspired oxygen will be titrated to acheive oxygen saturations of &gt;93%. Study treatment will be discontinued at 1000hours post-operative day 2 and need for ongoing oxygen therapy assessed.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Due to the nature of the therapy it is not possible to blind participants or treating clinicians to allocated therapy. Therefore randomisation in blocks of 12 will be performed using opaque, selaed envelopes sequentially numbered. Patients will be enrolled pre-operatively and baseline measurements performed. At the time that the patient is deemed clinically ready for extubation, they will be screened by research staff or bedside clinician to ensure continued participation. The patient will then have an arterial blood gas drawn. Once this has been taken the randomisation envelope will be opened and allocaiton revealed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Following cardiac surgery, patients may experience respiratory problems and reduced lung function. This may cause low oxygen levels and often a longer hospital stay. Reduced lung function may also be resistant to simple techniques traditionally used to improve lung function such as patient positioning and physiotherapy. Ensuring adequate oxygen levels post-operatively is vital but there is little published evidence to guide doctors in the selection and use of different oxygen therapy systems. A high flow nasal high oxygen system (Optiflow by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Ltd) has been shown to deliver some positive airway pressure and this may help lung function. We now wish to study this to see if this is true. Patients in the study will either receive the nasal high flow oxygen or oxygen delivered by a standard face/nasal mask for 24hours after coming off the breathing machine post-operatively. If this proves to be true, patients may well be discharged earlier from the ICU and from hospital, thereby shortening hospital stay and improving hospital throughput.</summary>
