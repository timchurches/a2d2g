  <interventions>
    <interventions>In line with a patient-centred philosphy an individualised lifestyle intervention program will be provided, following comprehensive assessment and functional goal setting by trained physiotherapists and/or occupational therapists. The intervention will be structured to meet individuals' needs and so the frequency of contacts per week and the overall duration of the program will vary (3 to 14 weeks).  Intervention could include attendance at day therapy centres, exercise, fitness, balance-retraining and/or socialisation, organisation of home help or community care packages, motivational interviewing or counselling.
NOTE: This RCT will be nested within a larger longitudinal cohort study that will evaluate functional decline over 13 months in older people who present to an Emergency Dept with non-catastrophic illness. All participants will be assessed at 1, 4, 7 13 months. Those participants assessed at 1 month follow-up to be at risk for functional decline (Score of &lt;55 on the Mental Componenet Score of the SF-12) will enter the RCT.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional decline.
Functional decline will be assessed as change from baseline measures for the following :   
One or more falls increase from the baseline rate.
More than one event of hospitalisation from the baseline rate.
Functional change ie Decrease of one point in any item of the ADL instrument, or 2+ points decrease from baseline total iADL score, or any decrease in baseline score in the domains of home activities, doing laundry, shopping and getting places.
Scores decreasing from above median at baseline in either physical or mental domain, to below median in the SF12.
Any decrease in AQoL_4D.
Change to a more assistive gait aid (eg a one point stick to a four-pronged stick).
Change in living arrangements to more supported care.
Increased carer involvement.
Greater type and frequency of use of formal community services, or informal supports.
More frequent GP attendances.

Change over time in each outcome measure will be calculated using repeated measures ANOVA models, with study contact point, group and key demographic features as independent variables. Partial Least Squares models (PLS) using pathway analysis will be applied to the multiple outcome, immutable and mutable independent variables at each time point, to determine different spatial arrangements and the significant factors which impact on data clusters.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project will focus on older adults living independently in the community, and who are on the cusp of Functional Declune (FD). We will conduct a nested RCT within a 13 month longitudinal observational study. In the observational study we will apply a simple, previously untested quality of life screen to detect incipient Functional Decline, one month following an Emergency Dept presentation that did not result in an inpatient admission.  Those individuals with low scores at the point of screening will enter the RCT, which will test the effectiveness of a novel, early, home-based, personalised program (compared with usual care) in arresting or slowing Functional Decline. </summary>
