  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Aridol (mannitol) challenge test can
      predict response to treatment with inhaled corticosteroids in COPD subjects. Subjects will
      undergo an Aridol test and then 3 months of treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The
      effect on lung function and quality of life will then be measured and correlated with the
      Aridol test result.</summary>
