  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients allocated to the treatment group will receive 6 45-minute visits of chiropractic manual therapy consisting of a clinical assessment and the application of the Gonstead technique, delivered weekly over 6 weeks. The Gonstead technique is a commonly applied chiropractic manipulation involving a rapidly applied firm pressure to the neck that may or may not result in an audible click.</interventions>
    <comparator>A wait list control group of individuals with neck pain will participate in the three measurement sessions only. These individuals will be offered the intervention following their last measurement session at 6 months. It would not be unusual for patients with chronic neck pain to have long periods of time between treatment and there are often wait lists for chronic spinal pain treatment in the public health system. Therefore being on a wait-list is consistent with normal practice and not detrimental to the participants.
A second group of age and gender-matched healthy control participants will be recruited and will participate in measurement sessions at baseline and at 6 months.</comparator>

    <sequence>Neck pain participants will be assigned through concealed allocation and independent randomisation using a random numbers generator to one of two groups: chiropractic manual treatment techniques or a waiting list. The Clinical Research Design, IT and Statistical Support (CReDITSS) unit within the Hunter Medical Research Institute will oversee randomisation. Participants will be randomly allocated to the two groups using a randomised block design stratified by age and gender. Group allocation will be created dynamically with block sizes varying randomly and the randomisation schedule will be delivered via sealed envelopes prepared by CREDITSS and provided to the treating chiropractor.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data from 10 patients with chronic neck pain will be compared to 10 control participants. With this number of participants we can detect a 1 SD difference between groups with 80% power. However, this is a pilot study and the results of this study will provide data to accurately calculate sample size for a future larger study. Data from the pilot randomised controlled trial (5 participants in each group) will be reported descriptively. If the findings show potential levels of significance, then appropriate statistical tests will be used to further describe the results. The target for recruitment has been set at 25 to allow for possible attrition.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of chronic neck pain. Biomarkers from 10 individuals with chronic non-specific neck pain will be compared to 10 healthy age and gender matched control participants at baseline and six months from baseline. Neck pain participants will be randomised to either receive a chiropractic manual treatment technique (6 sessions) or be on a waiting list. For the neck pain group, biomarkers will be measured at baseline, immediately after treatment (6 weeks from baseline) and at 6-months from baseline.

Outcome measures are pain (VAS), cortical biomarkers measured with magnetic resonance imaging (structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy), kinematic biomarkers measured with 3-D motion analysis, and clinical measures including spinal stiffness, muscle performance on the deep neck flexor test, pressure pain threshold, cervical range of motion, Neck Disability Index, SF-12, Pain Impact Questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire-28. This pilot study will (1) determine potential cortical and kinematic biomarkers that can be used to develop targeted interventions for neck pain, and (2) determine if chiropractic manual therapy has effects on cortical and kinematic biomarkers and reduces pain.</summary>
