  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients fitting the inclusion criteria will have one side  of their wound closed using the V- Loc absorbable suture and the other side of the one wound closed with Monocryl absorbable suture. Preliminary data indicates that this  will take less than 30 minutes. Wounds will be assessed at one, six and twelve weeks to assess healing and any complications.   Photographs will be taken of the wound and scar cosmesis assessed by an independant blinded plastic surgeon.</interventions>
    <comparator>One  side  of the wound will be  closed using the V- Loc absorbable suture and the other side of the one wound closed with Monocryl absorbable suture.  The v-loc suture is  has unidirectional shallow barbs which distributes tension throughout the wound and allows closure of the wound without the tying of knots.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients fitting the inclusion criteria will be consented.  Half their wound will be stitched with a barbed suture (v-Loc) and the other half of their wound will be stiched using a traditional monocryl suture .  The wound will be assessed at one, six and twelve weeks after wound closure.  Photographs of the wound at these times will be assessed by a blinded independant plastic surgeon to rate wound cosmesis.</summary>
