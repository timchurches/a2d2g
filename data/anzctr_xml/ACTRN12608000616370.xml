  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients undergo 4 procedures, within a 6 week timeframe. Each procedure is only performed once per patient.

Initially the patient underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen performed in the standard manner. The MRI was performed on the fasted patient and scanned using 1 litre of dilute barium as intra luminal contrast. MRI scan involves patient lying on a flatbed in the machine and takes approximately 30 to 60 minutes.

One week after MRI, a barium Small Bowel Follow Through (SBFT) study was performed. Procedure involves (1) Person drinks radio-opaque contrast. (2) X-ray images of abdominal are made. It may take 2 to 4 hours to complete.

The patient proceeded to the Capsule Endoscopy (CE) procedure, four weeks after SBFT. Each patient was required to fast at least 8 hours prior to capsule ingestion, with no additional bowel preparation given to the patients directly prior to their CE. Patient swallows capsule under supervision, and capsule transmits data wirelessly to receiver worn on patient's belt. The patient was allowed to freely move around, but not to leave the facility area in order to ensure medical supervision throughout the transmission period (ie. for a total of 8 hours following from the ingestion of the Capsule). 

A gastroscopy using a side-viewing endoscope was done one to two weeks after this in the standard manner. This involves a period of fasting for at least 8 hours prior. At time of procedure, patient lies down and keeps mouth open. A lubricated fibreoptic endoscope is gentle inserted through the mouth down into the Gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Pain medication and a sedative may be administered via IV line during the procedure. Procedure usually lasts 30 to 45 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Side-viewing gastroscopy. It is a one off procedure.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number and size of polyps detected in each procedure relative to other procedures. This data is based on interpretation by 2 investigators experienced in their procedure and recording findings on a standardised collection form.

Analysis was essentially comprised of individual data, frequency table and descriptive statistics. Student's t- test / chi square testing were used for a comparison of duodenal polyp numbers and size, and identification of abnormal papillae, as estimated by each method. Analysis of variance was conducted using a General Linear Model and Two-Way ANOVA. Within the duodenum sensitivity and specificity of the Capsule was calculated using the duodenoscopy findings as the "gold standard".</outcome>
      <timepoint>The data from each procedure is measured at time of procedure, but comparative analysis is only possible after final procedure has been completed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distribution of polyps detected in each procedure relative to other procedures. This data is based on interpretation by 2 investigators experienced in their procedure and recording findings on a standardised collection form.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To describe the prevalence of cancerous growths in the small bowel as assessed by capsule endoscopy in a group of patients previously diagnosed with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). These patients are known to have previously identified cancerous growths and this study aims to compare the findings of capsule endoscopy to correlate this with the findings by other investigative techniques. These techniques are abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning, barium follow through examination(SBFT), and gastrointestinal side-viewing endoscopy.</summary>
