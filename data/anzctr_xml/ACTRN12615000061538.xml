  <interventions>
    <interventions>Constructive worry: 15 minutes per evening, between the hours of 6-8pm, of documenting worries/concerns, followed by ways to resolve these. Daily for two weeks. 
Mindfulness body scan: 15 minutes of practicing a mindfulness body scan at normal bedtime, each day for two weeks.

Both groups will be given instructions immediately after completion of their baseline data, via the computer screen. The researcher will be present at the time, to answer any questions. 

Adherence will be monitored by a twice-off self-report questionnaire.</interventions>

    <concealment>Secondary schools in Adelaide will be contacted via email with details of the project. Schools who are interested can contact the researcher, to set up an initial information session with class(es), selected by  the school (minimum Grade 10). 

Classes will be randomly allocated to one of three conditions, but all students within a class will receive the same condition.

Allocation is not concealed. </concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified allocation (based on year level at school). A website will be used to randomly allocate classes to a group (https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists), prior to data collection.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has shown that pre-sleep cognitive and emotional arousal increases adolescents' bedtime and sleep onset latency and decreases their total sleep time. We will test whether brief intervention can decrease pre-sleep cognitive and emotional arousal, therefore improving sleep.

We hypothesis that the constructive worry and mindfulness body scan groups will lower pre-sleep arousal, and therefore improve sleep, over the no treatment group.

Perfectionism may also play a role in how effective treatment is, with treatment being less effective at decreasing arousal for adolescents who score higher on a perfectionism scale, and more effective for those who score lower. Perfectionism will therefore be explored as a moderator (not an outcome measure).</summary>
