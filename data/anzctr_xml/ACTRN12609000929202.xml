  <interventions>
    <interventions>A multifaceted tailored intervention including culturally specific advice and support for Indigenous participants, evidence based communication and nicotine replacement after 2 failed quit attempts.  From the time the woman engages in an active quit attempt she is seen again in the clinic at a minimum of 2 visits within 5 and 14 days of the visit at which she agrees to attempt to quit smoking with support and advice.  If after two visits with support and advice she is still a smoker trying to quit with no contrainications to nicotine replacement therapy and she is prescribed nicotine gum.  For smokers of less than 25 cigarettes per day the 2mg gum is prescribed as required up to 24 times per day and for smokers of more than 25 cigarettes per day the 4 mg gum is prescribed.  The gum is prescribed as needed for up to 12 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was test an intervention designed to improve the extent to which staff in Indigenous primary health care clinics were able to support pregnant women who were smokers to quit smoking during their pregnancy.  We hypothesised that among the group of women exposed to the intervention the quit smoking rates would be 20% higher than among the group of women exposed to usual care smoking cessation support and advice.</summary>
