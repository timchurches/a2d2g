             infiltration of the bone marrow) within 28 days prior to randomization, including:

    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of
      Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) 695500 vs. rituximab (MabThera®) in previously untreated patients
      with low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL).

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and
      anti-tumor activity of BI 695500 vs. rituximab (MabThera®), as well as the presence of
      anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).</summary>
