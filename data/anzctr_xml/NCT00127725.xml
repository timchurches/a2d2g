  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fractures of the tibial shaft (diaphysis) are some of the most common long bone fractures.
      They most frequently occur in males less than 40 years of age. Despite advancements in the
      surgical management of these fractures, the precarious blood supply and lack of soft-tissue
      cover of the shaft of the tibia make these fractures vulnerable to non-union and infection.
      These complications often require multiple procedures, extended time off of work, and can
      result in ongoing poor mobility. This is reflected in the surgical revision rate that the
      scientific literature has recorded as being between 20 and 30%.

      Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation has been shown to be a safe and effective
      treatment for non-unions of the tibia. These are fractures in which the bone has failed to
      unite and the healing process has ceased. The PEMF is delivered via a device such as the EBI
      Bone Healing SystemÂ®, which straps onto the limb overlying the fracture. It is lightweight
      and portable using a rechargeable battery for power. It is compatible with internal and
      external fixation and may also be worn over a plaster or fibreglass cast. It is usually kept
      in place for ten hours per day and used for a period of three months or until the fracture
      unites. In animal models, PEMF stimulation has been demonstrated to improve the time to
      fracture healing in acute fractures. There have been no demonstrated side effects of the
      therapy.

      The study hypothesis is that PEMF stimulation during the first twelve weeks after fracture,
      in addition to normal surgical care, will increase the union rate for these fractures and
      thereby significantly reduce the surgical revision rate within the first twelve months
      following fracture.</summary>
