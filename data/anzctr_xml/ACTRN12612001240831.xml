    <interventions>This study is looking at the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of various drugs in overdose.
It is not an interventional study.
The aim of this research project is to study the clinical pharmacology of a number of new drugs, by modelling their concentrations and clinical effects from data collected from overdose patients.
Participants will be selected by the Prince of Wales Toxicology unit, either by the Clinical Toxicologist or Toxicology Fellow. 
Drugs of interest that will be studied include any newly marketed drugs, rare but serious overdoses such as colchicine, analgesics such as paracetamol and antipsychotics.
Data collected on these partcipants include drug and dose ingested, any symptoms, ECG data, drug and metabolite levels. 
The study will run for 5 years</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics of various drugs in overdose - by measuring concentrations of the drug or its metabolite in serum and or urine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Standard treatment in patients, whom take an overdose of a medication, depends on the drug ingested. The majority of patient's whom take an overdose will have an ECG and bloods taken on arrival to the emergency department. Then depending on the drug ingested, severity of the overdose and response to treatment, the patient may require additional ECG's and blood tests. The number and timing of these investigations depends on the drug ingested and the patients clinical condition. The Toxicologist on duty will determine how many blood samples will need to be collected. 
Hence timepoints for data collection depends on the drug ingested, its half life, if its a sustained release product and the clinical condition of the patient.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacodynamics:determine the relationship between drug concentration and clinical effects. 
For the study, it is intended to employ a population analysis technique that is reliant on recording relatively sparse data obtained in drug overdose circumstances. The modelling will require the sequential collection of drug concentrations, ECG parameters (e.g. QT interval) and the tracking of associated clinical effects, including the occurrence of arrhythmias and seizures</outcome>
      <timepoint>The number and timing of these investigations depends on the drug ingested and the patients clinical condition. The Toxicologist on duty will determine how many blood samples will need to be collected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To study the clinical pharmacology of a number of drugs in overdose. Many medications behave differently in overdose than in clinical situations. There is limited data on the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of many new drugs in overdose. 
This study aims to model drug concentration and clinical effects from data collected from overdose patients</summary>
