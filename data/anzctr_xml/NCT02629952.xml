  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Plant derived compounds, e.g. flavonoids from dark chocolate, green tea, or blueberries, show
      great potential as nutraceuticals for the treatment of various diseases such as type 2
      diabetes (T2D). Flavonoids have been suggested to improve glucose metabolism, reduce blood
      lipids, reduce oxidative stress and improve vascular function. For these reasons we recently
      investigated the effects of daily consumption of locally produced blueberry tea and
      demonstrated that this could partially restore insulin sensitivity in an animal model. We
      propose to translate these findings to assess the efficacy of this nutraceutical as a new
      treatment for improving glucose tolerance in people with T2D.</summary>
