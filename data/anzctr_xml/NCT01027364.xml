    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Factor IX (rFIXFc)
Treatment: drugs - rFIX

Experimental: Fixed Weekly Interval - 50 IU/kg rFIXFc via intravenous (IV) injection once every 7 days initially, then at a dose indicated by the participant's baseline pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment that ensured a target trough of 1% to 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated. Adjustments to the initial weekly dose of rFIXFc (50 IU/kg) were to be made based on baseline PK assessments, occurrence of spontaneous bleeding episodes, and the trough levels, which were to be monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.
Prior to the first dose of rFIXFc, participants in the Sequential PK subgroup were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg BeneFIX administered IV in the clinic, followed by PK sampling. A single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc was administered following a 120-hour washout from BeneFIX, followed by PK sampling for a baseline PK profiling. At Week 26 (±1 week) subjects were to receive a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFIXFc for repeat PK profiling.

Experimental: Individualized Interval - 100 IU/kg rFIXFc via IV injection once every 10 days initially, then at an interval derived from the baseline PK assessment that ensured a target trough of 1% to 3% above baseline or higher, as clinically indicated. Adjustments to the initial 10-day interval were to be made based on baseline PK assessments and trough levels, which were monitored at Weeks 4, 16, 26, and 39.

Experimental: On Demand - 20 to 100 IU/kg rFIXFc via IV injection, or the dose indicated by the participant's baseline PK to target a plasma level of 20% to 100%, as needed for the treatment of mild to severe bleeding episodes

Experimental: Surgery - The surgical period and dosing are dependent on the type of surgery the participant undergoes. Participants who started the study in one of the other treatment arms prior to surgery will return to the original treatment arm. Participants who joined the study in the Surgery arm will be assigned to one of the other treatment arms following post-operative rehabilitation.

      <outcome>Incidence Rate of FIX Inhibitor Development - An inhibitor test result =0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/mL, identified and confirmed by re-testing of a second sample obtained within 2 to 4 weeks, was considered positive. Both tests were to be performed using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda Assay by the central laboratory.

A follow-up injection administered &gt;72 hours after the most recent injection given to treat a bleed was considered a new bleed at the same location and was classified as type=Unknown (bleeding episodes of this type were not evaluable). The first bleed for each participant could not be included in this analysis since there was no previous bleed from which to measure time. The number of days from the last injection to treat a bleed to a new bleeding episode was analyzed across all evaluable bleeding episodes per participant.</outcome>

      <outcome>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index for Adults (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire: Change From Baseline to Week 26 - The Haem-A-QoL consists of items pertaining to 10 domains specific to living with hemophilia and was administered to adult participants (&gt; 17 years). The areas covered by this instrument are: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment (all 7 domains, during the last month) and future, family planning, and outlook for the future (all 3 domains, recently).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of the study were: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFIXFc;
      to evaluate the efficacy of rFIXFc in all treatment arms; to evaluate the effectiveness of
      prophylaxis over on-demand (episodic) therapy by comparing the annualized number of bleeding
      episodes between participants receiving rFIXFc on each prevention (prophylaxis) regimen and
      participants receiving rFIXFc on an episodic regimen. The secondary objectives of the study
      were: to evaluate and assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates of rFIXFc and rFIX
      (BeneFIX®) at baseline in the Sequential PK subgroup as well as rFIXFc at Week 26 (±1 week);
      to evaluate participants' response to treatment; to evaluate rFIXFc consumption.</summary>
