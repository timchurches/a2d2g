Simvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate that has demonstrated clinically relevant drug interactions with other known CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrates, inhibitors and inducers.  Warfarin is a weak substrate for CYP3A4 and use of warfarin as anticoagulant should be undertaken only with caution and close monitoring of INR and consideration should be given to switching the patient to low molecular weight heparin for the duration of the study. 

* Patients who are not able to swallow tablets. </exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of adding simvastatin to standard first-line chemotherapy regimens in untreated, metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with elevated inflammatory biomarkers. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer with evidence of systemic inflammation. You must also be eligible for standard first-line chemotherapy regimens in accordance with local standards of care and pharmaceutical benefits scheme approvals.
 
Study details 
All participants in this study will receive standard first line therapy, as chosen by their treating medical oncologist. In addition, participants will be asked to take a daily 40mg dose of simvastatin orally in the evening from the first day of chemotherapy until tumour progression or patient is withdrawn from treatment due to clinician or patient decision. 

Participants will be monitored for treatment toxicity and inflammation, and will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at 6 months to evaluate quality of life. The feasibility of the trial methods will also be evaluated in order to determine whether they could be used in a larger randomised clinical trial (RCT).</summary>
