    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - APR-246

Experimental: APR-246 - The trial regimen consists of the investigational agent APR-246, along with standard chemotherapy, Cisplatin and 5-FU. A maximum of 8 cycles of treatment will be given.
APR-246 and 5-FU must both commence on Day 1 and given on days 1 to 4 via intravenous infusion over 6 hours, whilst 5-FU must be given as a continuous infusion over 96 hours.
On Days 2-4, APR-246 must be given first via intravenous infusion over 6 hours, then commence cisplatin via intravenous infusion over one hour.
This is a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination therapy. The 3 dose levels are described as follows:
Dose Level 1:
APR-246 Dose: 75mg/kg LBM Cisplatin Dose: 25mg/m2 5-FU Dose: 750mg/m2/ day CI
Dose Level 2:
APR-246 Dose: 100mg/kg LBM Cisplatin Dose: 25mg/m2 5-FU Dose: 750mg/m2/ day CI
Dose Level -1:
APR-246 Dose: 50mg/kg LBM Cisplatin Dose: 25mg/m2 5-FU Dose: 750mg/m2/ day CI


Treatment: drugs: APR-246
APR-246 (also known as PRIMA-1MET), a first-in-class agent targeting mutant p53 resulting in re-expression of wild-type p53 activity.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female aged 18 years or older at screening

          2. Histologically-confirmed metastatic or advanced oesophageal or oesophago-gastric
             junction adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma

          3. Radiologic disease progression at or within 6 months of platinum containing
             chemotherapy in the advanced/metastatic or adjuvant setting

          4. Measurable disease as per RECIST1.1 criteria

          5. Measurable lesions must not have previously had radiotherapy or must have progressed
             following radiotherapy

          6. Patients may have had up to 2 lines of previous chemotherapy in the
             metastatic/advanced setting or 3 lines including adjuvant therapy. If patients have a
             maintenance strategy following platinum containing chemotherapy (e.g. fluoropyrimidine
             alone) this will not be considered a separate line of treatment.

          7. Patient has provided written informed consent for the trial

          8. Tumour tissue available from the initial surgical resection or any previous biopsies
             taken at any time before screening. Either a FFPE block or 15 unstained sections from
             the tumour tissue block must be available for the purpose of translation research
             studies. Obtaining archived tumour material or unstained sections from an archived
             tumour block will suffice to meet this requirement. The availability of the tumour
             material must be confirmed at Screening for a patient to be eligible. If no archival
             tissue block is available and/or fewer than 15 unstained sections are available,
             eligibility must be confirmed with the Coordinating Principal Investigator or
             delegate.

          9. Patients must have adequate haematological, renal, hepatic and pulmonary functions as
             defined by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count =1.5 x 109/L

               -  Haemoglobin = 10 g/L

               -  Platelet count =100 x 109/L

               -  Total serum bilirubin = 1.5 x upper normal limit

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 2.5 x upper normal limit or = 5 x upper limit of
                  normal if liver metastases are present

               -  Renal: A creatinine clearance rate of greater than 60 mL/minute

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course

             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.
