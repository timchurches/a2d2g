  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;50 Copies/ml) at Week 48 - Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load less than (&lt;) 50 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (ribonucleic acid [RNA]) copies/milliliter (ml) at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/ml after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/ml).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Snapshot, &lt;50 Copies/ml) at Week 48 - The analysis is based on the last observed viral load (VL) data within the Week 48 window. Virologic response is defined as a VL&lt;50 copies/ml (observed case). Missing VL was considered as non-response. Virologic Failure includes subjects who had VL&gt;=50 copies/ml in the Wk48 window, subjects who discontinued early due to lack or loss of efficacy, subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or lack or loss of efficacy and at the time of discontinuation had a VL&gt;=50 copies/ml and subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Observed, &lt;50 Copies/ml) at Last On-Treatment Visit (Post-Week 96). - Virological response is defined as (observed) plasma viral load less than 50 human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies per ml at the last on-treatment visit (post-Week 96).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Variable, ranging from 3 months up to maximum 15 months for TMC278 and 12 months for Efavirenz after the 96-week visit</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 and Week 96 in Absolute and Relative CD4+ Cell Counts (Using Imputed Data) - Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count was imputed in case of missing values: in case of premature discontinuation, data were imputed with the baseline value after discontinuation (i.e. change=0, Non-Completer [NC] = Failure); otherwise last observation carried forward was applied.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Virologic Failure for the Resistance Determination by Emerging Resistance Associated Mutations: First Available On-Treatment Genotypic Data After Failure - Virologic failure for the resistance determinations was defined as lack of virologic response (never having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL) and plasma viral load increase of &gt;=0.5 log 10 copies/mL above nadir (i.e., never suppressed), or confirmed loss of virologic response (2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL; i.e., rebounder), or discontinued with a last observed on-treatment plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL. For this study, treatment-emergent reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance associated mutations (RAMs) occurring in at least 2 virologic failures (for at least one treatment group) for the following lists are presented: i) Extended list of Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI RAMs) ii) IAS-USA list of Nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI RAMs).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of TMC278
      given at a dose of 25 mg once daily versus efavirenz (EFV) at a dose of 600 mg once daily,
      when combined with a fixed background regimen consisting of emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF), in HIV-1 infected patients who have not yet taken any anti-HIV
      drugs. The following evaluations will be done: antiviral activity, immunologic changes, and
      viral geno-/phenotype evolution, relationship of Pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      PK/Pharmacodynamics, medical resource utilization and treatment adherence.</summary>
