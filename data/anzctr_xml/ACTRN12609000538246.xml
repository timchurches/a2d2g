  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised cross-over design study which examines the effect of four different protein meals, each containing 50g of protein, on postprandial glucose, insulin and satiety response.
Arm 1: Meal containing 50 g tuna protein Arm 2: Meal containing 50 g egg white protein
Arm 3: Meal containing 50 g Turkey protein
Arm 4: Meal containing 50 g whey protein 

The kilojoule, fat and carbohydrate content were all the same in all 4 meals.

Each meal is only consumed once at 8:00 o'clock in morning of the assessment day. 

Before each visit, the subjects were instructed to keep a weighed food diary for 3-4 days before the intervention day and were provided with a standard meal to consume the evening before the intervention day.  The subjects were asked to fast for 10-12 hours before attending on the intervention day.  

Participants attended at Curtin University on four separate occasions with a one week washout period between each visit.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Immediately after completing the Vas questionnaire, subjects were offered an ad lib lunch and ere instructed to eat just
as much till they were satiated. Inake was recorded by weighing and recording of food as eaten in combination with food tables.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Determining which types of proteins are effective in lowering glucose response, promoting a greater insulin response and satiety postprandially (after a meal is consumed) has obvious benefits.  There is little conclusive evidence on the postprandial effect of different types of proteins on such metabolic factors and satiety in humans.  This study aims to determine the satiety and metabolic responses in relation to glycaemia and insulinaemia of four completely different protein sources, namely fish, poultry, dairy (whey) and egg albumin in healthy men aged between 18 and 30 years.</summary>
