  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supplement study with a randomised, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled research design.

Supplement: D-aspartic acid.
Dose: 6 grams per day.
Duration: Administered every day for 12 weeks.
Mode: Oral administration by opaque pill capsules.

Adherence to daily supplementation was controlled for via check-ups and prompts at supervised training sessions.

Participants trained four days per week, with supervised sessions conducted a minimum of once per week, with additional monitoring of adherence conducted via training logs. Supervised resistance training sessions were conducted by a trained exercise physiologist at the University laboratory gym. The training sessions that the participants could not make at the University gym were conducted at the gym the participant normally exercised at.

Both groups (DAA and Placebo) began training after baseline testing and continued for 12 weeks. The prescribed training involved five exercises that included 3-5 sets of various repetition maximum (RM) prescriptions (2RM  10RM). Prescription of intensity was as close to failure on the last repetition, thus training intensity ranged approximately from 70% to 95% of the participant's one repetition maximum. A primary lift was prescribed for each day  deadlift, bench press, good morning/stiff-leg deadlift and squat, with accessory exercises for balance and volume. Types of equipment for the exercises included barbell, machine, dumbell and bodyweight. Each training session lasted for approximately 1-1.5 hours. 

There was no direct personalisation of the training program with respect to exercises and relative prescription, however, as the prescription was based on repetition maximums the absolute loads lifted and training volume was personalised session by session according to the RM target. If a participant found they could perform more or less than the load for an exercise the load was increased or decreased the following session to keep them with the repetition range target. All participants performed the same exercises, and no other personalisation of the training program was implemented.</interventions>
    <comparator>An equal-weight, visually-matched placebo (rice flour) was administered to the placebo group. Both Placebo and the d-aspartic acid groups were exposed to the same training program.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent research has shown that resistance-trained men who supplemented with 6 g.d-1 of d-aspartic acid (DAA) over 14 days significantly reduced total testosterone and free testosterone levels. The long-term training consequences of reduced testosterone from DAA supplementation are currently unknown. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DAA to increase basal testosterone levels over three months of resistance training. A secondary objective was to establish potential mechanisms for changes in strength and hypertrophy. Based on our previous findings, it was hypothesised that the DAA group would experience decreased total testosterone and free testosterone. In addition, it was hypothesised that the DAA group would experience increased strength, explained by improved neural plasticity.</summary>
