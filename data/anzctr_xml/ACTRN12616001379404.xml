  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three months Internet-based intervention (web resource information and text messaging).
The Internet-based resource comprises of two elements  information and communication. Information about ACL reconstruction, expected milestones during the recovery process, strategies to overcome distress associated with the injury, and recommended physiotherapy exercises. 
Communication using frequent text messages to the participants via SMS (to their personal mobile phones) or emails. Participants can choose their preferred method of communication (SMS or emails)

Participants will be able to access the web-support resource as often as they wish and were encouraged to access it at least:
*On a daily basis for the first week following the surgery 
*Three times per week for weeks 2-4 following the surgery
*Once a week for weeks 4-12 following the surgery

 The SMS messages and emails encouraged the participants to access the web-support resource and check their progress by answering a set of questions each time. Based on the participants response, specific recommendations were suggested. 
The SMS followed the rehabilitation guidelines and recommendation of accessing the website and included: 
*A daily reminder for the first week following the surgery 
*A reminder 3 times a week for weeks 2-4
*A reminder once a week for weeks 4-12
The SMS messages and emails included a statement or a question regarding a specific aspect of recovery, with a link to the website. The set of questions were based on certain goals or outcomes that are expected to be achieved during the rehabilitation phases following the surgery.
Participants in the intervention group will be advised to continue with the standard care their health care provider institutes. The Internet-based intervention group was differ from the standard care control group only by the inclusion of the interactive web-support resource as part of their rehabilitation phases following the surgery. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study hence power calculation has not been conducted.
To determine trend for effectiveness the following statistical approach will be used:
For the qualitative data - Repeated measures ANCOVA  to evaluate the differences between groups (baseline vs three months post) and between groups over time s while controlling for age and gender. 
For qualitative phone interview - interviews will be audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Collected qualitative data will be reviewed to determine if the intervention is acceptable and to ascertain if modifications were required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This was a pilot randomised controlled trial that examined the feasibility of a three months internet-based intervention as a possible tool to enhance recovery and to examine how the intervention be perceived and if potential benefits can be identified. The potential effect of the internet-based intervention on knee pain, function, self efficacy and fear of pain were also assessed. The study would provide preliminary results, which could then help to determine whether such intervention is appropriate for further testing on a larger scale </summary>
