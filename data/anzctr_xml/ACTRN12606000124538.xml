    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>allocation concealment is achieved by having the holder of the allocation schedule at a separate site to the assessment and treatment location.The method of allocation concealment will be central randomisation via telephone. Importantly, assessment for eligibility is not performed by staff delivering the intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>After consenting to randomisation, eligible subjects will be allocated in consecutive groups of eight to the treatment, attention control or waiting list control group by block randomisation with variable block sizes. The allocation sequence was generated using the method described by 1. Altman DG and Bland JM. How to randomise. BMJ 1999;319:703-4 and random number tables (3. Armitage P and Berry G. Statistical Methods in Medical Research (2nd edition)).</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>There will be three groups:(1) the intervention treatment; (2) usual treatment/attention-control group); (3) a Waiting List Control condition (to control for the effects of time).</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will provide for the first time a sound Australian-sourced evidence base for the effective management of this intractable problem amongst the more severely disabled elderly chronic pain sufferers.  This research proposal addresses National Research Priorities of improving the mental and physical capacities (and self-reliance) of chronically-ill ageing Australians, by helping to minimise disability, improve self-reliance, workforce participation (where relevant) and quality of life in chronically-ill elderly Australians.</summary>
