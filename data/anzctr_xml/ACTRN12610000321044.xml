    <interventions>The Infant Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (IT-MAIS), to children under four years-old was applied; to children between 04 and 07 years old the Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS) was applied and for the individuals between 08 and 14 years old the benefit questionnaire assessing in children and teenagers proposed by Boscolo et al (2006).
The application was made in a single session of 30 minutes. The total study duration was 4 months old.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participated in this study, hearing impaired individuals which were fitted with hearing aids in Laboratory of Hearing of  of Federal University of Santa Maria (FUSM) through the health care program for hearing of this institution. This program is in effect since 2005 and serves the municipalities in the average complexity of the macro-Midwest region of Rio Grande do Sul.
Were evaluated only individuals whose parents or guardians have agreed to the procedures necessary to implement the search and signed a consent form after receiving clarification on the purpose and methodology of the proposed study. 
To be part of the research, the established inclusion criteria were: age between 03 and 14 years and a minimum of three months of use of amplification, because clinical experience has shown that this is a reasonable time to adjust to hearing aids, and able to verify the actual results of the intervention, since the benefits from the use of amplification do not emerge immediately (Weinstein, 1996).</inclusivecriteria>
