  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention has been designed based on the intensity, frequency and duration   established in the last reviews and the hypothesis that the Whole Body Vibration (WBV) or Balance Trainer (BT) in addition to a standard exercises program can improve fatigue and gait pattern. The duration was twice a week, during twelve week (24 sessions in total). The duration of the interventions increased progressively from 60 to 100 minutes, reached at the sixth-eighth week

The participants will be divide in three groups: Whole Body Vibration group (WBVgroup), Balance Trainer group (BTgroup) and Control group (CTgroup), which was in a waiting list to receive treatment. In the first two groups the nature of the program will be the same:
Standard Exercise Program
- 5min Warm Up
- 15-30min Aerobic Exercise: (e.g. stationary bike, treadmill walking, elliptical or brisk walking in a circular corridor of 150m)
- 15-30min Circuit Exercises: body weight exercises, coordination and balance exercises ((e.g. squats, unilateral weight bearing, dual-task, walk in a straight line, pilates ball exercises)
- 15min Stretching: major muscle groups
- 5min Cool-down: relaxation and breathing

There will be breaks between exercises and the exercise programme is progressive and tailored towards individual capabilities and preferences.

Mode of administration: Circuit training, a group exercise program adapted for individuals, supervised by an neurologic physical therapist. 4 to 8 individuals per group.


In addition to a standard exercises program

Group A) Whole Body Vibration Group [Using a Zeptor med System (Fa. Scisens, Germany)]
Amplitude: 3mm, Frecuency f: 6Hz +/- 1Hz/sec.
5 repetition X 1 min (1 min rest)

Group B) Balance Trainer Group
Balance training is mechanical device that provides a fall-safe balancing environment (Medica Medizintechnik GmbH, Hochdorf, Germany) in interaction with the computer in order to training balance.
15 minutes of  Balance Trainer. 

Twice times / week. 
-60-100 minutes/session


Group C) Control Group. (Waiting list/No treatment)

Adherence to treatment is monitored by records of attendance and punctuality.
Level of Assistance to sessions
Excellent: 90% or more.
Good: 75% - 90%.
Medium: 50% - 75%.
Poor: less than 50%.

Self-perception of physical effort and level of satisfaction is monitored using a Likert-type scale self-designed for the trial.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Group C) Control Group. (Waiting list/No treatment).
The control group will be offered a standard exercise program that includes Whole Body Vibrations, after twelve weeks.</comparator>

      <outcome>Gait analysis

We examine gait with GAITRite electronic walkway, is a portable gait analysis system and is activated by mechanical pressure as the subject walks on it.

The gait parameters include in the analysis are: FAP, velocity (cm/sec), cadence (steps/min), step time (s), base of support (cm), swing phase and double support (% gait cycle) and step length difference (cm)</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients are recruited from MS Units in Hospital University Virgen Macarena (Seville, Spain)


- 1st visit: physician generates a EDSS, potential participants are derive to neurologic physical therapist.


- 2nd visit: Neurological physical therapist, as a blinded assessor, perform baseline assessment. Demographic data are collected, participants complete self-reported measures (FSS, MFIS, BDI and MusiQoL) and gait analysis is performed with GAITRite™


- 3rd visit: Concealed allocation and randomization.

Subject who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of three groups using a random numbers table by the physiotherapist who also conduct the intervention. Therefore, the blinded assessor doesn´t know which group each subject  belongs. 

Method of allocation concealment: central randomisation by computer


- Intervention. Two physical therapist during 12 weeks


- Final assessment by the blinded assessor following the same protocol. </concealment>
