    <interventions>High flow nasal prong therapy
Children with viral bronchiolitis requiring more than 2L/min oxygen will receive treatment as per protocol A (Control) or B (Treatment)

Protocol B:
-Patient given HFNP providing humidified and warmed to 37 degrees.
-The flow rate, set to optimise oxygen saturation, will be up to 8 L/min depending on patient comfort
-Duration of HFNP will vary depending on severity of the bronchiolitis. Breaks for nasal care or mobilization will be permitted.
-Other treatments such as drug therapy will be given according to standard protocols</interventions>
    <comparator>Protocol A (control)
-Respiratory therapy presently available in the participating hospitals i.e. supplemental oxygen up to 2L/min provided by low-flow normal nasal prongs with unheated humidifier
-Other treatments such as drug therapy will be given according to standard protocols</comparator>

      <outcome>Reduction in transfer to children's hospital</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the treatment, it will be evaluated how many cases could be managed well with HFNP and hence did not require transfer to a tertiary children's hospital.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to conduct a clinical trial on the use of HFNP therapy on infants with viral bronchiolitis requiring ventilator support and compare it with the standard care at the Campbelltown and Mt Druitt Hospitals to see effect of HFNP therapy in reducing the need for intubation and cost of transferring children to specialized children hospitals.</summary>
