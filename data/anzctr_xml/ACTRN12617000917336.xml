  <interventions>
    <interventions>The independent variable is the intake of free sugar, which is defined by the WHO as all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.

Each participant completed two 24-hr recall, on two non-consecutive days, using the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM) developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary dependent variable is the micronutrient intake. This was translated from the dietary intake data of the survey, which was collected from two 24-hr recalls. The dietary intake data were then translated into nutrient intake using the AUSNUT2011-13 food composition database.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There has been an increasing concern on the possible negative effects of excessive sugar intake, particularly added sugar, on the quality of diet and health status. Added sugar was found to be associated with poorer nutrient intake. A similar impact on micronutrient dilution was expected from free sugar as an estimation of approximately 10 g difference between added sugar and free sugar intake was found in the Australian population. The hypotheses of the current analysis include: a) the WHO cut-offs were not suitable for assessing micronutrient dilution; and b) micronutrient dilution is not evident until %energy from free sugars reaches 25% or above.</summary>
