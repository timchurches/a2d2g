  <interventions>
    <interventions>Practice nurse will work in partnership with the GP and patients newly diagnosed with COPD to develop a care plan, which will contain relevant components of the following: 1) Smoking cessation as per current guidelines for current smokers 2) Immunisation - influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status will be assessed and updated 3) Pulmonary rehabilitation for patients with COPD. 4) Current medications and education about potential future indications for pharmacotherapy will be assessed. For patients already using any inhaler, inhaler technique will be checked using published checklists. Patients for whom inhalers are indicated will be educated on the appropriate use of these using established protocols. 5) Nutrition: Advice about diet and exercise and referral to a dietician if appropriate for overweight or underweight patients. 6) Psychosocial issues: identification and management of anxiety and/or depression. 7) Patient education: patients will be provided with written information about COPD and its management and with information about local patient support groups which provide emotional support and self-management information. 8) Co-morbidities and complications of COPD will be assessed and managed. 

The GP and the practice nurse involved with patient care will decide the frequency of visit and the intervention will be of 12 months duration.</interventions>
    <comparator>Nurse will recommend that patients with newly diagnosed COPD see their GP who will have been mailed a copy of COPD-X guidelines. Usual care for the purpose of this study will thus be the normal pattern of care by a GP, supported by the re-circulation of widely available guidelines without any supporting educational activities.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>COPD is a common problem for current or ex smokers but is often undiagnosed or diagnosed late when the condition has deteriorated significantly. Effective treatment is available so early diagnosis is very important. In this study practice nurses will identify patients who are at risk of COPD and undertake case finding.  Patients newly diagnosed with COPD who attend the intervention practices will be offered a management involving the GP and practice nurse working in partnership. The patients who attend the control practices will receive usual care from their GPs. We will then primarily examine the impact of the intervention or the usual care on patients' quality of life, health status and lung function and draw a comparison between the two groups in order to asses the effectiveness of the intervention.</summary>
