  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment group will undertake stretches of the pectoralis muscles, latissimus dorsi and lower trapezius muscles. A static stretch will be held for 30 seconds and then repeated twice. They will also complete thoracic extension and thoracic rotation exercises using the back of a chair, each stretch held for 30 seconds and repeated twice.  The stretches will be taught to the patients by a physiotherapist and then performed independantly daily for 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will undertake quadriceps, calf, adductor and hamstring stretches. Each stretch will be held for 30 seconds and then repeated twice.  These will be taught to the patient by a physiotherapist and then performed in dependantly daily for six weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a commonly inherited genetic disorder affecting numerous bodily systems, with great impact on the respiratory system including thoracic muscles.  Although musculoskeletal problems such as back pain appear to be common in CF patients, there has been little research conducted to investigate the efficacy of musculoskeletal techniques such as stretching in this population. 

Cystic fibrosis patients are invited to take part in a study to investigate the effects of stretching exercises on quality of life.

Background
You will be invited to attend one session, lasting 60 minutes at the Department of Physiotherapy, Prince Charles Hospital, where a physiotherapist will assess the following:
1.How much air you can breathe out in 1 second, repeated up to 6 times
2.Amount of movement you have in your arms, using a device to measure angles
3.How much you move your upper, middle and lower chest during breathing, by placing a tape measure around your chest and asking you to breathe in and out 3 times.
4.Measuring the curve of your thoracic spine by placing a soft mouldable ruler over your spine while standing
5.Fill out a questionnaire containing questions regarding your quality of life.
6.Fill out a questionnaire containing questions how your pain affects your daily tasks

After the 1st session, you will be randomly allocated to one of the following groups.  

Arm stretches group: This involves completing a series of stretches for your arms and trunk over the 6 week period.  Your physiotherapist will show you these exercises.  You will be asked to do these once a day over the study period and complete a diary of how many exercises you performed each day.

Leg stretches group:  This involves completing a series of stretches for your legs over the 6 week period.  Your physiotherapist will show you these exercises.  You will be asked to do these once a day over the study period and complete a diary of how many exercises you performed each day.

At the end of the 6 week period, you will be asked to attend another visit to repeat the above measures.

Benefits
Your participation in the study is not likely to benefit you directly but may assist in the development of future rehabilitation programs for patients with cystic fibrosis.</summary>
