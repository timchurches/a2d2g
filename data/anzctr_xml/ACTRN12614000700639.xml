    <interventions>Exercise Park Intervention Group (EPIG)
Participants from the EPIG will undergo an 18 weeks exercise intervention. The exercise sessions will be provided 2-3 times a week (each class approximately 1 to 1.5 hours duration) and it will be supervised by a qualified physiotherapist or an accredited exercise physiologist.

The exercise classes will include 6-8 participants and will be circuit-based with the warm up and cool down exercises being performed in a group and the core session being carried out in training pairs.

Participants will be performing a series of exercises such as sit to stand, calf raises+climbing finger steps, climbing stairs, walking up and down a ramp, walking on a balance beam, balancing on a gangway, taps on a platform, etc.

To measure the intensity of the exercises, we will be using 10-point Rate of Perceived Effort (RPE) Scale. Participants will be encouraged to progress the exercises to the next level if they rate the exercise intensity below 4/10. We will encourage them to exercise with a RPE between 4 and 7/10.

Participants from EPIG will be tested at the following timelines: at baseline, after 18 weeks and after 2 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group (CG)
Participants in the CG will be advised to continue with their daily usual activities and will be meeting the research team every 2 weeks to take part in some social activities (9 meetings over 18 weeks of intervention). These social meetings will last for 3 hours (each session). Participants will participate in a range of social activities such as bingo game, board games, card games, dance classes, craft classes, etc.

      <outcome>Feasibility: the feasibility will be assessed and will be defined as the number of participants recruited and retained over the recruitment period, overall adherence and seasonal adherence, safety and adverse effects and number of sessions cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions. In addition, the qualitative data collected via interviews of EPIG participants will be taken into account for feasibility purposes as they might more clearly show participants perceptions of this kind of initiative.
Overall adherence to the exercise program will be defined by the number of sessions attended: 100% adherence if participant attended 35 sessions or 9 sessions of social meetings. EPIG or CG participants participation and attendance will be recorded via a spreadsheet diary and will be collected respectively by the exercise supervisor of that participant on each specific session or by the principal researcher. Physical activity calendars will be used to monitor if EPIG or CG participants have participated in any other physical activities during their participation in the study. Reasons for participants missing sessions will be documented on the spreadsheet diary. Participants will be given a phone call in case they miss two consecutive sessions without any communication with any exercise supervisors. 
Seasonal adherence will be recoded as adherence over Summer (December to end of February), Fall (March to end of May), Winter (June to end of August) and Spring (September to end of November). Also, the number of sessions that were cancelled due to rainy, windy and excessively hot days (above 37 degrees Celsius) will be recorded given that these conditions would potentially put participants safety and health in risk.
Safety and adverse effects will be measured by the number of falls incidents occurred during exercise sessions and it will be recorded via an incident report form (treatment needed post-incident and related lesions or injuries). The circumstances surrounding the fall (e.g. muscle fatigue, dizziness,) will be recorded. EPIG participants will be also asked in the following session (48 hours) to report if they experienced any uncomfortable delayed muscle soreness or fatigue post-exercise that refrained them from doing their daily tasks such as coming up and down stairs, rising from a chair, and carrying shopping bags. The following question will be used: Did you experience any muscle soreness after the session that refrained you from doing your normal daily activities such as carrying shopping bags, rising from a chair or putting a t-shirt on?. If they answer yes the muscle soreness event will be recorded on the participants spreadsheet diary. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The feasibility measure will be measured after the conclusion of the data collection and analysis .</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Qualitative Data: Participants allocated to EPIG will be interviewed by an experienced qualitative researcher at the end of the intervention period (18 weeks). This interview will explore the participants experience with the project including reasons to volunteer to the project and their experiences with the training program (staff supervision, frequency, duration, progression of exercises, level of difficulty, changes to their life in general and general level of satisfaction). Only participants assigned to the exercise intervention group will be interviewed. In interviewing these participants, we aim to be able to identify the positive and negative elements of the exercise park program perceived by the participants, as well as the main participation barriers which can impact on the adherence and acceptability of the intervention. The interviews will be conducted on an individual basis by a researcher independent to the intervention. All interviews will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interviews will be analysed using a thematic analysis approach. </outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from Melbourne suburbs. Local senior organizations, retirement villages, community centres, senior clubs and associations in the areas around the park location will be contacted for recruitment purposes. Participants will be also recruited via community health promotion events and advertisement in local newspapers, magazines and online social networking media. Participants will be informed about the project by posters placed in healthcare facilities and places with high circulation of senior citizens and mail-out advertisements to health care practitioners in Melbourne. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the following groups: (1) Exercise Park Intervention Group (EPIG) or (2) Control Group (CG). Block randomization stratification by gender will be undertaken, so that blocks of 12 participants will be recruited at a time, randomized into one control group of six participants and one exercise groups of six participants (Figure 1). To accommodate couples (e.g. partners/married couples) participation, randomisation by couple will also take place. Six paper codes (three exercise intervention and three control group) will be added to opaque not concealed envelopes. There will be three envelopes: one for couples, one for females and one for males. Participants will be asked to pick one paper from their respective envelope and the picked paper will assign the participant to either the exercise intervention group or control group. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. If there are chance imbalances in baseline participants characteristics, then these variables will be used as covariates. 

Mixed linear modelling incorporating intervention and control groups at the baseline and two follow up time points (18 weeks and 26 weeks after intervention commencement), with the number of sessions attended and baseline physical activity level as covariates, will be carried out using SPSS. Comparisons will be made for the primary outcome (BOOMER) and secondary outcomes (functional tasks, strength measures, gait parameters, health related quality of life measures, and psychosocial measures). Although the number of falls is being recorder over a period of 12 months after the commencement of participants, this study is not powered for falls outcomes. Regarding the qualitative data being collected, the interviews from EPIG participants will be analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Both an inductive and deductive approach to data analysis will be used to identify themes.


Power analysis was undertaken using previously published discharge data on the primary outcome measure  - the BOOMER balance measure, and assuming an improvement of 3 points (reported as the minimum detectable difference) and an effect size of 0.5.  A sample size of 48 participants per group is required for a power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05. We will allow for 20% dropout rate (this is a conservative estimate based on previous exercise programs with older people), and therefore will recruit 60 participants per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls are a leading cause of disability among older adults. Physical activity has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of falls in elderly. However, elderly group are not regularly engaged in physical activity. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise intervention using an exercise park in reducing the risk of falls, improving strength and balance in the elderly. In addition, this research project will evaluate what other benefits, including psychological and psychosocial, can be achieved by using such exercise park. This project also aims to examine how this kind of intervention will be perceived in the community and if potential benefits can be identified, which could then help to determine whether such intervention is appropriate for further testing. This project will be run in collaboration with several community partner organisations in the Western Suburbs including Gateway Social Support Options and Catholic Homes. Sixty older people living in the community aged between 60 and 90 years who have had one fall in the previous 12 months or that are concerned they might fall will be recruited (older people with mild falls risk). Participants will be randomised in two groups: exercise park intervention group and a control group and will undergo a series of physical/physiological tests as well as complete some psychological and psychosocial questionnaires. Tests will be performed at baseline, after 18 weeks and then again after 2 months (26 weeks) for both groups. Participants will be followed up for 12 months via Falls and Physical Activity Calendars. Participants in the intervention group will have 2-3 sessions per week of 1-1.5 hours duration each session) for 18 weeks. Control group will continue with their normal activities for the same period. At the end of this study, the participants will be able to monitor their susceptibility to falls based on the result of the tests used in this study. Additionally, it is expected that, by the experience of working with this population group, some factors which can influence the exercise uptake and its compliance by the elderly may be identified. Furthermore, the research findings may offer some guidance on future investments local councils may make towards this population group.</summary>
