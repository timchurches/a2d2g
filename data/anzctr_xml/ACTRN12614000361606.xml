    <exclusivecriteria>1. Baseline transcutaneous carbon dioxide of greater than or equal to 60mmHg
2. FEV1:FVC ratio &gt;0.7
3. Age under 16 years 
4. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis
5. Morbid obesity (with a body mass index of greater than or equal to 40)
6. Inability to match FEV1 percentage predicted to a participant that took part in the bronchiectasis oxygen study* 
7. Any other condition which, at the investigators discretion, is believed may present a safety risk or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results.

*This study is designed to allow for comparison of results to a study of similar design in patients with bronchiectasis (ACTRN12612000356864). Participants will therefore be matched by FEV1 to the participants in the bronchiectasis study (the COPD participant must have an FEV1 percentage predicted within an absolute value of 5% of the FEV1 percentage predicted for the bronchiectasis patient (values inclusive)).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Following explanation of the trial and consent, participants will be assessed for eligibility. If eligible, participants will be randomised to the order of interventions (21% oxygen and 50% oxygen). This order will be available to an investigator who is not administering treatment, assessing outcomes or analysing data. Their role is to make available the gas bottles and bags (containing either 21% oxygen or 50% oxygen) in the randomised order. The labels on the bottles will be covered to maintain blinding of other investigators and the participant.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oxygen may have the side effect of increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood. Carbon dioxide is a waste product that is removed from the body through the lungs. This side effect is known to occur in patients with COPD. To help understand how to best administer oxygen to patients we are interested in understanding how this effect occurs. We are also interested in whether patients with COPD have a different response to oxygen therapy compared with patients with other respiratory diseases (including bronchiectasis). 

To investigate this we will measure carbon dioxide levels in people with COPD while breathing room air and compare them to carbon dioxide levels after they have breathed oxygen.

Following consent and assessment for eligibility, participants will be asked to breathe in random order treatment A (oxygen for 30 minutes) and treatment B (normal room air for 30 minutes) through a mask. 
Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive treatment A then treatment B, or treatment B then treatment A.

Carbon dioxide is easily measured during the interventions using a small device clipped painlessly to the earlobe. This will allow for continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide levels by a study doctor The results of this study will then be compared with those from our recently completed study of oxygen in patients with bronchiectasis.</summary>
