    <interventions>12-week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study that investigates the effects of daily unsalted almond consumption on cognitive function and established and emerging cardiometabolic biomarkers of disease in healthy participants in a free-living environment. Participants will be randomly allocated to consuming unsalted almonds (at 15% of energy intake) in conjunction with their habitual diet for 12 weeks. Overall calorie intake will remain the same as their habitual diet so participants will be advised by a dietitian on how to substitute foods to maintain the equivalent energy intake. Test foods can be eaten at any time of the day as decided by the participant. Test food checklists, serum and erythrocyte alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) levels will used to assess compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>12-week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm study that investigates the effects of daily unsalted almond consumption on cognitive function and established and emerging cardiometabolic biomarkers of disease in healthy participants in a free-living environment. Participants will be randomly allocated to consuming an isocaloric snack food (at 15% of energy intake) in conjunction with their habitual diet for 12 weeks. The control snack foods will contain an equal amount of energy and will be provided by the study. Participants' overall calorie intake will remain the same as their habitual diet so participants will be advised by a Dietitian on how to substitute foods to maintain the equivalent energy intake. Test food checklists will used to assess compliance. Participants will be advised to avoid nuts, including nuts as snacks, ingredients in a recipe (either as whole or ground nuts) or in packaged products more than or equal to 5% nuts as listed in the ingredients. All participants will have a 2 week period prior to stating the trial where they do not eat nuts or nut products.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline characteristics between the treatment groups will be compared using one-way ANOVA. The effects of almonds and control foods on the dependent measures over time will be analyzed using random effects mixed models, with treatment (almond group or control group) and time being the factors in the analysis and time being the repeated measurement. For significant interactions, Bonferroni post hoc pairwise comparisons will be performed to identify differences between means. Statistical significance will be set at P&lt;0.05. Primary outcomes for this trial include composite scores for different cognitive domains and also individual cognitive tests. The  composite score of speed of memory is known to decline with age and was susceptible to an omega-3 intervention in a healthy cohort. Additionally, the domain of speed of memory incorporates elements of processing speed which was improved by a nut intervention in a previous study by the team. Power analysis indicated that a total of 68 participants per group will be required to detect a difference in cognitive function between the two groups that equates to a medium effect size (0.5), at an -level of 0.05 with a statistical power of 0.80. An additional 7 subjects per group (10%) will be recruited to allow for attrition. Hence, we will recruit 150 participants in total. Based on previous published studies with similar populations and other nuts, we anticipate having sufficient power for secondary outcomes also.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effects of eating unsalted almonds on major cognitive domains (attention/concentration, executive function, working memory, secondary memory, spatial memory) and the secondary aims are to explore potential cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms underpinning cognitive enhancement following 12 weeks of almond consumption.This study will be a 12 week
randomized, controlled, parallel arm study that investigates the effects of unsalted almond consumption or alternative snack food (at 15% of energy intake) on cognitive function and established and emerging cardiometabolic biomarkers of disease in healthy participants in a free living environment. Participants will be asked to continue with their usual lifestyle whilst avoiding consumption of other nuts or nut butters apart from study foods. At the start of the study and after 12 weeks of eating almonds or the alternate snack food we will examine cognitive function in a computerised cognitive test battery, as well as cardiometabolic biomarkers (lipids, glucose regulation), vascular function (blood pressure, arterial compliance, circulating adhesion molecules) and markers of systemic inflammation. </summary>
