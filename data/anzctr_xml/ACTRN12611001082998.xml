    <studytitle>Scaffold Implant for Rotator Cuff Lesions Encountered on the Supraspinatus Tendon</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Study to determine if the addition of a collagen scaffold device will increase tendon thickness with comparable clinical outcomes over subacromial decompression and/or repair alone in patients with a supraspinatus tear.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1  Partial thickness tears surgically treated with the addition of an implanted collagen scaffold
Arm 2  Partial thickness tears surgically treated without the addition of an implanted collagen scaffold; standard subacromial decompression and/or repair alone (control) 
Arm 3  Larger partial thickness tears or small full thickness tears surgically treated with the addition of an implanted collagen scaffold

The surgical placement of the collagen scaffold following standard decompression and/or repair in treatment Arms 1 and 3 is expected to add approximately 20 minutes to the standard rotator cuff tear procedure in Arm 2 (control), which takes approximately 40 to 90 minutes depending on the size and complexity of the tear.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Supraspinatus tendon thickness as assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Constant Murley Shoulder Score; a standardized means of measuring Pain, Activities of Daily Living, Range of Motion, and Power, on a 100 point scale. Pain and Activities of Daily Living are subjectively scored. Range of Motion and Power are objectively scored using standard relevant limb positions measured with a goniometer and a Dynamometer respectively. (Constant, CR, and AHG Murley. "A clinical method of functional assessment of the shoulder." Clin Orthop Relat Res 214 (1987): 160-64.)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ASES Shoulder Score; a standardized shoulder score derived from patient self-evaluations of pain, using a visual analog scale, and answering questions on activities of daily living . (Richards, RR, et al. "A standardized method for the assessment of shoulder function." J Shoulder Elbow Surg 3 (1994): 347-52.)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>SF-36 quality of life assessment; derives a score from the answers to 36 survey questions (QualityMetric. SF-36v2 Health Survey. 2011)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
