    <interventions>Group III: for whom splanchnic using (10 ml of 70% alcohol  preceded by  2 ml of 2% lidocaine  will be  injected in each needle, two needles will be used) and celiac blocks (with 20 ml of 70% alcohol preceded by 2.5 ml of 2% lidocaine  will be injected in each needle, two needles will be used or 40 ml of alcohol in single needle approach )after failure of pain control with strong opioid medications  and then, analgesic requirements will be  managed according to severity of pain and WHO analgesic ladder..
The intervention wil be performed once for each patient.
Follow up will be extended along patients survival.

    <statisticalmethods>Comparison of  opioids consumption, pain  intensity and QLQ-C30 scores will be  made using the Student t test. Chi-square test will be  used for comparison between reported side effects, number of patients used opioids between groups. Cumulative survival will be  estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method  with Log- Rank. Signifcance will be  considered if P&lt;0.05. All analyses will be  performed using an intention-to-treat approach based on initial randomization by compensation  missing data due patients' death  in calculation by the last reported data value.
This study is a preliminary study, not powered and sample size determination based on previous clinical studies which had enrolled lesser number (1,2) of patients than 20 patients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To our knowledge yet no studies compared the efficacy of combined splanchnic nerve blockade and coeliac plexus blockade in pain relief and quality of life due to upper gastro-intestinal (GIT) tumours. The aim of this study was to compare effect for combined block including (splanchnic and celiac ) on quality of analgesia and quality of life versus each technique separately. </summary>
