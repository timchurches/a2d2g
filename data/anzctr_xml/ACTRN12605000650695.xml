  <interventions>
    <interventions>This pilot study involves the testing of a new assay to detect IL-4. A once only sample of two mls of blood will be taken from 4 specific groups of patients to test for the presence of IL-4. The cytokine, IL-4, measured by this new assay, is abnormally elevated in the blood of patients with coronary artery disease, the degree of abnormality of blood IL-4 is related to important clinical events in such patients, including severity of disease, acute complications and treatment.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All patients presenting in the settings described will be eligible to participate.  There will be no criteria for exclusion, apart from unwillingness to participate. It is proposed initially to study four small groups of patients with ischaemic heart disease. 1. Patients with unstable coronary artery disease admitted for Coronary Care will be studied on admission and then daily until coronary angiography is performed (or decided against). The IL-4 results will be related to the patient's clinical course, ECG changes, cardiac enzyme levels and angiographic findings. 2. Patients having coronary angioplasty, who have not been studied as part of group 1, will be studied before, immediately after and 24 hours after the procedure. The IL-4 results will be used to assess whether it can relate to the iatrogenic plaque rupture which this procedure involves. 3. Patients having coronary artery bypass grafting will be studied before, immediately after and 24 hours after surgery. On pump and off pump procedures (half in each subgroup) will be separately studied. The IL-4 results will be related to the extent (number of grafts) and duration of the surgical procedure. 4. Patients with stable coronary artery disease about to receive statin and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy will be studied before and twice weekly after the commencement of therapy for four weeks. The IL-4 results will be related to the dose and duration of drug therapy.</inclusivecriteria>
