  <interventions>
    <interventions>Insulin pump therapy with aspart insulin. Insulin pumps are small computerised devices delivering subcutaneous rapid-acting insulin continuously, accurately and flexibly.

Intervention - following a stable baseline subcutaneous insulin infusion rate for 6 hours, a clinically-relevant change is to be made to the basal insulin infusion rate. For the next 5 hours, circulating insulin levels are to be tested 15-minutely to assess the time to reach steady state circulating insulin levels. At the first study visit, the basal insulin rate change is to be an increment, and at the second study visit (1-6 weeks after the first visit) the rate change is to be a reduction. The total dose of subcutaneous insulin infused during the 5-hour intervention period will be between 2 units and 10 units (depending on the insulin requirements of the individual). Standardised insulin pumps and aspart insulin will be used for each study visit, and participants will resume their usual insulin and insulin pump at the conclusion of each visit.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insulin pumps are increasingly being used to deliver insulin for people with type 1 diabetes. The two main components of insulin pump delivery are firstly "bolus" insulin, used with meals or to correct high glucose levels, and secondly "basal" insulin which provides the background insulin requirements of the individual. The rate of basal insulin delivered can be adjusted with the pump, and this may vary according to the time of day, stress, illness or exercise.

Information regarding changes in the basal insulin infusion rate to best match an individual's insulin requirement is essential to guide clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study is to determine the time to reach steady state circulating insulin levels after a clinically-relevant increase and also a clinically-relevant reduction in basal insulin infusion rates delivered by insulin pumps to adults with type 1 diabetes.</summary>
