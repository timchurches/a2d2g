  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is an uncontrolled pilot. Main assessments occur at baseline, week 4 and week 8. Minor assessments occur at week 1, week 2 and week 3. The assessment materials include a Snack Intake Index, Snack TLFB, modified Snack-OTI, assessment of motivation to change behaviour, confidence to control snack intake scale and robot opinion questions. Different combinations of these measures are presented at different assessment time points. Demographic data and treatment expectancy are collected at the baseline assessment. The intervention will be delivered by a social robot (NAO robot), which has been programmed to deliver the intervention designed by three clinical research professors with extensive clinical health behaviour experience. The intervention will involve two face-to-face sessions (2 x 60 minute sessions) delivered by the robot in South Brisbane and two pre-recorded online video sessions (2 x 10 minute sessions) delivered by the robot as a booster treatment session with all sessions provided individually. A semi-structured qualitative interview will be conducted at the end of the second face-to-face session. The two face-to-face sessions are provided within two weeks, and two video sessions sent before and after the second face-to-face sessions. The social robot will deliver a modified and static version of Functional Imagery Training (Motivational interviewing with an imagery-based review of motivation, including imagery-based exercises for building motivation towards change. The intervention content will mostly be static and pre-programmed, with limited branching and customization. Fidelity of the script to key components of Functional Imagery Training has been checked by the developers of that intervention</interventions>
