  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who are recently diagnosed with a first onset head and neck cancer (HNC) and who report experiencing acute stress symptoms and/or depressive symptoms within the initial 4-6 weeks post-cancer diagnosis and prior to commencing their radiotherapy (primary or adjuvant) will be randomly allocated to receive Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). The CBT intervention is a directive therapy that comprises relaxation, stress management and coping skills training. Therapy will be conducted on an individual face-to-face basis and will consist of 6 consecutive weekly  meetings, 1.5 hours each, commencing on the same week as participants' scheduled radiotherapy program. Participants will also receive a booster (7th) session of CBT at 1-month following the completion of their radiotherapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants who are recently diagnosed with a first onset head and neck cancer (HNC) and who report experiencing acute stress symptoms and/or depressive symptoms within the initial 4-6 weeks post-cancer diagnosis and prior to commencing their radiotherapy (primary or adjuvant) will be randomly allocated to receive Supportive Counselling (SC). The SC intervention is a non-directive approach in which client-participants are encouraged to express their concerns in an unconditionally supportive therapeutic environment. Therapy will be conducted on an individual face-to-face basis and will consist of 6 consecutive weekly  meetings, 1.5 hours each, commencing on the same week as participants' scheduled radiotherapy program. Participants will also receive a booster (7th) session of SC at 1-month following the completion of their radiotherapy.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aim of this research is to test the efficacy of a brief, early cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention in reducing anxiety [including cancer-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  (PTSD)], and/or depression and improving the psychological well-being and quality of life for adult individuals newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) who have been scheduled to receive radiation treatment. It is hypothesized that the CBT program (experimental condition) will help reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms both in the short- and longer-term (up to 12-months) following the completion of patients radiotherapy regimens, compared with a non-directive Supportive Counselling (SC) program (active control condition).</summary>
