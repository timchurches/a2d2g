  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin (Hgb) at Week 4 - Baseline Hgb value was the average of three Hgb values taken during screening period at Week (W) -4, W-2 and Day 1. Change from Baseline in Hgb was calculated as W4 value minus the Baseline value. To model the dose-response relationship a four-parameter Emax model was used. The dose response dataset was based on all non-missing data collected up to W4. Participants (par.) who had a Week 2 Hgb measurement, but a missing Week 4 Hgb measurement were included with a change from Baseline at Week 4 value imputed as twice the change from Baseline at Week 2. E0 is the expected Hgb change from Baseline for a par. receiving placebo and experiencing the average Hgb Baseline observed in the study. Emax is the expected Hgb change from Baseline for a par. receiving the highest dose above which no further increase in response can be achieved. ED50 is the dose that attains the intermediate response. Gamma is the slope parameter. Alpha is the coefficient of the model covariate for centred Baseline.</outcome>

          -  Gender: Female and male subjects. (Week -4 verification only) Females: If of
             childbearing potential, must agree to use one of the approved contraception methods,
             from Screening until completion of the Follow-up Visit OR of non-childbearing
             potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, or oophorectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) 23.0-116.3 International units per liter (IU/L) and
             estradiol &lt;=10 picomole per liter (pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use
             one of the approved contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2
             weeks must elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive
             method;

             may have become eligible. However, an individual subject may not rescreen more than
             twice. There is no predetermined amount of time that the investigator needs to wait to
             rescreen a previously ineligible subject, except those excluded for Hgb or folate who
             may only rescreen in 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, and those excluded for Vitamin B12
             who may rescreen in 8 weeks</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This study is intended to evaluate the dose-response relationship of GSK1278863 over the
      first 4 weeks of treatment and evaluate the safety and efficacy of GSK1278863 over 24 weeks
      to maintain hemoglobin (Hgb) level in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are switched from a stable dose of
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). The data generated will enable selection of the
      starting dose(s) and optimize dose adjustment regimen(s) for Phase 3 clinical trials.</summary>
