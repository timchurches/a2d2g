  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paracetamol is commonly used to reduce pain after operations. Recently anaesthetists have
      been using bigger doses of paracetamol because it has been suggested that bigger doses will
      work better. However these bigger doses have never been assessed scientifically in adult
      patients to see if they work better, and it has not been determined at which dose the maximum
      effect in reducing pain occurs. We We will investigate whether a 90 mg per kg body weight
      dose works better than a 60 mg per kilogram dose, in reducing pain after wisdom tooth
      extraction. We will also examine the pharmacokinetics (the way the body removes the drug) of
      paracetamol, and whether paracetamol changes the way blood clots at these doses. We will also
      examine whether these doses are safe, by monitoring liver enzymes, and making sure the blood
      level of paracetamol is not greater than that previously recognised to cause liver disease.
      The patients will be healthy volunteers scheduled to have wisdom tooth extraction. They will
      have blood taken at intervals for four hours after having the paracetamol. They will fill in
      pain scores at the same times they have blood taken.</summary>
