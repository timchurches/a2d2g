  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention in this research program is the ambient temperature to which participants will be exposed. Two separate protocols will be investigated:
1. Ambient temperature will begin at 23 degrees, and over the course of 90 minutes, will either be increased to 35 degrees or decreased down to 11 degrees. These temperature ramps will be linear and controlled with automatic feedback loop programs within the environmental simulation suite. The cooling and warming exposures will both be carried out by the same participants but on separate days. To allow for further clarification of the thermoneutral zone, participants will have these expired gases measured with indirect hood calorimetry throughout the exposure. Participants will be asked to wear scrubs and sit in a semi-reclined  position whilst wearing a clear plastic indirect calorimetry hood in the environmental simulation suite. 
2. During the second protocol, participants will visit the environmental simulation suite for three sessions. Whilst wearing standadised scrubs, they will be asked to live and work inside the room calorimeter for 8 hours in an effort to replicate a normal office day experience. For the control condition, temperature will be kept at the thermoneutral temperature of 23 degrees. The two intervention exposures will lower the temperature to 17 degrees for the 8 hour exposure or fluctuate the temperature between 23 and 17 throughout the exposure. Indirect room calorimetry  will be collected throughout the exposure so that the energy expenditure response to temperature changes may be monitored. 
For both protocols, a DXA scan will be performed so as to accurately quantify fat/lean mass for subsequent analysis of the calorimetry data. Data collection will take place at the Centre for Translational Physiology which is part of the University of Otago Wellington campus. Due to the cross over design of both protocols, at least a 2 day wash our period will be implemented between exposures. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will serve as their own controls for both protocols with the control conditions being set at 23 degrees. This is a temperature commonly used in the literature by previous studies and has been shown to be in the thermoneutral zone for most participants. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Multivariable-adjusted general linear models (GLM) will be used to quantify the environmental condition differences in total energy expenditure and the changes in total energy expenditure. In the latter GLM for analysis of changes, covariates will include baseline total energy expenditure and other variables known to be associated with this outcome variable. These covariates will include body composition, neuroendocrine function, gender, age and both peripheral and core temperature. The precise relationship between total energy expenditure and body mass will be identified with an allometric model rather than simple ratio normalisation. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants will be asked to visit the Centre for Translational Physiology in the morning in a fasted state and having avoided alcohol and exercise for the previous 24 hours. A DXA scan for body composition will be carried out and a standardised breakfast provided to all. 

Protocol 1:
Participants will visit the Centre twice and in a randomised order undergo a warming or cooling protocol.  All sessions will take place in the Global Energetics and Environmental Simulation Suite (GEnESiS), which allows for control of temperature, humidity and oxygen concentration. After being fitted with the study measurement tools, participants will be placed under a hood in a semi-reclined position. Over the course of 90 minutes, the environmental conditions will be modulated in accordance with the grouping structure and energy expenditure continuously recorded. To standardise environmental exposure, all participants will be provided with identical scrubs in the place of personal clothing. Temperature will start at thermoneutral 23 degrees so as to not have previous exposure affecting responses. 

Warming condition- Temperature will start at 23 degrees and increase to 35 degrees over 90 minutes
Cooling condition- Temperature will start at 23 degrees and decrease to 11 degrees over 90 minutes

Protocol 2:
Healthy participants (18-60 years) with no major cardiovascular disease will be asked to visit the Centre for three 8-hour sessions and one familiarisation session. The temperature conditions in the simulation suite will be modulated as the study intervention; baseline temperature 23 degrees, mild cold exposure 17 degrees and fluctuations between mild cold and baseline temperature. The order of exposures will be randomised for each participant and daily activity will be held consistent. </summary>
