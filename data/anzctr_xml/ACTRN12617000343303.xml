  <interventions>
    <interventions>During visit 1, participants will undergo a cognitive assessment and a fitness test. 
One week later, participants will return to the lab for a second visit. 

During visit 2, each participant will be randomly assigned to one of the three following exercise condition:  1) stretching 2) moderate intensity aerobic exercise and 3) high intensity aerobic exercise. The acute bout of exercise will be completed after the blood draw has taken place. Subjects will engage in either stretching (gentle upper and lower extremity stretching) for 38 minutes, moderate-intensity cycling for 38 minutes (50-75% V02 max) or high intensity cycling for 33 minutes (85-95% V02 max). During the exercise session, subjects heart rate will be monitored during warm up, cool down and during the test to ensure they maintain their target. All three exercise conditions will be performed one-on-one in a gym at The University of Queensland School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences. 

1) The stretching condition will provide interaction with a researcher without increasing the subjects heart rate and is commonly employed as a control. To ensure this is achieved, heart rate will be monitored during the session. 

2) The moderate intensity aerobic exercise condition will be conducted on a Watt Bike for a total of 38 minutes per session. A five minute warm up and a three minute cool down will be conducted at 50-60% of HRmax. The participant will cycle for 30 minutes at an intensity of 50-65% of HRmax. 

3) The high intensity aerobic exercise condition will be conducted on a Watt bike for a total of 33 minutes per session. A warm up of five minutes and a cool down of three minutes will be conducted at an intensity of 50-60% HRmax. The high intensity interval training will alternate periods of work with active recovery. The exercise protocol will be 4x4min bouts at 85-95% of HRmax. An active recovery (50-65% HRmax) for three minutes will follow each four minute high intensity bout. 

One week later, participants will return to the lab for a third visit (follow-up) where they will undergo a recall and a recognition word learning task and will complete a questionnaire on the strategies used during word learning. 

Therefore, each participant will attend 3 visits within a period of 2 weeks.
Visit 1: day 1  (cognitive assessment and fitness test) 
Visit 2: day 8 (blood draw pre-exercise, acute exercise bout, post-exercise blood draw, word learning task*, post-learning blood draw)
Visit 3: day 15 (follow-up recall and recognition task**, word learning strategies)

 * The word learning task during visit 2 includes 5 learning trials interspersed with 5 recalls and a recognition task and the total end. This word learning task assesses the initial acquisition of new words. 

 ** The word learning task during visit 3 only includes 1 recall and 1 recognition task for memory consolidation purposes of the new words that were presented during visit 2.

      <timepoint>All three blood draws are performed within the same day (during visit 2). 
1. Blood draw #1 : before exercising. 
2. Acute bout of exercise (either stretching, moderate-intensity cycling or high-intensity cycling. 
3. Blood draw #2: after exercising. 
4. Word learning task. 
5. Blood draw #3: after learning. 

All three blood draws will be performed during visit 2 within an approximately 2 hour period. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is now compelling evidence demonstrating the importance of exercise in maintaining and improving cognition in late adulthood (Hillman et al. 2008), but little is known about the effect of acute exercise on age-related problems in language function and memory consolidation. In order to tackle this issue, we will examine the influence of acute exercise on how older adults learn and consolidate new word representations. New word learning is impacted by ageing (Service &amp; Craik, 1993; Whiting et al. 2011) and involves the hippocampus and the striatum; regions that are both implicated in exercise effects on cognition and vulnerable in ageing (Erickson et al., 2011) suggesting candidate mechanisms for exercise-induced enhancement of word learning. The proposed research will examine how exercise affects new word learning when different intensities of exercise and types of learning are involved. This project will employ an innovative combination of behavioural and biomarker measurement to achieve the following overall aims: 1) Determine the effects of acute exercise on new word learning and brain function in older adults; 2) Identify the relationship between word learning and exercise-induced changes in neurotrophins and neurotransmitters; 3) Examine the influence of acute exercise on initial acquisition versus consolidation of new words.</summary>
