Primary contact physiotherapy is when the patient is referred directly to the physiotherapist after triage.  The intervention comprises a single episode of care expected to last less than 3 hours.  The complete duration of the project is expected to be 18 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiotherapists are being used more often in Emergency Departments to help treat people with simple musculoskeletal injuries. The physiotherapist in the Emergency Department can treat directly (primary contact physiotherapy), or treat after the patient is first seen by a doctor who then refers on to physiotherapy (secondary contact physiotherapy). 

The aim of this project is to compare the different models of physiotherapy services for people with simple peripheral musculoskeletal injuries presenting to Emergency Departments.  It is hypothesised that compared to secondary contact physiotherapy, primary contact physiotherapy will reduce length of stay in the Emergency Department, without having any adverse effects, such as an increased re-presentation rate.</summary>
