  <interventions>
    <interventions>Glucagon-like peptide-1 at 1.2pmol.kg.min infused at 1ml/min between t=0-270min.  Participants will cross-over to the other arm (i.e. GLP-1 to control and vice-versa) on the next consecutive day (as GLP-1 is rapidly metabolised with a t1/2 &lt; 5mins)</interventions>
    <comparator>Cross-over study
Cross-over treatment is 4% albumin infusion (which has no effect on blood glucose) infused at 1ml/min between t=0-270minutes</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Royal Adelaide Hospital will be screened.  Next of kin will be approached for informed consent.  Synthetic GLP-1-(7-36) amide  is  reconstituted by the Royal Adelaide Hospital department of pharmacy, as a solution in 4% albumin.  Randomisation is performed by the department of pharmacy, so that on each study day the investigators receive the study drug in a glass bottle covered by black plastic.</concealment>
