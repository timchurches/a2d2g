  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who present with a first time patella dislocation will be randomly assigned to one of two immobilisation braces (full or partial immobilisation) for 3 weeks. The partial immobilisation group will be the intervention. The full immobilisation brace maintains the knee in full extension, the partial immobilisation brace allows limited knee flexion and maintains pressure on the lateral side of the patella. Both groups will wear the allocated brace full-time for 3 weeks from the date of injury.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants  aged older than 12 years who suffer an acute patellar dislocation and present to the emergency department of Monash Medical Centre, Casey Hospital or Dandenong Hospital between June 2012 and June 2013 will be invited to participate in this study. Those who meet the inclusion criteria (and have no exclusion criteria) who sign informed consent (and their parents if aged less than 18 years) will be included in the study.
Once admitted to the emergency department, all eligible participants will be examined by a physiotherapist and have their affected knee immobilised in a Zimmer knee splint for 3 days. This rigid form of immobilisation is considered to be standard practice amongst Southern Health hospitals, and reflects the results of the few studies that have compared different forms of immobilisation for acute patellar dislocations. All patients will be provided with a gait aid and asked to weight bear as tolerated and receive education regarding on standard acute injury management procedures (rest, ice, compression, and elevation, with no heat, alcohol or massage). Information about this research project will be given to patients, and they will be asked to return for a review appointment 3 days after acute presentation. It is widely accepted that the acute inflammatory phase of wound healing has a duration of 72 hours (3 days) (Eaglstein, 1993), and therefore, all participants will receive this treatment regimen during the initial healing phase. 
At the follow up appointment, a physiotherapist at Monash Medical Centre, Dandenong or Casey Hospital will review eligible patients. Those who consent to participate in this trial,  will have their hypermobility assessed with the Beighton Scale and then they will be randomised accounting for their hypermobility status using sealed envelopes. Randomisation will be completed by someone external to the study and the intervention applied by the study participants. 
Participants randomised to the control group will be instructed to continue wearing the Zimmer knee splint, while those in the intervention group will be fitted with a J- Lat brace (a patellar stabilising brace, Sportstek Australia) that provides partial immobilisation. All participants are will be instructed to wear their brace at all times, with weight bearing as tolerated. Participants in both groups will be immobilised for a period of 3 weeks from the original presentation at the hospital, and are not to participate in sport for 6 weeks. This duration of immobilisation reflects the standard practice at Southern Health hospitals, as well as the average immobilisation time as reported in current literature.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence will be generated using two sets of computer generated random allocations in permuted blocks: one set will be for subjects classified as 'no hypermobility', and the other for those classified as 'hypermobile'.  These randomisation processes will be repeated to generate the same random allocation with permuted blocks model for each of the three participating sites.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare standard full immobilisation protocols with partial immobilisation for 3 weeks on the functional and treatment outcomes and redislocation rates of individuals with first time patella dislocations. 
It also aims to examine the effect of generalised joint hypermobility on outcomes after first-time patella dislocation.
Hypotheses
This study will test the hypothesis that those treated with the partial immobilisation brace will have better functional outcomes with no change in redislocation rates compared to full immobilisation.    In addition, it is hypothesised that those treated with full immobilisation, will require more physiotherapy than those treated with a partial immobilisation stabilising brace, in order to regain the same level of function. 
It is also hypothesised that participants with generalised joint hypermobility will have greater redislocation rates than those who are not hypermobile in both groups.</summary>
