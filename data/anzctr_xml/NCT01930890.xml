  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - AEs with a start date on or after the first dose date in study 211LE202. AE: any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE: any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Week 108</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment or Withdrew From Study Due to an AE - AEs with a start date on or after the first dose date in study 211LE202. AE: any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE: any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

    <inclusivecriteria>Key 

          -  Subjects who completed Week 52 of Study 211LE201 (NCT01499355) and did not discontinue
             BIIB023 or placebo study treatment.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception during the
             study and be willing and able to continue contraception for 6 months after their last
             dose of study treatment.

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any significant change in medical history in subjects from Study 211LE201, including
             laboratory tests or current clinically significant condition that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would have excluded the subjects' participation. The Investigator
             must re-review the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any
             diseases that would preclude treatment under this protocol.

          -  Subjects from Study 211LE201 who discontinued BIIB023 or placebo treatment prior to
             Week 52 of Study 211LE201.

          -  Female subjects considering becoming pregnant while in the study, currently pregnant,
             or breast feeding.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the requirements of the protocol including
             the presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect
             the subject's ability to comply with the protocol.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen, makes
             the subject unsuitable for enrollment.
