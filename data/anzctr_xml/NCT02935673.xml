    <summary>The purpose of this study is to characterize the Pharmacokinetic and to confirm the popPK
      model derived from healthy volunteers in hospitalized adults who are infected with
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to determine in adults who are hospitalized with
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection the dose response relationship of multiple
      regimens of lumicitabine on antiviral activity based on nasal RSV shedding using quantitative
      real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay.</summary>
