  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, randomised (solution allocation), bilateral, cross-over clinical trial where a minimum of 30 experienced contact lens wearers will use a commercial multipurpose solution (MPS) (OPTI-FREE (Registered Trademark) Puremoist (Registered Trademark)) (OFPM) and a novel MPS (BHVI7) in conjunction with Clariti (Trademark) and or ACUVUE (Registered Trademark) OASYS (Trademark) contact lenses on a daily wear basis for approximately two or four months. There will be 2 or 4 stages in this study, with each stage corresponding to using one of the MPS for one month. There will be 8 or 16 scheduled visits, with 4 visits per stage: baseline/dispensing visit, 2 hour post insertion, 2 weeks and 1-month visits. These visits will involve assessment of visual acuity, assessment of ocular comfort using questionnaires employing a 1-10 numeric rating scale and ocular response by examination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (a specialised microscope for viewing the eye). Lenses will be worn a minimum of 5 days per week, 6 hours per day. All solutions will be used after lens removal and as per manufacturers recommendation: Rub lenses with solution (5 seconds), rinse lenses with solution (5seconds) and store in solution for at least 6 hours. Solution is not to be reused. Clariti contact lenses will be replaced monthly and ACUVUE OASYS 2-weekly. There will be a 48 hour wash-out where no contact lenses are worn before the commencement of each stage.</interventions>

Be at least 18 years old, male or female.
Be experienced at wearing contact lenses.
Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses.
Correctable to at least 6/12 or better in each eye with contact lenses.
Be willing to not wear contact lenses for at least 2 days before each stage of the clinical trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 
NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 2 days between in-house studies.

    <concealment>Participants who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria are enrolled in the trial and are given a sequential participant number. A randomisation plan (see below) is used to allocate contact lens solution to each participant, based on their unique participant number. A randomisation list will be generated by the biostatistician and applied through the Clinic Data Management system.</concealment>
