  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two intervention arms in a cross-over design: once only sessions where either active or sham anodal transcranial direct current stimulation is delivered to the lesioned lower limb motor cortex from a Phoresor II stimulator (Model PM850; IOMED) set to deliver 0.5 mA for 10 minutes using an 8 sq cm saline soaked sponge electrode. Intervention arms will be separated by at least 1 week.</interventions>
    <comparator>For sham brain stimulation the same protocol will be used and the current ramped back down to zero within 30 seconds of stimulation starting.
The inclusion of a group of healthy subjects is not an intervention control but has been included to allow the comparison of intervention-induced changes of gait initiation measures between stroke with healthy subjects.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prior to and after brain stimulation, EMG recordings from ankle and knee flexors and extensors of both limbs will be used to estimate the time from an auditory cue to the onset of muscle activation (latency) as subjects initiate stepping.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after brain stimulation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prior to and after brain stimulation, EMG recordings from ankle and knee flexors and extensors of both limbs will be used to estimate the amplitude of the EMG burst from onset to when the heel leaves the floor as subjects initiate stepping.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after brain stimulation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prior to and after brain stimulation, subjects will initiate stepping from a pair of three dimensional force plates and the latency from auditory cue to when ground reaction forces begin to change from quiet standing will be recorded. The pattern and variability of centers of pressure in both limbs will also be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after brain stimulation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relationship of effects of brain stimulation and integrity of the corticospinal pathway projecting from the lesioned hemisphere will be assessed by regressing the asymmetry of fractional anisotropy calculated for the posterior limbs of the internal capsules and the latency of EMG onset during gait initiation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>MRI scans will be obtained prior to the gait initiation data collection; and the latency of EMG onset during gait initiation will be calculated prior to transcranial direct current stimulation being administered.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke affects approximately 56,000 New Zealanders at any point in time. The majority of patients regain their ability to walk but have difficulty initiating stable gait. This instability increases the likelihood of falls, and diminishes the patients confidence to walk in the community. Research suggests this instability is caused by poor balance and weakness in the affected leg, plus abnormal commands descending from the brain to the spinal cord that alter the timing of muscle activations in the legs just prior to stepping off. This latter abnormality is the subject of the proposed research. The experiments will determine if safe, painless and weak electrical stimulation administered to the brain through the scalp can restore the generation of normal brain commands and increase stability of gait initiation in stroke survivors. Age-similar healthy control subjects will be included in the study to aid our understanding of the effects of the brain stimulation, and of the mechanisms driving improved stability. Research outcomes are expected to inform the development of new walking-related therapies. The study will also seek to identify patient characteristics that would guide the future delivery of an enhanced therapy on an individualised patient basis.</summary>
