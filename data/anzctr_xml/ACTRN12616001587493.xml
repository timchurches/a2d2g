The intervention arm will be asked to perform two minutes of CPR on a manikin that has been encased in a suit containing pig fat in a vacuum sealed bag to a depth that mimics a BMI of 40 kg/m2. 

The washout period between mannikins will be 5 minutes. We were concerned that 15 minutes between trials was excessive. In a trial of the methodology we found that participants HR had returned to baseline by 5 minutes and the washout period was reduced to this as a result..</interventions>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Assuming that effective CPR will be conducted for 90% of compressions, to demonstrate a 15% deterioration in CPR efficacy, it is thought that a sample size of approximately 55 participants will be needed with an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.8. Calculated using Statistica(TM).

Results will be analysed using Statistica(TM).  Non-parametric data will be analysed using the Chi squared statistic (efficacy of CPR, rate, adequate depth, adequate recoil for &gt; 90% of compressions, difference between perceived and actual effectiveness).  

Parametric data will be analysed using the students t test (time taken to fatigue, level of discomfort).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is little research regarding the efficacy of CPR in obese patients.  The primary aim will be to assess whether hospital staff trained in BLS can deliver effective chest compressions in the setting of a CPR simulation using a dummy which is modified to reflect a patient with morbid obesity.

Aim of study:
*	The aim of this study is to explore whether chest compressions in an obese patient are an effective part of the BLS and ALS algorithm and should continue to be used as part of resuscitative efforts during a cardiac arrest.  In addition, this study aims to explore whether providers of CPR fatigue more rapidly when delivering CPR to morbidly obese patients.

Primary Outcome:
*	The primary outcome is to measure the efficacy of chest compressions in a morbidly obese scenario. This will use digital mannequins to record the quality and adequacy of chest compressions over a period of 2 minutes of uninterrupted CPR.  Effective CPR will be defined as a composite measure of adequate depth of compression, adequate time for recoil and at an adequate rate for more than 90% of compressions delivered.

Secondary outcomes:
*	Adequacy of each component of CPR (namely depth, adequate recoil and rate).
*	Time taken for staff to fatigue when performing CPR on a morbidly obese mannequin.  It is known that the maximum amount of time a member of staff can perform effective CPR for is 2 minutes in a normal scenario. 
*	Staff discomfort/pain experienced performing CPR.
*	The association between perceived effectiveness of chest compressions by staff and recorded adequacy.
