  <interventions>
    <interventions>1- Minimally access hydrocelectomy:
A small scrotal incision 2 cm long is done as well as incision of the Dartos muscles in the same line . 	The parietal tunica vaginalis  is grasped and minimal blunt dissection is made by the aid of index finger and a small hole is made for aspiration of hydrocele fluid . Then a disc of tissue is excised of the parietal tunica vaginalis about double of the skin incision dimension using electrocautery.  The edge of the tunica vaginalis is sutured to the Dartos and scrotal skin in an everted manner aiming to expose the visceral tunica toward scrotal skin . Closure with drain  and discharge is allowed at the same day. Cephradine 1 gm administered intravenously at the time of induction of anaesthesia or just after the administration of spinal anaesthesia was given followed by another dose 2 h postoperatively. Patients are seen in the second day and examined for scrotal edema and hematoma. In all patients, drains are removed in the second day. All the excised tissues are sent for pathological examination to rule out any epididymal or vasal structures in the specimen. The mean operative  is 15 minutes. The total duration of the study period and its follow-up is 60 months

2- Conventional hydrocelectomy:
Incision of the hydrocele sac after complete mobilization of the hydrocele. Partial resection of the hydrocele sac, leaving a margin of 12 cm. Care is taken not to injure testicular vessels, epididymis or ductus deferens. The  edges of the hydrocele sac are sewn together behind the spermatic cord (Winkelmann's or Jaboulay's technique). The mean operative  is 27 minutes. The total duration of the study period and its follow-up is 60 months</interventions>

    <sequence>Opaque envelopes are numbered sequentially from 1 to 120 ( 60 patients for each groups).  A computer-generated table of random numbers is used for group assignment; if the last digit of the random number is from 0 to 4, assignment was to Group A (minimally access hydrocelectomy), and if the last digit is from 5 to 9, assignment was to Group B (conventional hydrocelectomy). The assignments are then placed into the opaque envelopes and the envelopes sealed. The envelopes are opened by the operating surgeon after patient consent and just prior to the surgery. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Calculation of the sample size  of participants to be recruited for the study uses the mathematical equation. The author used this equation to calculate the minimum number required to reliably answer the research question. 

m  =		m= K(p_1 q_1+p_2 q_2 )/d^2 =60 patients

                            
Where:
q1 = (1 - p1) , q2 = (1 - p2) and  d   = (p1- p2)
K  = constant, which depends on: alpha and beta levels, where alpha =0.05 and beta =0.1. Then K =8.6. 
P1 represents the overall complications of conventional surgical hydrocelectomy in previous studies.

P2 represents the overall complications of minimally access hydrocelectomy reported in previous studies.
The statistical tests were run on a compatible personal computer using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) for windows 15. Chi-square distribution was used for studying the frequencies of recurrence, pain, hospital stay and postoperative complications. The values were expressed as means +/-standard errors of deviation. The mean values of the groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired comparisons of the groups were done using the paired student t test. P&lt; 0.05 was considered significant.
