  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this phase Ib, multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group
      study, 120 subjects with moccasin type tinea pedis (MTTP) will be enrolled at approximately
      11 centres in the USA, Canada and Australia.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the patient response to three W0027 regimens
      in subjects with MTTP. Secondary objectives include assessment of the safety, tolerability
      and skin and nail pharmacokinetics to the three Albaconazole regimens.</summary>
