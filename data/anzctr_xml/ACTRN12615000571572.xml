  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients will be eligible for the trial if they are adult men aged 40 to 80 years who have a PI-RADSv2 (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score of  4 or 5 and proceed to prostate biopsy with an intention of having a prostatectomy for confirmed high-risk prostate cancer</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be ineligible for the trial if they:
- have been taking any lipid (fats) or cholesterol-lowering medication or blood-glucose (sugar level)-lowering drugs
- have experienced any unwanted effects with lipid or glucose-lowering drugs previously
- have been considered by their urologist to be unsuitable for the research programme or involvement in the study is not consistent with the patients best interests
- are taking medications that could cross-react with medications used in the trial</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potentially eligible patients who are seeing a recruiting urologist for this trial and who have had a multiparametric MRI (magenetic resonance imaging) with a commercially-operated 3 Tesla machine for an elevated serum PSA will be given the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form for this trial with their request for the MRI.

Patients who have the MRI and subsequently have a PI-RADSv2 (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score of 4 or 5 and indicate a preparedness to have a radical prostatectomy if significant cancer is detected by biopsy, will then discuss the trial with their urologist and sign the consent form at their leisure should they wish to participate and be eligible. The urologist will then pass the consent form on to the Trial Coordinator along with the participant's biopsy date. 

The participant will then complete the baseline questionnaires and provide blood and urine samples prior to their prostate biopsy. Randomly selected participants will have an additional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with a 7 Tesla machine prior to their prostate biopsies.

The trial coordinator will then use a randomisation list to randomise participants into one of the four treatment groups and arrange for the appropriate medication to be dispensed. This list will not reveal the group to which participants have been assigned to the Trial Coordinator, urologist or participant, only their randomisation number (R001, R002, etc.), which will also be used to label their medication. The Trial Coordinator will also have opaque Code Break Envelopes containing the group assignment of each randomisation number, should unblinding be required due to an adverse event. With the exception of unblinding being required due to an adverse event, unblinding will not take place until statistical analysis has been completed.

The morning after biopsy the participant will commence the 6 weeks of medication. Medication will be supplied to patients in three bottles (morning, mid-day and evening) and each bottle will contain pills of identical appearance (although they will be coloured depending on the time of day they should be taken, but not their content).

In the unlikely event that a participant's biopsy reveals no prostate cancer or should a participant later elect not to undergo a radical prostatectomy he will cease the trial medication and any further assessments. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence will be computer-generated externally to the research team with no blocking resulting in 20 participants being allocated to each trial group across the 80 participants involved.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>As a phase I/II study, a number of 20 per group was considered appropriate for provision of baseline data. If evidence of favourable parameter changes and acceptable tolerability of the combination regimen of atorvastatin and metformin is forthcoming, the results may justify a larger study with these drugs, although not necessarily at this stage in tumour development.

A multivariable model for prognostication of the risk for experiencing either of the primary end points will be developed. The model will incorporate baseline measures in blood and SF as well as metabolomic and proteomic markers. Each marker tested independently that achieves a significance level of P&lt;0.20 will be selected for testing in this multivariable stepwise (backward elimination) logistic regression model. Variables associated with P&lt;0.2 will be retained in the final multivariable model. Maximum likelihood estimates of the parameter coefficients will be obtained using Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The goodness of fit of the model will be evaluated by calculating the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic and the ability of the model to classify patients (ie, its predictive performance) will be evaluated using the C statistic, a term equivalent to the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve for dichotomous outcomes. The beta coefficients of selected markers will be used to create the composite scores that can then be used for clinical risk stratification. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether Metformin and Atorvastatin (taken alone or together) improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer in terms of the aggressiveness and the biology of their cancer

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 40 to 80 years, have a PI-RADSv2 (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System) score of 4 or 5 and proceed to prostate biopsy with an intention of having a prostatectomy for confirmed high-risk prostate cancer.

Study details
Metformin is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes to lower blood sugar levels and Atorvastatin is a common cholesterol lowering medication. Previous research has found that people who take these Metformin are less likely to have prostate cancer and those who take Atorvastatin are more likely to have less dangerous prostate cancers. Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of four groups. The four groups will be divided as: 1) Placebo; 2) Metformin; 3) Atorvastatin; and 4) Metformin and Atorvastatin. You will have to take oral capsules three times a day for 6 weeks and all parties will be blinded regarding patient treatment allocation. 

Patient outcomes will then be assessed through blood, urine and tissue samples provided before the treatment starts and 6-8 weeks after as well as through medical imaging for some patients.

It is hoped that the findings of this pilot trial will serve to help other men after they have had diagnostic prostatic biopsies showing prostate cancer, through providing evidence for a treatment that reduces the aggressiveness of their cancer, although this will need to be established in larger studies.</summary>
