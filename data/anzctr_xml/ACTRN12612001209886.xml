    <interventions>Observational study of fatty acid/carnitine homeostasis in CFS/ME. Participants will provide a single fasting blood sample from which plasma free fatty acid and carnitine levels will be determined and the ratio of fatty acid/carnitine levels calculated. In a sub-group of participants, assessment will also be conducted using standard 13C-oleic acid breath testing and baseline corrected expired air 13CO2 concentration-time data will be kinetically modelled to determine the rate and extent of fatty acid oxidation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to determine the ratio of free fatty acid/acylcarnitine for a wide range of fatty acids, as an index of fatty acid/carnitine homeostasis, in patients with CFS/ME compared to healthy controls, and the possible application of this information as a diagnostic criterion in CFS/ME.
Participants will provide a single fasting blood sample from which plasma free fatty acid and carnitine levels will be determined and the ratio of fatty acid/carnitine levels calculated. Ratios will be compared between the study populations using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if a difference exists.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship between the ratio of fatty acid/carnitine levels and quality-of-life (assessed via Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 questionnaire) and fatigue severity (assessed via Fatigue Severity Scale) will be examined using linear regression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single-point assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objective of this study is to determine the rate and extent of fatty acid oxidation, as indicated by the 13C fatty acid breath test, in patients with CFS/ME compared to healthy controls, and to assess the suitability of this test for the clinical diagnosis of CFS/ME.
In a sub-group of participants, assessment will also be conducted using standard 13C-oleic acid breath testing and baseline corrected expired air 13CO2 concentration-time data will be kinetically modelled to determine the rate and extent of fatty acid oxidation. Breath test results will be compared between the study populations using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if a difference exists.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Single fasting blood samples will be collected from each study participant for analysis of endogenous plasma L carnitine, acylcarnitine and free fatty acid concentrations. Results will be utilised for the determination of indices of fatty acid/carnitine homeostasis, calculated as the ratio of plasma free fatty acid  acylcarnitine. At the time of blood sample collection, each study participant will complete validated questionnaires for assessment of fatigue severity (Fatigue Severity Scale) and quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36, SF 36). 
13C oleic acid breath testing will be conducted in a subgroup of participants. After an overnight fast, participants will be administered a single 50 mg oral dose of 13C oleic acid. Expired air samples will be collected prior to dose administration (baseline) and then at hourly intervals until 8 hours post-dose for analysis of 13CO2 content. Baseline-corrected expired air 13CO2 concentration-time data will be kinetically modelled to determine the rate and extent of oxidation of oleic acid.
Results of fatty acid/carnitine profiling and 13C oleic acid breath testing obtained from patients with CFS/ME will be statistically compared to those obtained from healthy controls using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical examination of the relationship between the determined indices of fatty acid oxidation and fatigue severity/quality of life will be conducted using linear regression.</summary>
