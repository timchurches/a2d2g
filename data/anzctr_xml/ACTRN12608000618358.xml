    <concealment>Geriatricians or psycho-geriatricians will assess the patients and classify them according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (AIREN) diagnostic criteria. Medical history and examination, blood tests for reversible dementia and neuropsychological assessment will be conducted if deemed necessary. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to receive the active Chinese herbal medicine formulation or placebo. Medication randomisation is conducted by a computer at a central administration site where the trial medications are also labelled in numbered (coded) containers to maintain concealment for researchers.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be conducted by computer. Patients and investigating staff will be blinded to treatment allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common form of dementia and is a major cause of mental and physical disability in the elderly. There are currently no satisfactory or widely accepted medical options to help alleviate the symptoms associated with this disorder. Traditional Chinese medicine has a well-documented history of using herbal formulations for treatment of dementia-like disorders, but its therapeutic effectiveness has very little or no scientific validation. This controlled clinical trial will investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of a Chinese herbal medicine formula used in the treatment of VaD. 120 patients will be recruited to trial this formula over a four-month period.</summary>
