    <studytitle>Exercise intervention for subacromial impingement syndrome. A randomised controlled trial of two rehabilitation protocols.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Is an intervention consisting of up to 3 pain free exercises equivalent to a standard evidence based protocol in regards to pain, function and compliance for patients aged between 30 and 65 with intermittent unilateral shoulder pain and positive impingement tests.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be given individualised exercises according to a protocol that: excludes exercise in the presence of pain and excludes exercises that reduce the subacromial space.
There are 2 standard exercises- Elastic resisted adduction and extension and an optional 3rd exercise  (internal rotation against elastic resistance).  
Participants will attend a maximum of 8 physiotherapy session over 12 weeks. No manual therapy is performed at physiotherapy sessions.
The initial physiotherapy session will be for 1 hour with subsequent visits being 30 minutes. 
Exercises are performed as a home exercise programme using elastic supplied to the participant. Subjects are asked to aim to complete the exercises every 2 hrs. Exercises are started at repetitions determined by the physiotherapist with an aim of 10-15 repetitions per occasion per exercise. 
Physiotherapists are provided with the following directions regarding progression:
*	Do not progress elastic resistance
*	Add internal rotation if not prescribed at start of programme
*	Can increase repetitions up to 20-25 per exercise per occasion
*	Can increase ROM through which exercises are performed

Participants are encouraged to continue exercises after 12 weeks according to previous instructions regarding maintenance exercise.
A self reported exercise diary will be used to monitor and record compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects will be given individualised treatment according to a recommended protocol from the literature (Holmgren et al 2012).  Specifically, the protocol advocates: exercises performed within tolerable levels of pain/ discomfort that include exercises that reduce the subacromial space.
Exercises include resisted internal and external rotation, abduction, range of motion exercises and manual therapy.
Participants will attend a maximum of 8 physiotherapy session over 12 weeks. The initial physiotherapy session will be for 1 hour with subsequent visits being 30 minutes. Exercises are performed as a home exercise programme.
Manual therapy can be performed at the physiotherapist's discretion, particularly aimed at stretching the posterior glenohumeral capsule and pectoralis minor muscle.
Exercises are not allowed to provoke more than a 5/10 pain and are:
*	Repeated 15 times in 3 sets twice daily for 8 weeks. 
*	Perform posterior shoulder stretch for 30-60 seconds and repeat 3 times twice daily. 
*	From week 8 to week 12, repeat exercises once a day. 
Progress by:
*	The exercises are individually adjusted and progressed with increased external load using weights and elastic rubber bands at physiotherapist visits once every fortnight during the whole rehabilitation period.  
*	Dont increase number of exercises per day.

Following completion of the specific exercise programme (after 12 weeks), participants should maintain the daily home exercises for another 2 months. 

A self reported exercise diary will be used to monitor and record compliance.

    <concealment>The receptionist will inform patients with a referral for physiotherapy for shoulder pain, who present to the Physiotherapy Outpatient Department at Fairfield Hospital, about the study.  She will arrange a routine appointment for assessment/triage and provide an Information Sheet.  When the patient subsequently presents for assessment, the receptionist will ask the patient whether they are willing to participate.  Volunteers will be provided a Consent Form.  This process will obviate the need for the assessing physiotherapist to recruit subjects.  Those patients interested in participating will be consented by another physiotherapist, who is not involved in the provision of treatment. 
Patients who decline to participate will be assessed and treated according to the usual procedures for the Physiotherapy Department and treatment will not be withheld in any way. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Prior to the study, a researcher not involved in data collection or treatment will generate a randomisation sequence.  Labelled pieces of paper with the intervention arm will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes according to the random sequence.  The envelopes will labelled with a subject number between 1 and 20 written on the front.  Subjects will be allocated consecutively according to their entry number into the study.  The envelopes will be kept at University of Western Sydney by a researcher not involved in measurement or treatment of subjects, and will be delivered to the hospital as each block sequence is completed.  The Receptionist shall keep the envelopes in a secure location. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A blinded assessor, not been involved in the treatment of subjects and unaware of the subjects allocation, will perform data analyses. Planned Contrasts within a Repeated measures ANOVA will be employed to describe within- and between-group differences for each continuous outcome measure. Exercise compliance and medication use will be compared using Chi Square analyses, since data will be categorical. Data will be analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle to account for drop-outs (Peat, 2001).
Regarding target sample size: a figure of 80 per treatment arm is indicative. Following recruitment of the first 20 participants, an independent assessor shall determine mean and standard deviation data for analyses to determine the number of patients required to appropriately power the study for a level of 0.8 at an alpha level of 0.05, allowing for 20% drop outs. Assumptions include minimal clinically important differences of 15/100 for pain intensity and 20% for the Patient Specific Functional Scale. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise therapy has been shown to be effective in treating subacromial impingement syndrome. The purpose of this research project is to compare two different exercise treatment protocols. The first protocol has been researched and shown to be of benefit. The second protocol has a sound physiological basis and has been used by therapists for many years. This will be the first time it has been the subject of a research project. 
If proven to be effective the second protocol will simplify the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.
