    <interventions>This study is not testing the effectiveness of an intervention, but the accuracy of an assessment tool.

Manual Muscle Testing is an assessment tool used by an estimated 10 million practitioners worldwide.  In this study the anterior deltoid muscle will be tested to see if it can withstand a given force (into extension) applied by a healthcare practitioner. During one MMT, the patient's arm will be held at 90 degrees of anterior flexion for a period not exceeding 5 seconds. Each patient will undergo no more than 30 MMTs in total over the course of about 30 minutes (i.e. 1x 5-sec MMT per minute). It is expected that one data collection session will take no more than 30 minutes.

Data collection will take place over two (2) years: September 2009 to August 2011 - or when our sample size has been acheived, whichever comes first.

It has been previously reported that a patient will not be able to resist the downward force after speaking an incongruent statement, and can easily resist the force after speaking a congruent statement. In that study, as in this one, a congruent statement is defined as one which the patient believes is true, and an incongruent statement is one that the patients believes is false. 

In this study, the patient will be asked to speak statements which are true and statements which are false. In all cases, the patient will know whether the statement is true or false. However in some cases, the practitioner will be unaware if the statement spoken by the patient is true. (That is, the practitioner will be blind in some cases.)  Also, in some cases, the patient will be aware that the practitioner knows that verity of the statement, and in some cases, the patient will not know if the practitioner knows the verity of the statement. (That is, in some cases, the patient will be blind to the practitioners blindness.)</interventions>
    <comparator>The MMT results will be compared under different levels of blinding. During some MMTs, the practitioner will be blind, and during other MMTs, the practitioner will not be blind. In all cases, blinding will be randomly determined. In addition, this study is comparing the accuracy of more experienced practitioners compared to less experienced practitioners. Finally, this study will investigate if confidence impacts the accuracy of MMT.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the % of accurate tests for each level of blinding.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One entire data collection session will last no more than 30min. (See primary outcome 1 above) Data collection will take place over two (2) years: February 2010 to December 2011 - or when our sample size has been acheived, whichever comes first.
Data collection is continuing for one part of this study and will be completed by the end of 2016.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of manual muscle testing to distinguish congruent from incongruent statements in a group of healthcare practitioners. Manual muscle testing is an assessment tool commonly used by an estimated 2 million chiropractors and other health professionals worldwide. A total of 160 participants will be recruited: 80 from a population of healthcare practitioners ("Practitioners") and 80 "Testees" from the general population of healthy adults. The accuracy of muscle testing will be assessed on a single occasion under varying degrees of blindness.</summary>
