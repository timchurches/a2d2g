    <interventions>Psycho-education intervention to teach coping skills
The Coping Skills Intervention is an education program on applying problem solving skills to everyday problems, based on Problem Solving Therapy techniques. It teaches the use of the Stop Slow Down Think and Act (SSTA) approach for coping with stress. 
Topics covered include:
* Stress, kidney failure and coping
* Effective problems solving,
* The SSTA method
* Problem solving styles
* Stress and your body
* Stress and your brain, 
* Reactions to stress
* Strategies to slow down eg. distraction, mindfulness, relaxation
* The ABC approach to healthy thinking
* Problem solving step by step approach
* Review problem solving outcomes, 
* Coping skills resources
Education will take place over 6 sessions during normal dialysis treatment (ie. during nurse supervised dialysis in the home dialysis education unit), one session per week for 6 weeks.
It will be provided as a one-to-one teaching session, following a manualised program.
A Psychology Intern (Provisional Registration with AHPRA) under supervision of Psychologist, will present the program to the participant.
Participant will be given their education booklet for each of the six sessions, to work on during session and to take home to continue with home practice.
Each education session will last approximately one hour.
Each session will be video recorded for review with supervising Psychologist, to ensure consistency of content and format.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Successful transition to home dialysis and maintenance of a home based therapy is influenced not only by medical and demographic factors but also by psychosocial stressors. There is evidence from other medical conditions that coping skills influence patients psychological well-being. Our previous research has suggested that people with adaptive coping skills, such as problem solving and active coping, are more likely to sustain home haemodialysis. Based on this research, we believe that by providing home haemodialysis patients with additional adaptive coping skills they are more likely to sustain the use of a home therapy. 
A coping skills intervention program has been modified for use by people learning home haemodialysis. The program has been developed by psychologists who work with patients of a nephrology department, and is designed to be delivered by any health practitioner. It includes basic skills in stress management, problem solving, mindfulness and healthy thinking. It is designed to be able to be incorporated into the existing education provided to learners during home haemodialysis training, delivered chair-side during dialysis over six one hour sessions. 
This coping skills intervention will be compared with treatment as usual with home haemodialysis learners. The outcomes to be tested are 
a) sustainability of home dialysis after training, 
b) change in levels of reported distress, and 
c) change in reported use of adaptive coping strategies.

The intention of this intervention is to enhance the patient experience of this home based treatment and improve their quality of life.
