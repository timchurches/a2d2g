  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1 :2 doses of Zoledronic acid (0.025mg/kg/dose ,Intravenous infusion) will be administered to children more than 10 years of age at diagnosis of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia /lymphoblastic lymphoma.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the safety and feasibility of zoledronic acid to prevent joint complication (osteonecrosis) following chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma in children and adolescents. 
Who is it for? You or your child may be eligible to join this study if you/they are aged between 5 and 16 years and have been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. 
Trial details: In participants more than 10 years of age the drug zoledronic acid will be intravenously infused (i.e. administered directly into the vein) on day 8 of chemotherapy and again 6 weeks later (Group 1). Children between 5-10 years of age will not receive zoledronic acid (Group 2). Both groups will be regularly monitored by blood tests and radiological interventions for up to 2 years post treatment in order to determine the feasibility and safety of zoledronic acid and the incidence of osteonecrosis (joint complication of cancer treatment).
