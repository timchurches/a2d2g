  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adolescents, aged 14-17 years from Melbourne suburbs, will participate in a four-treatment, acute crossover trial in a laboratory setting. The four trial conditions involve: 1) uninterrupted sitting for 6h and consumption of two healthy meals (at 0h and 3h; consistent for each condition); 2) sitting for 6 hours with 2-min interruptions every 18 minutes and consumption of two healthy meals; 3) uninterrupted sitting for 6h and consumption of two unhealthy meals; and 4) sitting for 6 hours with 2-min interruptions sitting every 18 minutes and consumption of two unhealthy meals.  
Both the healthy and unhealthy meal contains the same macronutrient content (e.g. 55% carbohydrates, 30% from fat and 15% from protein). However, the healthy meal is 25% of the daily recommended energy intake (2,802kj) and follows the dietary guidelines for healthy eating (e.g. contains whole grains, lean meat, is low in sodium, high in fibre etc). Whereas the unhealthy meal contains 1.5 times more kilojoules (4,203kj) and does not follow the guidelines (e.g. low in fibre, high in sodium, refined carbohydrates etc). Participants will be asked to consume the meals within 20 minutes, and any food or drink left over will be recorded and accounted for in the analyses. 
Each condition will be performed on separate days with a rest day/washout period in between conditions. Prior to beginning, participants will be fitted with a Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system to monitor interstitial blood glucose and wear an accelerometer and inclinometer to objectively measure their sedentary and sitting time, respectively, during each condition. The interruptions during condition 2 and 4 will involve two minutes of simple exercises such as body squats, calf raises, gluteal contractions, and step-ups. During all four conditions, all participants will be supervised by research staff to ensure compliance to the protocol.

    <statisticalmethods>As this is an exploratory pilot study, a sample of 10 participants will be recruited. A previous repeated-measures study that took place in an office environment included 10 adult participants and were able to compare the associations between blood glucose responses to sitting and standing using accelerometry. The area under the curve (AUC) will be calculated for the cumulative measurement of glucose against sitting time post 3 hours of the main test meals. Prism or graph pad will be used to plot the AUC in blood glucose units (x axis) against the minutes spent sitting (y axis) using regression analyses. Generalised estimating equations with repeated measures will be used to evaluate the different effects sitting and interrupted sitting has on glucose post 3-hours after the main meals. All models will adjust for the covariates such as age, BMI, waist cicumference and pubertal status.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how different foods can affect blood glucose responses when a young person sits for a long period of time and when that sitting is interrupted with light exercise breaks. We hypothesise that the glucose responses will be minimised when healthier foods are eaten and when the sitting is interrupted by light exercise breaks. </summary>
