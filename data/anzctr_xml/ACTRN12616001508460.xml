  <interventions>
    <interventions>Name of intervention: anti-platelet medication.

Arm 1: aspirin alone. Oral administration of 300 mg aspirin (loading dose) on day 1, oral administration of 100 mg aspirin (100 mg once daily, maintenance dose) on days 2 to 7. Total duration is 7 days.

Arm 2: Aspirin and ticagrelor. Oral administration of aspirin, as described in arm 1. Oral administration of 180 mg ticagrelor (loading dose) on day 1, oral administration of 180 mg ticagrelor (90 mg bi-daily, maintenance dose) on days 2 to 7. Total duration is 7 days.

Washout period: 20 days.

Empty drug container to be returned following each anti-platelet drug regimen to ensure adherence to each intervention. 

Participants will not be exposed to infectious agents as a part of this trial. Blood will be drawn before and after each anti-platelet drug regimen. Platelets will be isolated from this blood sample and incubated with synthetic infectious agents ex vivo. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Platelet activation in response to infectious agents is the primary outcome of this study. 

This is a basic science study and involves in vitro testing of blood samples. The methodology for assessing platelet activation is outlined below.

Platelets will be isolated from whole blood and incubated with 2 TLR agonists (synthetic infectious agents) at various concentrations. These concentrations will produce approximately 50%, 20% and 10% platelet activation at the baseline (before anti-platelet regimen) blood test. Platelet activation following anti-platelet treatment will be assessed against this baseline for each volunteer to determine the extent to which platelet activation is reduced following treatment. In this way, each volunteer acts as their own control for each drug regimen. 

Platelet activation will be assessed by flow cytometry. Following incubation with TLR agonists (synthetic infectious agents), platelets will be incubated with anti-CD62p and anti-PAC1 antibodies. This will allow detection of CD62p+ and PAC1+ platelets by flow cytometry, which indicates an activated platelet. Platelet activation will be reported as the percentage of the whole platelet population that is expressing CD62p or PAC1,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (day 1) + immediately following each anti-platelet medication regime (day 8)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid and ADP.

Platelet aggregation will be measured in vitro from blood samples using the Multiplate analyzer. This analyzer uses multiple electrode aggregometry, whereby a blood sample will be incubated with arachidonic acid and ADP in a test cell. Platelets will become activated in response to these agonists and will aggregate on 2 electrodes within the test cell. The extent to which platelet aggregation impedes the electrical current that passes across these 2 electrodes is recorded and reported.

Incubation of whole blood with arachidonic acid will test whether platelets were inhibited in response to aspirin. Incubation with ADP will test whether platelets were inhibited in response to ticagrelor. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are inviting healthy individuals to take part in a study that is investigating how platelet activation in response to infection is reduced following administration of anti-platelet therapy. Platelets are blood clotting cells that usually act to repair damage to blood vessels. However, these cells also cause blood clots in the arteries of the heart and this can cause a heart attack. Platelets participate in a heart attack by becoming activated. People with heart attacks are treated with anti-platelet drugs that prevent platelet activation and reduce the risk of having another heart attack. We have previously shown that platelets can become activated in response to infection. However, it is unclear to what extent treatment with anti-platelet medication can inhibit platelet activation in response to infection. 

We aim to investigate how platelet activation in response to infection is reduced with anti-platelet medication. 

Once recruited, each healthy volunteer will be asked to take 2 courses of anti-platelet medication, each one for 7 days. There will be a 'before' and 'after' blood test for each of these courses (totalling 4 blood tests). Each volunteer will participate in thus study for a total of 5 weeks. 

If we determine, from this study, that platelet activation is reduced only slightly by anti-platelet medication, patients that have a heart attack and also experience an infection could have high platelet activation, despite being optimally treated. They may experience a recurrent heart attack as a result. This study will, therefore, determine whether there is a gap in the treatment of this group of patients and whether treatment for these patients needs to be revised.
