  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The method most commonly used to gain entry to the abdomen in laparoscopic surgery (minimally
      invasive surgery) amongst gynecologists is the Veress Needle. This needle is inserted,
      usually near the belly button, before adding gas to the abdomen. With a pressurised abdomen a
      sharp trocar is then inserted to hold the operating telescope.

      The XCEL bladeless trocar is another method of inserting the operating telescope whereby you
      don't need to first introduce gas before the trocar. This trocar is widely used in
      laparoscopic surgery but it is uncommon to the field of gynecology.

      This study will compare the two methods with regard to:

        1. Time taken to enter the abdomen

        2. The number of attempts taken to enter the abdomen

        3. The impact of the time taken to enter compared to the whole operating time

        4. The happiness that the surgeon has entered the abdomen before adding gas, on a scale of
           1 to 5.

      Patients will be recruited into the trial through the Monash Medical Centre Gynecology
      department and the Mercy Hospital for Women Gynecology department. Patients that are having
      laparoscopic surgery and would usually have a Veress Needle entry are suitable for this
      trial. A patient information sheet will be provided and written consent will then be
      obtained. Patients who give written consent will be randomised into one of two arms of the
      trial, either the control (Veress Needle) or the XCEL bladeless trocar arm.

      Information will be entered on a proforma by a researcher for each patient during their
      operation. All patient information will be strictly confidential and only be available to
      researchers directly involved in the study.

      Surgeons operating as part of the project are the consultants and fellow of the gynecology
      department of Monash Medical Centre and Mercy Hospital for Women and are competent in both
      techniques.

      200 women will be recruited over a one year period and the data will then be analysed with
      the help of a statistician.</summary>
