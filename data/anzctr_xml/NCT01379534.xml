  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate - The 18-week PFS was defined as the percentage of participants who did not have a progression event at week 18. Participants who progressed, died, had response assessment of unknown (UNK) or discontinued before 18 weeks of observation without progression were counted as "failure". Progressive disease was assessed as per investigator assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate (ORR) - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and every 6 weeks until disease progression, up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate (DCR) - DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and every 6 weeks until disease progression, up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DR) - Duration of response was defined for participants with a CR or PR as the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented progression or death due to disease. If a participants did not have a progression event, duration of response was censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment before the data analysis cut-off date or the antineoplastic therapy start date or the death date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time from date of treatment to the date of death from any cause. If a participant was not known to have died at the date of analysis cut-off, the OS was censored at the last date of contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a participant did not have an event, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate response assessment before the data analysis cut-off date or the start date of new antineoplastic therapy after study drug discontinuation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Deaths - Adverse event monitoring was conducted throughout the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, up to 18 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
