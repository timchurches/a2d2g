  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects =18 years of age undergoing craniotomy/craniectomy for pathological processes
             in the supratentorial region or posterior fossa

             study and provide written informed consent.

          -  Surgical wound classification Class I

          -  The cuff of native dura along the craniotomy edge on each side is adequate, based on
             surgeon's judgment, to facilitate suturing and to allow for sufficient surface area
             for adherence of the investigational product

          -  Presence of intra-operative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage following primary dural
             closure or after Valsalva maneuver</inclusivecriteria>

             CSF leakage.

          -  Chemotherapy within 30-days prior to enrollment or scheduled within 7-days following
             surgery

          -  Radiation therapy to the head within 30-days prior to enrollment or scheduled within
             7-days following surgery

             of infection, fever, positive urine culture, positive blood culture, positive chest
             X-ray.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test or intent to

             system or autoimmune disease who can NOT receive hydrogel sealant.

          -  Subjects with penetratring traumatic injuries to the head with damage to the dura

          -  Dural injury during craniotomy/craniectomy that cannot be eliminated by widening the

             closure.

          -  Approaches that would not allow sutured dural closure such as trans-sphenoidal or
             trans-labirinthine-/petrosal/-mastoid. Superficial penetration of mastoid air cells
             are allowed.

          -  Use of implants made of synthetic materials coming into direct contact with dura

          -  Use of other fibrin sealants or PEG-based sealants on the dural closure. Approved
             fibrin sealants may be used for hemostasis if not in contact with the dura.

          -  Hydrocephalus, except occlusive hydrocephalus caused by posterior fossa pathology or
             incompletely open cerebrospinal fluid pathways, to be treated during surgical
             procedure.

             cannulation and ventriculo-peritoneal shunting.

          -  Subjects with any other intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may
             preclude the conduct of the study procedure.

          -  Confined bony structures where nerves are present where neural compression may result
             due to swelling.</exclusivecriteria>
