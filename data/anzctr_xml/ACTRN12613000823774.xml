  <interventions>
    <interventions>The HeadStrong program comprises of a booklet, a slideshow and various appendices freely downloadable from the HeadStrong website. The program consists of 5 modules designed to teach students about the nature of depression and bipolar disorder, and how to (a) recognise the symptoms of these illnesses, (b) help friends and relatives who exhibit symptoms, (c) help themselves if they should experience symptoms, (d) increase their levels of resilience, (e) raise community awareness about mood disorders, and (f) break down stigma surrounding mood disorders. 

The program will be delivered in class alongside classroom activities over a period of 5-8 weeks within Term 1 (approximately 10 hours in total). Note that there is no online component to the delivery of the program, the materials are simply available freely and downloadable online.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The HeadStrong program is a mood disorders prevention program delivered to Years 9 and 10 secondary school students in NSW. The program is delivered by teachers within Personal Development, Health, and Physical Education (PDHPE) classes. Schools will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition with measures being administered at baseline, immediately post program completion and 6 months follow up. The goal is to determine whether the HeadStrong program causes lasting improvements in students knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and symptoms, with regard to mental health, well being, and help-seeking. </summary>
