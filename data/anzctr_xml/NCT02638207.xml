    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - NewGam

Experimental: 0.5 g/kg NewGam - All patients will receive a loading dose of 2.0 g/kg Newgam (administered over two consecutive days), followed by seven infusions of the maintenance dose the patient has been randomized to (0.5g/kg NewGam), also administered over two consecutive days every 3 weeks (±4 days).

Experimental: 1.0 g/kg NewGam - All patients will receive a loading dose of 2.0 g/kg Newgam (administered over two consecutive days), followed by seven infusions of the maintenance dose the patient has been randomized to (1.0g/kg NewGam), also administered over two consecutive days every 3 weeks (±4 days).

Experimental: 2.0 g/kg NewGam - All patients will receive a loading dose of 2.0 g/kg Newgam (administered over two consecutive days), followed by seven infusions of the maintenance dose the patient has been randomized to (2.0g/kg NewGam), also administered over two consecutive days every 3 weeks (±4 days).


Treatment: drugs: NewGam
In the Dose-evaluation Phase, all patients will receive a loading dose of 2.0 g/kg Newgam (administered over two consecutive days), followed by seven infusions of the maintenance dose the patient has been randomized to (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg NewGam), also administered over two consecutive days every 3 weeks (±4 days). If a patient is randomized to receive the low or medium NewGam dose, the same volume with the same infusion rate as would have been applied in case the patient would have been randomized to 2.0 g/kg NewGam will be used, thus supplemented with an authorized 0.9% w/v isotonic sodium chloride solution as appropriate and detailed in the following infusion bag split to maintain the blinding
