    <concealment>At session 1 (-6 weeks) all eligible participants will complete a beep test session which will be used to match subjects according to their DOMS response and anthropometric data (height, weight, body mass index, activity and training history). This will enable matching of participants before randomisation to minimise inter-individual variability.  Participants will then be randomly assigned active or placebo medication by a computerised random number generator and matched up by an independent party to allow double blinding.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) and muscle damage are common and expected self-limiting sports training related conditions that can result in a loss of muscle force and significant pain.  For athletes required to train and compete in close succession, DOMS can pose an obstacle to optimal performance.  At present there are multiple methods for treating DOMS.  Methods include; cryotherapy, anti-inflammatory medications, stretching, hypo-baric oxygen therapy, homeopathy, ultrasound, E-stimulation, L-carnitine, rest and light exercise.  To date, a sound and consistent treatment for DOMS has not been established.

High-quality scientific research into Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) and DOMS is limited despite the increase usage of such products by athletes.  This is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial that looks at four selected CAMs in four sub-studies and their effect on DOMS and muscle damage in sub-elite athletes.</summary>
