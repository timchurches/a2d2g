    <interventions>Alternative model of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) : 
Redesign of internal and external referal processes to hospital and community secondary prevention services.
Changes to Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) Cardiac rehabilitation program delivery .  One key aspect is the development and implementation of a new patient needs assessment tool (in consultation with ward staff and internal and external cardiac rehab staff). The tool will be used in the ACCESS group before discharge, taking approximately 10 minutes to complete. The tool helps to assess patient learning needs and forms an individualised CR plan. Participatory action research will be utilised as changes to the needs assessment tool and its implementation process are identified. Routine follow up of all Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients at 3 months will also be implementedto ACCESS patients. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ACS patients discharged from RPH from 1st April 2011- 31st March 2012 will be compared to those discharged 1st April 2013- 31st March 2014 . The study will compare 2 models of cardiac rehabilitation: traditional cardiac rehabilitation vs a new alternative model implemented in April 2013. The proportion that access cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention programs plus cost effectiveness will be compared. Cardiac rehabilitation is defined as having an initial assessment and individualised plan within 2 weeks , education, and follow up at 3 months. Between April 2012 - March 2013 changes to referral processes and RPH cardiac rehabilitation program delivery were implemented using information sought from staff and patient surveys and focus groups. The study will compare readmssion rates and mortality of both ACS cohorts at 12 months after discharge. </summary>
