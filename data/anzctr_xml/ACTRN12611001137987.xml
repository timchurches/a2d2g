  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is not known when in the course of incurable cancer referral to a specialist palliative care service should optimally be made.
It is hypothesised that early contact with palliative care services will improve patients' end of life experiences through better symptom control and quality of life; addressing patients' supportive care needs; reducing lines of chemotherapy, and reducing the likelihood of dying in the acute hospital setting.</summary>
