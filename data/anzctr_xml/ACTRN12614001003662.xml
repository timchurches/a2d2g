    <statisticalmethods>Hypothesis A will be tested using analysis of covariance.  A model will be fitted with sputum eosinophils at 52 weeks as the outcome of interest.  The predictor variable of interest in the analysis of variance model will be treatment group (Prevenar13 or Pneumovax 23) with baseline level of sputum eosinophils included as a covariate.  
Hypothesis B, health status and asthma symptom scores, will also be analysed using analysis of covariance with baseline level included as a covariate. 
Baseline characteristics, change scores and end of treatment results will be summarised by treatment group. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using Students t test for parametric data and Wilcoxon ranksum tests for nonparametric data. Categorical data will be compared using the Chi square or Fishers exact test as appropriate.
Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using 2-sided tests with p values &lt;0.05 considered statistically significant.  The analysis will be repeated on the per protocol population.

Number of study participants for the study:
Alpha: 0.05; Power: 80%; Sample size required is 49 per group, as described below and allowing for dropouts. 
 
ACQ: a clinically important difference is 0.5 units. In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 0.83.  If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 0.5, we will need 44 experimental and 44 control subjects. 
 
FEV1%predicted: In a prior study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 20.8.  If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 15.5, we will need to study 29 experimental subjects and 29 control subjects.
 
Sputum eosinophils: In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation of 16.28%. If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 10%, we will need to study 43 experimental subjects and 43 control subjects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma is a high impact, chronic inflammatory airway disease where modulation holds the promise of long term clinical benefits. Different types of cells have been involved in asthma such as eosinophils, neutrophils and a mixture of both eosinophils and neutrophils. The main purpose of this study is to see if treatment with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar 13) will help people with eosinophilic asthma. It is hypothesised that Prevenar 13 will attenuate eosinophilic airway inflammation and improve health status.</summary>
