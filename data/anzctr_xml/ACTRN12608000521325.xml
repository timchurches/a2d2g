  <interventions>
    <interventions>Autologous AdE1-Latent Membrane Protein (LMP) Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes.  Dose, duration and mode of administration: total dose 20-800 million CTL  given in 4 equal doses (each dose 5-200 million CTL) intravenously, at weekly intervals for the first cohort of 10 patients, and twice a week  for the second cohort of ten patients.</interventions>

    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Other</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility (generation of autologous clinical grade AdE1-LMP-specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) from the blood of EBV-positive lymphoma patients)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The investigational product for each study participant will be assessed post production. Overall assessment when all study participants have received at least 1 treatment.  The patient will have blood samples taken prior to and following each of infusion, and then at one, three, six and 12 months following the final infusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be assessed by adverse event monitoring.  Patients will be questioned  and toxicities recorded according to the International Common Toxicity Criteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 hour post 4 AdE1-LMP CTL injections (injections are weekly for first 10 participants &amp; twice weekly for the next 10 participants), 3-5 weeks post the 4th injection, then 3, 6 and 12 months post the 4th injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reconstitution of EBV-specific CTL immunity with anti-viral efficacy as a result of infusion of the investigational product.  This will be measured by immunological and virological assessment of blood samples. Assays include immunophenotyping (using Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I peptide-specific tetramers), intracellular cytokine assays, CD107 cytotoxicity assays, and Epstein-Barr Virus deoxyribonucleic acid (EBV DNA) load analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, pre and 1 hour post 4 AdE1-LMP CTL injections, 3-5 weeks post the 4th injection, then 3, 6 and 12 months post the 4th injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of the optimal dose intensity of the intervention.  Optimal dose intensity will be assessed by comparing the clinical efficacy (as assessed by radiological assessment by Computerized Tomography), biological efficacy (as assessed by reconstitution of EBV-specific CTL immunity and anti-viral efficacy), safety and efficacy of the first schedule (4x weekly infusions) versus the second schedule (2x twice weekly infusions).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical evaluation, adverse event monitoring and collection of blood samples for specialised tests will occur at baseline, pre and 1 hour post 4 AdE1-LMP CTL injections, 3-5 weeks post the 4th injection, then 3, 6 and 12 months post the 4th injection.  Radiologic examination will occur at baseline and at 3 to 5 weeks and 3 months post the fourt treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical efficacy will be assessed by radiological assessement (as measured by Computerized Tomography) and clinical evaluation (history and physical examination).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Computerised Axial Tomography scan and additional scans at the physicican's discretion at baseline , 3-5 weeks post the 4th injection and 3 months post the 4th injection.  Clinical evaluation at baseline, pre and 1 hour post 4 AdE1-LMP CTL injections, 3-5 weeks post the 4th injection, then 3, 6 and 12 months post the 4th injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will use a new method of treating lymphoma using a therapy derived from a persons Killer T cells. These Killer T cells are taken from a person's blood and grown in a test tube to increase the number of these cells that are specifically active against the lymphoma cells. The cells are then given to the patient by intravenous infusion with the aim of killing the lymphoma cells. Potentially this treatment will help to kill the residual/recurrent tumour that is present after other lymphoma treatment and reduce the chance of the tumour recurring.</summary>
