  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial will test the effect of a professional development intervention (the Adolescent Motivation in Physical Education intervention), targeting PE teachers. The intervention is based on the self-determination theory and is designed to increase students opportunities to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during PE lessons and to enhance their motivation to not only be physically active during PE lessons, but also during their leisure-time.
Over the main intervention period of 6 months, teachers will participate in 2 days of face-to-face workshops and complete two implementation tasks, involving self-reflection and feedback from a mentor. During the next 8 month follow-up period teachers will complete a half-day face-to-face workshop and complete an implementation task. Throughout the entire intervention period (main intervention plus follow-up period), teachers will also have access to online resources, including videos of best/poor practice and a discussion forum. 
The face-to-face workshops will include presentations by members of the research team, videos of best/poor practice examples, self-reflection, group discussion, and opportunities for teachers to implement taught principles in simulated scenarios. The first workshop will be given at the very beginning of the main intervention period. The second workshop will occur 3 months after the first workshop. A final half day workshop will be provided in the follow-up period, 5 months after the end of the intervention.
From the beginning of the intervention to the end of the study, teachers in the intervention condition will have access to the projects interactive website. The site will guide teachers through a series of three implementation tasks. The first task will require teachers to set an action plan (i.e., goals) for implementation of strategies from the face-to-face training workshop into their lessons during the month following Workshop 1. During this period a video of a PE lesson taught by each teacher will be recorded and uploaded to the project website.  Project staff will use an online coding system designed to identify specific instances of implementation attempts related to the action plan of principles taught during the face-to-face workshop. These instances will be condensed into a short video clip that will be uploaded to the project website. Teachers will use these clips to self-reflect on implementation. 
Following self-reflection, each teacher will meet with one of three senior mentor teachers employed by the project. Each mentor meeting will last 30-45 minutes. These mentors will have at least 5 years of experience teaching PE and will have completed training designed to ensure in-depth understanding of intervention principles. The mentor teacher will have reviewed the video recording of the lesson and will facilitate a feedback conversation based on his/her viewing and knowledge of the teachers self-reflection. This conversation is the final step in the first implementation task. Mentors will then help teachers to set a new action plan. These actions plans will be implemented over the remainder of the term and will be reviewed at the start of Workshop 2 (beginning Term 3 2013). Implementation Task 2 will follow Workshop 2, with similar procedures followed (i.e., self-reflection, mentor meeting and new action plan). 
In addition to facilitating teachers implementation tasks, the project website will provide teachers with resources designed to facilitate successful implantation of principles from the face-to-face workshops. The site will utilise a Web 2.0 platform that will allow for dynamic interaction between the teachers and the research team.
Adherence to the program will be assessed by recording and analysing: attendance at workshops; use of the online resources (e.g. number and duration of log-ons); completion of self-reflection tasks; attendance at mentorship meetings; and video recordings of the teachers PE lessons to identify the use of strategies that are encouraged in the intervention.</interventions>

    <concealment>This trial is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Principals and PE department heads from all 64 secondary schools that meet our eligibility criteria will be invited to express their interest in participating in this study. If more than 14 schools indicate an interest, we will purposely sample schools in order to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, in terms of school size and gender composition (i.e., single sex or co-educational). Schools that agree to participate will be match paired according to socio-economic status of the post code in which the school is located, school size (Year 8 enrolment), gender composition of Physical Education classes (i.e., single sex vs co-ed) and the duration of physical education lessons. Using a computer-based randomization plan generator, 14 schools will be randomized from within each pair following baseline assessments. Randomization will be carried out by a researcher not associated with the project. Students will be blinded to hypotheses and school allocation. Teachers will be aware of their allocation to intervention or control condition. 
All PE teachers in schools that enter into the trial will be invited to an information session during which study procedures will be outlined and questions answered.
Once Principal and Physical Education teachers have provided consent, student assent and parent consent will be sought by written invitation handed out to students in class. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations have been based on estimated effect sizes for the primary outcome. A recent meta-analysis indicated that Physical Education lesson planning and delivery interventions have shown a pooled effect of d = 0.60 on moderate to vigorous physical activity during Physical Education lessons. To ensure 80% power to detect an effect of this size would require 90 participants in a non-clustered trial (two-tailed probability level of 0.05). We considered the clustered nature of the data, including both school and class levels. However, results from a pilot study we conducted and a recent study of moderate to vigorous physical activity in Physical Education lessons indicated that clustering at the school level was negligible after accounting from clustering at the class level. As a result, we adjusted our sample size calculations for clustering using the formula 1+(m-1)ICC, where m is the number of students per class and ICC is the intra-class correlation.
A recent study that we conducted in schools from the Sydney area indicated a class level ICC of .55, whilst another recent and similar study reported a class level ICC of .63. We adopted a conservative approach, and adjusted based on the larger value. With an estimated class size of 22 participating students, an adjustment of 14.23 was required: 1+(22-1)0.63 = 14.23. Multiplying by the 90 participants required in a non-clustered trial, we estimated that 1280 students would need to participate to achieve 80% power. We estimated that 14 schools, with a mean of 4.5 classes of Year 8 students per school could be recruited in the specified time frame, and therefore aim to recruit 1386 students (14 schools x 4.5 classes per school x 22 students per class). Potential loss to follow up of up to 30% of participants (n=384; a very conservative estimate) would not substantially impact on the statistical power of the study. This is because this study will use generalized mixed models to estimate intervention effects with no and with multiple imputations, enabling the inclusion of all participants (included at baseline) in the analyses. The first type of analytical approach has been shown to lead to a decrease in power of ~3.5% following the loss of 30% of cases/data in non-clustered longitudinal clinical trials. The second approach generally leads to similar estimates, but may sometimes slightly increase power.

Between condition differences in changes on the primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed according to intention to treat and per-protocol principles. Specifically, intention to treat analyses will involve analysis of outcomes collected from all students who completed baseline assessment, regardless of whether or not they complete follow-up 1 or 2 assessments. 
Generalized linear mixed models, adjusting for class clustering, will be employed. Possible school-level residual clustering will be explored and included in the models, if appropriate. The effects of temperature at the start of each lesson and lesson activity type (categorical variable; e.g., invasion games vs striking and fielding games vs fitness activities) will be also be explored by adjusting for these variables in the models. 
Generalized linear mixed models will be also used to examine mediation hypotheses. Mediating effects will be estimated using a cluster-bootstrapped based product-of-coefficients test that is appropriate for cluster randomized controlled trials. 
Potential moderators of the intervention effects will also be explored. Potential moderators will include gender, ethnicity, and weight status (categorical variables), as well as socio-economic status and baseline levels of physical activity and psychosocial variables (e.g., motivation and needs satisfaction) which will be treated as continuous variables. Moderator effects will be explored using the same generalized mixed modeling approach by including appropriate interaction terms in the regression models. Significant interaction terms will be explored by testing differences in intervention effects across sub-groups stratified according to the moderator variable. 
Per protocol analyses will investigate the influence of teachers adoption of the intervention, as indicated by the proportion of intervention components completed by each teacher, on student outcomes. These analyses will also examine the effect of teachers implementation of the intervention, as indicated by increases in their use of suggested strategies from baseline to follow-up (observed in video recordings of their lessons), on student outcomes. As with the aforementioned moderator analyses, the effect of teacher adoption and implementation on student outcomes will be explored using interaction terms, with follow-up stratified sub-group analyses, where appropriate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Funded by the Australian Research Council, this study will test the effect of a professional development program targeting physical education teachers that is designed to increase students opportunities for physical activity during physical education lessons and to enhance their motivation towards physical activity. 
This research is important because many Australian youth do not participate in sufficient physical activity and there is a large decline in physical activity associated with adolescence. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop strategies to engage adolescents in physical activity. If adolescent physical activity levels can be increased, a variety of benefits are expected, including engagement during academic classes, greater self-concept, and better overall well-being.
