    <interventions>Heart Failure Dyspnoea Action Plan including strategies for symptom management and when to contact health professionals will be provided to participants at baseline and reinforced at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months. Participants will be instructed to use oxygen administered via nasal cannulae at 2-3 Litres per minute (approximately 28% oxygen) overnight while sleeping (approximated at 6-8 hours) and when short of breath over a period of 6 months. Symptom management instructions will be given in written and verbal form at baseline and each of the outcome assessment points at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.</interventions>

Heart Failure Dyspnoea Action Plan including strategies for symptom management and when to contact health professionals will be provided to participants in Control 1 and Control 2. Participants in Control 2 will be instructed to use air (21% oxygen) administered via nasal cannulae at 2L overnight and when short of breath over a period of 6 months. Symptom management instructions will be given in written and verbal form at baseline and each of the outcome assessment points at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months in Control 1 and Control 2 arms</comparator>

      <outcome>Costs including direct and indirect healthcare costs.
Costs related to service delivery will be calculated during the study and expressed as the cost/patient/month of follow-up. The cost of applying the intervention will include: (i) infrastructure costs for the intervention; (ii) community-based costs based on 2007/2008 Medicare schedules, diagnostic tests and costs related to hospitalisation and community based care (iii) gas (oxygen and air) medication usage according to 2007/2008 Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule and (iv) costs incurred directly by the patient and their family eg unsubsidised help and in a subset of intervention and control group in-depth interview and questionnaire of carers to obtain direct and indirect costs.
The incremental costs per QALY gained
as well as other natural outcomes will be calculated. The scoring algorithms for the EQ-5D and the SF-12 will be used to convert patient scores into utility weights to calculate QALYs.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation, particularly among the elderly. Breathlessness is a common reason for patients presenting to hospital. Although the use of oxygen in acute HF with hypoxaemia is well established, there is no evidence to support or refute the use of oxygen in chronic HF. The OXYGEN-HF Study seeks to test the hypothesis that oxygen administered in conjunction with a dyspnoea action plan will decrease rates of hospitalisation compared with air and a dyspnoea action plan and a dyspnoea action plan alone in patients with New York Heart Association Class III-IV heart failure.</summary>
