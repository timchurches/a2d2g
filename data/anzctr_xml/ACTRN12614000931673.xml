  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomised into two groups:
1. the reflective blanket group will receive a reflective blanket (MEDIflex, desposable emergency blanket, 140x210cm) close to the skin and one cotton sheet on top to contain the light weight reflective blanket.
2. patients allocated to the cotton will receive a cotton sheet to the skin and a cotton blanket on top of the sheet.

In both groups the blankets will be tucked around the patient, leaving only the head and at times their arms exposed, for the preoperative period from admission to the anaesthetic bay until discharge from the Post- anaesthesia recovery unit (PARU).</interventions>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The lead researcher will prepare sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes, enclose the particular intervention sheet for group 1 or 2 to the assigned corresponding number as per randomisation schedule and seal the envelops. The admitting nurse will assign the envelopes in numerical sequence to the patients as they consent to partake in the study. The nurse will be unaware towards the intervention concealed in the envelope to prevent selection bias. The envelope will only be opened by the perioperative nurse preparing the patient for surgery.

The project manager will review the operation schedule the day prior and identify subjects who meet the inclusion criteria for the study. To confirm ASA patient medical records will be consulted.

A list with names of the eligible patients will be generated for the admission nurse for recruitment. 

</concealment>
    <sequence>A biostatistician, with no clinical involvement in the trial, will create a computer generated randomization sequence using a Microsoft Excel spread sheet random number generator. Space blankets are allocated numbers between 0 – 0.5 and cotton blanket above 0.5 – 1. Consecutive number from 1 - 328 will be assigned to each intervention.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation for the study is based on an expected treatment effect of 0.50C on post-intervention preoperative peripheral foot temperature. We assumed a type 1 error (alpha) of 0.05 for a two tailed test and a correlation coefficient of 0.8 for temperature measures taken within each individual. A sample size of 274 patients, divided into two groups, is estimated to provide 90% power. An extra 54 patients will be recruited to the study to allow for a 20% buffer for withdrawals of patients who become ineligible due to extended surgery times or for incomplete data collection. The data will be grouped in pre-, intra- and post-operative and if data in either of these sections is incomplete others can still be analyzed.  The total sample size will be 328 patients. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia (IPH) is a common problem for patients undergoing surgery. Heat redistribution from the bodys core to the periphery after induction of anaesthesia is the major contributor to heat loss. 
Both cotton and reflective blankets are currently in routine use in operating theatres for perioperative warming of patients undergoing short procedures.  
This study aims to determine if thermal insulation with reflective blankets is more effective than cotton blankets in reducing the temperature gradient from the bodys periphery to the core during the preoperative phase in adult patients undergoing short surgery and thus in reducing the intraoperative drop in core temperature.
