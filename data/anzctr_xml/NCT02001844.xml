Treatment: devices - placebo foot orthoses (FOs)

Placebo Comparator: Control - The control FOs, or placebo FOs was supplied to patients who were randomly included in the control group. The control FOs was made of leather board (1mm), grey Poron (1mm), and black EVA (0.75mm) as covering. This thin inner sole did not have any sort of biomechanical support, nor had it any effect on the distribution of pressure, as it was completely flat. In addition, the placebo FOs did not present with any intrinsic or extrinsic correction underneath the sub-talar-joint (STJ).
The use of black EVA as the covering material and the leather-board as a base, allowed for gathering of a dynamic impression over the 6 months of the trial.

Experimental: Trial Group - Trial Group:
children who were randomly introduced into this group received the pre-formed semi-rigid FOs. The FOs were used as an off the-shelf device and subsequently customised with chair side modifications. In order to reproduce the exact same aesthetical appearance as the control FOs, grey poron (1mm) and black EVA (0.75mm) was used as well to cover the trial FOs.
Furthermore, depending on the type of correction applied to the trial patient, the black EVA also allowed the correction applied on the surface of the device to be masked.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Modern modular foot-orthoses systems allow an integration of the cost and efficiency benefits
      afforded by the use of pre-formed semi-rigid FOs components, while simultaneously allowing a
      high degree of individualisation of prescription. Such systems, while popular, still remain
      unproven. Recent studies in paediatric rheumatology have made a contribution in developing
      guidelines with regards to pharmacological intervention in arthritic children. In addition,
      specific drug therapy protocols have been published to effectively help general
      practitioners, physiotherapists and ophthalmologists to successfully treat children with JIA
      patients (BSPAR 2006; Hull 2001; NICE guidelines 2002). A Cochrane systematic review on
      treatment of pes planus, highlighted that children with JIA were excluded as a group from
      most of the studies (Ashford et al. 2005). At present little evidence exists for the
      podiatric management of children affected by this disabling pathology, especially for
      orthotic management. This research has provided evidence to support the use of readily
      available off-the-shelf FOs in treating JIA children.</summary>
