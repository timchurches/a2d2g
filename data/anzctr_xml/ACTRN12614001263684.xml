    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolling: Parents of babies who are likely to become eligible (maternal diabetes, likely late preterm birth, or anticipated high or low birthweight) will be identified through lead maternity carers and antenatal clinics and provided with an information sheet as early as is feasible. Written informed consent will normally be obtained before birth by the lead maternity carer or a member of the clinical team. 

Treatment allocation: Allocation to intervention will be by central randomisation by computer, which will prescribe the treatment pack number to be used and volume of gel to be given. The intervention and placebo gels look identical and are packaged identically.</concealment>
    <sequence>Within each hospital and stratum babies will be randomized to placebo or dextrose within fixed block sizes using the Plan procedures of SAS (v9.4 SAS Institute Inc). Seeds for the pseudorandom number generator were chosen from successive random numbers in ETON Statistical and Math Tables (4th Ed. Eton Press Ltd).

    <statisticalmethods>Power and Sample Size
Based on data from Auckland City Hospital and Waikato Hospital, 10% of at-risk babies will require admission to NICU. A trial of 2,129 babies (1,014 in each arm, with continuity correction and allowing for 5% drop-out rate), will have 90% power to detect a 40% relative reduction (absolute reduction of 4%) in admission to NICU from 10% to 6% with two-sided alpha of 0.05. 

Minimum Important Difference
Apart from any cost implications, any reduction in NICU admission would be an important benefit to both patients and clinicians. NICU admission involves separation of mother and baby at a crucial stage in their relationship 28, potentially disrupts the establishment of breast-feeding and involves painful procedures. Moreover, NICU cots are often in short supply due to the increasing incidence of risk factors for admission, such as preterm births and maternal diabetes. Any intervention that reduced NICU admission would be welcomed by clinicians as this will make it less likely that critically unwell babies will need to be transferred to a NICU in another city that has cots available. 
Should this study show that dextrose gel is effective at preventing NICU admission, it will also be critical to find out if this improves long-term outcomes for babies. Our own preliminary data in 138 2-year-old Waikato children born at risk of hypoglycaemia show that 40% have evidence of developmental delay. A sample size of 2028 babies would allow us to detect a reduction in the number of children with one or more low developmental scores (more than 1SD below the mean) on Bayley Scales of Infant Development Edition III assessment at 2 years of age from 40% to 33%. Thus, if this trial is successful, we will have adequate power to investigate further these long-term outcomes in the future.

Analyses
The primary outcome of NICU admission will be analysed by logistic regression, stratifying by collaborating centre.  Secondary analyses will adjust for potentially confounding variables:  reason for risk of hypoglycaemia (infant of diabetic, late preterm, small, large, and other), sex, gestational age, and mode of birth (vaginal vs caesarean section).  Continuous data will be compared by Students t test, or the Mann-Whitney U test if the data are not normally distributed and cannot be converted to near-normality by simple transformation.  Data with repeated points, such as blood glucose concentrations, will be compared using mixed model techniques, modelling the main effect of treatment group allocation, time and their interaction, with significant main effects and interactions tested using the method of Tukey.  All tests will be two-tailed, with P&lt;0.05 considered significant.  The data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and any baby who dies or for whom admission to NICU is unable to be verified (e.g. through maternal withdrawal of consent for ascertainment of NICU admission status) will be assigned the worst case outcome of NICU admission.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypoglycaemia is the commonest metabolic condition of the newborn. It affects up to 15% of babies, and the incidence is increasing as risk factors such as maternal diabetes and preterm birth are becoming more common. Neonatal hypoglycaemia frequently leads to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and may cause long-term brain damage. There currently are no evidence-based strategies to prevent hypoglycaemia and its adverse consequences.

The purpose of this trial is to determine whether prophylactic dextrose gel prevents admission to NICU.
