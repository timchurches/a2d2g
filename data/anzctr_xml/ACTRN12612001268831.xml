  <interventions>
    <interventions>during icsi cycle, after controlled ovarian stimulation oocytes will be picked up and icsi will be performed.Controlled ovarian stimulation will be performed as long analog protocol in which lucrin as gonadotrophin analog will be used In this protocol, participants will take lucrin daily 10 microgram subcutaneously, beginning from 21th day of menstrual cycle up to third day of their next menstruation.After than, lucrin (luprolide acetate)dosage will be decreased to 5 microgram and will continiously be applied up to day of human corionic gonadotrophin(hCG),(Pregnyl 10000Units) administration.On tirth day of menstruation fixed dosage of 225Units of gonadotrophin(Gonal F) will be applied and will continue up to the day of hCG administration, also.36 hours after hCG, oocytes will be picked up by aspiration in once session under vaginal ultrasonography.Oocytes will be put culture medium and intacytoplasmic sperm injection will be applied by embryologist. 3 to 5 days later,after blastocysts were obtained, two embryo will be transferred by one catheter in control group (as usual), two embryos will be transferred by two catheters in two times in study(intervention) group.Catheters will be used in both groups are all commercially available similar catheters.
Embryos will be transferred, when they reach 8 cell stage.Total number of embryos will be determined according to availibility of quality embryos (three or four embryos)</interventions>
    <comparator>control group will be composed of women who get transfer two embryos in single catheter in one attempt.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>clinical pregnancy rate after two different type of embryo transfers.
Clinical pregnancy will be positive if gestational sac would be seen by transvaginal ultrasonography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>21 days after transfer</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>implantation rates and biochemical pregnancy rates after transfer.Implantation rates and biochemical pregnancy rates will be determined by serum free hcg greater than 10IU/ml at 12 days after the transfer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 days after transfer</timepoint>
