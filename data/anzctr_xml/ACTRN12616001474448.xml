  <interventions>
    <interventions>For patients enrolled to the intervention arm, they will be provided with the current standard of care (which involves a clinical review of medications, some may have a medicines reconciliation on admission (they qualify for this based on the local criteria for this), counselling on only specific medications such as warfarin or home intravenous antibiotics) by the ward pharmacist AND a more comprehensive, individualised discharge service by the study pharmacist. This will occur only on discharge from hospital as a single event (if the patient is to go home outside of pharmacy hours, the discharge service will occur the next working day and education will occur via telephone) The discharge service is expected to take up to an hour (however this will vary patient to patient). It will include:

Patient counselling of medicines 
Discharge medication reconciliation
Organise a compliance aid if necessary
Returning patients own medicines
Medication card and medicine information leaflets
Assist with access to medication 
Review of the medication related information on the discharge summary
Comprehensive General Physician and community pharmacist handover (including medication changes, discharge medication list, ongoing monitoring, any drug interactions)

If deemed necessary, a referral to a Clinical Pharmacist working in the PHO 
The participants will also be asked to complete a single question health literacy test and a quality of life survey.
Every intervention provided to each participant will be documented on an 'intervention' form for analysis at the end of the trial. </interventions>
    <comparator>For patients enrolled in the control arm, the ward clinical pharmacist will provide the current standard of care which involves a clinical review of medications, some may have a medicines reconciliation on admission (qualify based on the local criteria for this), counselling on only specific medications such as warfarin or home intravenous antibiotics, with no intervention on discharge. The patients will also be asked to complete a single question health literacy test and a quality of life survey.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eligible participants are adult (over 18 years) patients being treated on the Internal Medicine ward at Dunedin Hospital who are identified as being high risk for readmission by an electronic prioritisation tool. Patients meet inclusion criteria if they are allocated a certain score using a prioritisation tool on admission. The cut off score for inclusion is still to be decided (the electronic tool validation is underway currently).</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The electronic tool generating the ‘scores’ that indicate risk of readmission for patients will do so in a format that lists the patients on the Internal Medicine ward by surname consistently. Those newly admitted patients who reach the cut off score will be entered into the spreadsheet with the randomised allocations to intervention (1) or control (2), in order of surname. The allocation sequence is not concealed from the researcher enrolling patients</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During your hospital stay your medicines may change.  The aim of this project is to find out if patients who get extra education from a pharmacist when being discharged mean they can manage any changes better.  We also want to find out if the pharmacist work has an impact on readmission to hospital and quality of life.
This project needs two groups of patients.  One will receive the usual standard of quality care and will complete a brief questionnaire to measure your quality of life.  The second group will complete the same questionnaire and have some additional time with a specialised pharmacist.  
By doing this we can see if there is any difference between the 2 groups and work out if the extra pharmacist time reduces readmission to hospital and improves patients quality of life.
