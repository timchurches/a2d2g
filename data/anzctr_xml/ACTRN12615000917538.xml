  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1. Learn to BE SAFE with Emmy 5 x 1 hr weekly sessions focused on protective behaviour themes. Each session involves a teaching component and activities that revolve around the sessions theme. The key themes and an example activity for each week are outlined below. 

Week 1: Content focuses on body signals that indicate various emotions as well as emotions or signals that might indicate danger (i.e. early warning signs). Example activity: Match feelings to faces. 
Week 2: Content focuses on early warning signs and discriminating safe and unsafe situations. Example activity: Listing early warning signs. 
Week 3: Content addresses the concept of personal space and private body areas as well as teaching responses to personal space violations and information regarding disclosure. Example activity: Using pictures to colour public/private body parts
Week 4: Content focuses on examples of safe and unsafe secrets and distinguishing between these. Encouragement is also given to disclosing potentially unsafe secrets to safe adults.  Example activity: Picking safe vs unsafe secrets
Week 5: The final session focuses on recognising and developing networks of safe adults from whom children may seek help. Example activity: Creating a 'hand of safety'

Sessions are conducted with two trained facilitators from the non-for-profit organisation ACT for Kids and are run with classroom groups. A core component of the program is the use of an adult sized program mascot 'Emmy' to help illustrate key themes and model program strategies. Handouts of session content are also sent home to parents on a weekly basis. 

An audit will be conducted in 10% of sessions to ensure consistency of sessions. A roll call will be conducted for each session to assess how many sessions each participant received.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2. Waitlist control  will be on 6 month waitlist for participation in Learn to BE SAFE with Emmy program. Receive school curriculum as usual in this time.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>G*Power was used to estimate sample size, assuming a simple random sampling strategy with individuals as the primary sampling unit. This suggested a total sample size of at least 100 children per group at each of three sites. Because cluster sampling was going to be used with schools as the primary sampling unit , we followed similar studies that have estimated the sample size with this design effect, taking into account potential attrition of (20%) owing to student absences and/or mobility to be approximately 1.5 (e.g. Midford et al., 2012). In addition, we need enough power to examine the effects for subgroups (sex/school/family/stress etc). Therefore, a total sample size of at least 1,350 is required in this study to test the effectiveness of the intervention. Assuming conservative class sizes of 20 students per class (60 children per school; 9 schools in each region), we plan a final initial sample size of 1,620 Year 1 children and their parents to give us sufficient power for this study.

Factorial ANOVA and independent sample and paired sample t-tests will be used to examine primary and secondary outcome data. Comparisons will be conducted across time and between intervention groups. If necessary hierarchical linear modelling will be used. 

Mediation and regression will be used to examine any moderating or mediating relationships as well as models of protective behaviours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted examining the effectiveness of the Learn to Be Safe with Emmy and Friends protective behaviours program as compared to a waitlist control group in Queensland, Australia. Participants will be children in first grade classrooms at three locations. The Learn to Be Safe with Emmy Program consists of 5 one-hour weekly sessions teaching protective behaviour concepts such as emotions, safe/unsafe secrets, private/public body parts, early warning signs and disclosure networks. Waitlist control students will participate in educational activities as normally scheduled. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks post-baseline (intervention completion) and 6 month follow-up for both conditions, with additional 1 year, and 18 month follow-ups for the program condition. Outcomes will include protective behaviours knowledge, intentions and skill.</summary>
