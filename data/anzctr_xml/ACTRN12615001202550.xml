    <interventions>Prescription Dose Per Site
Stereotactic radiotherapy over 5-6 days or stereotactic radiosurgery over 1-2 days will be performed using planning software which allows for the planning and treatment of multiple (3-10) cerebral metastases. Dose prescription and fractionation schedules will be based on metastases size, location and previous surgery. For each metastatic site identified, 98.5% of the defined PTV volume must be covered by the appropriate dose. All prescribed doses per lesion classification are outlined below:

PTV* (total) -Total Dose (Gy) to 80% IDL* -	Fractions
0.5-4.0 cubic cm will receive 20 Gy in 1 fraction
4.0-15 cubic cm will receive 35 Gy in 5 fractions
Brainstem/basal ganglia will receive 36 Gy in 6 fractions
Resection Cavity 0.5-4.0 cubic cm will receive 20 Gy in 1 fraction
Resection cavity &gt;4.1 cubic cm will receive 35 Gy in 5 fractions

*PTV = Planning target volume / IDL = Isodose level

Dose prescriptions
All fractionation is based on the prescription dose covering &gt;98.5% of the PTV. Dose-fractionation has been designed to provide similar efficacy in terms of tumour control with increasing fractionation based on volume (PTV), and to provide maximum safety in terms of late reactions such as tumour necrosis and symptomatic cerebral oedema.

For participants prescribed hypofractionated dose regimes, it is expected that treatments will be delivered daily totaling 5 fractions per week according to departmental policies, except where interruptions to treatment schedule are unavoidable due to public holidays or any other reason. If an interruption in treatment is needed due to an adverse event, the cause and nature shall be documented and scored using the per-protocol CTCAE v4.03, with treatment to resume as soon as is clinically feasible. Any other alternative events that result in treatment interruptions should also be documented. 

Planning System Requirements
The computerised planning system should have the following minimum capabilities:
- Provides a 3D dose calculation algorithm (e.g. convolution / superposition algorithm) capable of performing calculations that account for variations in scatter in the presence of 3D CT defined heterogeneities. 
- Can provide dose calculation grid spacing of 1x1x1mm.
- Can provide digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) with superimposed target volume, critical structure contours and treatment aperture. 
For the purposes of this study, BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Brain Metastases Planning system (Version 1.0) (BrainLab AG, Germany) utilizing iPlan Pencil Beam Convolution RT Dose (Verision 4.5.3) (6MV photons) will be employed, using a calculation grid size resolution of 1mm or finer to ensure the accuracy of dose distribution calculated. 

Beam Arrangement and Technique Selection
(i) Treatment Modality
BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Automatic Brain Metastases Planning program (BrainLab AG, Germany) is a novel radiotherapy planning software that was designed solely for the treatment of numerous brain metastases simultaneously. Internal algorithms within the software will analyse predefined target and critical structure proximity and dose constraints, structure priority, size and shape, and work in reverse to construct a plan that best achieves the dosimetry that matches all the input parameters (i.e. inverse-planned). Radiotherapy planning with BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Automatic Brain Metastases Planning software and the use of dynamic Micro-multi-Leaf Collimators (mMLCs) to create tight margins around identified targets allows for dose distributions with steep dose gradients that greatly minimise dose to the normal healthy surrounding tissues and structures. 

(ii) Number of treatment arcs and arrangement
In order to make treatment sessions exponentially faster, and to meet predefined dose constraints, BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Automatic Brain Metastases Planning (BrainLab AG, Germany) software will automatically place a single virtual isocentre and utilise a number of dynamic arcs at multiple table angles (non-coplanar) (maximum 10 arcs at 5 table positions) respectively. Arcs will rotate backward and forward at the same couch position to ensure adequate coverage of metastases that may be occluding one another.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics such as means/medians and standard deviations, interquartile ranges (the difference between the 25th and 75th percentiles) will be reported. The nonparametric Wilcoxon paired samples test will be employed to compare patients neurocognitive functioning (HVLT) between baseline and 3 months, and baseline and 6 months evaluations as described in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial, "A Phase II Trial of Hippocampal Avoidance During Whole Brain Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases--RTOG CCOP Study - RTOG 0933". Time to event analysis will employ the Kaplan-Meier method as described by Armitage (2002). Secondary endpoints will be examined using methods appropriate for repeated measures such as generalized estimating equation or mixed models.

RTOG 0933 was based on the Wilcoxon paired sample test with alpha =0.05(one-sided) noting a total of 51 eligible patients would ensure 80% statistical power to detect a 15% average relative loss in delayed recall at 4 months. Assuming 20% of patients would be unable to complete the evaluation at 3 or 6 months and 10% protocol deviation by requiring further intervention prior to further assessment, 73 patients, conservatively rounded to 75 patients would be required.

Unless otherwise specified, 0.05 statistical significance and 95% confidence intervals will be employed throughout.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether improved radiation planning technology that conforms to the shape and size of the cancer, can be used to treat multiple sites of cancer within the brain, and at the same time protect and preserve your brain (memory and cognitive) function.

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with 3-10 measurable cerebral metastases, i.e. your cancer has spread to three or more spots on the brain. 

Study details: All participants in this study will receive a new treatment called Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy. This is highly focused radiation given in one or a few (5-6) treatments. Robotic targeting is used to avoid important parts of the normal brain. Where previous treatment for multiple sites of cancer within the brain has involved giving radiation to the whole brain, this treatment will allow us to treat multiple areas at the same time. The aim is to avoid the use of whole brain radiation that can affect the memory structures within the brain such as the hippocampus, thus preserving brain (memory and cognitive) function. The trial will use software called "BrainLab Elements (Trademark)". This software will help the radiation oncologist to plan and deliver the radiotherapy treatment. All participants will be monitored throughout treatment for safety. They will also be asked to undergo MRI scans and complete some questionnaires at the start of the study and at 3 and 6 months after treatment to assess neurocognitive functioning, disease response, and quality of life. We estimate that this study will contribute further to the research into using radiotherapy to control cancers that have spread to the brain, while minimising the effects on brain function.</summary>
