  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention to be examined in this trial is the subcutaneous administration of denosumab 60mg compared to placebo (0.9% saline). The first dose of study drug will be given on day 3 in ICU after vitamin D assessment has been completed and supplementation provided, and in the absence of untreated or new infection. The second dose of intervention or placebo will be administered at the 6-month follow-up, after vitamin D assessment and supplementation as indicated.

The first dose of study drug will be administered by an ICU registered nurse as a subcutaneous injection on study day 3 in ICU.

Denosumab: 
*Formulation: 60mg denosumab in a single-use pre-filled 1ml syringe
*Administration: subcutaneous injection administered in upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen.

Following administration of the study drug in ICU, monitoring for hypocalcaemia will occur a minimum of twice daily for 48-hours. The majority of patients will have intra-arterial and/or central venous vascular access, with regular blood gas measurement that include calcium performed. If routine testing provides twice-daily calcium additional testing will not be performed.  Hypocalcaemia is defined as ionized calcium &lt;0.9 mmol/L, based on ICU protocols for treatment of hypocalcaemia in other settings, ie citrate induced hypocalcaemia with the use of citrate for anticoagulation. Hypocalcaemia will be treated with parenteral calcium, as per hospital dosing and administration protocols, to maintain a target ionized calcium range of 0.9-1.1 mmol/L.

The second dose of study drug will be administered by a registered nurse as a subcutaneous injection at 6-months post-ICU discharge.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care
*Standard nutrition will be administered to both control and treatment arm participants per ICU feeding protocols, including dietician review and advice provided to participants in hospital. 
*Vitamin D supplementation: Following enrolment and randomisation, a serum vitamin D level will be collected and analysed.  If the serum vitamin D level is &lt; 50 mol/L, a single dose of 50,000 IU cholecalciferol will be administered via oral or enteral route. 

Placebo: 
*Formulation: 0.9% Saline in a single-use pre-filled 1ml syringe
*Administration: subcutaneous injection administered in upper arm, upper thigh, or abdomen.

    <statisticalmethods>The principal aim of this study is to detect the change in the bone resorption marker CTX in participants receiving denosumab compared to those receiving placebo. A prospective RCT conducted in 20 postmenopausal females with chronic critical illness administered 3mg ibandronate intravenously compared to placebo, and followed patients for 14-days. They observed a 34% decrease in serum CTX levels on day 6 compared to a 13% increase in the placebo group. By day 11 there was no difference. A large RCT of denosumab for fracture prevention in women with osteoporosis reported a median decrease of serum CTX of 86% at 1-month compared to placebo. In our prospective study of bone turnover markers and BMD in ICU survivors, we reported a median CTX of 654 [IQR 4791165 ng/] at baseline, and 315 [162-592 ng/L] at 1-year in female participants, with a population median of 338 ng/L (IQR 212499)..

Given these results we believe a clinically significant effect of denosumab is a 50% reduction in median serum CTX from baseline levels to day 28, compared to no change in the placebo group. A sample size of 7 patients per group will provide a 95% power (2 sided p-value of 0.05) to detect a difference in serum CTX from day 0 to day 28 equal to 2 standard deviations, and an 80% power (2 sided p-value of 0.05) to detect a difference equal to 1.5 standard deviations. With a predicted 20% rate of drop-out or death from enrolment to the 28-day primary outcome time-point, a sample size of 18 participants is required. This figure equates to the anticipated enrollment over a 12-month period at the principal study site. 

All data will be assessed for normality. Continuously normally distributed data will be reported as mean (+standard deviation), whereas non-parametric data will be reported using median (interquartile range [IQR]) or frequency distribution. Where normality exists, the primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using paired t-tests, with a two-sided p-value of 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Where changes in outcome are found to be non-symmetrical, Wilcoxon sign rank tests will be employed. Due to small sample size, multivariate analysis will not be performed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intensive care patients face health issues that extend beyond their critical illness, including weakness, changes in quality of life, and an increase likelihood of disease and death. One area of post-ICU illness that may be preventable is fragility fracture. 

Fragility fractures occur due to weakening of bone, most commonly due to osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Fragility fractures have devastating effects, resulting in hospitalisation, loss of independence and function, and increased likelihood of dying in the following year.

Critical illness appears to increase the rate of bone loss, with studies showing an increased in markers of bone turnover, an accelerated loss of bone mass, and an increase in rate of fragility fractures, during and after critical illness. This is particularly evident in women, suggesting critically ill women face an extra injury to their bones at a time when they are already at risk.

Medications that prevent or reduce bone loss have been extensively tested and shown to be effective in post-menopausal women, and other groups at risk of losing bone rapidly. This includes some types of cancer, and patients receiving therapies that cause bone loss. 

There is very limited experience in using these antiresorptive medications in critical illness, although some evidence suggests they may be effective at reducing bone turnover. 
Denosumab is a more recent antiresorptive medication that acts to prevent bone loss, and has been shown to be effective in large trials. It has not be used in critical illness, so we would like to perform a small study to ensure it is safe and effective in this group.  Like other antiresorptive agents denosumab has side effects, although its has an advantage that it does not affect kidney function. It does however have some effect on immune function, a concern during critical illness. Given this we plan to delay its administration until there is no active infection. 

At the completion of this study we will examine the safety and effect of densoumab on bone turnover in postmenopausal critically ill women. If it appears safe and show signs of benefit, we will plan a larger study to assess its effect on bone mass, fractures, and survival, more completely.
