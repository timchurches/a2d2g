  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nicotinic acid prolonged release (PR), starting dose of 1000mg orally daily (od), increasing to 2000mg od after 4 weeks and maintaining this dose for the next 8 weeks (i.e. 12 week treatment period in total). This is a cross over study, therefore Nicotinic acid PR will be taken for 1 of the two 12 week treatment periods. There will be a 3 week washout period inbetween the 2 treatment periods. The second treatment period is a no treatment period. Nicotinic acid will be administered as an oral tablet.
Rosuvastatin, 5-40mg. All participants will be on stable dose concomittant Rosuvastatin for 6 weeks prior to the study and for the duration of the study. Rosuvastatin will be administered as an oral tablet at an optimal dose to acheive an low density lipoprotein-cholesterol of less than 2.5mmol/L.
Immediately following a high fat test meal, intravenous D3-leucine stable isotope and two oral vitamin A capsules (50,000U each) will be used as kinetic tracers of lipoprotien metabolism. These will be given twice, that is once only on each stable isotope day at the end of each (two) treatment periods.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Apolipoprotein (apo) B48 Fractional Catabolic Rate (FCR) will be used as an assessment tool for the proportion of the apoB48 pool that is catabolized per day. Apo B48 FCR will be determined and compared between groups. All analyses will be carried out using SAS 9.1 (Cary, NC, USA). Group characteristics will be compared by t-tests and general linear modelling after logarithmmic transformation of skewed variables where appropriate.  Treatment effects will be examined using SAS mixed-effect models and adjusted for baseline values. Carry-over effects will be examined. Associations will be examined by simple and multivariate linear regression method. Compartmental analysis will be used to develop and fit models to lipid and lipoprotein tracer data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>ApoB48 FCR time points are baseline, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60mins, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 24, 48, 72, 96 hours following administration of D3-leucine stable isotope and vitamin A capsules on 2 occasions i.e. once at the end of each (two) treatment periods.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apoB FCR will be used as an assessment tool for the proportion of the VLDL apoB pool that is catabolized per day. VLDL apoB FCR will be determined and compared between groups. All analyses will be carried out using SAS 9.1 (Cary, NC, USA). Group characteristics will be compared by t-tests and general linear modelling after logarithmmic transformation of skewed variables where appropriate.  Treatment effects will be examined using SAS mixed-effect models and adjusted for baseline values. Carry-over effects will be examined.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>High density lipoprotien (HDL) ApoAI produciton rate will be used as an assessment tool for the rate of production of HDL ApoA1. HDL ApoAI production rate will be determined and compared between groups. All analyses will be carried out using SAS 9.1 (Cary, NC, USA). Group characteristics will be compared by t-tests and general linear modelling after logarithmmic transformation of skewed variables where appropriate.  Treatment effects will be examined using SAS mixed-effect models and adjusted for baseline values. Carry-over effects will be examined.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to carry out a cross-over study to determine if Nicotinic acid prolonged release (Nicotinic acid PR) has beneficial effects on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and apoprotein transport rates in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In these participants, Nicotinic acid PR will be used in combination with their current optimal dose statin therapy.</summary>
