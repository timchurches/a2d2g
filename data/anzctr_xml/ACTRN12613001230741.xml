  <interventions>
    <interventions>The allocated provider for the intervention group were nurses. 

On day 1 clinical care and initiation of medical abortions (MA) from their allocated provider (nurses or physicians) began. This included counseling, a vaginal/pelvic exam, an abdominal ultrasound, and dispensation of 200mg of oral mifepristone taken on-site under provider supervision. Women were then given 800 micro grams of misoprostol (in 4 tablets of 200 micro grams each) with instructions to self administer them buccally at home, 24 hours after the site visit. As part of the counseling women received on day 1, participants were provided with a card with instructions for contacting a study representative in the event of any questions or concerns, and were given an flyer containing information on expected side effects and also of potential serious events hat may require prompt medical attention, such as heavy bleeding, fever, and abnormal vaginal discharge. During the follow-up visit between days 7-15, abortion completion was assessed through a review of clinical symptoms and bleeding history  and an abdominal ultrasound in order to confirm non-pregnancy, both administered by the assigned provider (nurse or phyrsician). When the process was deemed to be not yet complete, participants received an additional dose of 800 micro gramsof misoprostol (to be taken buccally at home) with a request to return for follow up one week later. If providers (nurses and physicians) felt a surgical intervention was warranted or if a woman requested ita manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) was provided at the same site. All MVA procedures were carried out by an Ob-Gyn specialist, not part of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>The allocated provider for the control group were physicians. 

A total of 932 women participated, 461 in the nurse-led arm and 471 in the physician-led arm. By comparing the number of completed abortions without surgical intervention by both nurses and physicians, we were able to determine if nurses can perform medical abortions to the same level as doctors. </comparator>

Available answered differed by type of question such as:

Yes, no, and maybe

Very satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, No opinion

Better than what she expected, More or less what she expected, Does not know

    <statisticalmethods>A non-inferiority design was used. The margin of non-inferiority was a priori determined to be 5%, meaning that nurses would be judged to be equivalent to physicians if the outcome of interest should were no more than 5% worse than outcomes for physicians. This margin of non-inferiority was based on clinically important differences and considerations of cost and feasibility. The sample size of, 800 (400 in each study arm), was sufficient to detect non-inferiority with 90% power, assuming a 5% loss to follow up rate. Non inferiority for this outcome was compared using the Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis.
The homogeneity of the three sites (strata) involved in this study was assessed using index H. 
T-tests for two independent samples were used to assess significant differences in the means for physicians and for nurses across particular factors; for example, the mean difference of duration of gestation (by last menstrual period and ultrasound) of women attended by doctors and nurses. 
In order to assess client acceptability across the two types of providers, we used responses to 14 questions on acceptability to compute an ad hoc score for each provider group. For each question the option representing the lowest acceptability received 0 points, and the option representing the highest received 1 point. Some of these questions could have been scored at 0.5. As such, the total score for each patient ranged between 0 and 14. The acceptability of each provider group was assessed comparing the mean of these total scores.

All analyses were conducted using SPSS v18 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA), and WINPEPI (Abramson, J.H.  WINPEPI updated: computer programs for epidemiologists, and their teaching potential. Epidemiologic Perspectives &amp; Innovations 2011, 8:1).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently in Mexico City, medical abortion (MA) is only administered by physicians. Our study examines the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of nurse-led provision of MA in comparison to that by physicians. The outcome of interest was completed medical abortion without the need for surgical intervention. The outcome was analyzed by intention-to-treat and per-protocol. A total of 932 women participated, 461 in the nurse-led arm and 471 in the physician-led arm. The study found that nurse-led provision of MA is no less safe, acceptable or effective as those led by physicians in Mexico City. </summary>
