  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be screened according  to study specific criteria to determine if eligible for the trial.  After undergoing pre-procedure assessments which are standard of care for this type of procedure, the subject will be treated according to standard of care, but utilizing the study device under investigation by a trained physician with robust experience in performing bronchoscopy or other pulmonary interventions.   The study device is a robotic-assisted bronchoscope system, which is an alternative to a conventional bronchoscope.  The approximate duration of the procedure is approximately 1 hour.
 
Subjects will be monitored prior to discharge and undergo a post-procedure chest x-ray to check for any complications.  Subjects are then required to visit their study doctor at 7-days post-procedure for results of the diagnostic intervention and for a general health assessment, and will also undergo a phone or office visit at 90 and 180 day post procedure.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate safety (through intra and post-procedural complication rates)  of the study device under investigation as assessed through the rates of complications seen throughout the trial.  Primary safety outcomes are specific to pneumothorax (collapsed lung) and severe bleeding.  Complications will be noted in the patients medical record by trained study staff, and entered into a secure, de-identified study specific database.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra and post-procedure (through 180 days)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the feasibility (through number of successful attempts to retrieve tissue samples for diagnosis compared to the number of attempts)  of the study device under investigation.  Feasibility will be assessed by comparing the number of subjects with a successful tissue sampling relative to the number of subjects with an attempt made.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-procedural and post-procedure through 7 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess overall safety related to the study device, including all adverse events/complications (not just pneumothorax and bleeding).  Safety will be assessed by analyzing the rates of complications observed in enrolled subjects.  Complications will be noted in the patients medical record by trained study staff, and entered into a secure, de-identified study specific database.</outcome>
      <timepoint>through 180 days post-procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate accuracy characteristics related to the study device.  Accuracy characteristics will be assessed though comparing procedure results with post-procedure pathology results.</outcome>
