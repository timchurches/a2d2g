  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised to receive lignocaine or placebo, to begin following the induction of anaesthesia. The treatment regimen is as follows:
1. Loading dose (lignocaine or placebo): 1mg/kg (0.1ml/kg) administered intravenously as a single dose at a rate of 20mg/minute (2ml/minute). Following completion of the loading dose, immediate commencement of;
2. Constant rate infusion (lignocaine or placebo): 2mg/kg/hr (0.2ml/kg/hr) for 24 hours.

Dose titration / adjustment will not be performed. If adverse effects are seen, the infusion will be ceased. At the end of the treatment period, the study drug will be discontinued without tapering.

Each participant's involvement in the trial will end when they are discharged from hospital. </interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo formulation for this study is contained within a 500ml fluid bag that appears identical to the lignocaine study drug, though is composed only of 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride.

Both intervention and control groups will receive (additional)analgesia consistent with the current standard of care.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 18 patients in each group has been calculated to be sufficient to detect a difference of 20mm in the mean VAS score for pain, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 20mm, with a significance level a = 0.05 and a power of 0.90. A difference of 20mm in pain score was chosen as this was found to be the amount needed to cause a clinically significant reduction in a persons experience of pain. 25 patients per group will be enrolled to compensate for possible dropouts.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the best efforts of medical practitioners, a short period of severe post-operative pain is still experienced by many patients undergoing surgery. This is particularly so in patients that undergo laparoscopic repair of a hiatus hernia, since there are limited pain relief options that do not cause nausea and vomiting (as these could ultimately lead to disruption of the surgical repair).  

Many studies have shown that intravenous lignocaine infusion in the perioperative period is safe and has clear advantages in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. These same studies concluded that further research is needed to determine the optimum dose, timing and duration of infusion of lignocaine in this setting.

This study aims to evaluate the benefits and validate the safety of intravenous lignocaine for pain relief for patients undergoing laparoscopic repair of hiatus hernia. </summary>
