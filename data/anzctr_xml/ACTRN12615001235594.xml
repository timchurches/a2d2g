  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 'BeyondNow' safety-planning smartphone application will be installed onto participants' smartphones for a period of two months. The BeyondNow app provides users with the ability to develop a structured, and personally useful list of coping and help-seeking strategies which can be used to help cope with suicidal ideation during times of distress or crisis. The app allows users to document personalised warning signs of an impending crisis, ways to keep their environment safe, reasons for living, coping and distraction strategies, socialisation strategies, social contacts and professional support services including inbuilt contacts for Lifeline, 000 emergency, and the Suicide Call Back Service. Users will spend around 40 minutes developing their safety plan and learning to use the app with study staff at the baseline session. The researchers will not actively monitor adherence to the intervention, however, aggregate data on app usage and participant self-report app usage will be gathered. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to evaluate the functionality, efficacy, and utility of a new safety planning smartphone application. The trial will involve including the use of the smartphone application into existing Monash Health mental health services. Participants will include 60 patients who have experienced recent suicidal ideation or behaviours. Participants will be recruited by their treating mental health clinician. First, research staff will train the treating clinicians and participants in the use of the smartphone application, and conduct baseline measurement of suicide ideation and/or behaviour, as well as suicide resilience using self-report measures. Participants will then undergo 'treatment as usual' under the management of their treating clinician for a period of two months. Research staff will then conduct post trial measurement of suicide risk and resilience along with qualitative data on smartphone application functionality and utility. Data on smartphone application usage will be collected via Google analytics software. This information will not include personal information stored in the application.</summary>
