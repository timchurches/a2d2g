  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will consist of 5 experimental treatment sessions scheduled at weekly intervals on an individual basis for participants in the imaginal exposure therapy conditions, and group basis for participants in the in-vivo exposure therapy conditions. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: Imaginal exposure therapy + D-Cycloserine (DCS), Imaginal exposure therapy + placebo, In-vivo exposure therapy + DCS, or In-vivo exposure therapy + placebo. Participants will be assigned to groups using random block assignment. Prior to the commencement of treatment, and after the completion of treatment, all participants will be asked to give a 3 minute impromptu speech on a topic of their choice. Participants will given 2 minutes to prepare their speech and will be videotaped. 

Imaginal Exposure Treatment -

Treatment session 1 will consist of psycho-education about imaginal exposure therapy and treatment (60 minutes). Placebo and DCS tablets will be made into two different colours by the compounding chemist. At the beginning of treatment session 2 participants will be asked to toss a coin. How the coin lands will determine what colour tablet the participant will take. Neither the co-investigator nor the participant will know which tablet they will be taking. The participants will then take the same capsule (500mg) before each exposure session. In the imaginal exposure therapy condition participants will be asked by the therapist to imagine themselves giving a speech about a topic of their choice. Participants will be given a list of topics from which to choose. Consistent with previous studies using exposure each session will consist of three exposure tasks (i.e. three speeches), each of which will be 5 minutes in duration, with a total of 15 minutes of exposure per session. The speeches will become increasingly difficult as the sessions progress.   

In-Vivo Treatment -

As with imaginal exposure, treatment session 1 will consist of psycho-education about in-vivo exposure and treatment (60 minutes). Allocation of capsules to participants will be determined in the same manner as in the imaginal exposure condition, and participants will be required to take the same capsule (500mg) before each exposure session. In the in-vivo exposure therapy condition participants will be asked by the therapist to give a speech about a topic of their choice. Each session will consist of three exposure tasks (i.e. three speeches), each of which will be 5 minutes in duration, with a total of 15 minutes of exposure per participant  in each session. The audience will consist of 4 participants who will also be giving 3 speeches within the same session in turn. Each exposure session will be 90 minutes in duration in total. The speeches will become increasingly difficult as the sessions progress and all sessions will be video recorded.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>D-cycloserine (DCS) is an antibiotic that has been used for the treatment of Tuberculosis over the last 40 years. Research indicates that DCS affects receptors in the brain known as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors which are located in a region of the brain called the Amygdala. When the NMDA receptors become active (as occurs during extinction) this leads to a reduction in fear levels. Research suggests that DCS enhances the activity of these receptors, and as a result, enhances therapy techniques such as exposure (Guastella, Lovibond, Dadds, Mitchell &amp; Richardson, 2007). 

To date, few studies have investigated the effects of DCS as an adjunct to exposure therapy using human participants, and of these none have done so using imaginal exposure therapy. The research thus far has focused primarily on the effects of DCS with in-vivo exposure on individuals. Yet, the same underlying processes appear to contribute to the success of both imaginal and in-vivo exposure therapy, i.e. the activation of anxiety and the formation of new associations in the brain through confrontation of the feared stimulus or situation. If DCS works by strengthening the formation or accessibility of new, non-threat associations (Guastella, Richardson, Lovibond, Rapee, Gaston, Mitchell &amp; Dadds  2008), then it should also enhance the effects of imaginal exposure. Therefore there is good theoretical reason to see whether DCS has the same exposure enhancing properties when used as an adjunct to imaginal exposure therapy. In terms of its application in clinical settings, imaginal exposure therapy has several advantages compared to in-vivo exposure techniques, offering greater practicality and flexibility, particularly with regards to situations that are not readily accessible. Research also suggests that individuals experience less aversion when exposed to fearful images than when they are in direct contact with the feared object or situation (Hunt, Bylsma, Brock, Fenton, Goldberg, Miller, Tran &amp; Urgelles, 2006). This relatively novel area of research has the potential to revolutionise the practice of psychotherapy and possibly offer new treatment options to individuals with public speaking anxiety and possibly other anxiety disorders. 

Aims of the study - 


1. To replicate previous research which shows that DCS enhances in-vivo exposure therapy for individuals with public speaking anxiety

2. To extend previous research by showing that DCS enhances imaginal exposure therapy for individuals with public speaking anxiety

3. To determine whether the ability to conjure up a vivid image and become absorbed in that image increases anxiety levels as measured by self-report and physiological changes, and in turn, leads to positive treatment outcome

4. To determine whether competency in public speaking improves as treatment progresses</summary>
