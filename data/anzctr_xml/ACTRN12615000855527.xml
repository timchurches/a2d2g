  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the a nutritional, targeted refined supplement, to see if this product reduces inflammation, as well as signs and symptoms in adults with IBD. This supplement is made up of Omega  3 fish oil, (more than 500mg); vitamin D:25-OH (500IU); CoQ10 (50mg); zeaxanthin (0.82mg); ,lutein (3mg) and astaxanthin (500mcg). It also contains natural mixed tocopherols, vitamin E with ascorbyl palmitate (1mg). It will be taken orally - 2 capsules a day with the main meal. Adherence is monitored by supplement capsule return. This trial will be conducted as a controlled, double blinded, randomized, cross-over intervention trial over 18 weeks. The duration of the nutritional supplement is 6 weeks, The washout period is 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is an omega three fish oil which is the same as contained in the supplement.. The control will be taken for 6 weeks</comparator>

    <concealment>The subjects will be selected from an already existing IBD  data base from Nutrigenomics New Zealand. They will be invited to participate. They will  initially complete an eligibility questionnaire and dietary questionnaire for prescreening. Once eligible, an information sheet and the consent form will be discussed and sent- to be returned, signed, by post/email/ handed to the study centre. Participants will then be given specific instructions on how the study will proceed. Once the consent forms are received, they will be registered in the study and given a study code number. After coding they will be randomised into the 2 arms of the study by an independent person so the study will be double blinded. One arm will receive the supplement first and the other arm will receive the control first.</concealment>
    <sequence>The participants will be randomized into the 2 arms of the study by an independent person who will use a random sequence (excel generated) using the codes of the participants</sequence>

The number of participants for this trial was based on the Jorgensens et al. Vitamin D3 treatment in Crohns diseasea randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. (Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2010;32(3):377-83). Prior data indicates that the difference in the response of matched pairs is normally distributed with standard deviation 4.  If the true difference in the mean response of matched pairs is 27 we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 1.000.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. (R: A language and environment for statistical computing. Vienna, Austria. Cary, NC, USA.2012). </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>This study will investigate a nutritional, targeted refined supplement, to see if this product reduces inflammation in adults  with IBD.  We hypothesize that the targeted nutritional supplement is able to reduce inflammation in a patient population which has IBD, as well as increasing serum Vitamin D, increasing availability of omega-3 PUFA, and reducing symptoms associated with IBD.</summary>
