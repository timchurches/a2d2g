  <interventions>
    <interventions>Suitable participants will receive a 7 day course of Curcumin and an 8 day course of over the counter 500 IU of Vitamin E (taken as one capsule once per day). Clinic visits occur on day 0 and day 7. Curcumin dosing is on days 1-7 inclusive. Vitamin E dosing is on days 0-7 inclusive. 

Curcumin will be supplied in the form of Longvida (Registered Trademark) sachets  Participants will take 20 grams of Longvida (Registered Trademark) each morning before breakfast for 7 days, which is equivalent to 4 grams of Curcumin. The sachets may be mixed with a low-lactose drink (supplied). Longvida (Registered Trademark) is currently not registered for this indication in Australia and is therefore considered an investigational or experimental product.

At each clinic visit, participants will have a blood test and have photos taken of their eye retina's. To take the photos, pupil-dilating eye drops will be instilled into the eyes. Photos will be taken with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope.

In addition, participants are asked to complete a medication diary during the course of the Curcumin/Vitamin E to record all the medication intake. All Curcumin and Vitamin E containers should be returned to the clinic, even if they are empty.
</interventions>
    <comparator>All suitable participants will receive Curcumin and Vitamin E. The results from participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment will be compared to the results from the Healthy Control group. In addition, the results will be correlated with the participant's results from participation in the parent study. Data from the parent study was collected from April 2013 to November 2014. The parent study is known as NVI003 (ACTRN12613000367741)</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis applies within retinal sampling/imaging [number, size and location] of beta-amyloid plaques and will be compared between diagnostic groups and across imaging sessions in the same individuals. We will apply one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni (or other suitable) post-hoc testing.  A power analysis was performed based on the expected change in retinal amyloid burden and one-way ANOVA testing. 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference in retinal plaque burden change between groups requires group sizes of n=20 or above.The target sample size of 100 is expected to include different strata for comparison: MCI n&gt;20, HC n~80, 
HC+ n&gt;20, HC- n&gt;20. While recruiting from a limited cohort means we are unable to ensure minimum numbers in each strata, a sample size of 100 should enable comparisons across groups with at least n=20 in each group, which is the number required to detect a significant difference based on the power analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alzheimers disease is characterised by the presence of beta- amyloid plaques in the brain. More recently it has been proposed that these beta- amyloid plaques may first appear in the retina, at the back of the eye, before the plaques are detectable in the brain. This longitudinal study will investigate if the amyloid plaques identified in the retina increase in number and size over time.

Curcumin, found in the spice turmeric, is a food additive that has molecular and optical properties that enable us to image amyloid plaques in the retina. Participants will be asked to have eye imaging done before and after taking curcumin for 7 days.

The participant's image will be compared with other results from their participation in the NVI 1003 and AIBL studies. In addition, the results from participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment will be compared to the results from Healthy Control participants.  </summary>
