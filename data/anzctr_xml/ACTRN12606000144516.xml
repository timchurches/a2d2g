  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Myocardial infarction remains common and early sequelae include adverse heart function, decompensation and increased death particularly over the first 3 months after a heart attack. This study aims to: (1) provide detailed information regarding early changes in heart function and hormones in patients who suffer heart attacks and do not have a successful early intervention to restore normal blood flow to the heart .(2) assess the potential benefit of infused BNP hormone on heart function, hormone status and cardiovascular outcomes over the 3 months following a heart attack.</summary>
