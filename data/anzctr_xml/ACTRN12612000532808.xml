  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injections (often called cortisone) are commonly used to treat shoulder pain. For over 10 years in the UK, physiotherapists with additional training in medicines and injecting, have been able to independently give these injections. UK services involving physiotherapist injecting have been found to be effective and help patients get appropriate care sooner. In Australia physiotherapists are not normally permitted to prescribe or inject. We want to see whether allowing an appropriately trained physiotherapist to give shoulder injections, would be feasible or beneficial for Gold Coast patients. We will use an experienced Australian physiotherapist who has completed the necessary prescribing and injecting training in the UK, has 5 years experience of giving these injections to patients in the UK and has undertaken a further period of supervised injection practice in Australia. Our research will compare this physiotherapist with a Specialist Orthopaedic Surgeon in relation to decisions about who should be offered an injection and responses to the injection.</summary>
