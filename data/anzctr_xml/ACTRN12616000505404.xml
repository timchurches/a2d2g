  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated into three groups with participants commencing pulmonary rehabilitation at these various time frames (during hospital admission, 4 weeks post hospital discharge and 8 weeks post hospital discharge). This rehabilitation program consists of a total of 16 hours of exercise training and 8 hours of education. The exercise training component includes endurance  (walking and cycling program) and upper and lower limbs muscle strength training. Participants are required to exercise at 80% of maximal intensity during the rehabilitation program and will complete training for one hour (approximately 30 minutes of walking/cycling and 30 minutes of strength training (two upper and lower limb exercises using free weights), twice a week. This exercise intensity will correlate to a participant exercising at a level of perceived dyspnea between 3 and 5 on the Borg scale (from 0 for no breathlessness to 10 for the most severe breathlessness) and a Borg exertion score of less than 13 for perceived level of exertion (from 6 for no exertion at all to 20 for maximal exertion) during the exercise training.  The exercise training will be delivered by a qualified physiotherapist via small group sessions at the outpatient physiotherapy department at either sites.  As for the education component, participants will attend an hour of group education each week with topics delivered by a multi-disciplinary team. Individual health professional in the multi-disciplinary team will be responsible for delivering a topic relevant to the management of COPD each week. The list of topics include exercise principles for people with COPD, relaxation techniques, use of bronchodilators, continence management, managing dyspnea and anxiety.  These sessions will take place on the same day after the completion of an exercise training so as to reduce the number of visits a participant is required to make during the rehabilitation program. The only variation to the intervention will occur in the group which commences pulmonary rehabilitation at time of hospital admission. Due to the acuity of their exacerbation of COPD, participants in this group will complete 4 1/2 hour exercise sessions which includes both 15 minutes strength (both upper and lower limb) and 15 minutes endurance training (10 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of cycling) once a week until they are discharged from hospital. Pulmonary rehabilitation will be implemented within 4 days of admission. Upon discharge, they will continue their rehabilitation as per normal protocol. A register of attendance will be use to capture the attendance at each session. In a occasion that a participant has failed to turn up for his rehabilitation session, a follow up phone call will be made by a member of the research team to offer the participant an opportunity to make up for their missed session. Each participant will be offered three opportunities to make up for their missed session. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants who have been randomly allocated to the control group will have to complete a 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation program that commences at 8 weeks post hospital discharge. The rehabilitation program will be identical to the intervention group. The assessment will include number of attended sessions, 6 minute walk test distances, quadriceps muscle strength, number of respiratory related hospital admission within 6 months post initial hospital discharge and mortality rates. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>An estimated 69 participants will need to be recruited for this trial using the assumptions that the median sample size for each group in previous trials investigating effects of early commencement of pulmonary rehabilitation is 20 participants and the expected attrition rate for this population is estimated at 15%. Both an intention to treat and a per-protocol analysis will be completed for this trial.  The number of sessions attended by participants will be expressed as a percentage over the total number of sessions. The percentage differences in attendance and completion rates in each group will be compared using one-way ANOVA. Reasons for missing rehabilitation sessions will be descriptively analysed. Number of respiratory-related hospital readmissions over the 6 months post hospital discharge will be reported as an incident rate ratio using a negative binomial regression model. Binary logistic regression will be used to calculate mortality odd ratios and compared between groups. Changes in 6-minute walk test and quadriceps strength will be analysed using ANCOVA using the baseline results as a covariate. An estimated of effect sizes (standardised mean differences) will also be calculated. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a highly effective intervention for people with COPD. However, attendance to pulmonary rehabilitation programs remain to be poor throughout the world. It may be possible that attendance to pulmonary rehabilitation may improve if rehabilitation is implemented at a much earlier time frame such as during an acute exacerbation of COPD or immediately after. This trials aims to investigate the impact on uptake and completion rates when pulmonary rehabilitation is implemented at these various time frames (during hospital admission, 4 weeks and 8 weeks post hospital discharge). Secondary outcomes include physical function, mortality and number of hospital readmissions. </summary>
