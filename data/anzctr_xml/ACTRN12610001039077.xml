  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mindfulness-based meditation, comprising 2 45minute session per week for 3 weeks, with additional home practice via audio CD. the meditation aims to enhance awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of bodily sensations through: 
- Psychoeducation in mindfulness principles.
- Body Scan exercise
- Sitting meditation
- Breathing exercise
- Hearing exercise
- Increasing awareness and mindful acceptance of pleasant and unpleasant events
- 3 minute breathing space
- Action plan for stress management
Participants are instructed to practice exercises daily with the CD for the 3 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment. The wait-list control group will be scheduled to commence the mindfulness course in the week following the second interview and diary assessments (the post treatment assessments for the treatment group).</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Statistically significant reduction in headache severity compared to Control group. headache is recorded in a 2-wek diary by participants, yielding measures of intensity, duration, and days of headache. Headache severity is measured as average intensity or duration of headaches, or number of days headache.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks following randomization.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Statistically significant reduction in experimental acute pain sensitivity compared to Control group. pain is assessed as: 
1) mean pressure pain detection threshold at finger or head (assessed by manual pressure algometer).
2) mean  pain detection, intensity rating, and tolerance thresholds to cold pressor pain (assessed by immersing hand in cold water for up to 3 minutes).
3) mean muscle tenderness score (assessed by manual palpation of 7 extracephalic muscles bilaterally).
4) mean pain inhibition (assessed as the difference between pressure pain threshold at finger before and during contra-lateral painful occlusion cuff inflation).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks following randomization.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Headache is a common condition associated with significant socio-economic impact and reduced quality of life (Schwartz, Stewart, Simon &amp; Lipton, 1998). Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for headache, however it has several limitations, precluding its successful use in many headache sufferers (Fumal &amp; Schoenen, 2008). Particularly, CBT requires considerable time for both therapist and patient, and encourages avoidance rather than coping with headache, which may increase sensitivity to headache triggers and aggravating factors (Martin, 2001). Brief mindfulness based therapy (BMBT) is an emerging behavioural intervention not subject to the above limitations of CBT. Several reports support the efficacy of BMBT in reducing pain and improving functioning in chronic pain conditions such as back pain (Morone et al 2008), fibromyalgia (Creamer et al 2000) and groups of heterogeneous chronic pain sufferers (Kabat-Zinn et al 1985; Kabat-Zinn et al 1986; Kabat-Zinn 1982). BMBT has also been shown to reduce acute pain sensitivity in healthy subjects (Creamer et al 2000, Zeiden et al 2009). This is particularly relevant to headache, in which increased pain sensitivity is a common finding, and thought to be of pathophysiological significance (Cathcart et al 2009). We recently demonstrated that headache is triggered by factor aggravating the already increased pain sensitivity in headache sufferers. Despite the potential benefits of BMBT for treating headache, the efficacy of BMBT as an intervention for headache has not been reported to date. BMBT may reduce headache by inhibiting increased pain sensitivity in headache sufferers.  The present project therefore examines effects of BMBT on headache activity and pain sensitivity in frequent headache sufferers.</summary>
