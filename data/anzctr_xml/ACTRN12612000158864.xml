    <interventions>A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled intervention trial designed to evaluate whether fish oil supplementation (6 x 1g/day for 4 months) can reduce inflammation and mediate improvements in functional exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Forty volunteers will be recruited through public advertisements and from a patient database maintained by the Department of Respiratory Medicine in the Southern Adelaide Health Network. They will have a clinical and spirometric diagnosis of COPD. Prior to the commencement of the study volunteers will complete a series of questionnaires and tests designed to assess lung and physical function, diet history and quality of life. Blood samples will be collected and assayed for dietary and inflammatory biomarkers. Volunteers will be randomised to to one of two groups: 1. Fish oil - 6 x 1g capsules (approximately 3.6g/day long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) 2. Placebo - 6 x 1g capsules (corn oil) Functional and biochemical assessments will be repeated at four months following commencement. A symptom diary will be used to assess frequency and severity of exacerbation symptoms during the study. Upon completion of the study participant experience and perspectives will be gathered using a structured telephone interview. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a debilitating condition that results from inflammation of the airways. This inflammation impairs lung function and thus reduces an individuals ability to undertake physical activities, including activities of daily living.
Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) have been shown in a number of studies to elicit anti-inflammatory effects.  People with COPD will be supplemented with either LCn-3PUFA or placebo; effects on inflammation, lung and physical function will be assessed at four months.
It is anticipated that supplementation with LCn-3PUFA will reduce inflammation, and improve physical function (exercise capacity), which will collectively improve health related quality of life</summary>
