    <interventions>Other interventions - rFIXFc

Experimental: rFIXFc - rFIXFc is administered by intravenous injection. A prophylaxis regimen will start prior to or immediately following the third occurrence of hemarthrosis (joint bleed). The recommended starting prophylactic dose of rFIXFc is 50 IU/kg weekly. Treatment will continue until the participant has reached at least 100 exposure days to rFIXFc. Optional episodic treatment doses are determined by the investigator and range from 25% Factor IX level for minor bleeding episodes to 100% for major episodes or prior to surgery. Single injections of rFIXFc up to 200 IU/kg are allowed.


Other interventions: rFIXFc
Adjustments to the dose and interval of rFIXFc can be made in this study based on investigator discretion using available pharmacokinetic (PK) data, subsequent FIX trough and peak levels, level of physical activity, and bleeding pattern, in accordance with local standards of care for a prophylactic regimen. There is an option to start study dosing as episodic treatment (on-demand).

    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of rFIXFc (recombinant
      coagulation factor IX Fc fusion protein, BIIB029) in previously untreated participants with
      severe hemophilia B. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of rFIXFc in the
      prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in previously untreated participants (PUPs),
      and to evaluate rFIXFc consumption for prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes in
      previously untreated participants.</summary>
