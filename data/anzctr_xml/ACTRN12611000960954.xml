  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pre Test = The participants are given Denatonium Benzoate doses of 4.28 microg , 8.55 microg, 12.84 microg, 17.12 microg, 21.4 microg twice (in 133mL sports drink samples). On the same session, the drinks are given for the first time at rest (3' between each samples), later on (after a VO2 max test) the drinks are given a second time while cycling (4' between each), all the drinks are totally swallowed. The pre test takes place at least one week prior to the first performance test.
   The drink with the higher ratings regarding bitterness and the lower regarding pleasantness will be used later on as followed. The participant will test 4 drinks during the study in itself : one without any DB (control), one with the dose previously selected from the pretest, one at 2/3 of it and another one at 1/3 of it. During the test session, only one drink is given 9 times (0 minute, 9 minute, 21',33',45',53',65',77',89'), each time the volume is 133mL.
   The lab test ride is made of : 5 minutes at 40% of Peak Power, 5 minutes at 50%, nine 2 minutes intervalls at 90% with 2 minutes at 50% between each, 10 minutes at 50% after the ninth, then nine 2 minutes intervalls at 80% with once again 2 minutes at 50% between each. After 90 minutes, the performance test starts : the power increases by 1 Watt every 3 seconds. The rider does not know how long he has been riding for during the performance test. He is just warned when his cadence goes below 70 RPM, after the third warning, the test ends.
    Each drink is tested during a specific session, each session is spaced from the next by one week.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sports drinks are used by many people to reduce effects of dehydration and running out of energy stores on how hard exercise feels and on performance. We have found that solutions containing a particular concentration of the sugar fructose (from fruit, honey) and maltodextrin (broken-down starch from corn) can lead to a better performance relative to other ratios. In this work, carbohydrate delivery and gut comfort was best with the optimal ratio, but there was also a differential perception of sweetness. Other scientists using a mouth-rinse model have found that performance can sometimes be improved simply by rinsing the mouth out with a carbohydrate solution. These data suggest that drink taste and simply the presence of carbohydrate in the mouth can impact on perception of effort and performance. Biologists accept that sweetness is associated with pleasure and safe-to-eat foods, while bitterness with warning, avoidance or treat. Therefore, we asked the question does drink sweetness/bitter profile affect perception of wellbeing and performance during high-intensity endurance exercise.</summary>
