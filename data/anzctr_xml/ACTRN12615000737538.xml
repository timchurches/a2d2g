  <interventions>
    <interventions>Open-label, proof of concept study in initially 10 participants, providing informed consent, to assess whether intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is efficacious as an adjunct to treatment as usual (treatment prescribed by participants usual treating clinicians) in patients with treatment-refractory BDD. iTBS TMS will be conducted five times per week, for 6 weeks. No lead in time required preceding 6 week trial, nor taper period required after 6 week trial as treatment as usual continued throughout. 
The iTBS TMS protocol consists of bursts of three pulses given at 50 Hz repeated every 200 ms, mimicking the coupling of theta and gamma rhythms. Stimulation intensity used in this protocol is the 80% of the active motor threshold (AMT). The intermittent iTBS consists of 1,840 ms of stimulation repeated every 10 s for a total of 191.84 s (600 pulses). Hence there are approximately 15 pulses a second, delivered in a 2 second on / 8 second off pattern for a little over 3 minutes. Treatment will occur Monday to Friday and will require approximately 3 minutes for the TMS itself, and up to 20 minutes for each visit.
Targetting will be via the International 10-20 electrode placement system and/or neuronavigation system of left intracalcarine cortex and occipital pole (Brodmann areas 17[primary visual cortex] and 18[secondary visual cortex]). Neuronavigation will require a baseline MRI brain.</interventions>

This includes confirmation of the clinical diagnosis, as well as there having been at least 2 treatments with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) at maximum dosage for at least 12 weeks, and at least 1 trial of at least 16 sessions of  Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy.  Participants’ usual treatment, which may include medication and/or psychological treatment, will be determined and by their treating psychiatrist, who will continue to provide treatment as usual during the study.  Participation in the study does not require a change or stopping of usual treatment.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The power  will be set at 0.8, with a 20% chance of a type 2 (B) error. The latter involves incorrectly accepting the null hypothesis, that is that there is no difference between pre iTMS and post iTMS stimulation in symptomatic (including a size effect of 0.35 for BDD-YBOCS) parameters in the participants having DBS. With a confidence interval of 95%, utilising non-parametric analyses, the level of statistical significance chosen, p, will be less than or equal to 0.05. Therefore, there is a 5% chance of a type 1 error or false positive. 

Comparison at these time points will be via analysis of variance (ANOVA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) affects approximately 2% of the population and involves constant worry and distress about how someone thinks and feels that they look. About 40% of people with BDD do not respond to currently available treatments. 

In BDD, there appear to be abnormalities in the activity of some areas of the brain, including areas responsible for visual processing.  To date there have been no studies evaluating whether transcranial stimulation (TMS) is helpful for people with ongoing and distressing symptoms of BDD, including those who have not responded to other treatments. 

Hence, the aim of this study is to determine whether TMS is helpful in the treatment of people experiencing BDD, aged 18-65 years, who have not responded to currently available treatments. TMS uses electric currents to generate magnetic fields which can be used to stimulate the brain. This technique is non-invasive (does not require surgery or the introduction of instruments into the body) and requires no anaesthesia or hospital stay/treatment. 

The TMS in the study will stimulate the areas of the brain responsible for visual processing, which may be functioning abnormally in BDD, over a 6 week period. 

Participation in the study does not require a change or stopping of usual treatment, which may include medication and/or psychological treatment, determined by participants' consultation with their treating psychiatrists.</summary>
