  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate concentration in the blood) is common in dialysis patients. Hyperphosphatemia can cause renal bone disease and is also associated with higher mortality. 

Most dialysis patients are prescribed phosphate binder drugs to bind phosphate in the gut and prevent its absorption. These include Calcium Carbonate (Caltrate (Registered Trademark) or Calsup (Registered Trademark)), Aluminium Hydroxide (Alu-Tab (Registered Trademark)), Lanthanum Carbonate (Fosrenol (Registered Trademark)) and Sevelamer (Renagel (Registered Trademark)). In theory some phosphate binder drugs need the stomach to be acidic to work effectively and bind phosphate.

Haemodialysis patients are often prescribed gastric acid suppressant drugs to treat gastric ulcers and gastric reflux disease (heartburn). These drugs include Pantoprazole (Somac (Registered Trademark)), Omeprazole (Losec (Registered Trademark)) and Esomperazole (Nexium (Registered Trademark)). These acid suppressing drugs may reduce stomach acidity and therefore the effectiveness of phosphate binders. This potential drug interaction may worsen hyperphosphatemia

The primary purpose  of this study to evaluate the effectiveness of phosphate binders in managing hyperphosphataemia when they are co-administered with acid suppressive therapy in haemodialysis patients</summary>
