  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an acute dietary intervention trial in healthy adults, in a cross over design. Participants will be asked to consume a standardised breakfast consisting of 2 slices of white toast, jam, fruit and tea/coffee with skim milk and asked to consume this breakfast at 7am on the test morning. Participants are then required to fast for 2 hours until they visit the University at 9am. 

Participants will be randomised to consume one of the following foods:
Group A: Pork (200g of cooked pork mince)
Group B: Lamb (200g of cooked lamb mince)

All participants must consume the 200g serve within 10 minutes. Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 hours following consumption of the test foods and will be analysed for plasma lipid profile (cholesterol, LDL &amp; HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). After a washout period of at least one week, subjects in Group A will consume lamb while those in Group B will consume pork and blood sampling will be repeated as above.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active (cross-over study). There is no control group as each participant's fasting blood sample will act as the control and compared to blood samples collected following each of the treatment groups. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The aim of this project is to examine the effects of the food matrix of white and red meat (pork and lamb) in which the lipids are embedded. It is proposed that the postprandial lipemic response will be different between the meats.The primary outcome measured are the changes in lipids.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At each of the intervention sessions, blood will be collected and lipid levels (LDL, HDL, Triglycerides, total cholesterol) will be measured at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 hours after treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fatty acids are a necessary key energy source in the body, however, when present in excess, can be detrimental. Increased fasting blood fat (lipid) levels have long been accepted as a risk marker for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity
and diabetes, however, there is now increasing evidence which points to postprandial lipemia being a more accurate indicator of risk.
The rate in which fats from the foods we consume are digested, absorbed and appear in the bloodstream is dependent on various factors, including (but not limited to)
the quality and quantity of fat and the nature of the matrix in which fat is embedded in the food. Postprandial monitoring of lipids therefore can reveal the variable response to food intake not seen under fasting conditions. It is this variation which is referred to as the
Lipemic Load. Analysis of the Lipemic Load provides a simple and accurate means of predicting the ability
of a food in modulating blood lipid levels, and can be used as a tool to help consumers choose foods for optimal health.</summary>
