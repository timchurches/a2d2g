  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate whether adding a medicine in pill form to the non-invasive ventilation that you are already receiving can make that non-invasive ventilation more successful.
This study aims to see whether adding acetazolamide to treatment with non-invasive ventilation can improve daytime hypercapnia by improving ventilatory response to hypercapnia. It will take subjects with a diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome who are already receiving treatment with non-invasive ventilation, but who still have abnormally high carbon dioxide levels despite that treatment. 
They will have initial baseline measurements including arterial blood gas on air, renal function blood test and measurement of ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Providing their renal function is good enough they will then take acetazolamide at a dose of 250mg twice a day for one week. They will continue to use non-invasive ventilation at night throughout the study as normal. They will return at the end of that week for repeat arterial blood gas and ventilatory response to hypercapnia testing to see whether the acetazolamide has brought about any change. Further arterial blood gas and ventilatory response to hypercapnia testing will occur after one month to see whether any changes caused have persisted in the absence of the trial drug but with continued use of non-invasive ventilation.
This is a pilot study aiming to ensure the tolerability of this treatment and to quantify the magnitude of any changes seen. It would act to help inform a power calculation for a larger study should it be shown to be beneficial.
