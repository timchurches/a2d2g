  <interventions>
    <interventions>Forty overweight women will be randomly assigned to an exercise or control group.  Exercise will consist of 8 weeks of interval sprinting with three 20 minute sessions per week.  Each 20 minute bout of interval sprinting will consist of 60 mini-sprints of 8 seconds followed by 12 seconds of easy pedaling.  Exercise will be performed on a stationary bike and all sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist.  All women must complete 24 exercise sessions and must make up a session if one session is missed.  Exercise training will be carried out in small groups of between 2 and 3 women.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Our previous interventions improved aerobic fitness with a large effect size of .9.  A recommended power is .8.   Thus, based on a moderately large effect size , a sample size of 10-12 subjects per group would provide a statistical power of .8 at an alpha pf P&lt;0.5. In this intervention we will use 40 subjects in case of drop out.  The statistical analysis will be ANCOVA if assumptions are not violated or t tests on the difference scores.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Being overweight causes increased risk for type 2 diabetes.  We have shown that participation in regular interval sprinting reduces diabetic risk in young adult females.  However, no examination of older women appears to have been carried out. Thus, we hypothesize that 8 weeks of interval sprinting will significantly reduce insulin resistance in middle-aged women, Twenty overweight women will be assigned to a 8 week interval sprinting exercise group and 20 to a control group. All women will be screened for entry to the study.  Exercise will involve 3 x 20 minute sessions of interval sprinting for 8 weeks. Fitness (sub max test), body composition (DEXA), metabolic status (GTT, insulin), autonomic state (heart rate variability, baroreceptor sensitivity), cardiovascular (blood pressure, arterial stiffness, muscle blood flow, cardiac output, stroke volume), and blood markers (insulin, natriuretic peptides, cytokines) will be assessed before and after the 8 week intervention.</summary>
