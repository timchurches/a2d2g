  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be administered with a single dose of either placebo or with F-652 (The Investigational Drug). Dose levels of F-652 will range from 2.0, 8.0, 30.0, 120.0 and 250.0 microgram/kg. Both F-652 or placebo will be administered via subcutaneous injection. As this is a dose escalation study, the first cohort of 8 participants will received the lowest dosage. Safety evaluation will then be performed based on the adverse event reported as well as from the safety laboratory results prior to dose escalating to the higher dose. The same process will be perform prior to every dose escalation. There will be 5 cohorts with 8 participants in each cohort for this study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>F-652 is intended for the treatment for Alcoholic Hepatitis which results in the inflammation of the liver. This is a single dose escalation study testing evaluating dose levels of 2.0, 8.0, 30.0, 120.0 and 250.0 microgram/kg. This is the first time F-652 is tested in humans and that is to establish safety and tolerability, to evaluate how the body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) and what the drug does to the body (pharmacokinetics) compared to when the drug was tested in animal models.</summary>
