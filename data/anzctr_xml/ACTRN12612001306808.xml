  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Treatment with clinician-assisted Internet based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), or 2) Face to face treatment for OCD at the Anxiety Disorders Clinic, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.

All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for OCD. 

Group 1: The online treatment group will have 6 online lessons to complete over the 12 week period. We recommend approximately 1 hour per week reading the lessons (total approximately 12 hours). All group 1 participants will separately complete the Internet based treatment about the management of symptoms of OCD. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 7 days between lessons and a maximum of 14 days). Group 1 participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, weekly reminder emails, and one-on-one contact with the Clinician (Clinical Psychologist) by telephone or email in the first 2 weeks, then as required. The duration of the program is 8-10 weeks, but participants will be contacted 3 months post program and asked to complete follow-up questionnaires. 

Study questionnaires for both groups will be administered at application, pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, at 3 months post-treatment, and the K10 pre-each lesson. These will take about 20 minutes to complete. The treatment materials are based on cognitive behavioural techniques.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2: The face-to-face group will have 12, weekly one hour sessions (total 12 hours) at St Vincents Hospital, Sydney. Patients will be provided with a standardised Patient Treatment Manual and the clinical psychologist will guide participants through exercises designed to help patients gradually confront feared situations until their anxiety reduces.

    <concealment>There are already people on the waitlist for the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney. When people attend the Anxiety Disorders Clinic, they will be offered participation in the study. People will read the information about the study and elect to continue or not. If they choose to apply for the study they will undergo a brief phone interview with a clinician from the program explaining the program, will read the information sheet and return an electronic consent form to the investigators. The phone interview will continue in which the diagnosis will be confirmed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (Appendix A). Questions about the study will be answered and an offer of treatment made. Patients will be randomly allocated to CaCCBT group (n=25), or face-to-face cognitive behaviour therapy (n=25). Randomisation will be done via www.random.org and allocation will be concealed (in opaque sealed envelopes) until the offer of treatment is made and accepted.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be undertaken using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) ANOVA with measurement occasion as a within-groups factor and intervention as a between-groups factor. Relationships between observations at different occasions will be modelled with an unstructured covariance matrix. For each experimental group, planned contrasts will be used to compare changes from baseline to post-test and 3 month follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose is to investigate the value of a new internet therapy for people troubled by OCD compared to participants who receive face-to-face clinician-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We hypothesise there will be no difference in treatment outcomes between the groups.</summary>
