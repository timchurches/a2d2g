  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is a single-arm study for patients presenting with both local and metastatic
      adenocarcinoma of rectum. The aims of the trial are (1) to determine the tolerability rate,
      and (2) to determine toxicity rates, pelvic and distant response rates in patients with
      locally advanced rectal cancer in the presence of distant metastasis who are treated with an
      interdigitating chemotherapy (oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil [5FU]) and radiotherapy regimen.</summary>
