  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cancer patients are diagnosed by Western medicine doctors for pathology report, cancer-related catastrophic illness from health insurance information, and International Classification of Diseases 9th code (ICD-9 code). Patients use western medicine which includes Tamoxifen (Tam), Anastrozole (AI),  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), Letrozole separately, Tam combined with AI, or others regardless of cancer stage (stage 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). At the same time, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctors diagnose and treat patients with traditional Chinese medicine (Bian-Zheng-lun-zhi) based on their chief complaiants, such as insomnia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and pain to relieve patients' symptoms. Patients will return to clinics as schedule at 1,6, and 12 months and blood tests for female-related hormone which is Estradiol (E2) and Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be performed. We also apply  quality of life questionnaire to evaluate the change of quality of life in these patients. This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of  Chinese-Western medical treatment plans for cancer patients for 1 year.</interventions>
