    <summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab subcutaneous (SC)
      monotherapy every 2 weeks (Q2W) and monthly (QM), compared with placebo and ezetimibe, on
      percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with a
      10-year Framingham risk score of 10% or less.</summary>
