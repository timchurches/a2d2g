  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project involves a three-arm randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Internet-based prevention and early intervention program ProYouth OZ in reducing weight and shape concerns and/or eating disorder symptoms in young people. An additional aim of this project is to examine whether the addition of synchronous online peer-to-peer support (i.e. Internet-based chat sessions in a group format) increases treatment effectiveness.

Arm 1
Participants will receive access to the ProYouth OZ website for 6 weeks allowing them to read comprehensive information on eating disorders and access the monitoring and feedback system that aims at monitoring eating disorder related symptoms and providing early minimal intervention with supportive feedback. In addition participants will have access to the online peer-to-peer support component, i.e. attending weekly 1hour moderated group chats to interact with peers for a period of 6 weeks. The chats will be delivered by a trained PhD Psychology student who has several years of experience in delivering online group chats.

Self-Monitoring
The participants will have access to the monitoring and feedback system that aims to monitor eating disorder related symptoms, to detect symptom elevation early and to provide early minimal intervention with supportive feedback. Participants can be tracked closely over time and receive supportive feedback on the four dimensions of: 1) body dissatisfaction, 2) body weight and shape concerns 3) balanced diet and nutrition 4) binges and compensatory behaviours. In the case of deterioration, messages are provided that express concern and give advice on how to counteract negative development in their eating behaviour and weight and shape attitudes. Positive feedback reinforces healthy eating behaviours and improvements. If participants report severe deterioration during this monitoring process, they automatically receive an email advising them to seek more intensive face-to-face help. 

Arm 2
Participants in this condition will receive ProYouth OZ as described above without the peer-to-peer support component.

Arm 3
The control group will be placed on the waitlist until the intervention period and the first follow-up (3 months) is complete. Then participants in the control condition will be provided with access to the program delivered to Arm 2.

Adherence to the intervention will be measured by monitoring number of logins to the program and number of attended chat sessions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project involves a three-arm randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Internet-based prevention and early intervention program ProYouth OZ in reducing weight and shape concerns and/or eating disorder symptoms in young people. An additional aim of this project is to examine whether the addition of synchronous online peer-to-peer support (i.e. Internet-based chat sessions in a group format) increases treatment effectiveness.

The project has several aims:

(1)	To examine the effectiveness of ProYouth OZ compared to a wait-list control condition on a range of outcomes including eating disorder attitudes and behaviours, barriers towards seeking help, self-esteem, symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, and social support.
(2)	To examine the effectiveness of ProYouth OZ with online peer support compared to ProYouth OZ without peer support on a range of outcomes including  eating disorder attitudes and behaviours, barriers towards seeking help, self-esteem, symptoms of depression and anxiety, quality of life, and social support.
(3)	To explore engagement, adherence and use of the online peer-to-peer support groups.
(4)	To examine and compare users satisfaction of ProYouth OZ with and without online peer support.
