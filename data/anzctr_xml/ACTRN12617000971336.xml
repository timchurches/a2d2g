  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three capsules containing 200mg of a proprietary blend of Ashwagandha (total daily dose of 600mg) will be consumed once daily for 8 weeks by healthy, overweight males aged between 40 and 70 years with mild to moderate symptoms of fatigue or reduced vitality. Adherence to capsule intake will be monitored through capsule return and count. In this crossover trial, there is no washout period between treatment arms.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated into placebo and treatment groups. These groups are named group 1 and group 2 and the primary investigator and participants will be unaware of which treatment these groups represent. Each participant will be allocated a participant number (1 to 50) based on the order of inclusion in the study. A computer-generated software will randomly assign the numbers 1 to 50 into either group 1 or 2.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In this crossover study, participants will be given an opportunity to take both Ashwagandha and placebo. This ensures we have a sample size of 50 in each group. With a predicted moderate effect size of 0.5, this study is sufficiently powered to detect group differences. 

Pre and post analyses will be conducted to determine changes in the following:
1. Total and subscale scores determined by the administration of the Ageing Males Symptoms
2. Subscale scores determined by the administration of the Profile of Mood States, Short Form
3. Change in salivary testosterone, cortisol, oestradiol, and DHEAs levels

Comparisons will be made between the periods when participants were taking a placebo versus periods on Ashwagandha to determine if there are any significant differences in the above measures. 

These analyses will be conducted via a repeated measures analysis of variance via SPSS</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study assessing the effects of Ashwagandha in 50 overweight adults presenting with mild-to-moderate symptoms of low energy/ vitality. Each participant receives both treatments (8 weeks of Ashwagandha and placebo) and randomisation is used to determine the order in which the participant receives each treatment,( i.e. Ashwagandha followed by placebo, or placebo followed by Ashwagandha ). The Ashwagandha dosage is 600mg of Ashwagandha once daily. Changes in mood, energy and vitality will be assessed via the completion of self-report measures, The effects of Ashwagandha on salivary levels of testosterone, cortisol, oestradiol, and DHEAs will also be examined.</summary>
