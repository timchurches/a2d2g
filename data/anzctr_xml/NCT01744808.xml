          5. Have clinical laboratory test results that are within the laboratory reference range;
             or if out of range are not clinically relevant and are acceptable to the Investigator
             and Sponsor medical representative

          6. Negative Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis Screening test

             medications and routine vitamins but including megadose (intake of 20 to 600 times the
             recommended daily dose) vitamin therapy within 7 days of first dosing, unless agreed
             as non-clinically relevant by the Principal Investigator and Sponsor

          3. A history of, or current evidence for, suicidal ideation, based upon clinical
             interview and a psychiatric questionnaire

          4. A history of known or suspected seizures, spasms, infantile spasms, febrile
             convulsions, unexplained significant and recent loss of consciousness or history of
             significant head trauma with loss of consciousness or a family history (first degree
             relative) of epilepsy or seizures (fits)

          5. A history of sleep problems in the last 3 months

          6. A history of relevant atopy or drug hypersensitivity

             glass (125 mL) of wine = 1 measure of spirits = Â½ pint of beer) will also be
             ineligible

          8. A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or on the day of
             admittance to the Study Unit

          9. A history of smoking in the last 3 months

         10. Have a significant infection (such as influenza) or known inflammatory process on
             screening or admission

         11. Have acute gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of screening or admission (e.g.
             nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn )

         12. Have previously received EB-1020

         13. Be vegetarians, vegans or have medical dietary restrictions

         15. Have difficulties communicating reliably with the Investigator or appear unlikely to
             co-operate with the requirements of the study in the investigator's judgment.

         16. Any other condition which in the view of the Investigator is likely to interfere with
             study or put the subject at risk.</exclusivecriteria>
