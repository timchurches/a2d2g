    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be recruited by newspaper advertising.
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria were given an MRI.
Subject with bone marrow oedema visualised on MRI are then randomised to treatment or placebo.   Allocation was determined from computer generated random numbers.  Staff members not involved in assessing trial patients or performing infusions will generate the random sequences and label the vials.  Sticky labels with subject ID will be placed on an appropriate vial (zolendronic acid or placebo) for each patient.  Allocation is therefore double blind.  Vials of zolendronic acid and placebo are identical.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study rationale: Bone marrow oedema has recently been recognized to be a key correlate of knee pain. There is no known treatment for this problem but it is very common in those over 50 (30% of a random sample of 50-80 year olds in Hobart) (Zhai, 2006). There are no randomized trials but there is some observational evidence suggesting bisphosphonates modify this process. Firstly, they are much less common in population samples using bisphosphonates (OR 0.1) (Carbone 2004) and an open label study with IV ibandronate led to rapid resolution of hip bone marrow oedema (Ringe 2004) when natural history studies in the knee do not suggest resolution. Zoledronic acid is an attractive candidate for the treatment of this condition dues to its one off administration and potential for long term efficacy</summary>
