  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjective and objective measures of low back pain and movement will be utilised in patients with chronic low back pain. 

2 ViMove sensors are placed on the patient's back by the treating physiotherapist. Physio's will receive a training session (at an early time) to ensure proper sensor placement and adherence to protocols.  1 sensor is in-line with the posterior superior iliac spine, and the other is on the thoracic spine. Both are placed according to a protocol+guide.  

Initial assessment session: Whilst wearing ViMove sensors in clinic, patients will perform a set of back extension, flexion, and lateral flexion movements. This set will be repeated 5 times. This assessment is referred to as a ViMove live low back assessment and takes approximately 10-15 minutes total. Participants do not need to do anything with the sensors, as they are attached using  disposable adhesives. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire package which contains all subjective measures.
Once the in-clinic assessments and questionnaires are completed, participants will leave the clinic whilst still wearing the sensors and will go about their day. Sensors will monitor the participants low back movements, in what is referred to as ViMove low back monitoring. Sensors will be worn for approximately 6-10 hours outside of the clinic.

Sensors can be returned directly to the clinic, or can be mailed back, This will be outlined to the participant

This same procedure (live assessment, questionnaires, monitoring) will be repeated at a follow-up date 8 weeks later.

Patients will not receive any interventions as part of this trial, and will be treated according to the management plan of their treating physician.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>N=40. As this is a pilot study to gather information to be used in a follow-up randomized study, no formal sample size calculations were undertaken. Up to 50 participants are predicted to be enrolled initially if we assume a 25% drop out between baseline and follow-up. 

An initial descriptive analysis will be completed on baseline measures of movement to ascertain mean scores, ranges and standard deviations in this population. 
Correlation analysis will be completed using a Pearsons correlation coefficient to determine if there is a relationship between ViMove data and other outcomes collected at baseline and follow-up. 
Other collected data will be used in the discussion of these primary results, as they would be in current treatment and decision making.
All findings will be deemed significant with a p value of &lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The recent availability of low cost wearable sensors provides the research community with a rich opportunity to expand knowledge about the movement and activity of both healthy people and those suffering from a range of chronic conditions. This area is of particular interest in the management of so-called lifestyle diseases where activity is encouraged as a key component of both prevention and treatment.  

This study is designed to further the understanding of  specific physical movements and activity in people with non-specific low back pain. The study will assess 40 people with low back pain on 2 separate occasions to measure a range of bio-psycho-social factors that are typically impacted by this condition. The study will develop our understanding of the relationship between these factors, specifically comparing commonly-used (but subjective) outcome measures to the objective outcomes provided by portable sensors.</summary>
