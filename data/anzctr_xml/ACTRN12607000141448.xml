    <interventions>Two intranasal treatment conditions: (1) Oxytocin Nasal Spray (24IU or 40.3mg) and (2) Placebo.                                                                                                                                        Administration at 50 mins prior to fMRI scanning procedure. There is a minimum washout period of 1 week in between 2 fMRI sessions.  The two groups, involving patients with Generalised Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD) and healthy controls, will both receive the same interventions (placebo and oxytocin) during the time span of the study, but in different sequences during the study.  All participants act as their own control due to placebo condition.  However it is also of interest to compare the group of Generalised Social Anxiety Disorder patient with a control/comparison group of healthy controls. The allocation of the conditions is blinded and randomised.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>fMRI data will be collected to investigate whether oxytocin affects the amygdala response to threatening (vs. non-threatening) facial expression processing in patients with Generalised Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD) relative to healthy controls.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The fMRI data collected 50 minutes post drug adminstration will also be used to investigate the effects of oxytocin (vs. placebo) on functional connectivity (ie. Amygdala-Brainstem, Amygdala-Insula) in patients with Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GSAD) compared to healthy controls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Functional connectivity will be investigated during the analysis using correlation analysis, which is done post data collection during data analysis. This data used is collected at 50 minutes post drug administration.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study will examine if intranasal oxytocin can modulate the neural circuitry (especially the amygdala) response to threat in patients with Generalised Social Anxiety Disorder (GSAD).  Two treatment conditions are involved: Oxytocin vs. Placebo.  Participants (20 GSAD, 20 healthy controls) are required to undergo two functional magnetic resonsonance imaging (fMRI) sessions during which they will be asked to complete two emotional facial expression tasks.  It is hypothesised that under placebo, patients with GSAD will show exaggerated amygdala activity as well as functional connectivity to threatening (i.e. angry and fearful) facial stimuli compared to healthy controls.  Under oxytocin, such effects will be absent and amgydala activation and functional connectivity during threat processing will be reduced.</summary>
