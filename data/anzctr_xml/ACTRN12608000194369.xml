    <interventions>Percutaneous Endoscopic  Gastrostomie PEG : We used the classical PEG performed by  the pull through technique in one-hand technique, our average duration of intervention was 4 minutes 30.The mean dose of Disoprivan® (Propofolum (2,6-Diisopropylphenol)  used was 85 mg.Due to the in part high risk of thromboembolic complications in our neurological and stroke patients, and in patients with internal and external cardiac support devices, we opted generally not to withdraw the thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors ASA (Aspirin®; Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) and clopidogrel (Plavix®; Bristol-Myers Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Partnership, New-York, USA) or to interrupt unfractionated heparin (UFH; Liquemin®; Hoffmann-La Roche Pharma AG, Grenzach-Whylen, Germany) prior to PEG placement. Phenprocoumone (Marcumar®; Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Grenzach-Wyhlen; Germany) was also not defined as a contraindication</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PEG placement under the thrombocyte aggregation inhibitor aspirin (acetylsalicylacid; ASA) has been considered a relative contraindication thus far according to the ASGE guidelines, aggressive antithrombotic drug regimens or clopidogrel and phenprocoumon/warfarin in patients with high risk conditions like atrial fibrillation associated with valvular heart disease, mechanical valve in the mitral position and mechanical valve and prior thromboembolic event make this a high-risk procedure. The present study addresses for the first time the risk of bleeding and general complications of PEG in patients treated concurrently with simple or aggressive regimens of mono- or combination anticoagulants. The influence of the thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors ASA and clopidogrel is studied alone or in combination with low-molecular weight or unfractionated heparin or phenproucumone using a modified pull-through technique.</summary>
