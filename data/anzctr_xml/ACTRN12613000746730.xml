    <interventions>If you participate in this study you will have two different types of scans as well as a single stereotactic body radiotherapy session (SBRT). The two types of scans we are researching are called a four-dimensional positron emission tomography (4D-PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) perfusion scan. 
Both scans are slow and recorded along with your breathing, which allows us to see how much your organs move as you breathe in and out. Each 4D-PET scan is broken down into many separate scans, each showing where your organs and the cancer are at a specific point of your breathing, for example, just as you start breathing in. For us to know whether you are breathing in or out, we will monitor your chest movement using breathing equipment. This will be done by either putting a belt around your chest or abdomen which senses your breathing, or a small lightweight reflective box on your chest and watch this using a special camera in the room. Both devices can tell us at which part of your breathing cycle each CT or PET image was taken, so we can make sets of images from each phase. Either device can be used during your scan, and this will depend on the particular machine on which you have your scan taken. The CT perfusion scan is similar to a standard CT scan, but is taken over a longer period of time with more contrast. This allows us to record the flow of contrast and blood flow into the cancer.  
Specifically, the research involves:
1.  Before treatment, you will have a four-dimensional positron emission tomography (4D-PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) perfusion scan, as a baseline.
2. After treatment, you will have another 4D-PET scan and a CT perfusion scan at day 14 and day 70. These will be compared with the first scans in order to assess how your cancer responded to the treatment. Each scan will take approximately 30 minutes of time.
The stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment itself will routinely involve a third type of scan: a cone-beam CT. This scan is performed on the treatment machine, and is used to make the treatment more precise.
Specifically, the stereotactic radiotherapy treatment involves as standard: 
3. Prior to treatment whilst being set-up on the treatment machine, a cone-beam CT will be used to check the position of the cancer. This will be repeated immediately before the treatment and again mid-way through the treatment (a total of 3 cone-beam CTs). 
4. A single high-precision, high-dose radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment directed against the cancer. The treatment is a 26Gy single fraction. The treatment will take approximately 60 minutes.
Follow-up will involve a visit at approximately 2.5 to 3 months, and then at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months from treatment. Participation in this study will involve no extra cost due to either having these scans or the treatment.

    <statisticalmethods>The study sample size is pragmatic and is based on the accrual rate necessary to successfully complete a larger study powered to assess the superiority of FDG-PET over standard CT in the response assessment of stereotactic radiotherapy of the lung.  

We estimate that the accrual rate from this pilot will be slower than at the time of activating the larger proposed study. This is because referral patterns have yet to be established for this novel treatment that has only now become available in this country. We estimate that the accrual of 5-10 patients within 9 months at this early stage of the implementation of SBRT in this country will likely be sufficient to ensure adequate accrual to meet a target of at least 34 patients within 3 years. 

      The sample size for the larger study was calculated on the postulated superiority of post-therapy FDG-PET over post-therapy standard CT in predicting for overall survival. We estimate our event rate to be 45% at 2 years. The larger study trial timeline indicates that patients will have a mean follow-up of 3 years at the final analysis. Hazard ratios of the ability of FDG-PET to predict for overall survival in the presence of CT have been derived from our own institutional data in the setting of NSCLC .
   The following assumptions are made for the purposes of performing the power calculation.
1.The hazard ratio for PET response when used in isolation to predict overall survival is consistent with that reported previously from our institution (i.e. HR ~= 3.1) 
2.The hazard ratio for CT response when used in isolation to predict overall survival is similarly consistent with that reported in the same publication (i.e. HR ~= 2.3) 
3.The strength of the association between PET response and CT response is also consistent with that reported in the same publications. 

   With a sample size of 45, and allowing for a type I error rate of 0.05, software simulations show that the power to conclude that PET adds significant prognostic value when used in addition to CT is equal to approximately 0.90. If accrual does not meet expected targets, then the study will still be powered to significance with 34 patients (~0.80).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an new form of cancer treatment involving highly precise radiotherapy. SBRT appears to be very effective in controlling cancer. After the treatment is given, however, with standard scans we have not been able to reliably assess how well the treatment worked. We propose to research SBRT with state-of-the-art scanning tools in patients with cancer spread to the lung. We aim to better understand how cancer responds to this therapy. This is the first step of the research, and is a small pilot study. The pilot is designed to assess whether the research can be completed. 
Who is it for? 
This trial is for patients who have cancer which has spread to the lung. We aim to enrol ten patients in total to participate in the research. These patients will be invited through Peter MacCallum at East Melbourne.
