  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical study is a phase IIa, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate two doses of orally administered
      GLPG2222 in adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CF harbouring one F508del CFTR
      mutation and a second gating (class III) mutation and on stable treatment with ivacaftor.

      Up to 35 evaluable subjects are planned to be included in the study. Eligible subjects must
      be on stable treatment with physician prescribed ivacaftor (Kalydeco®) for at least 28 days
      at the baseline visit. They will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive one of two active
      doses of GLPG2222 (150 mg q.d. or 300 mg q.d.) or placebo q.d. administered for 29 days.
      Subjects will be in the study for a minimum of 6 weeks and a maximum of 10 weeks, from
      screening until the follow-up visit.</summary>
