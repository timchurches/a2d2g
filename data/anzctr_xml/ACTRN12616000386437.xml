  <interventions>
    <interventions>Deep dry needling on ankle joint stability muscles involves using a needle to reach the target muscle looking for obtaining changes in the muscle recruitment measured in terms of electromyography and outcomes of centre of pressures. The target muscles will be fibularis longus and tibialis anterior muscles. Both of them will be palpated with flat technique and needle will be inserted (a) perpendicular to skin surface in a lateral to medial direction toward the fibula bone for fibularis longus muscle; and (b) whith a slight medial direction toward the tibia for tibialis anterior muscle. The needle will remain for a maximum of 2 minutes while the multiple rapid insertions technique is applied in order to obtain sharp pain, referred pain or local twitch. Treatment will be administered by trained physiotherapists and will be developed in a single 10 minute session, including patient preparation and muscle evaluation before dry needling as well as ischemic compression applied after treatment. Measures will be obtained four times: just before and after the dry needling application, 48 hours and 1 month after intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo dry needling involves using a placebo needle which will not penetrate the target muscles. The needle will rest on skin surface above fibularis longus and tibialis anterior muscles for a maximum of 2 minutes pretending to apply multiple rapid insertions techique. Sharp pain, referred pain and local twitch are not expected to occur. Treatment will be administered by trained physiotherapists and will be developed in a single 10 minute session, including patient preparation and muscle evaluation before placebo dry needling as well as ischemic compression applied after treatment. Measures will be obtained four times: just before and after the dry needling application, 48 hours and 1 month after intervention.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>For sample size calculation, fibularis longus muscle reaction time was considered as the primary outcome and the software GPower 3.0.18 was employed. An effect size (f) of 0.25 was considered, Assuming 0.5 as the value of correlation among repeated measures, 0.5 as the value of nonsphericity correction (E); and establishing a 0.80 statistic power, alpha level of 0.05 and 2 groups in which 4 measurements will be accomplished, a total of 24 participants were obtained. The follow-up loss was assumed to be about 15%, and a total of 28 participants will be necessary, 14 participants per group.   

Data will be organized and analyzed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS ) version 20.0 for Windows.
Previously to statistical analysis a study of dependent variables normality will be realized in order to determine the type of tests (parametric or non-parametric) to carry out subsequently. For this, the Shapiro- Wilk test will be used. For a value of Sig .
over 0.05, variables will be considered to be distributed normally. For a Sig value of
Sig . less than 0.05 il will be necessary to take into account the sample size to determine whether the assumption of parametric assumptions infringement is tolerable.

The descriptive statistical analysis of data obtained will be expressed with mean and standard deviation (SD) in case variables match normality. Median and interquartile range will be used in case that variables do not match normality. Qualitative variables wil be expressed as absolute frequencies and percentages.

Then, homogeneity / initial contrast of the two observed groups will be checked on sex, age and pretest results of the dependent variables. In the case of sex variable, homogeneity will be checked using the Pearson's Chi -squared test. After that, either Mann-Whitney U test, Student T test or Welch's T test will be realized for age. 

Finally an analysis of the contrast between the values obtained in the pre versus post test values as well as contrast between groups will be developed by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test or paired-samples T test.

All statistical data will consider a confidence interval (CI) of 95 %.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective of this study is to determine whether dry needling of myofascial trigger points on the muscles of ankle joint improves recruitment pattern and muscle reaction time as well as motor control in basketball players suffering from functional ankle instability.

The results of this study aim to propose a fast, inexpensive and effective therapy for the treatment of this type of injury in basketball players. 
Subjects included in the final sample will have to meet some inclusion and exclusion criteria such as: playing basketball, history of, at least, 1 significant ankle sprain, history of previous twist ("giving away") episodes, recurrent sprains and/or feeling of ankle joint instability; as well as confirming confirming the absence of any surgery on the lower limbs or lower limbs injuries occurred in the previous three months, vestibular and neurological disorders and feeling pain in other areas at the same time of evaluation.

Sample will be divided into two groups and subjects will be randomly assigned to any of them. The first group will receive a dry needling in two muscles of the leg (fibularis longus and tibialis anterior muscles) and another group (control group or placebo group) will receive a placebo dry needling. In this case, the needle will not reach the target muscles, but it will only stay on skin surface. 

Electromyograpic outcomes will be assessed together with motor control tests, by using a centre of pressures measurement platform. This tasks will be performed just before and inmediately, 48 hours and 1 month after intervention.  

Data will include: muscle reaction time and recruitment pattern of the mentioned muscles as well as displacement area, displacement velocity of the centre of pressures and sway varibility. Finally subjects daily life tasks related to foot and ankle dysfunctions will be assessed, but in this case, a validated questionnare before the intervention and after the last assessment will be used. This questionnare is known as Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM).
