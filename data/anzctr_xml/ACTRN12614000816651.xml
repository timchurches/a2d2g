  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to either the treatment or wait-list control condition after completing a diagnostic interview and relevant psychometric measures. The current intervention protocol will be based on Gawrysiak et al.s (2009) modification of the revised Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD-R) protocol, in which they condensed central components of the 10-session intervention into one 90-minute treatment session that includes psychoeducation on depression, treatment rationale, a life values assessment, setting weekly activity goals, and discussing ways the participant can monitor and modify weekly goals. The treatment interval is two weeks, during which time the participant will engage in scheduled activities and complete monitoring forms. Participants will complete the psychometric measures at the end of the two-week treatment interval and again at three-month follow-up.

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis using G*power was calculated to determine the number of participants required for an 80% probability of capturing a moderate interaction (i.e., f =.25) between group (intervention, control) and time (pre-test, post-test). According to G*Power, approximately 48 participants will be required (24 in each group). This was determined at an adjusted Bonferroni level of .0125. 

Hypotheses will be tested with a series of Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). In order to optimise the likelihood of convergence, the GLMMs will be be tested separately for each of the outcome measures. To control for inflation of familywise errorrate, as a result of analysing each outcome independently of other, each GLMM will be evaluated at a Bonferroni adjusted alpha-level of .0125</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study aims to assess the efficacy of a single 90-minute session of a Brief Behavioural Activation for Depression (BATD) intervention in treating depressive symptoms in adults. BATD is a single-component intervention that increases access to environmental reward to improve mood. Treatment efficacy will be assessed by comparing outcome measures of a treatment group to a wait-list control group at pre-intervention and post-intervention. It is hypothesised that the treatment group will show significant reductions in self-reported depressive symptoms, as well as increases on measures of environmental reward and valued living, relative to the wait-list control group. It is hypothesised that these gains will be maintained at three-month follow-up.</summary>
