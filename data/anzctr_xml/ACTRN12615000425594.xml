  <interventions>
    <interventions>Relative motion extension (RME) splinting employs two components; a volar static wrist extension orthosis and a digital orthosis in the manner of a yoke. 
Within the first 10 days post-surgery a Hand Therapy appointment is arranged and administered with a Physiotherapist or Occupational Therapist with 3 years or more Hand Therapy training, and the RME digital and wrist orthoses (splints) along with a resting pan night splint are fitted. The resting pan splint is worn every night throughout the 8-9 week intervention period. 
During Week 1-3 the RME digital splint and the wrist splint are worn together during waking hours. Participants are instructed to actively flex and extend their fingers as far as they can within the confines of the day time splints 10-20 times every 2 hours and use their hand for light functional activities.
During Week 4-5 digital splinting and mobilisation continues as for Week 1-3, however participants are instructed to remove the wrist component only and mobilise the wrist from extension to flexion in a tenodesis pattern 10 times every two hours. When full wrist range of motion is achieved, the wrist orthosis is discontinued for most of the time and only worn for heavy activity.
Week 6-9: Participants are instructed to wear the finger component only during activity, and to remove the orthosis for active finger flexion and extension 10 times every hour. 
When full finger (active) range of motion is achieved, the finger orthosis is discontinued.  

In order to optimise retention and adherence to intervention protocols, participants will be provided with petrol vouchers in recognition of the costs of attending the two follow-up assessments. Petrol vouchers will be provided at the rate of $20 for each assessment attended. In addition, for participants who live more than 20 km from the study locality and the follow-up assessment does not coincide with a follow-up Hand Therapy or Surgical appointment (and the participant is not eligible for Accident Compensation Corporation  travel costs), petrol vouchers will be provided at the rate of 50c per km travelled. 

Adherence to splinting will be evaluated using a participant questionnaire completed retrospectively at 6-weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Dynamic extension splinting employs a dynamic forearm based orthosis to allow early digital motion while protecting the repaired extensor tendons.
Within the first 10 days post-surgery a Hand Therapy appointment is arranged and administered with a Physiotherapist or Occupational Therapist with 3 years or more Hand Therapy training, and the dynamic extensor splint (wrist in 30 degrees extension; injured digit and adjacent MCP joints rest in neutral) and pan resting splint are fitted. The resting pan splint is worn every night throughout the 8 week intervention period. 
During Week 1-3 the dynamic extensor splint is worn during waking hours. Participants are instructed to 1) actively flex the finger at the MCP joints 30-40 degrees, allowing the extensor outrigger to passively return the MCP joints to 0 degrees and 2) flex and extend the IP joints as far as comfortable within the confines of the splint. Participants are instructed to perform the exercises 10-20 times each waking hour.
During Week 4-5, exercise 1) above is progressed by 10-20 degrees per week, unless an extensor lag appears.  Participants are also instructed to remove the dynamic extensor splint every 2 hours to actively flex and extend the IP joints as far as comfortable and to mobilise the wrist from neutral to extension in a tenodesis pattern. Participants are instructed to perform the exercises 10-20 times each waking hour.
Week 6-8: The dynamic extensor splint is discontinued.

    <statisticalmethods> A clinically significant difference for TAM has not been established in the literature. A trial by Mowlavi et al (2005) found a statistically significant difference of 16% at 6 weeks between dynamic extension splinting (239 +/- 22) and immobilization (206 +/- 53). This is plausably a clinically significant difference as immobilization is assumed to be an inferior treatment compared with either splinting option, thus is appropriate for use as an inferiority boundary. Assuming 16% difference in TAM is clinically significant, this requires a sample size of 17 participants per group to give 90% power using 1-sided p-values significant at the 5% level, appropriate for a primary non-inferiority and secondary superiority research question (Haynes 2006). This is a conservative estimate, as immobilization typically has greater variability (SD) than either splinting option. Allowing for a plausible drop-out of 20%, this equates to 19 participants in each group or a total of 38 participants. 
Participant characteristic variables will be presented to assess the baseline comparability of the two groups. Descriptive statistics will be presented for each group with the mean value (standard deviation, 95% confidence interval) for outcomes at each time point. As the outcome of multiple extensor tendon repairs in one hand cannot be considered as independent observations, the mean TAM scores for patients (rather than for individual digits) will be calculated and compared between the two groups. Differences in mean values between groups will be compared using regression analysis, carried out at the 5% level of significance. Primary analysis of the data will follow the intention to treat principle and will include all participants, including those who have missing data and who are not fully adherent to the protocol. The handling of missing data will be through the use of the multiple imputation method. 
Cost analysis will include both health system and societal resource costs. The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-utility analysis based on EQ-5D-3L score index value.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Relative motion extension (RME) splinting is a new method of rehabilitation for extensor tendon repair that is simpler and easier than the current well-established early mobilisation treatment of dynamic extension splinting, however to date no studies have directly compared the two. 
This study aims to compare range of motion and functional outcomes, patient adherence and satisfaction, and complication rates between groups at 6 and 12 weeks after surgery, and to compare the cost-effectiveness of the two treatment methods. 
Up to 38 consenting participants with extensor tendon repair in zones V and VI (on the back of the hand) involving up to three fingers will be recruited from the Dunedin Hospital Orthopaedic service and randomised to either RME or dynamic splinting. Participants will be partially-blinded by not revealing to them the study hypothesis in full; independent hand therapists blinded to group allocation will assess outcomes at 6- and 12 weeks. Differences in mean values between groups will be compared using regression analysis carried out at the 5% level of significance, following the intention to treat principle. Cost analysis will be on a health utility basis.  
A finding of significantly better outcomes and/or cost-effectiveness with RME will result in practise change locally and internationally. Information from this study will help to avoid unnecessary time off work and the associated loss of wages and productivity, minimise the cost and burden of splinting, and improve outcomes. The incidence of extensor tendon injury in zones V and VI of the hand appears to be higher in Maori and Pacific people and therefore findings of this study are likely to be of particular significance to this population.
