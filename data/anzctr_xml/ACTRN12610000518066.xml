  <interventions>
    <interventions>Laser vapourization of prostate (PVP) compared to TURP.  PVP uses a 120W green light laser to vapourize prostate tissue to create an opening to allow an improved urinary flow.  The procedure takes between 30 and 80 minutes.  There is very little bleeding and saline can be used to washout the bladder.</interventions>
    <comparator>TURP is the long established "gold standard" to improve urinary flow blocked by an enlarged prostate.  An electrical current is used to remove chips of prostate.  Whilst generally quicker than PVP there are risks of bleeding and fluid absorption.  Saline cannot be used as an irrigant as it will not allow the passage of an electrical current.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PVP is a new procedure that may one day be able to replace TURP as the main treatment for men with benign prostate enlargement.  There has only ever been one randomized controlled trial of PVP with TURP and this was using the now outdated 80W model.  Recent advice from the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has stated that PVP should only be used in the context of randomized controlled trials. We intend to assess whether the procedure has long term benefits for patients and whether it is cost efective for health providers.</summary>
