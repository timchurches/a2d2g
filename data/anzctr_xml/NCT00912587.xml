  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ghrelin is a newly discovered peptide that is secreted by the stomach. Its main role is to
      stimulate food intake but recent studies indicate that it also acts on the cardiovascular
      system to confer beneficial effects. The mechanism of action is unclear but experimental
      studies suggest that ghrelin decreases the sympathetic nervous system. Beside there is new
      evidence in animal models that ghrelin may also be involved in stress reaction as ghrelin
      injection seems to protect against symptoms of stress. Given that circulating levels of
      ghrelin are reduced in obesity, this suggests that the effect of ghrelin may differ between
      lean and obese subjects. Ghrelin could represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for the
      treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the study if to gain more knowledge of the
      effect of ghrelin on the sympathetic nervous system and stress reactivity in both lean and
      obese subjects.</summary>
