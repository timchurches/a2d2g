  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were treated with the combination of the nail spicules cutting technique and the orthonyxia technique using polyethylene sheet. The intervention was carried out by a qualified podiatrist (researcher). The investigator had to cut the nail straight at the level of hyponychium. Then the researcher had to measure the nail width for patients receiving the intervention treatment (orthonyxia). The nail spicules cutting technique consisted of the removal of the portion of the nail that causes onychocryptosis, with the intention of releasing it from the soft parts. Using a number 15 scalpel or fine tip pliers this portion of the nail is then removed. This treatment was carried out at least on one occasion for all subjects enrolled into the study. If onychocryptosis recurred during the study period (12 months) the same procedure was performed again. The subjects were informed about making local cures with povidone-iodine once a day for a week. The orthonyxia technique consisted of the application of a flat polyethylene sheet of 0.5 millimeters in thickness which was glued onto the nail with cyanoacrylate. These sheets were replaced at three timepoints at minimum, baseline, 2, and 4 months. In case of accidental detachment or in case of appearing recurrence of onychocryptosis a new orthonyxia sheet was applied. Nail width measurement was performed at baseline, at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The recurrence of the symptomatology of onychocryptosis (dichotomous nominal qualitative variable) has been measured objectively by direct observation of the own researcher and subjective form by the patient who had to notify the investigator at the time in which reappeared the symptomatology.</outcome>

      <outcome>The variable number of onychocryptosis recurrences (quantitative discrete variable) was created to account for the variable recurrence, and to evaluate the success rate of the two techniques used in the study. It has been measured using a scale of discrete quantitative measurement (0 recurrence, 1, 2, 3, 4...)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Since the beginning of the study up to 6 months (treatment period) and from 6 up to 12 months (follow-up period) and it has obtained the global number of onychocryptosis recurrences (total recurrences) computation by adding recurrence found in each of the periods.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The variable width nail (quantitative continuous), has been used to evaluate the effectiveness of the technique of orthonyxia in the case of the study group, i.e., has been used to justify the change in blade nail or correction of the same.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample was calculated with an standard deviation equal to 1.5388, alpha equal to 0.05, beta equal to 0.01, the minimum interest of nail width difference equal to 1.3 mm., resulting in 43 patients for each group intervention. It was decided to include more subjects in each group to contemplate the possiility of usual "experimental death" in the investigations.
It is planned to used in the study of the statistical analysis the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0, a descriptive analysis of the data and an inferential analysis (the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine the normality of variables, non-parametric tests: Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon T test, and the Pearson correlation test for the study of the reliability of the measures).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial in patients with onychocryptosis in stage I and IIA on nails with pathological curvatures, which aims to determine and compare the effectiveness of the nail spicules cutting technique and the combination of the nail spicules cutting technique with the orthonyxia technique, as well as quantify the width change nail which is achieved with the orthonyxia technique. It was established as a hypothesis, that the treatment of onychocryptosis combining the orthonyxia technique with the nail spicules cutting technique, presents one lower rate of recurrence than the nail spicules cutting technique alone and that the use of the orthonyxia technique has the ability to significantly correct the pathological curvature of the nail plate.</summary>
