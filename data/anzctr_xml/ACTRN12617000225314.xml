    <interventions>A quasi-experimental, randomised controlled trial
Individual one-on-one meeting was used in all educations. Educations were given by a researcher (expert nurse)  into an appropriate room for hospital.  A Pregnancy Educational Booklet on Gestational Hypertension designed according to RAM was used in all education. 
RAM was used in the implementation of the study. According to this model, individuals are systems that adapt themselves by interacting with constantly changing environmental stimuli. RAM distinguishes the environmental stimuli that impact the individual under three headings. Focal stimuli are stimuli that the individual is in immediate contact with, contextual stimuli are other stimuli that have positive or negative effects on the focal stimuli, and residual stimuli, which always have an effect on the individual but consist of internal or external factors that cannot fully be explained. The individual uses these stimuli as coping mechanisms and responds to them with his/her behavior. Four domains of adaptation have been defined in order to assess behavior in the model. In the physiologic domain, adaptation involves maintaining the physical integrity of the system. The self-concept domain is related to basic needs that are needed to maintain psychological integrity, such as body image and self-concept. The role function domain consists of the roles that are needed to maintain social integrity, such as being a mother or father. The interdependence domain involves developing and maintaining relationships with individuals and nurturing these relationships with social support.
RAM classifies behavioral responses in these modes of adaptation as adaptive or non-adaptive. Nursing diagnoses are defined after non-adaptive behavior is determined and then interventions are planned accordingly. Here, the nursing intervention is the education provided that addresses the non-adaptive behavior in the four domains of adaptation. The nurse then makes another assessment to track the effects of the intervention. If the individual develops an adaptive behavior, the nursing intervention has been effective; if non-adaptive behavior has developed, the intervention is considered to have been ineffective.
This study is based on RAM's four modes of adaptation. The material prepared for the education related to the (1) physiologic domain included information on the development of pregnancy, the physiological changes occurring during pregnancy, hypertensive illnesses, daily life activities and the effects of gestational hypertension on pregnancy. (2) Related to the self-concept domain, the material included the effects of pregnancy and gestational hypertension on self-concept (body image and thoughts about how to cope with gestational hypertension). (3) With regard to the role function domain, the material included the effects of pregnancy and gestational hypertension on the role functions of the pregnant woman. (4) In the interdependence domain, the materials were focused on the importance of significant people and support systems in the pregnant women's life in terms of the pregnancy and gestational hypertension. 
The educational booklet was prepared in a manner that encompassed the four modes of adaptation described in RAM. The first section of the educational booklet dealt with the physiologic mode, containing information on the start of pregnancy, the physiological changes taking place in the pregnant women, hypertensive illnesses, activities of daily life and the effect of gestational hypertension on pregnancy.  In the second section, which dealt with self-concept, the impact of pregnancy and gestational hypertension on self-concept was discussed. In the third section covering the role function mode, the material included the effects of pregnancy and gestational hypertension on the role functions of the pregnant woman. Lastly, in the section on the interdependence mode, the material was focused on the importance of significant people and support systems in the pregnant woman's life in terms of the pregnancy and gestational hypertension.
Educational sessions were held with the pregnant women in the education group five times in their Weeks 20-24 of their pregnancy, once in their 30th-34th weeks, a total of six times. 
in their Weeks 20-24 of their pregnancy which individual coaching was provided on how to cope with the stimuli causing the non-adaptive behavior that had been previously determined by means of the Educational Booklet. Although the goal in this model-based education was to diminish or eliminate the impact of the stimuli that caused the non-adaptive behavior, if behaviors or stimuli could not be changed, developing a positive perception became the objective. At the educational sessions, five sessions were held--two sessions to cover the physiologic mode, and one session each for the other modes of adaptation (self-concept, role functions and interdependence). The sessions each took approximately 20-40 minutes. Additionally, behavior changes proposed to be achieved until the next visit that would improve the pregnant women's adaptation to pregnancy and to illness during pregnancy were planned and an Education Booklet was given to the women. 
in their 30th-34th weeks of their pregnancy which education was provided by means of the Education Booklet on areas of adaptation where problems were experienced, after which planning was carried out for the next meeting to facilitate behavior changes that could improve adaptation to pregnancy and prenatal illnesses. This  educational session took approximately 30-40 minutes. 
Log of session was used to monitor adherence to the intervention.

    <comparator>The meetings with the pregnant women in the control group were held in Weeks 20-24 and 30-34 of the pregnancy and on the first and second days after the birth. At the first meeting the pregnant women were invited into a suitable room and, using the face-to-face interviewing method, the Informed Consent Form, the Identifying Characteristics Form and the PSEQ-AP were filled out, after which the women were given routine care. In addition, the pregnant women were asked to have their blood pressure measured and recorded once a week over the period of the study. At the second meeting, the researcher filled out the PSEQ--AP and Gestational Hypertension Prognosis Form. At the third meeting, the Gestational Hypertension Prognosis and the Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes Evaluation Forms were administered.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim. The purpose of the research was to analyze the impact of prenatal education based on the Roy Adaptation Model on gestational hypertension, adaptation to pregnancy and on maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Backgraund. Studies show that education provided during pregnancy have a positive effect on learning about pregnancy, on daily life activities and individual health management.  
Design. This research was carried out as a quasi-experimental study.
Methods. The study was conducted over the period October 2013 - July 2015. The convenience sampling method was used to recruit 68 women into the education group and 64 into the control group, a total of 132 women with gestational hypertension.
Results. In the second monitoring, 16.2% of the pregnant women in the education and 57.8% of the women in the control group had developed severe preeclampsia. The mean score of the education group on the Prenatal Self-reporting Scale-Acceptance of Pregnancy Subscale was higher than in the control group and statistical analysis indicated that this difference was significant. In the third monitoring, it was seen that there were higher percentages of women in the education group who had no preeclampsia and mild preeclampsia than in the control group but the rates of severe preeclampsia were lower.
Conclusion. The study revealed that the education based on the Roy Adaptation Model had a positive impact on the prognosis for gestational hypertension, the adaptation to pregnancy and on maternal outcomes, but showed no effect on neonatal outcomes.
