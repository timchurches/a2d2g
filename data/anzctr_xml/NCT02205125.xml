  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Removal of polyps at colonoscopy reduces colon cancer. Snare polypectomy is the conventional
      method for removal however the snared area after removal can occasionally appear uneven
      raising the possibility that complete removal has not occurred. The significance of this
      irregularity has not be studied. This study aims to separately sample the irregular area and
      determine the constituents while recording how frequently this occurs during routine
      colonoscopy and polypectomy. We hypothesize that the irregular areas are submucosal tissue
      and do not represent polyp tissue left behind.</summary>
