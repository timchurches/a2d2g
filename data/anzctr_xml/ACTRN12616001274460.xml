  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will be involved in the evaluation of the changes associated with the new practice that will be implemented in the hospital. However, the new practice will be conducted by the hospital and we will no be not involved in the intervention phase. In each of the two stages we will recruit 200 participants to evaluate their level of mobility. All eligible participants will be invited to participate.  The new practice will include brochures that explain the importance of in hospital mobility that will distribute by the nurses, encouragement to walk by the nursing assistants, marks on the floor of meters (to acknowledge the patients of distance walked) and record mobility in the medical records by the medical and nursing team.     </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional decline post hospitalization is a common condition among older adults regardless their initial diagnosis. Several studies shows that in hospital mobility level is a modifiable factor however most studies that addressed mobility did not relay on the hospital resources and local changes of practice. The current study aims to evaluate whether practice changes can increase patients' mobility during hospitalization and thus improve their function at discharge.      </summary>
