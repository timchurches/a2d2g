    <interventions>THVD-102, a combination of oxybutynin (7.5mg) and pilocarpine (7.5mg).

Run-In phase: open label Oxybutynin (5mg) twice daily for 21 days.  
Double blind treatment periods: 3 treatment periods of 21 days where participants receive either of the following: THVD-102 administered twice daily as an oral capsule; Oxybutynin 7.5mg administered twice daily as an oral capsule; or Placebo administered twice daily as an oral capsule.  Participants are randomised to one of the three doses for 21 days, and then cross-over to either of the two treatments for 21 days, with each treatment period preceding a washout period of at least 7 days.  

Each participant will complete the run-in phase plus each of the 3 different treatment periods.

An IP dosing diary will be provided to participant to assist with compliance and dosing monitoring. </interventions>
    <comparator>In the double blind phase the comparator is oxybutynin 7.5mg twice daily versus THVD-102 versus placebo.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study will assess the safety and effectiveness of a THVD-102 which is a combination of 2 currently marketed drugs, oxybutynin (7.5mg) and pilocarpine (7.5mg). 

The study will investigate if oxybutynin and delayed release pilocarpine together will reduce or eliminate the dry mouth side effect, whilst still reducing the symptoms of hyperhidrosis

This study will look at how effective THVD-102 is in reducing excessive sweating, as well as how safe and tolerable it is compared with either oxybutynin by itself or a placebo.</summary>
