  <interventions>
    <interventions>Survey administered by mail. Survey includes questions about readmission, subsequent strokes, and the EQ5D (used to measure the health-related quality of life dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The Survey is sent with a Reply Paid Envelope; survey must be returned within 2 weeks of receiving it. If not received after this, the survey is re-delivered (maximum of 3 surveys mailed).</interventions>
    <comparator>Survey administered by telephone. Survey includes questions about readmission, subsequent strokes, and the EQ5D (used to measure the health-related quality of life dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The survey is administered by a health professional, and it takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. Only one survey is administered; three telephone calls to obtain a response are made prior to counting the participant as incomplete.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective randomized trial of the method of follow-up: cases registered in a national registry who were 3-months post-stroke receive the survey by mail or telephone. Data included collection of stroke and re-hospitalisation rates, and health-related quality of life. Response rates, time to response, and completeness of data were compared. Factors potentially associated with the outcome were explored.</summary>
