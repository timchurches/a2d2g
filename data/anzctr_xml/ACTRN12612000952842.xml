  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>This bioavailability trial represents an initial investigation  in healthy volunteers to determine the potential of gamma-glutamylcysteine (GGC) to augment cellular glutathione levels.   Glutathione depletion is associated with numerous age related disorders.</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>On separate days with a one week washout, participants will receive single oral doses of gamma-glutamylcysteine (GGC) at either 2,000 mg (plus 2,000 mg glucose placebo) or 4,000 mg, packaged in 1,000 mg caplets.  Participants will be from three equal sexed groups aged 20-25; 45-55; and 65-80 years of age. For each treatment, blood samples will be taken, via a venous cannula,  before dosing and at 90 minute intervals for the following 6 hours after GGC administration. White blood cells will be isolated from the blood and assayed for glutathione content.</interventions>
    <comparator>The experimental design will involve a randomized double blind crossover group, dose comparison procedure.  To mask the dosage level, all patients will receive gamma-glutamylcysteine at double blinded doses of 2,000 mg (plus 2,000 mg glucose placebo) and 4,000 mg in indistinguishable 1,000 mg caplets.  The control for each participant will be the initial pre-dose glutathione levels.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The lymphocytes will be isolated from blood samples using the Ficoll Paque PLUS based method. Following isolation the lymphocytes will be purified and counted using an automated cell sorter with morphology based gating to dispense 10^6 cells per well (96 well microtitre plate) in triplicate.  The cells will be lysed and assayed using a Promega glutathione assay kit (luciferase based luminescence detection).</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be volunteers who are friends, family or colleagues of the researchers who are familiar with the research and the potential health benefits of GGC. 

Each of the three groups will be assigned a random letter by  "drawing out of a hat" a card labelled either A, B, or C.

Each of the six participants in each group will be assigned a number by "drawing out of a hat" a card with a number ranging 1-6. (e.g. an individual's code may be A3, B6 or C2)

For each group, participants receiving 4,000 mg as the first dosage in the trial will draw a “x” out of a hat containing three cards labelled "x"  and three cards labelled with "y". Those drawing the "y" will receive the 2,000 mg GGC and 2,000 mg glucose placebo as their first dose (examples of individual allocation codes are A3x, B6y or C2x).  

After the one week wash out period, the participants will receive the opposite dosages. 

These allocations will be performed by a technically trained UNSW staff member not involved in the research aspects of the trial.  This person will also be responsible for overseeing the administration of the caplets and assigning each participant (and their allocation code) a random letter (a - o) for researchers to record analytical results.  The allocation table will be concealed from the researchers until the completion of the trial and associated glutathione analyses.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gamma glutamylcysteine (GGC) is commonly found in many foods, such as garlic and whey, which are anecdotally associated with numerous health benefits.  GGC can potentially be used by the body to synthesise the commonly termed master antioxidant glutathione, which is responsible for protecting our cells from oxidative stress and for the elimination of toxins.  As we age our bodys capacity to produce sufficient glutathione progressively declines leaving us vulnerable to many age related diseases and disorders.   In this study, we will investigate whether oral administered GGC can be of benefit in increasing the glutathione content in blood cells in young. mature and aged populations.</summary>
