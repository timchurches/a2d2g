  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether relaxation massage therapy is effective
      in reducing the levels of arousal and aggression on a young adult inpatient unit. It is
      hypothesised that relaxation massage therapy will lead to a lower incidence of violence and
      aggression on the ward via a reduction in the level of arousal and anxiety among inpatients.</summary>
