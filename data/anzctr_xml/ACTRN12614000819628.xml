  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective observational study of adult novices with no prior exposure to ultrasonography training or teaching. Baseline testing of novices' innate visuospatial ability will be performed using validated assessment tools of visuospatial performance, including components of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, the Vanderberg and Kuse Mental Rotations Test, and the Thurston and Jeffrey Flexibility of Closure Test. All of these tests are desktop paper and pencil, or manipulation of wooden blocks to construct shapes, and administered by a trained neuropsychologist. 
After watching a short didactic instruction 15 minute video, novices are next taken to a human volunteer and asked to perform non-invasive ultrasonography of the brachial plexus from neck to axilla. Image quality, smoothness of ultrasound scanning, and ability to obtain standardised images will be assessed using an objective scoring form by Assessors, who are experts in sonography.
The assessment of visuospatial ability and scoring of performance will take a weekend. </interventions>
    <comparator>Experts in ultrasonography of the brachial plexus (those performing at least 50 cases per year) will also be administered the visuospatial assessment tools, and be asked to perform the same sonography task on the same human volunteer. Experts' performance on the task will be assessed using the same objective scoring form by the same Assessors. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Endpoints are individual scores in the visuospatial tests of the different domains. Performance in the sonography task is recorded as a time taken to complete, individual item scores on the objective assessment tool, and a composite performance score. Linear mixed models will be used to model each sonographic outcome. Variables in these models include expertise and the visuospatial baseline measurements. Based on the mixed models, we will compare the sonographic performance between novices and experts , and between higher and lower visuospatial ability.
No previous study has been conducted in anaesthesia or radiology examining the visuospatial ability in ultrasound imaging. However, based on other studies in surgical laparoscopic skills and gastroenterlological endoscopy skills, novices were strongly discriminated in ability based on small sample sizes &lt;30 participants. It is thought that in early uptake of new hand-eye coordination skills, visuospatial ability is dominant in learning. A sample size of 30 was chosen for this observational study for reasons of feasibility.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>  Ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia (UGRA) is a complex procedural task that anaesthetists must learn. UGRA has been shown to have greater efficacy and safety than other nerve block localisation techniques and is thus the standard of care for performing peripheral nerve blockade. 
  Task deconstruction reveals that bimanual dexterity, hand-eye coordination and sonographic interpretation are some of the skills necessary for performance of UGRA. There is likely to be a correlation with visuospatial aptitude (defined as the ability to generate, retain and manipulate abstract visual images) and superior performance in UGRA in novices. 
  This study aims to evaluate the importance of visuospatial aptitude on the performance of UGRA in both novices and experts and which domains of visual perception are most closely linked to UGRA performance. 
  We will recruit novices to UGRA and administer a series of psychometric tests on visuospatial ability, to identify individuals with higher and lower skills. All novices will be asked to perform non-invasive, ultrasound scanning of the neck and shoulder of healthy human volunteers and their performance on several metrics (image quality, time, stability, and ability to obtain standard images) will be recorded. Experts in UGRA will tested as well, and they provide a control group against whom the novices will be compared to. </summary>
