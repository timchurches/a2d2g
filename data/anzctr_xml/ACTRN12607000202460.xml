  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive two oxygen regimes in a cross over fashion: room air (placebo) for 5 minutes before the start and continued until the end of the ETT, and high flow oxygen (15/L minute) (comparator) via a non-rebreather mask for 5 minutes before the start and continued until the end of the ETT. The order that the regimes are received will be allocated randomly and there will be approximately 90 minutes between tests. Exercise will be standardised according to the Bruce protocol for exercise stress tests. The ETT will be stopped for any of the following reasons  

ST elevation, LBBB or arrhythmia occurs 
The patient requests to stop the test 
The development of diagnostic ECG ischaemia for 15 seconds 
The cardiology registrar determines that the ETT should be stopped  
 

    If none of these endpoints are reached then the duration of the ETT will be determined by the exercise capacity of the patient.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is routine clinical practice to administer high flow oxygen to all patients with a heart attack.  However, there is evidence to suggest that this approach may be harmful, particularly to those patients who are not hypoxic.  High flow oxygen causing hyperoxia has been shown to increase blood pressure and reduce cardiac output, and possibly also reduce coronary artery blood flow.  As a result it is crucial that the effects of high flow oxygen on myocardial ischaemia is investigated further in patients with ischaemic heart disease.  A double-blind randomised controlled cross-over trial using exercise treadmill testing is an ideal method to measure the effect of supplementary oxygen on myocardial ischaemia.</summary>
