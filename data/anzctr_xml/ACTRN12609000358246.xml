Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 100IU), 2.5mcg, taken orally twice a day for 12 weeks of treatment. Every particpant will take a placebo for 4 weeks and then the active treatment for 12 weeks, twice daily.Placebo comprised of the same excipent base as the active treatment.  The particpants will take two tablets twice daily with warm water 15 minutes before food for 4 weeks.  The tablets will be taken orally.  Past researchers have found a noticeable placebo effect on menopausal symptoms.  The literature indicates that the most effective method to avoid this anomaly is to utilise a methodology similar to that which this trial proposes</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a descriptive study of a group of 15 women to comment on the possibility of an association between changes in menopausal symptoms following the use of a complementary therapy.  Participants will have good general health and demonstrate a recorded minimum of 21 hot flushes per week and above 80% compliance during placebo run in.  They will self administer 2 placebo tablets twice daily over the 28 day run in period and two tablets of Zen Harmony  twice daily over 12 weeks of active treatment.  Participants will be supplied with a daily diary containing a record of vasomotor symptoms (flushing) and instructed how to complete the required data.  They will also complete the Greene Climacteric Scale, the Women's Health questionnaire and the Menopause rating scale at each clinic visit.  .</summary>
