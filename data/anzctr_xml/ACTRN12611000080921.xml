  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is comparable to a parallel trial being conducted in Acehnese adults (ACTRN12610001085066). There are 2 arms to this trial. Arm 1:Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. Arm 2: Supportive Counselling. Therapy is administered in once-weekly 60-minute sessions of one-on-one therapy with a counsellor over 6 weeks. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy includes imaginal reliving of trauma memories, in vivo exposure that includes gradual exposure to feared situations, and cognitive restructuring of the trauma experience. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Supportive Counselling condition involves 6 once-weekly 60-minute sessions of individual therapy over 6 weeks. The therapy includes nondirective counselling that does not include any Cognitive Behaviour Therapy components. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</comparator>
