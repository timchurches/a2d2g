  <interventions>
    <interventions>As this study is a secondary analysis of the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey data that was collected as part of the Australian Health Survey, 2011-2013 (http://www.abs.gov.au/australianhealthsurvey), no participants will be enrolled.
The independent variables examined from this data includes: The temporal distribution (e.g. timing across the day) and frequency of eating occasions, including meals and snacks were examined.
Dietary intake information was collected during two 24-hour dietary recalls (~9 days apart) conducted by a trained interviewer from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  The methodology used in the 24-h recall was based on the USDA, 5-step Automated Multiple Pass Method.  The participants identified the type of eating occasion and the time when each eating occasion began as well as all foods and beverages consumed at these eating occasions. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This study involves secondary analyses of dietary and health data from the 2011-12 Australian National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS).  The NNPAS used a multistage, probability sample design to select a nationally representative sample of 12,153 persons aged 2 years and older.  The analyses draws on data from adult participants with two days of dietary recall data (n=6053) who were not pregnant, breastfeeding or undertook shift work in past four weeks (n=5366),  The frequency of all eating occasions, meals and snacks were calculated after applying previously published definitions of an eating occasion. Latent class analysis was used to assess the timing and frequency of eating occasions, or temporal eating patterns, across the day in men and women.. Person weights and replicate weights were applied to compute point estimates and standard errors to account for the probability of selection and the clustered survey design of the NNPAS,  The F test (for continuous data) and the adjusted Pearson Chi-2 test (for categorical data), were used to examine the sociodemographics and dietary and health behaviour characteristics of different eating patterns. The Bonferroni correction was applied where &gt;3 categories were compared.  Linear regression and logistic regression (for binary outcomes) were used to examine associations between eating patterns (temporal eating patterns, frequency of all eating occasions, meals and snacks), nutrient intakes, diet quality indicators and measures of adiposity and blood pressure. Models were statistically adjusted for potential covariates and energy misreporting. Sensitivity analyses that excluded energy misreporters was also undertaken.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Little is known about dietary intake at the level of an eating occasion (EO), which includes meals and snacks.  Current dietary advice is framed around the amount and types of food populations should consume, rather than a consideration of eating patterns.  Eating patterns describe the frequency and temporal distribution of meals and snacks. Eating patterns are likely to be important determinants of adults dietary intakes and health; however, the nutritional and health impacts of EO, meal and snack frequency and temporal eating patterns are inconclusive. Further, inconsistent evidence for eating patterns and health may be partly attributed to the lack of consensus on approaches for defining an EO or for assessing temporal eating patterns. 

The aims of these secondary analyses were to: 1) explore the influence of different definitions of EOs on the characterisation of eating patterns, 2) to examine temporal eating patterns using a novel data-driven analytic approach, and 3) to investigate associations of different eating patterns (e.g. frequency of all EOs, meals and snacks; temporal eating patterns) with nutrient intakes, overall diet quality and measures of adiposity and blood pressure.

The Census and Statistics Act 1905 provides ethics approval for the Australian Bureau of Statistics to conduct household interview components of national surveys, including the National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS).  At this is a secondary analysis of the NNPAS data which is de-identified, an exemption for ethics approval was granted by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee on April 16, 2015.
