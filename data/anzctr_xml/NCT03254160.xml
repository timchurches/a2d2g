  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Main 

          -  Subjects who have experienced an ischemic stroke documented by CT or MRI resulting in
             upper extremity deficit that warrants the need for rehabilitation therapy.

          -  Medically stable subjects, with expected survival &gt; 12 months, who are able to be
             randomized to study drug beginning between 1 and 52 weeks (i.e., 7 to 365 days)
             post-stroke.

          -  Mild to moderately severe upper extremity motor impairment.

          -  mRS score of 1 to 4 from index stroke.

          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of = 22.

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Residual motor deficit from any prior stroke

          -  Hemorrhagic stroke. Ischemic stroke with limited hemorrhagic conversion (i.e.,
             petechial hemorrhage or micro-hemorrhage) is acceptable.

          -  Severe or total sensory loss

          -  Moderate to severe aphasia and/or severe language deficits

          -  Excessive spasticity in the affected elbow or change in oral spasticity treatment
             drugs within 2 weeks before the Screening Visit

          -  Prior botulinum toxin injection to any portion of the affected arm in the prior 3
             months before the Screening Visit

          -  Major and active neurological, psychiatric, or medical diagnosis that is not
             adequately controlled and would likely reduce the safety of study participation or
             impact the subject's ability to comply with study protocol procedures in the opinion
             of the Investigator

          -  Any suicidal ideation during the subject's lifetime at any time prior to randomization
             including childhood (based on subject history), equivalent to type 2 on the
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

          -  Received an investigational pharmacotherapy therapy within the past 3 months

          -  Use of any tobacco-smoke emitting products (including but not limited to cigarettes,
             pipes, and cigars) within 30 days of Baseline.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females</exclusivecriteria>
