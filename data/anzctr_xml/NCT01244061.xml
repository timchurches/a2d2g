  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Continuous Abstinence Rate (CAR) From Week 9 Through Week 12 - The percentage of participants who, from Week 9 through Week 12, reported no smoking and no use of other nicotine-containing products since the last study visit/last contact (on the Nicotine Use Inventory) and who did not have carbon monoxide (CO)&gt; 10ppm at any visits during this time frame.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 9 through Week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CAR From Week 9 Through Week 52 - The percentage of participants who, from Week 9 through Week 52, reported no smoking (Weeks 9 through 52) and no use of other nicotine-containing products (Weeks 9 through 12), or no use of other tobacco products (Weeks 13 through 52), since the last study visit/last contact (on the Nicotine Use Inventory) and who did not have CO &gt;10 ppm at any of these visits during this time frame.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 9 through Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CAR From Week 9 Through Week 24 - The percentage of participants who, from Week 9 through Week 24, reported no smoking (Weeks 9 through 24) and no use of other nicotine-containing products (Weeks 9 through 12), or no use of other tobacco products (Weeks 13 through 24), since the last study visit/last contact (on the Nicotine Use Inventory) and who did not have CO &gt;10 ppm at any of these visits during this time frame.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>7-day Point Prevalence (PP) of Abstinence at Weeks 12, 24, and 52 - The secondary endpoint of 7-day point prevalence of smoking cessation was determined by evaluating a participant's cigarette smoking status, and other nicotine (and/or other tobacco) use, based on the "last 7 days" questions in the Nicotine Use Inventory. Additionally, a participant was not considered a responder if the expired CO was &gt;10 ppm at the time point being summarized. Participants were considered responders independently at each visit.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of the re-treatment
      of smokers with varenicline with placebo for smoking cessation during the last 4 weeks of a
      12 week course of treatment. The study will also assess whether smokers remain abstinent at
      Week 24 (12 weeks after the end of treatment) and Week 52 (40 weeks after the end of
      treatment).</summary>
