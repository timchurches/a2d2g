Folinic acid: 200 mg/m2 in 500 ml normal saline IV over 2 hours 
5FU: 450 mg/m2 IV bolus.

Oxaliplatin: 45 mg/m2 IV over a 90 min infusion 
Folinic acid: 200 mg/m2 in 500 ml normal saline IV over 2 hours 
5FU: 450 mg/m2 IV bolus

This 8-week cycle will be administered in an identical manner again (i.e. total 16 weeks).

Folinic acid and 5FU will be given immediately after completion of CPT-11 infusion. Each course should be repeated every week for 6 weeks followed by a two week rest period. One cycle represents 6 infusions (8 weeks).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to compare the response rate (RR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and to assess the toxicity profile of previously untreated patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) randomly assigned between Camptothecin-11 (CPT-11)/5FU /Folinic Acid (arm A) versus Camptothecin-11 (CPT-11)/Fluorouracil (5FU)/Folinic Acid followed by Oxaliplatin/Fluorouracil (5FU)/Folinic Acid(arm B) in the same line of treatment. 
A theoretical framework supports the hypothesis that the sequential administration of cytotoxic drugs at adequate doses can maximize the cell kill and overcome drug resistance.</summary>
