  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in this study are people over 65 years of age and who are recovering from an acute illness after hospitalization. Intervention includes six months tailored nutritional guidance and individual home sessions administered by a dietitian. First one-hour visit takes place after discharge from rehabilitation center and then the dietitian evaluates the need for further one hour guidance sessions, max. 3 sessions. Guidance is based on food diaries, the results of the baseline measurements, home visits, and discussions with the participants and their possible caregivers. Oral nutritional supplement are advised to use and given to participants when food and protein intakes are low. The intervention will be a process which responds and continues step by step according to participants individual needs. Adherence is monitored by the consumption of dietary supplements and checking protein intake at 3 months point in the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Persons in the control group will receive written nutritional information after randomization and at the end of the trial  handbooks about good nutrition and good sources of protein for the aged people.</comparator>
