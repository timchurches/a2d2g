  <interventions>
    <interventions>A one hour group education session on how to manage fatigue caused by cancer treatment. It is delivered using a PowerPoint presentation and participants will be given a handbook, a goal setting sheet and a progress diary.

The group session will be conducted before participants commence the course of treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). 2 x 15 minute follow-up phone calls using a structured script will be provided 2 and 4 weeks after each session to reinforce information given in the group.

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified from the Radiation, Medical Oncology and Haematology units at The Alfred. All patients undergoing outpatient chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy aged over 18 years and booked for 20 or more days of treatment will be flagged by the treating team, and provided with written and verbal information regarding the study by the principal investigator. If informed consent is provided, relevant demographic, condition and treatment information will be gathered from the participantâ€™s medical record or obtained from participants at the initial interview. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised (using a computerised random number generator) to either control or treatment group. Allocation concealment will be ensured by having the supervising researcher  place the sequence into opaque, sealed, sequentially numbered envelopes</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As this is a Pilot study to see if the intervention is appropriate for people undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we calculated that 15 people per group would give us a reasonable estimate of its effect. 

Participant outcome measures collected at baseline and at the two reviews will be compared between groups using t tests for normally distributed data and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for skewed data. Where summary scores were utilised, recommended scoring methods for each measure were applied. 

Linear mixed models (or generalised estimating equations) will be used by a blinded statistical analyst to compare follow-up scores for the primary and secondary outcomes between groups, (group treated as a fixed factor, participant and assessment as random factors, assessment nested within participant) while adjusting for the covariates of age, gender, baseline value of the dependent variable and whether participants were working or not at the baseline assessment. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the effect of fatigue management education on chemotherapy and radiotherapy patients' performance of daily living. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years and are scheduled to undergo outpatient chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment for 20 or more days. Trial details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups. Participants in one group will attend a one hour group education session on how to manage fatigue caused by cancer treatment. It is delivered using a PowerPoint presentation and participants will be given a handbook, a goal setting sheet and a progress diary. The group session will be conducted before participants commence the course of treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). Two follow-up phone calls using a structured script will be provided 2 and 4 weeks after each session to reinforce information given in the group. Participants in the second study group will continue to receive standard care. Participants will be required to complete some questionnaires at completion of treatment and 6 weeks later in order to evaluate their participation in everyday activities, health-related quality of life, fatigue and distress.</summary>
