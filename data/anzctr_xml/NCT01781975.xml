  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Males and females age 12-45 years of age who meet the ADA standard T1DM criteria1.
             Positive for at least one islet cell autoantibody. Initial enrollment will be for
             subjects ages 18-45, with the goal to lower the age down to 12 upon acceptable safety
             review and prospect of benefit for this initial older cohort.

          -  Diagnosis of T1DM within 100 days of Visit 0.

          -  Peak stimulated C-peptide level &gt;0.2 pmol/mL following an MMTT.

          -  Participants of childbearing age who are sexually active must agree to use an
             effective form of birth control (e.g., barrier method, oral contraception, or
             surgery). For females, these contraceptive measures must be maintained throughout the
             study; for males these measures must be followed for a minimum of 3 months after
             discontinuation of imatinib therapy.</inclusivecriteria>

          -  Prior treatment with imatinib or related tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

          -  Unable to avoid medications that affect CYP3A4: either inducers that may decrease
             imatinib levels, or inhibitors that may increase drug concentrations. (Refer to
             section 1.5.1.12 for a complete list of inducers and inhibitors.)

          -  Height standard deviation score =2 standard deviations below mean

          -  Any sign of QT prolongation on Visit -1 noted on ECG (&gt; 450 ms in males and &gt; 470 ms

          -  Known coagulation disorders or use of anticoagulants

          -  Current and anticipated on-going treatment with drugs that may increase or decrease
             imatinib plasma concentrations (CYP3A4 family inhibitors or inducers) or drugs that
             may have their plasma concentration altered by imatinib (drugs metabolized by CYP3A4/5
             and CYP2D6).

          -  Any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may compromise study participation
             or may confound the interpretation of the study results.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing
      ß cells. Although exogenous insulin is widely available, it is not possible for affected
      individuals to consistently achieve euglycemia with current technology, and thus they are at
      risk for devastating long-term complications. This phase II study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of imatinib mesylate as a novel therapy for new-onset T1DM. Imatinib is a
      first-in-class tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

      This study will explore the potential role of short-term therapy with imatinib to induce
      tolerance and possibly lead to a durable long-term remission of T1DM.</summary>
