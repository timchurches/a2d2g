    <interventions>ARM 1:(a)	Intervention group -  nebulised unfractionated sodium heparin ( 2 mls, 5000 U) every 6 hours
ARM 2:(b)	Placebo group 1 (2 mls of Sodium Chloride0.9%) every 6 hours or usual practice of nebulised bronchodilators for clinical indication only
ARM 3:(c)	Placebo group 2 Usual care-unblinded no active nebulized treatment with saline unless deemed clinically necessary by the treating clinician

In both arm 1 and 2 the patients will receive the study drug until the patient has been extubated for more than 48 hrs and the clinician is confident that the patient is pneumonia free and reintubation is unlikely or if the patient is extubated and discharged within the 48hrs.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nebulised heparin used as a prophylactic agent is associated with an absolute risk reduction of 6 % in the incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia.
VAP and time to VAP

1.Patients will be screened daily using the Modified Centre for Disease Control criteria for VAP after Klompas.

Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage will be performed where possible upon the suspicion of VAP and quantitative cultures performed using standard laboratory measures.  
Semiquantitative endotracheal aspirate culture or bronchial washing will be performed as the routine microbiological culture method.

2. Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score at time of clinical diagnosis of and for 48 hours prior to the onset of  VAP.  For the purposes of the study possible VAP will be a CPIS &gt; 6 without modified CDC criteria for VAP.

The final determination of definite or probable VAP will be made by an independent panel not directly associated with patient care.

Polymicrobial episodes of VAP were considered to be due to the microorganisms with the highest yield.
90-100 episodes of VAP are expected during this study in a total of 831 914 enrolled patients.  To assess the performance of the modified CDC criteria of Klompas for this study a random selection of 20 patients with VAP will be chosen at the time of clinical diagnosis to have a bronchoscopic  BAL performed to assess sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic algorithm.  This proportion is consistent with current unit practices.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nebulised heparin used as a prophylactic agent is associated with a absolute risk reduction of 50% in the incidence of airway colonization by Gram negative enteric bacteria

(a)Patient's received other antibiotics for reasons other than failure
(b)Failed to have an outcome determination or
(c)Withdrew from therapy less than 48 hours after commencement of treatment
(d)Died during therapy from infectious related reasons

5. Development of superinfection
(a)New pathogen(s) emerged during treatment requiring additional antibiotic therapy  and
(b)Clinical and laboratory evidence showing emergence or exacerbation of infection

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who are in intensive care may need to have their breathing assisted by a ventilator. Although all care is taken,pneumonia develops in 12% of patients on ventilators. This is because tubes connecting patients to the ventilator impair the lungs normal defenses against infection and causes inflammation in the airways. Inhaled heparin may assist to reduce this risk. Heparin has been used in patients with airway burns and has shown to decrease the inlammation and promote healing. This study will attempt to determine if giving inhaled heparin to patients needing mechanical ventilation will reduce their chances of developing pneumonial</summary>
