  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be assigned to using an auto-titrating positive airways pressure device overnight for 2 weeks. Auto-titrating positive airways pressure devices treat obstructive sleep apnea by delivering pressurised air via a hose to a mask interface. It delivers the pressure by sensing when the airway closes and only increasing the pressure if necessary. This is a crossover study and there is no washout period between treatments.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will be assigned to using a continuous positive airways pressure device worn overnight for 2 weeks.

Continuous positive airway pressure is the recognised gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. It treats obstructive sleep apnea by delivering a fixed amount of pressurised air via a hose to a mask interface; splinting the airway which prevents its closure during sleep. The fixed amount of air will vary according to each participant and remain fixed on a certain dose for each of those participants during this period.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients who are seen in the Sleep Disorders Centre who are on CPAP therapy and have aerophagia as a side-effect of this therapy will be asked to participate. Patients will have the study explained to them and given a Participant Information Sheet.  If agreeable, they will then be asked to sign the Consent Form which will be kept in the Sleep Disorders Centre. Patients will be assigned to the two treatment options in random order. The randomisation was carried out in the Microsoft Excel software package using the Random number function. One researcher will remain unblinded and will carry out the randomisation process. This researcher will not have any interaction with participants for the duration of the trial. Two of the researchers will remain blinded to which treatment arm the participant has been assigned to.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who suffer from Obstructive Sleep Apnoea, a disorder where the airway closes during sleep, are often prescribed treatment with CPAP (Continuous Positive Airways Pressure). This is a device that blows air down the airway via a face mask.  Some patients experience stomach bloating as a result of this therapy. This research aims to try an alternative treatment, APAP (Automatic Positive Airways Pressure), to assess if this is better tolerated in these patients. APAP delivers the pressure by sensing when the airway closes and only increasing if necessary.  Patients will use CPAP for two weeks and APAP for two weeks (in random order) to see which treatment is best tolerated. We propose that treatment with APAP will result in more effective and comfortable therapy. Patients who currently discontinue or struggle with CPAP due to these side-effects will have a reasonable alternative.</summary>
