  <interventions>
    <interventions>Blood and urine samples will be collected peri-operatively. Samples of liver donors will be collected before and after general anesthesia is conducted in the operating room. Samples of the recipients will be collected at several time points: (T1) before induction as baseline, (T2) after induction during general anesthesia, (T3) before the end of anhepatic phase, (T4) 2 hours post reperfusion, (T5) day 1 post-operatively and (T6) day 5 post-operatively. Hemodynamic data will also be collected at these time points.

At day 7, liver transplant clinical outcomes will be assessed and classified as early  allograft dysfunction (EAD) for grafts meeting one criterion or more (bilirubin greater than or equal to 10mg/dl, INR greater than or equal to 1.6, alanine (ALT) or aspartate (AST) amniotransferase greater than 2000IU/L within the first 7 days; as immediate graft function (IGF) for grafts with values below the cut-off points mentioned above; and as primary non function (PNF) for patients with irreversible graft dysfunction without detectable technical or immunological problems.

      <outcome>Metabolomic data of liver donors and recipients. The blood and urine samples will be analyzed using hydrogen-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and lipid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).The laboratory analysis will be studied with the clinical outcomes of liver transplantation in elucidating the possible mechanisms during transplantation and the possible factors influencing the  success of organ transplantation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood and urine samples will be collected peri-operatively. Samples of donors will be collected before and after general anesthesia in the operating room. Samples of the recipients will be collected at several time points: (T1) before induction as baseline, (T2) after induction during general anesthesia, (T3) before the end of anhepatic phase, (T4) 2 hours post reperfusion, (T5) day 1 post-operatively and (T6) day 5 post-operatively. Metabolomic studies will be conducted from these blood and urine samples and their trends will be studied in relation to the primary outcome.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Metabolomic software, GeneSpring MS, Markerlyn XS &amp; Metaboanalyst, will be used for multivariate data analysis and representation. For structural identification of target metabolite, standards will be operated under identical chromatographic conditions with that of the profiling experiment. MS and MS/MS analyses are performed in the same conditions.
The number of participants expected to enroll the study is calculated based on the number of liver transplantation conducted in our institution per year. In average, 2 liver transplantations are conducted per week, and we aim to enroll 120 living liver donors and 120 recipients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The liver is an essential organ in human body because it possesses synthetic, metabolic, secretory and excretory functions. For patients with acute and chronic end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation has been established as a viable treatment, and its success partly depends on proper organ retrieval, adequate donor assessment and optimal peri-operative conditions. The aim of the study is to determine the association of metabolomic incompatibility between donor and recipient andto predict early allograft dysfunction in liver transplantation.</summary>
