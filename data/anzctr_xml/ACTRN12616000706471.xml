    <interventions>Intervention (Up and Go Goodie Bag)
The "Up and Go" Goodie Bag will include child-friendly age appropriate information on the benefits of early upright mobilization and breathing exercises in the post-operative period. The information will include instruction on how to perform the breathing exercise routine and how to perform supported coughing. Incentives to encourage these exercises will include the provision of age appropriate toys such as whistles and bubble blowers. Incentives to encourage upright mobilization and completion of breathing exercises will include sticker charts with rewards for reaching goal points. Consumers, including the youth advisory committee of PMH will be consulted about the presentation of the information and contents of the Up and Go Goodie Bag.

The goodie bag is administered day 0, i.e., day of the surgery, but post operatively on the day of the surgery. The goodie bags, activities and incentives cover the first 5 days post operatively until discharge.  The minimum recommended frequency would be ten deep breaths (ie one breathing exercises/activity) per hour that the child is awake or  one period of upright mobilisation, which includes sitting out of bed, or assisted walking per hour the child is awake. The time of upright mobilsation is dependent on recovery stage i.e., day post op with increasing time expected as days progress. The frequency of breathing exercises and upright time are  outcomes being assessed within this trial to determine recommended recommended protocols as there is currently no good data of what to recommend for children. Parental support to initiate and complete activities is required. It is anticipated that older aged children (10-12 year old) may show self initiation but this is uncertain.</interventions>

      <outcome>Intensity and frequency of mobilization measured using positional activity logger (PAL 2) on a daily basis for the first 5 days including:
Uptime duration (minutes), 
Maximal single upright period (minutes), 
Sit-to-stand frequency (counts) 
The PAL 2  is a modified version of the Uptimer, which has been shown to be a reliable and valid method of recording uptime in adults and children post abdominal surgery (Browning et al 2007; Eldridge et al 2003). The PAL 2 records the quantity of time spent in an upright position  termed uptime. The device is worn on the thigh and senses changes in position via three mercury tilt switches. Data are downloaded and analysed.

      <outcome>Subjective evaluation of pain levels (Likert Pain scales or Faces Pain Scale)
A numerical Likert rating scale will measure pain intensity in children aged 8-12years. Participants will be asked to verbally rate the intensity of pain on a scale from "0" (no pain) to "'10" (worst pain possible; most hurt possible). Numerical rating scales have been shown to be valid, reliable and to have good sensitivity to change in perceived pain in children post operatively as young as 8 years of age (Page et al 2008).
For children aged 4-8 years the Faces Pain Scale will be used to measure pain intensity. The Faces Pain Scale is a visual scale composed of six faces illustrating increasing levels of pain intensity. Children are asked to choose the face that best describes the intensity of the pain they are currently experiencing. Scores range from 0 to 10 with the faces representing the lower and higher levels of pain intensity coded as 0 and 10, respectively. The Faces Pain Scale is highly correlated with the visual analogue  scale (r =.93) showing good validity (Hicks et al 2003).

Postoperative pulmonary complications will be defined as when there are  four or more of the eight criteria as defined by Scholes et al, 2009. While there is no consensus about the best tool to use in diagnosing  post operative pulmonary complications in abdominal surgery, particularly children, these criteria were selected on the basis that they are the most recently described and have been used in recent Australian studies in adult populations (Scholes et al 2009; Haines et al 2013).

    <concealment>Design: Quasi Experimental Before and After Study Design
A “before and after” study design will be used. The “before” period (control phase) will enrol consecutive patients who have undergone abdominal surgery before Up and Go Goodie Bag implementation (intervention). These control group participants will receive standard medical/nursing care which includes encouragement of early mobilization and referral for physiotherapy only on medical request. 

The “after” period (intervention phase) involves enrolment of consecutive patients who have undergone abdominal surgery and who will receive standard medical/nursing care as well as being supplied on day 0 with an Up and Go Goodie bag designed to encourage early mobilization and deep breathing exercises.  They will also receive a referral for chest physiotherapy only on medical request.

It is not possible to have a randomised controlled study design as it is difficult to have subjects in a shared room or ward visibly receiving different management approaches at the same time. Nursing care would be  influenced by the intervention and the trial results would be confounded

Control Phase
Participants will be recruited sequentially on arrival to the ward after an abdominal surgical procedure. Families will be provided with an informed consent sheet. These participants in the control period will receive current standard care, including encouragement and assistance from nursing staff to mobilise, and referrals to physiotherapy by medical staff as required. 

Up right time of participants in this control phase will be measured using the Positional Activity Logger 2 (PAL 2). A research assistant will apply the PAL2 to recruited participants and educate them on its required use. The PAL2 will be checked daily by the research assist to ensure that continuous data recording is occurring and monitor participant compliance with its wear. The PAL2 is worn for 24 hours a day for five consecutive days including showering/bathing. It will be removed on the day of discharge. If the participant is discharged prior to Day 5, the PAL 2 will be removed on the morning of discharge. If the PAL 2 is dislodged, inadvertently removed, or ceased to record, only full day data from the correctly worn activity logger will be used. Following discharge, the research assistance will collate data regarding patient demographics, surgical history, PMH, gut motility, evidence of PPC and referral history to Physiotherapy.


Intervention Phase
During the intervention phase, nursing staff will be asked to distribute the Up and Go Goodie Bags to participants recruited in the trial on their first day on the ward. The Research Assistant will monitor adherence and will award incentive prizes when uptime is achieved and goals are reached. The Research Assistant will supply participants with the PAL2 on arrival to the ward and collect data as described in the Control Phase.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has become routine for any adult who had undergone abdominal surgery to have physiotherapy treatments such as deep breathing, incentive spirometry, encouraging mobilisation (getting out of bed)  and other specific chest physiotherapy techniques manual techniques. It is thought that this  physiotherapy will prevent post-operative pulmonary complications. The research in adults has shown that of these techniques, early upright mobilisation is most effective in reducing length of stay in hospital for adults who have undergone abdominal surgery (Browning et al 2007). There is very little published evidence to support the use of physiotherapy to prevent post-operative complications in children who have undergone abdominal surgery. 

Current medical, physiotherapy and nursing care after abdominal surgery at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) advocates for early mobilisation. These recommendations for children are based on findings on adult patients. As a result, there are no clear guidelines of how much, how often, and how best to encourage mobilisation in children after they have had abdominal surgery.  

This uncertainty leaves clinicians working in this clinical area partly dependant on their own clinical experience when making decisions regarding individual patient management and results in variation in clinical care (Morris et al 2003). This uncertainty and variation in clinical practice is one of the driving forces behind the development and evaluation of the Up and Go Goodie Bag.  

AIM: We wish to evaluate whether patients supplied with a self-directed early mobilization and deep breathing incentive goodie bag (Up, and Go Goodie Bag ) after abdominal surgery facilitates early mobilisation, early discharge and prevents post op pulmonary complications. This information will be used to develop mobilisation guidelines for children who have undergone abdominal surgery.
