  <interventions>
    <interventions>3L (elastic) Tubular bandaging was used in three graduated lengths of 3 layers as follows: 
1.	from base of toes to just under knee (long layer)
2.	from base of toes to above calf pump (medium layer)
3.	from base of toes to mid gaiter (short layer)
This study is a within person sub bandage comparison.Participants will have an elastic bandage applied to one limb and the inelastic bandage applied to the other limb. All layers will be applied at the same time and measured with a sub bandage pressure measurement instrument. Participant legs randomised to either control compression bandage or to the intervention compression bandage. Eg. right leg randomised to control or intervention bandage. The overall duration of this trial is one day. There is no washout period.</interventions>
    <comparator>SS (Inelastic): Standard short stretch compression therapy consists of:
1.	A padding layer 
2.	10cm inelastic short stretch compression bandage 
3.	A tubular support bandage 
All layers of standard compression therapy were applied from base of toes to just under the knee. All layers applied at same time. Participant legs will be randomised to either control compression bandage or to the intervention compression bandage. Eg. right leg randomised to control or intervention bandage The overall duration of this trial is one day.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate the magnitude of difference in mean sub-bandage pressure of 3L (elastic) and SS (inelastic) compression bandage systems at rest, standing , exercise and recovery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six quantitative outcome measures were defined between the two bandage systems: (i)-(iv) the difference in mean sub-bandage pressure during each of four activities; (v) the difference in stiffness parameter ; and (vi) the difference in amplitude of sub -bandage pressure (SBP) during the exercise activity. The outcome was measured during the intervention at 0.25 second intervals for entire 90 seconds for each participant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate the difference in mean stiffness parameter (SP) between bandage types. 
To estimate the difference in mean amplitude of sub-bandage pressure during exercise between bandage systems.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomisation was stratified by person. One of each type of bandage (elastic or inelastic) was randomised to either right or left leg for each participant. Randomisation followed a computer generated allocation schedule to ensure that elastic and inelastic bandages were allocated equally between right and left legs in each participant. Participants were unaware of prior treatment assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence randomisation was achieved by using a computer generated algorithm.</sequence>
