Active Comparator: Arm I (bevacizumab) - Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Arm II (bevacizumab, anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105) - Patients receive bevacizumab as in Arm I and anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105 IV over 1-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

    <summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well bevacizumab with or without anti-endoglin
      monoclonal antibody TRC105 (TRC105) works in treating patients with kidney cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab
      and anti-endoglin monoclonal antibody TRC105, may block tumor growth in different ways by
      targeting certain cells.</summary>
