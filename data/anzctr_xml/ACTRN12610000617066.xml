  <interventions>
    <interventions>1)Maternity early warning scores- this is a track and trigger system to detect vital signs that are outside the normal ranges expected and will be calculated when vital signs are done
2)a new observation chart- this will incorporate the early warning score as well as other information specific to maternity in-patients such as per vagina(pv) loss, protein in urine
3)education program about deteriorating maternity pateints including prelearning with a CD an manual and a 2 1/2 hour face to face session with lecture and case studies
The intervention period will run for 4 months once 50% of the clinical staff have completed the education program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Four months of data from the same period from the previous year will be compared to determine the interventions impact.
The data will be collected in four group, a historical group and a intervention group at each of the 2 hospitals</comparator>
    <control>Historical</control>
    <interventioncode>Other interventions</interventioncode>
    <interventioncode>Early detection / Screening</interventioncode>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Other</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased measurement of vital signs- medical records will be examined to collect data which will be entered in an Access database. Comparison of the 2009 group with the trial period to note changes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Compare 4 months control period with 4 months trial period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased medical review- following collection of vital signs a early warning score will be calculated by the database. Any set of vital signs that have reach a trigger for medical review, a search of the medical record will be undertaken to see if a review was requested by the midwives and if a medical officer reviewed the woman. The two time periods will be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Compare 4 months control period with 4 months trial period</timepoint>
