    <interventions>EU-C-001: 
Group 1: Single oral administration (5mg, 15mg, 45mg, 90mg, 150mg, 180mg)
Each subject will receive one single oral administration of the study medication, either EU-C-001 or placebo. At each dose levels, six male subjects will receive one oral
administration of either EU-C-001 (four or five subjects) or Placebo (one or two subjects).
Dose escalation will be stopped when the maximal tolerated dose is defined. However, higher dose levels might be investigated if the maximal tolerated dose has not been reached. In addition, smaller dose escalation steps may be explored if warranted by the safety data.
Stopping criteria are occurrence of abnormal results at safety assessments (e.g. laboratory values) and / or systemic adverse events all being of clinical relevance. It is anticipated that the maximum tolerated doses are reached after six dose escalations.
At the lowest dose level two subjects will be treated first, one subject will receive placebo and one subject will receive EU-C-001. If there are no clinically relevant adverse events related to the study medication (no NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity) within 48 hours, the remaining subjects of the cohort will be
treated (3 on EU-C-001; 1 on placebo). Provided there are not more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no subject with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity in each cohort, dose escalation continues with one subject receiving placebo and five subjects receiving EU-C-001 from Cohort 2 (15mg) to Cohort 6 (180mg). When there are more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity the maximum tolerated single oral dose is reached.

Group 2: Single 15 minute IV infusion (5mg, 15mg, 45mg, 60mg, 90mg)
Each subject will receive one single administration of the study medication, a 15-minute intravenous infusion. At the lowest dose level, six male subjects will receive one intravenous
administration of either EU-C-001 (four subjects) or Placebo (two subjects).
At each of the following dose levels, six male subjects will receive one intravenous administration of either EU-C-001 (five subjects) or Placebo (one subject).
Stopping criteria are occurrence of abnormal results at safety assessments (e.g. laboratory values), local injection reactions and / or systemic adverse events all being of clinical relevance. It is anticipated that the maximum tolerated doses are reached after six dose escalations.
At the lowest dose level two subjects will be treated first, one subject will receive placebo and one subject will receive EU-C-001. If there are no clinically relevant adverse events related to the study medication (no NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity) within 48 hours after the intravenous infusion, the remaining
subjects of the cohort will be treated. Provided there are not more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no subject with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity in each cohort, dose escalation continues with one subject receiving placebo and five subjects receiving EU-C-001 from Cohort 2 (15mg) to Cohort 5 (90mg). When there are more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity the maximum tolerated single intravenous dose is reached.

Group 3: Repeated oral administration (15mg, 45mg, 90mg, 180mg)
Each subject will receive once daily oral administrations of the study medication for 5 days. Six male subjects will receive oral administrations of either EU-C-001 (four or five subjects) or Placebo (one or two subjects). It is planned to administer 5 oral administrations at 24-hour
intervals. It is anticipated that the maximum tolerated doses are reached after three dose escalations. However, higher dose levels might be investigated if the maximal tolerated dose has not been reached. In addition, smaller dose escalation steps may be explored if warranted by the safety data.
At the lowest dose level two subjects will be treated first, one subject will receive placebo and one subject will receive EU-C-001. If there are no clinically relevant adverse events related to the study medication (no NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity) 24 hours after the 2nd oral administration, the remaining subjects
of the cohort will be treated. Provided there are not more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no subject with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity in each cohort, dose escalation continues with one subject receiving placebo and five subjects receiving
EU-C-001 from Cohort 2 (45mg) to Cohort 4 (180mg). When there are more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and more than one subject with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity after the oral administrations the maximum tolerated dose is reached for this route of repeated administrations.

Group 4: Repeated 15-minute intravenous infusions (5mg, 15mg, 45mg, 90mg)
Each subject will receive repeated once daily administrations of the study medication for 5 days, as 15-minute intravenous infusions. Six male subjects will receive 15-minute intravenous infusions of eitherEU-C-001 (five subjects) or Placebo (one subject). It is planned to administer the 5 injections at 24-hour intervals. It is anticipated that the
maximum tolerated doses are reached after three dose escalations. However, higher dose levels might be investigated if the maximal tolerated dose has not been reached. In addition, smaller dose escalation steps may be explored if warranted by the safety data.
At each dose level one subject will receive placebo and five subjects will receive EU-C-001. Provided there are not more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and no subject with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related toxicity in each cohort, dose escalation continues in the same way for cohorts 2 (15mg) to 4 (90mg). When there are more than two subjects with NCI-CTC Grade 3 related toxicity and more than one subject with NCI-CTC Grade 4 related
toxicity after the intravenous administrations the maximum tolerated dose is reached for this route of repeated administrations.

All doses are administered at the site under controlled conditions by the investigators.

The subjects will be sequentially allocated to the different study groups.
The assignment of number and code for the subjects identification is based on the need for
anonymity. Subjects will be identified only by their subject number, a study center subject
identification code and date of birth. The allocation of the treatment (EU-C-001 or placebo) to the subjects will be done in the morning of Day 1 immediately before the start of the first administration of the study medication according to a randomization list. The randomization list is prepared by an independent statistician from CPR Pharma Services not involved in the study and will be kept blind in the Study Files until the end of the study or individual random code sheets can be broken, if deemed necessary in medical emergency situations.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For the statistical analysis of safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, a
descriptive statistical approach is foreseen.
Demographic parameters (age, height, weight) will be summarized by means of tabulated
descriptive statistics (the number of observations (N), arithmetic mean, median, SD, SEM,
minimum and maximum), by treatment groups and overall. Results of physical examination
will only be listed by subject, time point and body system.
The numerical values relating to safety and tolerability (ECG, blood pressure, pulse rate, and laboratory values) will be compiled by treatment descriptively in form of means with standard deviation (standard error), 95%-confidence intervals, maximum and minimum values calculated per time points on observed values and changes pre-dose/ post-dose.
All AEs recorded during the study will be coded according to the Medical terminology for Drug Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) and assigned to an organ system class. AEs will be listed
individually per administration. Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events will be
summarized using frequency of events and number of subjects experiencing these events per administration, lowest level term, preferred term, system organ class and intensity.
The concomitant medications will be coded according to the WHO drug code. They will besummarized for each treatment by tabulating the number and percentages of subjects having received each treatment.
All pharmacokinetic concentrations and parameters will be presented descriptively for each administration and treatment group.
Descriptive statistics comprise N, mean, geometric mean, SD, SEM, median, coefficient of
variation (CV%,) minimum and maximum. Plasma concentrations will be described in addition per treatment and per time point. Values below LLQ will be taken as zero for descriptive statistics of concentrations.
Individual plasma concentration-time profiles will be plotted by treatment. Arithmetic mean of plasma concentrations will be plotted with SD per administration. Plots will be provided in linear and semi-logarithmic scale.
Pharmacokinetic dose proportionality for EU-C-001 and its metabolites will be assessed by
correlating pharmacokinetic parameters with dose, if possible.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this trial, the safety and tolerability of a EU-C-001 is being evaluated.  Additionally the amount of study drug and its metabolites is being measured in blood and  urine after it is administered by different routes and at different dose levels. This is a phase 1 study in healthy subjects. It is planned to develop the drug for reducing pressure in the brain of patients with a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Increased pressure following TBI can lead to death or can cause permanent disability. There are currently no medications that are approved for improving outcomes after TBI. The drug will also be tested for improving clinical outcome in patients that suffered a concussion.
The study drug being evaluated is called EU-C-001 and is being developed by an Australian company called PresSura Neuro. Studies in animals have shown that EU-C-001 may reduce pressure in the brain. Therefore, it is thought that EU-C-001 may improve outcomes in patients with TBI by increasing the amount of oxygen available to brain tissue. In other studies it was shown that the EU-C-001 may also have potential to improve outcomes in patients with concussion.
