  <interventions>
    <interventions>Contoured inserts:  Commercially-available, full-length prefabricated foot orthoses (Vasyli Custom Red, Vasyli International, Labrador, Australia) will be inserted into the participants shoes. These contoured inserts are made of high density (shore A 75 degrees) ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), have an inbuilt arch support, and a 6 degree varus wedge as specified by the manufacturer. A full length piece of Cambrelle [Registered Trademark] (Camtex Fabrics Ltd, United Kingdom) will be applied to the top of the insert to standardize the appearance of the intervention and control inserts.

Participants will attend a single 2.5hr testing appointment at La Trobe University, where a registered Podiatrist with 5 years experience will fit one pair of contoured inserts. Participants will be asked to wear the inserts as much as possible for the study duration (6 weeks), and can transfer the inserts to other footwear. This reflects current clinical practice, and will ensure maximal wear time and potential effects.  Participants will be contacted by the Podiatrist 4-7 days after fitting, and offered a follow-up appointment (30min) at La Trobe University to amend any issues with the inserts (e.g. to improve comfort). They will be encouraged to contact the Podiatrist at any time during the follow-up period if they experience any issues with the inserts.

Adherence to the intervention will be assessed daily via a paper-based diary. Participants will provide information regarding the number of hours per day and number of days per week they have worn their shoe inserts during the 6 weeks. </interventions>
    <comparator>Flat inserts: Participants allocated to the control group will receive a single pair of flat shoe inserts. These are designed to have minimal mechanical effects on the patellofemoral joint, and will control for the contouring of the intervention insert. The flat inserts will also be made of high density EVA (shore A 75 degrees), but will be of uniform thickness along the length (3mm), and have no inbuilt arch or wedging. A full length piece of Cambrelle [Registered Trademark] (Camtex Fabrics Ltd, United Kingdom) will be applied to the top of the insert to standardize the appearance of the intervention and control inserts. 

Participants will attend an individual testing appointment at La Trobe University, where a registered Podiatrist with 5 years experience will fit one pair of contoured inserts. Participants will be asked to wear the inserts as much as possible for the study duration (6 weeks), and can transfer the inserts to other footwear. This reflects current clinical practice, and will ensure maximal wear time and potential effects.  Participants will be contacted by the Podiatrist 4-7 days after fitting, and offered a follow-up appointment at La Trobe University to amend any issues with the inserts (e.g. to improve comfort). They will be encouraged to contact the Podiatrist at any time during the follow-up period if they experience any issues with the inserts.

Adherence to the intervention will be assessed daily via a paper-based diary. Participants will provide information regarding the number of hours per day and number of days per week they have worn their shoe inserts during the 6 weeks. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee biomechanics:
Kinematic data will be acquired using skin-based markers and a three-dimensional motion capture system (Vicon), while ground-embedded force plates will capture ground reaction force data simultaneously. Participants will perform level overground walking and stair ascent/descent under three conditions (random order): (i) shoes alone; (ii) contoured inserts; and (iii) flat inserts. Knee kinematics and joint torques will be calculated using standard procedures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate effects (baseline)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility:
Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating willingness of participants to enrol; number of eligible participants; recruitment rate; adherence with allocated shoe insert and log-book completion; adverse effects; and drop-out rate.  The Podiatrist who fits the shoe inserts will record the number of additional appointments required, prescription notes and adverse effects during fitting and follow-up. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through to 6 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee pain severity:
This will be evaluated during biomechanical testing (walking, stair ascent/descent) in both shoe insert conditions and the participants own shoe, using a 100mm visual analogue scales. For pain, terminal descriptors 0mm = no pain, 100mm = worst pain possible. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate effects (baseline)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee confidence:
This will be evaluated during biomechanical testing (walking, stair ascent/descent) in both shoe insert conditions and the participants own shoe, using a 100mm visual analogue scales. For confidence, terminal descriptors 0mm = very confident, 100mm = not confident at all.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate effects (baseline)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Credibility of treatment:
This will be evaluated using the Borkovec and Nau questionnaire which consists of 6 items related to the credibility and expectancy of treatment received. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 6 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use of co-interventions:
Participants will use a daily log-book to record the use of any interventions outside those allocated in the study (e.g. rescue medication such as paracetamol; other treatments such as physiotherapy, osteopathy etc.)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily for 6 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS):
KOOS is a disease-specific, patient-completed questionnaire consisting of 5 subscales: pain, symptoms, function in daily activities, function in sport/recreation, and knee-related quality of life. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the immediate biomechanical effects of shoe inserts in those with kneecap arthritis, as well as the feasibility of conducting a larger scale clinical trial. Thirty-two participants will be recruited from the Melbourne community, and will remain blinded to the intervention and study hypotheses for the duration of the study. 
 
To investigate the immediate biomechanical effects of shoe inserts in those with kneecap arthritis, a within subject, repeated measures study design will be used. The immediate effects of different shoe inserts on lower limb biomechanics will be obtained using a three-dimensional motion capture system during the baseline appointment. Participants will perform walking and stair-stepping tasks while wearing three different shoe insert conditions applied in a random order: (i) own footwear; (ii) own footwear with contoured shoe inserts; and (iii) own footwear with flat shoe inserts. 

To determine the feasibility of conducting a larger scale clinical trial, a parallel group randomised trial with two groups and a 6 week follow up will be used. Following the study of the immediate biomechanical effects of the shoe inserts, participants will then be randomly assigned to one of two shoe insert conditions (contoured inserts, flat inserts), which they will take home and wear in their usual footwear for 6 weeks. The feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial will be assessed via willingness of participants to enrol in the study, the number of participants who qualify for the study, adherence with use the allocated shoe inserts, shoe insert diary completion, frequency and types of adverse effects, participant attrition, and treatment credibility. The Podiatrist who fits the shoe inserts will record the number of additional appointments required, prescription notes, and adverse effects during fitting and follow-up appointments (if required). Measures of pain severity, function, quality of life, and overall improvement will inform calculation of sample sizes for future larger-scale clinical trials. </summary>
