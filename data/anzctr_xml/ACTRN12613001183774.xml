  <interventions>
    <interventions>All suitable patients with arthritis of the glenohumeral joint causing  marked decrease in quality of life were operated on and had the Affinis Short stem prosthesis implanted.
The Affinis Short Stem  glenoid component is double pegged, curved back polyethylene. The stem is titanium with bioactive calcium phosphate coating and on growth surface. The surgical procedure takes about 2 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Shoulder arthritis can be extremely painful and debilitating and impact on a person's work and life. A solution in appropriate patients is the replace the ball and socket joint of the shoulder and so reduce pain and improve mobility. Historically these replacements have had a long stem in the humerus (long bone of the upper arm) and a new socket in the shoulder where the glenoid bone is.  The developments in hip surgery with the replacement of the hip ball and socket, includes a stem which is now much shorter. It is postulated this results in less pain in the femur and may decrease the possibility of mid shaft fracture around the base of the stem.  The development in shoulder prostheses has adopted the same concept. Short stem prostheses have been used for several years and this study is not experimental.  This study will evaluate whether in this Australian population the short stem has greater efficacy than the published studies of the long stem prosthesis in total shoulder replacement.</summary>
