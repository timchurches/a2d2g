  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies have shown potentially higher exposure to fluticasone furoate in Japanese
      subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. The reasons for these potential differences are
      unclear. Therefore this study is being done to look at and compare how fluticasone furoate is
      processed by the body in healthy Caucasian, Japanese, Korean and Chinese subjects after
      inhaled and intravenous administration. The data obtained will be used to help in the
      clinical development of the drug in Japanese and other East Asian populations.</summary>
