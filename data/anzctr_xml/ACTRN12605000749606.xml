  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Australian Physiotherapy Association has received funding from the Department of Education and Training (DE&amp;T) to conduct a motor skills training program for Victorian children who do not receive assistance under the Program for Students with Disabilities (PSD).   Students who do not qualify for assistance under the PSD have movement disorders that prevent them from fully participating in school activities but are insufficiently severe to attract government support.  These students are intellectually competent and will have to compete with people without physical disabilities in future education, training and employment.  The motor skills project will evaluate the effect of a motor skills training program specifically on motor skills acquisition and self perception.  Participants will be aged 6- 14 years old and randomly allocated to one of the following groups:
Group A: Training program comprising of occupational therapy conducted weekly over six weeks followed by physiotherapy conducted weekly over six weeks
Group B: Training program comprising of physiotherapy conducted twice weekly over six weeks followed by occupational therapy conducted twice weekly over six weeks
Physiotherapy will consist of lower limb strength and endurance training
Occupational therapy will consist of upper limb dexterity training
It is anticipated that the training program will be conducted over two school terms.
The outcomes measures used are the Goal Attainment Scale and the Self Perception Profile for Children / Adolescents.  Assessment will take place before the intervention commences, at 6 weeks, at its conclusion and one and three months post completion.  Assessors will be unaware which group each participant has been allocated to.</summary>
