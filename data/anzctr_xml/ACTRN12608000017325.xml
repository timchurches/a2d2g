  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an 11 x 2 hour session group program, with structured learning and practice activities.  The program is based in cognitive behavioural theory, and strategies include psycho-education, stress management/inoculation, cognitive restructuring, goal setting, behaviour rehearsal, modeling, and self-monitoring.  Home assignments will build on information presented in the sessions and include self-monitoring and skills practice.   One 2 hour session will be on physical activity counselling</interventions>
    <comparator>The resilience training + physical activity counselling will be compared with resilience training without physical activity counselling</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be volunteers recruited from staff from Education Queensland Townsville District, using information sessions and electronic communication. Individuals who are currently feeling distressed or depressed by work/family stress, life dissatisfaction or social isolation will be specifically invited to apply to participate. Respondents will be screened over the telephone by a research assistant (RA). The RA will provide eligible respondents with further details of the study, seek verbal consent, and schedule baseline assessment. Participants attending baseline assessment will be informed of the specific study requirements and asked to provide written consent before any data is collected. Participants completing baseline assessment will be randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions by the RA using a computer generated random number. Allocation is therefore concealed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression and poor social support are significant risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD), and acute life-event stressors can trigger coronary events.   People experiencing such psychosocial difficulties are also more likely to be physically inactive, which is itself an independent risk factor for CHD.  It is important therefore, to trial innovative heart health programs that promote both psychosocial functioning and physical activity.  Resilience training programs offer a means by which to enhance resistance to stressors and improve psychosocial functioning, but do not directly address physical activity.  In this study we propose to investigate (i) whether a resilience program designed for adults in the general population can improve psychosocial functioning and lower CHD risk indicators, and (ii) the added value of including a component to promote physical activity.  If successful, the results from this trial will demonstrate an innovative means by which to prevent CHD in the general population.</summary>
