    <summary>This phase II trial studies how well sunitinib malate works in treating younger patients with
      recurrent, refractory, or progressive malignant glioma or ependymoma. Sunitinib malate may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.</summary>
