  <interventions>
    <interventions>This pilot / Phase I study aimed to develop a nurse-led psychosocial intervention with peer support to reduce anxiety, psychosocial and psychosexual needs and symptom distress of women receiving radiotherapy for gynaecological cancers. The intervention consists of 3 nurse consultations (pre-treatment, mid-treatment, end-of-treatment); 5 peer support consultations (phone) (pre-treatment, mid-treatment, end-of-treatment, 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment). The overall duration of the intervention is approximately 12 weeks. Consultations will take less than 1 hour. The intervention group will also receive usual care.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involved the development and pilot / phase I testing of a psychoeducational intervention involving tailored nursing consultations combined with peer telephone support to address the psychosocial needs of women with gynaecological cancer being treated with radiotherapy. The intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable to patients and clinicians. This intervention was then further modified and is being tested in a larger RCT to identify whether the support program reduces psychological distress, unmet supportive care needs, psychosexual difficulties, and improves quality of life and adherence to dilator use. 
The ACTRN is the initial development &amp; pilot testing phase is: ACTRN12609000312246. 
A second ACTRN is for the phase III trial for which this study was the initial development &amp; pilot testing phase has also been submitted: ACTRN12611000744954.
