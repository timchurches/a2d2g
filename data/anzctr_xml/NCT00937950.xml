Experimental: Cervarix Group - Subjects vaccinated with 3 doses of Cervarix in the NCT00122681 study, who displayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV infection or were pregnant, so that no cervical sample could be collected at their last visit.


Treatment: surgery: Gynaecological follow-up
Subjects will receive a gynaecological follow-up with cytology and oncogenic HPV DNA testing every 12 months, for up to four years.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to enrolment.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study.

             following criteria:

          -  displayed normal cervical cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV infection at
             her last NCT 00122681 study visit (Visit 10, Month 48).

        or

         was pregnant at her last visit of the NCT 00122681 study (Visit 10, Month 48) so that no
        cervical sample could be collected at that visit.</inclusivecriteria>

             HPV infection at her last NCT 00122681 study visit (Visit 10, Month 48).

          -  A subject who had a cervical lesion at her last NCT 00122681 study visit (Visit 10,
             Month 48) or who had a cervical lesion that required treatment at the NCT 00122681
             exit colposcopy.

          -  A subject for whom the cervical cytology results from the last NCT 00122681 study
             visit (Visit 10, Month 48) were unavailable for reasons other than pregnancy.

        If at the time of enrolment the subject experiences heavy bleeding (menstruation or other)
        or heavy vaginal discharge, or is pregnant, the pelvic exam cannot be performed. The
        subject's first study visit will be deferred until condition is resolved according to
        investigator's medical judgment.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed provide up to four years of annual oncogenic HPV DNA testing and
      cervical cytology examination for NCT 00122681 study subjects who displayed normal cervical
      cytology but tested positive for oncogenic HPV infection at their last NCT 00122681 study
      visit (Visit 10, Month 48).

      This follow-up study will also be offered to subjects who were pregnant at their last NCT
      00122681 study visit (Visit 10, Month 48) so that no cervical sample could be collected at
      that visit.

      The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase (study 008/580299) are presented in a
      separate protocol posting (NCT00122681).</summary>
