  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Asia, osteoporosis is rapidly increasing amongst postmenopausal women with the subsequent increasing risk of hip fracture.  Low calcium intake has been reported as one of the risk factors for osteoporosis amongst Asian women. In short-term studies, the measurement of biochemical markers to assess bone turnover offers an accepted means of determining the effect of a treatment or dietary supplement on bone metabolism prior to any significant change in actual bone density. In general, changes in levels of biochemical markers are well correlated with changes in bone density in post-menopausal women.  The impact of a high calcium vitamin D fortified milk drink on biochemical markers of bone turnover has been recently assessed in two clinical trials. These were conducted in Indonesia and the Philippines, and clearly showed an immediate impact of the milk on reducing bone resorption and bone turnover in post-menopausal women. The purpose of the current study is to compare the effect of the high calcium milk drink with added vitamin D  versus a placebo drink supplementation, on serum parathyroid hormone and blood mineral levels as well as markers of bone formation/ resorption in postmenopausal Chinese women over three months.</summary>
