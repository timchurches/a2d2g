    <statisticalmethods>For the primary outcome measures (fT3 and fT4), we will make pairwise comparisons of data employing t- or z-testing.  If the immunoassay and LCMSMS assay are shown to return systematically different values, an exploratory analysis will follow to estimate the effect of quetiapine concentration as a covariate in multiple regression. 
There are no estimates available for the mean and variance of the immunoassay-LCMSMS difference. A power calculation that is based on comparison of immunoassay results in a recruited quetiapine-treated population to the known general population characteristics (the laboratorys calculated normal value distribution) for fT4 was done, to get an upper estimate for numbers required to demonstrate a clinically meaningful difference. 
The laboratory range for fT4 (9 -19 pmol/L) includes values within 2sd below and above the population mean, implying that mean = 14 and sd = 2.5 pm/L. A clinically significant difference in fT4 is 2.5 pmol/L. Assuming that the sample standard deviation = mean and taking fT4 to be a continuous variable, a sample of 16 patients will give at 80% power to detect the clinically relevant difference of 2.5 pm/L in fT4 at alpha = 0.05, 2-tailed. The study of 20 patients should therefore give a sufficiently precise estimate of the mean difference, particularly since paired comparisons, rather than unpaired comparisons, will be possible. The resulting data will then allow a decision on whether to proceed to a subsequent phase of this study program, which is to examine changes in fT4 over time. .

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Quetiapine is a commonly-prescribed drug with a good safety margin that is prescribed in psychotic illnesses, agitation and anxiety. Thyroid function is commonly checked in patients with psychotic disorders and signs of anxiety. We have observed that some patients taking quetiapine have low results on measure of free thyroid hormone level in blood, even though there is no other evidence that their thyroid function is impaired. We suspect this is because the quetiapine is interfering with the laboratory test, but it might actually be a biological effect of the quetiapine and potentially important to quetiapines adverse effects on metabolism.
In this project, we will first ask 20 patients who are already taking quetiapine to provide us with one specimen of blood each to check thyroid function. 
In a subsequent part of the study (which has a different registration on the ANZ Clinical Trials Registry), we will also ask a further 20 patients in whom their treating psychiatrist has already made the clinical decision to commence quetiapine as part of their management plan, to provide us with a specimen of blood to check thyroid function on 4 occasions (prior to quetiapine commencement, 1 day following commencement of quetiapine, and  at weeks 3 and 6 ).
We will firstly check to see whether our impression, that free thyroid hormone tests are reading lower in patients on quetiapine by the current test, is correct. The current test is an immunoassay. Then we will use the same blood specimens to measure free thyroid hormone level by another newer, highly specific test (LCMSMS) that is not open to interference in the way immunoassays may be. A comparison of the results will tell us whether the problem is simply immunoassay interference from quetiapine.
