Treatment: devices - other stented biological valve

Experimental: Perceval - The Perceval sutureless aortic heart valve (Perceval valve) is a bioprosthesis manufactured with bovine pericardium and assembled on a Nitinol stent. The Perceval valve is designed to offer an alternative to surgically implanted flexible prostheses (stented and stentless biological valves). A special feature of the device is that it is self-anchoring and does not require sutures to be fixed to the implant site.

Active Comparator: other Stented biological valves - The comparator will be other commercially approved standard biological sutured stented valves, both bovine and porcine. The choice of the comparator tissue valve will be at the discretion of the participating investigators.


Treatment: devices: Perceval valve
Sutureless Aortic Biological Valve

Treatment: devices: other stented biological valve
Any biological stented valves available on the market (Edwards, Medtronic, St.Jude, LivaNova, Labcor)
