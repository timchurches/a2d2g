  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a low-intensity internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) program, the Chronic Conditions Course, which aims to help people to manage anxiety and depression and the impacts of functional gastrointestinal disorders.

The Course consists of:

(a)	5 online lessons provided over 8 weeks.
(b)	A homework summary with assignments for each lesson
(c)	Additional written resources that can be downloaded and which include information about other important skills, such as assertiveness and communication skills and techniques for managing sleep difficulties.
(d)	Case Stories based on previous participants, which they can follow throughout the Course.
(e)	Brief weekly contact with a Psychologist via secure email or telephone.

Participants will be encouraged to complete a lesson every 10 days and to read through a summary of the lesson and complete some basic homework in the following 10 days. Participants will have the option of  being contacted by a Psychologist by phone or email each week for support with working through the course; each eCentreClinic Psychologist receives 1 hour or more of weekly supervision from another eCentreClinic Psychologist in which all of their participants are reviewed; as per best-practice guidelines and eCentreClinic Policy.

The Chronic Conditions Course is based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) principles and teaches evidence-based skills for managing disability, anxiety and depression associated with chronic health conditions. Each lesson takes between 10 and 20 minutes to complete and it is suggested that participants read each lesson at least twice and spend approximately 3 hours, across the week, practicing the skills taught. Telephone calls will be limited to approximately 10 minutes per week; however, more time will be provided where clinically indicated. Adherence (e.g., logins, lesson completion, lesson views, time spent on course) will be monitored via the eCentreClinic software, which is used to provide the Chronic Conditions Course.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a pilot study of the acceptability, efficacy and feasibility of a low-intensity internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) self-management program, the Chronic Conditions Course, in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression adults with functional gastrointestinal disorders. The proposed trial employs a single-group open-trial design (n = 30) and participants will be given access to an internet-delivered CBT Course; a 5-lesson 8 week self-management program. Participants will have brief weekly contact with a Clinical Psychologist as they work through the Course.</summary>
