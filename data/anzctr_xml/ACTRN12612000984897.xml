  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) administered in groups of 4 to 6 people with SCI by two clinical psychologists in each of the two SCI Units. Sessions consist of 2 hours per week for a period of 6 to 8 consecutive weeks, with a maximum of 8 sessions. All participants receiving group CBT also receive standard rehabilitation treatment. If a participant misses a session due to say illness, then they will receive an individual treatment session on the topic missed, equivalent to the group session.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SCI results in severe impairment and is managed by a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach. Unless sensitive and timely psychosocial assessment occurs, serious
complications may not be identified or appropriately managed. This project will investigate the following within the Statewide SCI Units in Sydney: 
* develop and pilot a standardised psychosocial assessment schedule that can be used to monitor progress, set goals and detect psychosocial risks in people with SCI; 
* assess the efficacy of a multi-layered psychosocial cognitive behavioural therapy self-management rehabilitation package to be run as a service programme during inpatient rehabilitation in the SCI Units in Sydney</summary>
