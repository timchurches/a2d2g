  <interventions>
    <interventions>"Positive Parenting for Healthy Living Triple P" is a brief parent education and skills-training program that combines parenting information about child behaviour and illness management with the provision of illness relevant information. The intervention consists of two, 2-hour group seminars designed to target the direct and indirect pathways of parenting impact on child outcomes - i.e. parenting practices, and parenting confidence and stress. Seminars are delivered two weeks apart. Seminar content draws on the theoretical principles that form the basis of the well-established Triple P program, which is a preventively orientated parenting and family support strategy derived from social-learning, functional analysis, and cognitive-behavioural principles.</interventions>
    <comparator>Care as usual. Families allocated to the care as usual condition will continue to receive regular medical managment from their primary care physician, as appropriate. After the final 6-month follow-up assessment families will be offered participation in the program.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Every day, thousands of Australian children suffer the effects of asthma and eczema and families struggle with illness management and children's behavioural and emotional adjustment. Many parents experience difficulties with their caregiving role and lack confidence in their ability to manage their child's illness and ensure their wellbeing. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, group-based parenting intervention for parents of children with asthma or eczema. It is expected that participating in a group-based parenting intervention has the potential to reduce ineffective and coercive parenting practices, and lead to improved child behavioural and emotional adjustment, better family wellbeing, and healthier children.</summary>
