    <interventions>Cross-sectional study with a sample of convenience of 70 participants of the Project for the Promotion of Health of the Elderly. Photogrammetry and flexicurve method were used to evaluate the standard posture of the volunteers. The level of older womens physical activity was evaluated by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Single 90 minute assessment session was performed. the overall duration of this trial was 8 months.</interventions>
