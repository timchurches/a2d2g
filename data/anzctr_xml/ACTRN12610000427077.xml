    <interventions>Comparison of conventional high-flux dialysis (HF80 polysulfone membrane) with helixone high-flux dialysis (FX series polysulfone membrane). The FX series membrane has a higher molecular flux enabling greater clearance of middle molecules compared to the standard high flux membranes. All participants will maintain their standard dialysis regime (duration of dialysis per session, sessions per week and blood flow speed). The only difference between groups is the dialysis membrane used for the 12 month period</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effects of the dialyser membrane on markers of plasma protein and lipid oxidation, inflammatory markers including pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules over a 12 month period. The primay outcome is a composite of the measures of oxidative stress listed below
Protein thiols are measured colorimetrically. Protein-bound dityrosine fluorescence and protein-bound lipofuscin-like fluorophores are measured fluorometrically. Protein carbonyls are measured colorimetrically. Plasma oxidised low density lipoproteins are measured by immunoassay. Protein peroixdes are measured enzymatically. Plasma C reactive protein is measured by high sensitivity immunoturbidimetric assay. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) are measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients were recruited from 2 low dependency satellite dialysis units by nephrology staff. Following a 1 month run in low flux polysulfone dialysis membranes they were randomly allocated to either conventional high-flux dialysis membranes (HF80) or helixone high flux dialysis membranes (HF series).
Allocation was by a third party off site and independent of the investigators</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was performed by a third party matching an alphabetical list of eligible screening  participantts to a computer generated random number list in a single block. (Prism 4 for windows).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis to be tested by this study is that the improved clearance of middle molecules (thought to be important uremic toxins) by the new FX 80 membrane would lead to less oxidative stress and inflammation when compared to dialysis using a standard hig-flux membrane.</summary>
