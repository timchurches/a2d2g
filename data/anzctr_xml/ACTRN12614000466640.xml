  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be two high saturated fat muffins (40% total fat of which 50% is saturated fat) differing in saturated fatty acid chain lengths.

One muffin will be higher in long chain saturated fatty acids (99% long chain and 1% short chain) and one will be lower in long chain saturated fatty acids (70% long chain and 30% short chain). The total grams of fat will be approximately 46grams.  
 


</interventions>
    <comparator>The control/comparator muffin will be a high fat monounsaturated fat muffin (40% total fat of which 70% is monounsaturated). The total grams of fat will be approximately 46 grams. 

All of the three test muffins will be isocaloric (~3500kj) and have similar macronutrient content (40% fat, 15% protein and 45% CHO). The total grams of fat will be approximately 46 grams in each muffin serve. 

There will be three study mornings. On the first two mornings the participants will randomly receive one of the two saturated fat muffins They will then be asked to come back on a third morning to receive the monounsaturated fat muffin. There will be a minimum of a 1 week washout period between each visit.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through voluntary response from advertisements placed in the community, social media or by personal approach.  
1. Volunteers will express their interest to participate by sending an email or making a telephone call to the researcher listed on the advertisement. The interested volunteer will then be sent an explanatory statement and consent form
2. Initial screening will be conducted by telephone call or email and will involve answering questions relating to the inclusion criteria
3. If volunteers meet all the inclusion criteria, they will be asked to make an appointment to have a site visit to complete the screening and consent process. 
4. The volunteer will have the opportunity to ask any further questions before agreeing to complete the screening procedures and participate in the study by signing the consent form. This screening visit will take approximately 30 minutes. The participants will be required to fast for at least 10 hours the night before to facilitate the fasting blood glucose and lipid screening tests.  At this visit the volunteer will have their waist, height and weight measured and fasting finger prick blood samples collected to confirm all eligibility criteria have been met. Given these measurements meet all inclusion criteria; this will complete the screening process and the participant will be invited to enrol into the study.

    <statisticalmethods>Thirteen healthy male overweight and obese volunteers aged 18-40 years old will be required to complete the study. This number is based on energy expenditure levels reported in the literature, to detect a 25% difference in energy expenditure after an isocaloric SFA and MUFA breakfast meal at a power of 80%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to understand the effect of high saturated fat meals differing in saturated fatty acid chain length on energy expenditure and fat metabolism. Evidence suggests that not all fats are metabolised in the same way and not necessarily equivalent in the way they behave to maintain energy balance in the body. Ingesting fats that have a propensity to increase biological energy expenditure, fat oxidation and fullness may ultimately have beneficial effects on body weight control. It is postulated that individuals will find it easier to make changes in the types of fat they eat rather than total amount of fat when aiming to control body weight, especially in adulthood when dietary preferences can already be quite ingrained.
