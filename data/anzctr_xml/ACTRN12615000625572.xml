    <interventions>Eligible and consented patients will be randomly allocated to receive an intravenous injection of  0.04 mg/kg (total body weight) upto a maximum of 5 mg midazolam immediately prior to the sedation with intravenous propofol.The dose of propofol will be titrated by the administering anaesthetist to a sedation level suitable to perform the procedure. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of cognitive recovery as measured by Postoperative quality of recovery ( Postop QRS) questionnaire. The definition of recovery is a return to baseline values or better in all of the recovery domains, with adjustment for performance variability in the cognitive domain
The Postoperative Quality of Recovery Scale (PostopQRS) is a brief tool that has been widely used in many studies to assess quality of recovery in multiple domains at various time points. The final version of PostopQRS consists of six domains (physiologic, nociceptive, emotive, activities of daily living, cognitive and overall patient perspective). </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Adult patients undergoing colonoscopy at the Prince Charles Hospital will be recruited for this study prior to but on the day of the procedure. Letters to the patient informing about the study will be posted to the patient a few days before the surgery. These patients will be contacted either at the colon consent clinic or on the day of the procedure to sign the consent for the study. This is  a parallel randomized trial with allocation ratio 1:1 </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization table will be produced using a computer generated randomization sequence. Concealment will be by placing the card containing the allocation information in double opaque sealed envelopes.  A non-participant in any process of the study will perform preparation of the envelopes. Concealment will be maintained until after recruitment and patient is admitted for the procedure. A non-investigator medical or nursing staff/research coordinator will then open the envelopes to reveal the allocation. The trial preparation will be drawn in a syringe by a non-investigator anaesthetist or nurse, labeled as “trial drug” and documented as “trial drug” in the chart. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using the chi-squared analysis for difference in the incidence of recovery in the cognitive domain at day 3.  For recovery across all time points for each domain, the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test will be used to examine the difference in the proportions of recovery between the groups with continuity correction over the different time periods. Continuous data will be analysed using independent samples t test, or repeated measures ANOVA for repeated measurements. The level of significance will be defined as p&lt;0.05. Based on the previous studies, the cognitive recovery on day 3 is around 70% in elderly patients. Considering that an absolute difference of 15% would constitute significant difference between groups and using a two-tailed design, a sample size of n= 174 per group will provide a power of 80% with an alpha value of 0.05. 400 patients will be recruited to compensate for the dropouts and loss to follow up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing day surgery procedures are usually discharged the same day. They are not assessed further unless they come back for follow up or they have some medical or surgical complications. The recovery from general anaesthesia can vary considerably between individuals. Due to paucity of randomized trials, it is unclear if the brief anaesthesia the patients receive for their surgery, can affect longer-term recovery (especially cognitive recovery). Midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, enhances the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), thereby acting as a neural inhibitor. It increases binding of GABA to GABA-a receptors that are highly concentrated in hippocampus.  It is widely used as anxiety relieving, sedative and as a premedicant. There are concerns about the residual effect of midazolam on the cognitive status of  patients following its administration as a part of anaesthetic induction.
In day surgery procedures, quality of recovery has profound implications for the individual patient and for the community, in terms of return to work and safe driving.  An ideal anaesthetic for day surgery procedures should not affect the mental capabilities for a long period of time. 
Our objective is to identify if administering midazolam in addition to propofol affects the recovery of cognitive function in patients undergoing elective colonoscopy.</summary>
