               4. Chemotherapy:

                  The following drugs must be stopped &gt; 1 week prior to CTL019 infusion and should

                  salvage chemotherapy (e.g. clofarabine, cytosine arabinoside &gt; 100 mg/m2,
                  anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide), excluding the required lymphodepleting

          -  Anti T-cell therapy: Administration of any T cell or toxic agent is strongly
             discouraged since residual lytic levels may destroy the infused CTL019 cell or prevent
             their in vivo expansion.
