Experimental: Resistant Hypertension - The catheter-based (device: Celsius® ThermoCool® RD) renal denervation will serve to treat resistant hypertension.


Treatment: devices: Celsius® ThermoCool® RD
The investigational device is designed to transmit radiofrequency (RF) current to the electrodes for ablation purposes, specifically for the treatment of resistant hypertension by renal denervation.
