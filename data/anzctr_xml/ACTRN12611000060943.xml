  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will consume a 75 mg dose of resveratrol (resVida 'Trademark (TM)', DSM Nutritional Products, Switzerland) daily for 6 weeks. This supplement will be delivered orally in capsule form.
There will be three separate visits to the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre (of 2 hours duration each), baseline, week 6 then crossed over to alternate dose (active or placebo), then assessments at week 12. There is no washout between the active and placebo arm.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsules are identical in appearance to the active capsules but contain an inert filler consisting of Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) of various particle sizes including Prosolv 50 and talcum powder (hydrated magnesium silicate). This supplement will be delivered orally in capsule form. 
There will be three separate visits to the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre (of 2 hours duration each), baseline, week 6 then crossed over to alternate dose (active or placebo), then assessments at week 12.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Degree of change in vasodilator function assessed by flow mediated dilatation in the brachial artery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There will be 5 assessments at three time points. Baseline, week 6, then crossover to alternate dose (active or placebo), then assessment at week 12, plus an acute supplementation assessment at week 6 and 12. The acute assessments will be performed after the chronic assessments have been made on a given visit. The purpose of these measures is to determine an acute effect may be potentiated by the chronic exposure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Stroop test. This test requires participants to read the names of colours and then name the colours in which incongruent colour names are printed. The ratio between time taken to name colours compared with reading colour names reflects the degree of interference afforded by suppressing the habit of reading words in order to name colours. Uncorrected errors during the colour naming trial reflect failures of inhibition.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There will be 3 assessments at baseline, week 6, then crossover to alternate dose (active or placebo), then an assessment at week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Supine blood pressure, heart rate and arterial compliance will be recorded with the Hypertension Diagnostics Cardiovascular Profiling Iinstrument (CR2000), after lying quietly for at least 10 min. Four consecutive readings will be taken at 1 min intervals by a single observer. The first reading will be discarded and an average of the remaining measurements will be taken</outcome>
      <timepoint>There will be 3 assessments at baseline, week 6, then crossover to alternate dose (active or placebo), then an assessment at week 12</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the general population by newspaper advertisements, flyers, electronic mail advertisements and radio/television announcements. Volunteers will be screened via questionnaire to assess their eligibility for the trial. Eligibility will be determined by the study coordinator. Volunteers will be required to consume each supplement (active or placebo) daily for 6 weeks, then crossed over to alternate dose, the order will be determined by a random number generator. Doses will be allocated a letter A or B for identification. The identity of the supplement will be held by an individual separate to the study and will not be decoded until all the data has been analysed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well established that obesity can lead to impaired vascular function. This not only leads to cardiovascular health consequences but may also impact on cognitive function by impairing the delivery of blood flow to the brain. 
We have recently demonstrated an acute, dose dependent improvement of flow mediated dilatation (FMD) with resveratrol supplementation (ACTRN12609000023257). However, the effects of chronic supplementation are still unknown. FMD is a non-invasive means of assessing blood vessel function.
We will now determine whether regular daily consumption of resveratrol for 6 weeks can lead to a sustained improvement in FMD which may result in a decrease in resting BP and enhance cognitive performance. This could be particularly advantageous in potentially improving long term cardiovascular and mental health. The investigation will be undertaken in obese subjects as they are more likely to have impaired FMD without other established risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</summary>
