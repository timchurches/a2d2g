  <interventions>
    <interventions>Childhood serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels were measured in 2010 using serum samples taken in 1980 and stored at -20°C. Serum 25OHD levels were remeasured using serum samples taken in 2001 (1094 measured by 2003 and the rest during 2011) and 2007 (measured in 2008). The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study is a multi-centre population-based follow-up study of cardiovascular risk factors in Finland(Raitakari OT, Juonala M, Rönnemaa T, Keltikangas-Jarvinen L, Rasanen L, Pietikainen M, Hutri-Kahonen N, Taittonen L, Jokinen E, Marniemi J, et al. Cohort profile: the cardiovascular risk in Young Finns Study. Int J Epidemiol 2008;37(6):1220-6.). In 1980 (baseline), 3,596 participants aged 3-18 years were randomly selected from the national register of the study areas. They were followed up in 2001, 2007 and 2011, when 2283, 2204 and 2060 (aged 34-50 years) participants were re-examined, respectively.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (YFS) is one of the largest follow-up studies into cardiovascular risk from childhood to adulthood. The main aim of YFS is to determine the contribution made by childhood lifestyle, biological, and psychological measures to the risk of cardiovascular diseases in adulthood. In the current study, we used data from YFS to describle the association of childhood, as well as the average from childhood to adulthood, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with the risk of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes mellitus.</summary>
