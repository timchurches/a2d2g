Other: adalimumab - This study is a Phase 3, open-label multicenter study designed to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of adalimumab in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate-, posterior-, or pan-uveitis who have either discontinued from study M10-877 or M10-880 for having met "Treatment Failure" criteria or have successfully completed study M10-877 or M10-880.
Starting at Baseline, all subjects will receive open label adalimumab 40 mg eow SC regardless of treatment assignment in the randomized, double-masked studies M10-877 or M10-880.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is an unmet medical need in non-infectious intermediate-, posterior- and pan uveitis.
      These types of uveitis are at a higher risk for vision loss compared to anterior uveitis.
      Patients with these types of uveitis are often treated with chronic corticosteroids. The use
      of chronic corticosteroids is linked with predictable long-term side effects. The objective
      of this study is to evaluate the long term efficacy and safety of adalimumab subjects with
      non-infectious intermediate-, posterior- or pan-uveitis.</summary>
