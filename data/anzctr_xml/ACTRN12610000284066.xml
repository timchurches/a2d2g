  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in spite of traditional disease modifying medication like methotrexate, with high clinical and laboratory disease activiy as well as increased symptoms of RA, will, according to national guidelines, be requested for treatment with biological medication (if there are no contraindications). All the biological treatments are high-cost medications and includes anti-Tumor Necrosis Treatment (anti-TNF): infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira), golimumab (Simponi), anti-B-cell therapy; rituximab (MabThera), anti-T-cell therapy; abatacept (Orencia) and anti-Interleukin 6 (IL-6)(tocilizumab). The patient's rheumatologist will decide the indication for starting biological medication. Up till now clinical examination and assessment of inflammatory varibles (C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)) are used to examine the response to this expensive treatment. However, ultrasonography (US) is found to be a valid and reliable method for detecting arthritis (synovitis, effusion and vascularization) with sensitivity almost like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and highly more sensitive than clinical assessments. All the patients at dept. of rheumatology, Diakonhjemmet hospital, Oslo, Norway, starting one of the biological medications will be asked to participate in the present study. They will all be assessed by use of US of 36 joints (bilateral wrists; radiocarpal, intercarpal, radioulnar joints, MCP 1-5, PIP 2-3, elbow, knee, ankle; talocrural, MTP 1-5, extensor carpi ulnaris and tibialis posterior tendons) with scoring (semiquantitative 0-3) of the degree of synovitis and vascularization (power Doppler). In addition, the patients will be assessed traditionally (clinical, joint count, questionnaires, laboratory markers). All patients will be examined at baseline and after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months. Patients will be recruited consecutively during one year.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in spite of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) treatment should after international guidelines be treated with biological medication. The patients are followed regularly by use of clinical and laboratory examination to assess the response to treatment. Ultrasonography has been shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing the degree of inflammation (grey scale) and vascularization (power Doppler). The present study will explore ultrasonography as a method to differentiate between responders and non-responders early in the treatment period. In addition, the ultrasonographic findings will be compared to radiographic, laboratory and clinical responses to therapy.</summary>
