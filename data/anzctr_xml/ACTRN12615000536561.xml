  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be a composite of major CVD events: fatal and non-fatal acute coronary syndrome and ischaemic stroke, ascertained by linkage with AIHW and NDI. The following ICD-10 codes will be included: I20 (unstable angina), I21 (acute myocardial infarction) and I63 (cerebral infarction). Cardiovascular events will be assessed through data linkage to medical records.

    <concealment>There will be a mailout to community dwelling residents in the target age range through the Department of Human Services. Recruitment methods have been expanded to include social media (e.g. Facebook), health and medical websites (e.g. Stroke Foundation), and other means of promotion (e.g. Research Newsletters). Respondents will reply by completing a screening survey to ascertain eligibility by surface mail or via web. Once eligibility criteria are verified again at the clinic, randomisation will be stratified by gender and centre, using a web-based randomization system; allocation will also be concealed by this system as participants will be randomised to group A or B. The study Nurse will draw up the allocated study drug in a room away from the participant. Participants will receive active or control vaccination, the latter being a saline syringe identical in appearance to the vaccine.

</concealment>
    <sequence>There will be a computer generated randomisation system that will be accessed online. The randomisation will be stratified by each centre. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Due to slow recruitment (3000 over 1 year rather than 6000), the recruitment period has been extended to 2 years.  In order to accomodate a possible reduction in the total sample size, Power calculations have been modified to reflect a minimum total of 4500 people followed for a longer period, i.e 5 years after the end of recruitment (median of 6 years).  To accommodate the longer follow-up period, an interim analysis has been added 3 years after the end of follow-up (median 4 years).  The p-value for each of the 2 timepoints has been adjusted to 0.025 to preserve the total type I error.  . This will allow us to detect a hazard ratio of ~0.75 at 4 years and ~0.78 at 6 years, corresponding to a 25% and 22% reduction in CVD events respectively.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-centre trial to investigate the effects of the pneumococcal vaccination in the primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes. People aged 55 to 60 from 6 sites around Australia will be invited to participate in the study. The selected participants will attend a
clinic in their area and will be randomly given the pneumococcal vaccine or a placebo vaccine. Outcomes on the expected 6000 participants will
be ascertained by health record linkage with government databases after 5 years.</summary>

    <publication />
    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>There are multiple post-codes for recruitment. Each site will have postcodes within 25km radius of the main city postcode.

The participants are otherwise healthy in that they do not have any immunological or chronic diseases or the outcome of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the study is to see if the pneumococcal vaccine can prevent CVD in those at risk of CVD.</publicnotes>
