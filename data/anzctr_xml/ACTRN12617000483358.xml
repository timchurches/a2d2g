  <interventions>
    <interventions>A. Experimental group: Leuko@ tape on hip extensor and abductor of affected side limb. Control group: sham tape. After the taping applied, both groups will received the same exercise program include:  muscle strength strengthening, balance training, treadmill training . The 12 session will be conducted in 3 times weekly about 50 min for 4 weeks. All of the sessions is individual one-on-one sessions by one physiotherapist at the study site gym.
(a) Muscle strengthening program (15 min): subjects will doing hip extension (e.g. bridging), hip abduction in supine and side lying position on mat. Each movement will doing 10 repetition for 3 times. The resistance will be given with theraband on the lower extremities. The exercise intensity will be adjusted at 12-14/20 RPE.
(b) Balance training (15 min): subject will doing both static balance and dynamic balance movement like one-leg standing, tandem walk, kick ball, etc. Each movement will doing 3-5 times, focused on the quality of motor control.
(c) Treadmill training (15 min): treadmill speed started from 0.1 kph to comfortable gait speed. The intensity set at 12-14/20 RPE. The speed will be increasing step by step depended on the tolerance of subjects in 4 weeks.
The Taping procedure below:
a) Leuko@ tape have been proved that could provide properioception input, improve joint alignment and facilitate muscle firing. In this clinical trial, we use the Leuko@ tape to assist stroke patients to support affected lower limb on more weight bearing position.
b)  A physical therapist place the tape without any tension on the skin, but stabilize the muscle belly of hip muscle group in a shorten position. There are six bands on the hip extensors, and hip abductors. For the hip extensors, the first band from  the  medial  aspect  of  the  gluteal  fold,  pulled  laterally  and  superiorly  towards  the  greater  trochanter. The second band from  the  medial  aspect  of  the  gluteal  fold  to  the  top  of  the  buttock  above  the  gluteus  maximus  muscle  belly,  lifting  the  buttock. The third band, from  the  superior  end of the second piece of tape to the greater trochanter. For hip abductors, three bands of taping were applied from just below the greater trochanter. The first bands, directly upwards to the iliac crest. The second bands, upwards and anteriorally to the anterior superior iliac spine. The third bands, upwards and posteriorally towards the posterior third of the iliac crest. 

c) We changes a new tape at each training. 
d) We check the adherence by phone every day.
