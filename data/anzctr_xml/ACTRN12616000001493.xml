  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility study of increasing magnesium levels by supplementation for endocrine related cognitive problems in breast cancer. Assessed via the evaluation of recruitment, acceptability of the questionnaires, measurement of serum magnesium (free and total) and evaluation of cognitive performance measured by the NIH toolbox and questionnaires.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The feasibility of the study will be assessed after three months supplementation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To pilot the use of the NIH toolbox for measuring cognitive function in this NZ patient population. Acceptability of  the NIH toolbox will be assessed using an acceptability questionnaire designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the acceptability of the portfolio of patient related outcome questionnaires, including time commitments. Assessed using an acceptability questionnaire designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To pilot the use of an electronic-diary for collecting patient reported data on hot flushes. Acceptability of using an electronic version of a validated hot flush diary will be assessed using an acceptability questionnaire designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the best approach for measuring magnesium and compare changes over time and between treatment and control groups.  Comparative efficacy of two different laboratory tests for magnesium plasma levels will be assessed ( total levels analysed by routine biochemistry will be compared with  free levels of magnesium in  plasma analysed separately by the researchers).</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare baseline cognitive performance in patient groups receiving aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen therapy to determine whether both groups should be included in the definitive randomised trial.  Assessed using the NIH toolbox and validated questionnaires: Insomnia Severity Index , the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire and the Brief Fatigue Inventory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To provide a preliminary composite measure of changes in cognitive function and whether this correlates with changes in hot flushes, sleep patterns and fatigue during the study period.  Assessed using regression models to explore changes in cognitive function as measured  by the NIH toolbox and can be explained by changes in hot flush and/or sleep and fatigue scores (assessed through validated questionnaires -hot flush diary, Insomnia Severity Index  and the Brief Fatigue Inventory). Power will be limited but this will help in the specification of the analyses for the main study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the recruitment potential.  Assessed by the number of patients screened, the proportion of those meeting eligibility criteria, the number agreeing to take part in the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Number of patients randomised to the trial at the beginning of the supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To pilot the blood sample collection and storage in relation to magnesium measurement and future genetic studies relating to magnesium carrier status.  Assessed by collection of  blood samples from multiple sites and the number of samples provided..</outcome>
      <timepoint>Bloods collected at baseline and after one, two and three months of  supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To confirm the safety of magnesium in this clinical setting.  Assessed by measuring adverse events diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, urticaria according to CTCAE version 4.0 over the three month period.  Hypermagnesia assessed in blood samples collected at one, two and three months of supplementation.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>After three months supplementation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the acceptability of randomization and adherence to allocated regimen.  Assessed by the proportion of patients randomized who return to complete the three month assessment and their compliance measured by a pill count of returned bottles.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors letrazole, anastrozole and exemestane are commonly prescribed following surgery with the intent of reducing the likelihood that the breast cancer returns in the future. They work by blocking the effects of oestrogen &amp; progesterone, hormones found naturally in the body, including in the brain. Some side effects from taking these drugs are poor memory, difficulties with concentration and memory, hot flushes, sweating &amp; tiredness. Some researchers think that these memory and concentration problems are due to low oestrogen levels in the brain. Research shows that magnesium (Mg) levels in the body are controlled by oestrogen. We would like to find out if poor memory &amp; concentration in this group of women, may be caused by low Mg caused by low oestrogen. Mg is a mineral and is important for many functions in the body. We tend to get the Mg we need from our food. If our levels of Mg are low however, we can take it as a supplement. Some studies of people taking Mg
supplement have shown an improvement in their memory and concentration. Hot flushes &amp; tiredness in menopausal women have also been shown to reduce in some studies. We want to look at the effect of Mg on improving memory and concentration in women on endocrine therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. This study is a pilot study, to see if a larger one will work. We will look at the results of concentration and memory tests in women who have taken Mg and those who have taken a placebo. The participant, or the Dr, will not know if they are taking the Mg or placebo.
The results will give us a useful indication about whether supplementing the diet with Mg can help reduce some of the memory and concentration problems that women on endocrine therapy experience. We will also see if Mg helps with hot flushes and fatigue. We are looking to enrol 50 women for this pilot study in NZ.</summary>
