  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Treatment Discontinuation - An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of the relationship to the investigational medicinal product (IMP). SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was a medically important event. TEAEs were AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the TEAE period (time from first dose of IMP up to the end of follow-up period).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to the end of study (66 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved 20% Response in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Working Group Criteria for Response (ASAS20) - Treatment response for ASAS20 was defined as: Improvement of = 20% and = 1 unit on a 0 (least) to 10 (worst) numerical rating score (NRS) in at least 3 of the 4 ASAS improvement criteria (ASASIC) domains, and no worsening of = 20% and = 1 unit on 0-10 NRS in the remaining domain. The 4 domains included were participant's global disease activity assessment, total back pain, physical function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index), and Inflammation (mean of last 2 Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index questions on morning stiffness).</outcome>
