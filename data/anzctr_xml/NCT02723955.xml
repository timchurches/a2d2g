  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GSK3359609 is an anti-Inducible T cell Co-Stimulator (ICOS) receptor agonist antibody
      intended for the treatment of cancers of different histology. This is a first-time-in-human
      (FTIH), open-label. multicenter study designed to investigate the safety, pharmacology, and
      preliminary antitumor activity in subjects with advanced or recurrent solid tumors with the
      aim to establish recommended dose(s) of GSK3359609 for further exploration as monotherapy and
      in combination with pembrolizumab or other immune therapies. The study is comprised of two
      primary parts, each composed of two phases: Part 1: GSK3359609 monotherapy with Part 1A as
      dose escalation phase and Part 1B as dose expansion phase; Part 2: GSK3359609 combination
      therapy with Part 2A dose escalation phase and Part 2B dose expansion phase. Each part and
      phase of the study includes a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period.
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum
      tolerated dose or the maximum administered dose of GSK3359609 alone or in combination.</summary>
