  <interventions>
    <interventions>Postoperative enteral feeding plus standard postoperative diet.
During surgery an enteral feeding tube will be inserted through the patient's nose into their small bowel.  The location of the feeding tube is checked by the surgeon via palpation intra-operatively, as well as by plain x-ray postoperatively.  A standard fibre containing enteral nutrition formula (4.2kJ/ml) will be fed through the nasojejunal tube postoperatively.  Feeding will commence at a rate of 40mls/hr 4 hours after return to ward after surgery.  Feeds will remain at this rate for the first 24 hours.  The following day, feed rates will be increased to an individualised goal. The goal of enteral nutrition is to provide patients with 125 kilojoules per kilogram of body weight (adjusted using standard methodology for overweight patients). Patients randomised to early postoperative enteral feeding will be monitored daily by a nutritionist and will have their diet modified accordingly.
Patients randomised to postoperative enteral feeding can also commence standard postoperative diet on return to ward.  This usually involves sips of water and clear fluid commencing on the return to the ward after surgery. This "standard diet" may vary slightly from institution to institution.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard postoperative diet.
The standard postoperative care will apply with intravenous fluids and increase in diet as tolerated. Patients will be reviewed based on their dietetic requirements and as per the local practice.  
Standard postoperative diet usually consists of sips of water and clear fluids commencing on return to ward as tolerated by the patient.  This practice may vary slightly from institution to institution.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life.
This study will use the FACT-O, an ovarian cancer specific quality of life measurement.  This questionnaire will be completed by patients at Baseline, and at Follow Up #1 - 6 weeks after surgery, and Follow Up #2 - 30 days following the thirds cycle of postoperative chemotherapy.
The FACT-O is an ovarian cancer subscale that has been constructed to complement the FACT-G, addressing relevant disease, treatment, or condition related issues not already convered in the general FACT-G questionnaire.  Each is intended to be as specific as necessary to capture the clinically relevant problems associated with a given condition or symptom, yet general enough to allow for comparison across diseases, and extension, as appropriate to other chronic medical conditions.
The FACT-G was developed by the Centre on Outcomes, Research and Education (CORE) to determine the quality of life of cancer patients, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G).  
The FACT-O is a widely utilized quality of life questionnaire.  It is a self-report scale and allows patients to rate their current physical, functional, social/family, and emotional well-being.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment costs and cost effectiveness.
The purpose of the analysis is to estimate the length of stay in the hospital and the difference in cost outcomes between the two arms. Patients in the control arm will have some observed length of stay in hospital. Patients in the intervention arm will incur the marginal costs of the feeding and will have some observed length of stay in hospital. The question we seek to address is whether the cost of the feeding is offset by the cost savings from any reductions in length of stay in hospital.

A model will be built that describes cost outcomes for each group, and these will be expressed as probability distributions. The costs of feeding will be recorded for each participant of the intervention arm and either a normal or lognormal distribution fitted to these data. The length of stay in hospital will be recorded for all participants and gamma distributions fitted for the intervention and the control groups using the method of moments approach.

The difference in costs between the two groups will be expressed as:

($ Cost of feeding + $ Cost of hospital stay for feeding group) less ($ Cost of hospital stay for controls)

Ten thousand random re-samples (bootstrapping) will then be taken from the distributions and the resulting posterior distribution estimated. This technique provides us with robust estimates. This will indicate the mean difference in dollar cost and then the probability that the difference is negative can be calculated. Negative costs imply the intervention is cost saving and positive costs imply the opposite. We assume long term patient outcomes are similar or no worse for feeding, and any adverse event, such as infection, will be captured by longer stays in hospital for the control group. The relevant cost outcome is the opportunity cost of a bed day and this can be valued in dollar terms outside of any statistical processes. Valuations will be informed by observing current levels of expenditure on hospital services by state health services, these data can be obtained easily from routine data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.</outcome>

      <outcome>Need for inotropic medication.
All medication administered to the patient is recorded on a Case Report Form for the time period of randomisation through to 1 month following 3rd cycle of chemotherapy postoperatively.
Inotropic medication - given to support patient blood pressure and kidney function - is typically given during the surgery or day 1 or 2 postoperatively.  These medications are ordered on medication sheets and then this information is transcribed onto the Case Report Form by the Trial Coordinator and then entered onto the trial database.</outcome>

      <outcome>Nutritional status 6 weeks after surgery.

Scored patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA)
The scored PG-SGA is also a validated nutritional assessment tool and has been specifically developed for patients with cancer.  The tool consists of a medical history component, which provides information about weight change, dietary intake, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea that have persisted for two weeks) and changes in functional capacity.  Loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting, oedema and ascites will be considered in the physical examination. Based on the global assessment, the patient will be classified as category A (well nourished), category B (moderately or suspected malnourished) or category C (severely malnourished). In addition to the global ratings, the scored PG-SGA also incorporates a numerical score (PG-SGA score). For the overall PG-SGA score all point values for each section (patients history, physical examination) of the PG-SGA will be added. The additive PG-SGA score ranges from 0 to 50 with a higher score reflecting a greater risk of malnutrition. The PG-SGA score also provides cut-off scores for appropriate nutritional triage and intervention to improve symptom management.  The PG-SGA has been accepted by the Oncology Nutrition Dietetic Practice Group of the American Dietetic Association as the standard for nutrition assessment for patients with cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up nutritional status until 6 weeks after surgery.

This will be completed at Visit one (pre-operative), Visit 3 (the day before planned discharge) , Follow Up #1 (6 weeks post surgery), and Follow Up #2(30 days following completion of the third cycle of chemotherapy).</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients attending Gynaecology/Oncology Clinics at recruiting hospitals with a suspected or proven diagnosis of primary ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who are scheduled for their primary cytoreductive surgery are screened for malnourishment using the Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).  Inclusion and Exclusion criteria are used to screen all patients.  Patients are randomised to one of two equally sized groups - early postoperative enteral feeding and standard postoperative care versus standard postoperative care alone.  Randomisation is equal between the two arms (1:1) with stratification by treatment centre and mode (upfront surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy) to ensure balance across treatments.  Following the process of informed consent all eligible patients will be required to sign a consent form before they can be randomised.  
The randomisation procedure for the treatment type is centrally organised for all investigators.  At the time the patient is enrolled in the study, the surgeon/trial coordinator will open the next envelope in the sequence to determine which of the two treatment types will be used for postoperative nutritional care.  Envelopes are organised into treatment centres and mode (upfront surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomised permuted blocks will be used to allocate patients between the two treatment groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1.  The randomisation scheme will ensure that during the enrolment period the ratio of the number of cases in the two groups remain approximately constant.  Permuted block randomisation is combined with stratified randomisation.  The randomisation process is stratified for treatment centre and mode (upfront surgery versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy).  Any deviation from the assigned treatment will be reported as a deviation from Protocol.
Allocation concealment includes sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of early post-operative enteral (tube) feeding in people with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.
 
Who is it for? 

You can join this study if are a woman with primary ovarian, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer who has undergone primary surgery to reduce the cancer. 

Trial details 

Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive standard postoperative care combined with early enteral feeding (feeding with a tube into the stomach). The other group will receive standard postoperative care only. Participants will be monitored for quality of life 6 weeks after surgery (at least a 10 point difference on the Functional Assessment of Cancer-General (FACT-G) quality of life instrument). The study aims to determine if early nutrition using a feeding tube has an impact on quality of life, length of hospital admission, recovery from surgery, complications from surgery, need for intravenous fluids after surgery, dosage of chemotherapy, nutritional status and ultimately a reduction in treatment costs.</summary>
