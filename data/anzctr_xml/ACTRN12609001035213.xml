  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women with asymptomatic ovarian cancer and rising CA-125 levels will be randomised to receive either a Decision Aid (intervention group) or a Cancer Council NSW booklet called Understanding Ovarian Cancer (control group). The Decision Aid is a booklet containing clear written and graphical information about each of the main treatment options, as well as exercises to help with the process of weighing up the pros and cons of these options. Participation in the study involves filling out two questionnaires over a 4 month period. The study is expected to conclude in 2012.</interventions>

      <outcome>Feedback on the Decision Aid (for those in the intervention group)</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed in a questionnaire that the women complete after they have both read the booklet and made a treatment decision. There is no specific time frame in which this must occur.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient treatment preferences, assessed through a preference scale question for each option, with endpoints "do not prefer this option" and "strongly prefer this option".</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed in a questionnaire that the women complete after they have both read the booklet and made a treatment decision. There is no specific time frame in which this must occur.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Quality of life: Patients will be asked to rate their overall quality of life using the single-item Spitzer Uniscale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed in a questionnaire that the women complete after they have both read the booklet and made a treatment decision. There is no specific time frame in which this must occur. It will be reassessed in a follow up questionnaire 4 months later.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decisional regret and satisfaction will be measured with the Decisional Regret Scale (DRS) and the Satisfaction with Decision (SWD) Scale respectively.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a decision aid (DA) for women with asymptomatic ovarian cancer and rising CA-125 levels after successful first-line treatment. Participants will be randomised to receive either the DA or a control booklet called "Understanding Ovarian Cancer. All participants will complete an initial questionnaire when they first make their treatment decision, and a follow-up questionnaire 4 months later. It is anticipated that the DA will improve understanding of the treatment options, reduce decisional conflict, increase satisfaction with decision-making, and not increase anxiety, compared to the control booklet.</summary>
