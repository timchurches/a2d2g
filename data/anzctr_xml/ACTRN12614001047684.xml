    <interventions>Lichtenstein procedure; semi-absorbable self fixating mesh
ParietexProgrip Trademark Mesh (12X8 cm) is applied over the fascia transversalis after herniotomy and narrowing of the deep ring. For application of the mesh, anatomy around the spermatic
cord should be clear. The flap of the mesh is opened and closed loosely around the spermatic cord. The mesh was presented with the self gripping surface facing the tissues. Mesh is applied from medial side exceeding one centimeter
of the pubic bone first then was spread on the surrounding tissue around the spermatic cord starting by spreading the cranial part and lastly fixing the lower part to inguinal ligament. No sutures were used for fixation of the mesh.
Care was taken to avoid folding the mesh. Trimming
small part of the mesh may be needed to achieve the non folding. We completed the procedure by closing the external spermatic fascia and the skin. Procedure duration is about (60 - 120 minutes)</interventions>
    <comparator>Lichtenstein procedure; polypropylene mesh is applied over the fascia transversalis after herniotomy and narrowing of the deep ring. mesh is then fixed to pubic tubercle, internal blique fascia fibres and inguinal ligament. laterally, a small openning is made in the mesh through which the cord passes then the mesh is resutured laterally to create another deep ring. Procedure duration is about (60 - 120 minutes)</comparator>

    <sequence>a total number of 90 envelopes were divided into 45 polypropylene mesh and 45 self fixating mesh. Envelopes are completely sealed and shuffled. An operating nurse with no clinical involvement in the trial and is blinded to the procedure chooses one envelope just before the surgery and informs the surgeon with the procedure to be done.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aft er the great invention of tension free mesh repair, criteria of success of inguinal hernia repair have changed. One of the most important parameters is chronic pain that begins after hernioplasty and persists aft er 3 months of the operation, with an incidence ranging from 1% to 19%. 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the self gripping mesh compared to standard polypropylene mesh in treating primary inguinal hernia in adult males in terms of chronic post
operative pain.</summary>
