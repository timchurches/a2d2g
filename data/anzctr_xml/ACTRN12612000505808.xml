  <interventions>
    <interventions>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for patients with obesity +/- diabetes.  This study will observe glycaemic outcomes, weight loss achieved and maintained, lipid profiles, hypertension rates and micronutrient status following at least 5 years since surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>A cohort of subjects who were considered for surgery but did not undergo the procedure</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycaemic outcomes assessed using fasting glucose and HbA1c (based on current ADA guidelines for glycaemic assessment following bariatric surgery) , number and dose of diabetes medications required so as to be able to document rates of diabetes remission, or improvement, stability, or worsening of diabetes control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Greater than 5 years since surgery.  This outcome is assessed in each patient at one timepoint only (specifically, when contact is made with suitable patients during the data collection period) and is not limited to a maximum time frame.  The first procedure was performed in approximately 1990 so the effective maximal follow up time will be 22 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight loss will be assessed using digital scales and calculations of body mass index and excess weight loss.  The data collected during the data collection period will be compared with baseline data collected immediately prior to surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Greater than 5 years since surgery.  This outcome is assessed in each patient at one timepoint only (specifically, when contact is made with suitable patients during the data collection period) and is not limited to a maximum time frame.  The first procedure was performed in approximately 1990 so the effective maximal follow up time will be 22 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of nutritional deficiencies assessed by laboratory analysis of micronutrient concentrations in conjunction with a dietary record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Greater than 5 years since surgery.  This outcome is assessed in each patient at one timepoint only (specifically, when contact is made with suitable patients during the data collection period) and is not limited to a maximum time frame.  The first procedure was performed in approximately 1990 so the effective maximal follow up time will be 22 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of Hypertension assessed by sphygmanometer measurements during a clincal examination and use of anti-hypertensive medication, compared with similar data that was collected immediately prior to surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>Greater than 5 years since surgery.  This outcome is assessed in each patient at one timepoint only (specifically, when contact is made with suitable patients during the data collection period) and is not limited to a maximum time frame.  The first procedure was performed in approximately 1990 so the effective maximal follow up time will be 22 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ferquency of dyslipidaemia assessed by measurement of fasting lipids along with documentation of the use of lipid lowering medication.  This data will be compared with similar data that was collected immediately prior to surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>Greater than 5 years since surgery.  This outcome is assessed in each patient at one timepoint only (specifically, when contact is made with suitable patients during the data collection period) and is not limited to a maximum time frame.  The first procedure was performed in approximately 1990 so the effective maximal follow up time will be 22 years.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Data is limited on the long term (greater than 5 years) outcomes following gastric bypass surgery. We wish to compare a group of subjects who have had a gastric bypass operation greater than 5 years ago to a group of obese subjects who have not had the same gastric bypass operation. We particularly want to focus on teh effect this procedure has on long term metabolic characteristics such as blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol as well as some of the possible nutrient imbalances.</summary>
