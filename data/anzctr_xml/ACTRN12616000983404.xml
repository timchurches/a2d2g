  <interventions>
    <interventions>In Treatment Period 1 the patients receive their last scheduled dose of IV docetaxel. In Treatment Period 2, 3 weeks after the IV docetaxel,.Oradoxel is to be administered. All participants will receive study treatments in the same order i.e. IV docetaxel followed by Oradoxel. Both study treatments will be administered by study staff in an oncology unit.
Participants will receive one dose of Oradoxel; Oradoxel comprises an HM30181AK-US tablet followed by oral docetaxel capsules. The  oral docetaxel (at a dose of 75 mg/m2, 150 mg/m2, or 225 mg/m2, depending on the study cohort) is administered one hour after 15 mg HM30181AK-US tablet. 
Premedication for Oradoxel can be given as clinically indicated, in the judgement of the investigator. The details  of premedication given is entirely at the investigator's discretion, but should be in accordance with usual practice at the study site. Participants must abstain from alcohol consumption for 3 days before Study Period 1 until the Final Visit. Participants must refrain from caffeine consumption for 12 hours prior to dosing with Oradoxel and must fast at least 8 hours prior to and 4 hours after dosing with Oradoxel.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants receive both the study treatments and in the same order. IV docetaxel is the comparator treatment to Oradoxel as this is a pharmacokinetic and safety study. IV docetaxel is administered as per standard care for metastatic prostate cancer (e.g. dose and number of doses administered). The study starts just before the last scheduled dose of IV docetaxel is administered; this is followed by one dose of Oradoxel 3 weeks later. Therefore the Oradoxel dose is in addition to and following after the usual standard of care with IV docetaxel.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be
assessed by evaluation of laboratory findings.
Safety laboratory tests will include haematology, biochemistry (i.e. electrolytes, liver and renal function tests) and other routine tests (e.g. glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, protein) and urinalysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood should be collected within 4 days prior to dosing on Day 1 of each study period (preferably prior to starting premedication for each study period), and at weekly intervals (Day 7 and 14 of each study period), and at the Final Visit. The baseline collection for Study Period 2 will also serve as the Day 21 measurement for Study Period 1. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be assessed by evaluation of Adverse Events. This is the first clinical trial with Oradoxel but the possible adverse effects are expected to be similar to those with IV docetaxel. These can be serious (e.g. allergic reactions, liver toxicity, fluid retention, bone marrow depression); other side effects include changes in sense of taste, shortness of breath , constipation, decreased appetite, changes in fingernails or toenails, swelling of hands, face or feet, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, mouth or lips sores,  hair loss, rash and other skin reactions, redness of the eye and excess tearing. 
The most commonly reported side effects of the HM30181AK-US tablet are: constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, somnolence, fatigue, chest discomfort, dizziness, nasal congestion, throat irritation, runny nose, and a hoarse, rough or scratchy voice.
Adverse reactions will be assessed by asking the participant, physical examinations, and by observations by site staff.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Screening until the Final Visit, which is scheduled for Day 21 of Treatment Period 2. Participants will be assessed at regular intervals while at the study site to Day 2 and at each study visit on Days 3, 4, 7 and 14 after IV docetaxel and on Days 3, 4, 5, 7, 14 and 21 after Oradoxel.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be assessed by evaluation of concomitant medications.
All concomitant medications will be recorded on source documents and then entered into the eCRF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Screening until the Final Visit, which is scheduled for Day 21 of Treatment Period 2.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be assessed by evaluation of vital signs.
Vital signs (pulse rate, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiration and
temperature) will be measured at each study visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Vital sign measurements should be taken at Screening, Baseline (Day-1), and predose on
Day 1 for both study periods, in the morning of all inpatient days, and when the participant
first arrives for PK sampling on outpatient days. Vital signs should also be taken at the Final
Visit. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be assessed by evaluation of physical examinations.
Physical examinations will include an assessment of general appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thorax (including cardiovascular and respiratory systems); abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; extremities and neurological examination. Additional examinations will be performed as
clinically indicated to assess AEs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Complete physical examinations will be performed at Screening, and the Final Visit. All other physical examinations do not require complete examinations but will be targeted to the signs and symptoms related to adverse event reporting, and conducted on Day -1 of each study period.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be assessed by evaluation of ECGs.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Screening, Day 1  for both study periods - 2 hours post dosing of Oradoxel and IV docetaxel and at the final visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of Oradoxel compared with IV docetaxel will be assessed by evaluation of ECOG performance status.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oradoxel is a combination of an oral tablet, HM30181 methanesulfonate, and
capsules that contain docetaxel. HM30181 is a drug that helps the body
absorb docetaxel, a drug used to treat cancer. The purpose of this study is
to measure the levels of docetaxel in your blood at different times when
given by intravenous (IV) drip (through a vein in your arm) compared with
the levels of docetaxel at different times in your blood when given by
mouth (as Oradoxel).</summary>
