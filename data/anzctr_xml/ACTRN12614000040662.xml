  <interventions>
    <interventions>Inferior Pedicle Wise Pattern Breast Reduction; technique for bilateral breast reduction surgery, based on inferior pedicle. Approximate duration of surgery 3 hours. Previous reports suggest this technique results in better preservation of nipple sensation, but has greater incidence of breast 'bottoming out' and greater scar burden.</interventions>
    <comparator>Superomedial Pedicle Hall-Findlay Breast Reduction: technique for bilateral breast reduction, based on superomedial pedicle. Approximate duration of surgery 3 hours. Previous reports suggest this technique results in reduced incidence of 'bottoming out' and has smaller scar, but has reduced nipple sensation, and is more likely to require revision.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction, as measured using Breast Q questionnaire (validated pre- and post-operative questionnaire for use in breast surgery patients).</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months post-operatively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cosmetic outcome, as measured using clinical photography (in accordance with Peninsula Health clinical photgraphy guidelines). Cosmetic outcome will be assessed by independant, blinded plastic surgeons using the recognised grading system developed by Strasser et al (Plast Reconstr Surg 1999; 104(7): 2282-5.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast reduction surgery improves the quality of life of women with large breasts, with regard to both physical and psychosocial symptoms. At present two very different techniques predominate, with no consensus on whether the choice of operative technique affects patient satisfaction/quality of life (QOL). 
We aim to perform a prospective randomised cohort study to compare patient satisfaction/QOL following breast reduction using either the inferior pedicle Wise pattern or superomedial pedicle Hall-Findlay technique.</summary>
