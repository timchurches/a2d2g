      <outcome>Virology Analysis Participant Accountability From Week 96 Through Study Termination - Virology analysis included virus susceptibility (phenotype and genotype)to a standard panel of approved antiretrovirals as determined by the Monogram Biosciences PhenoSense GT assay. Below analysis table included the following parameters: 1. "protocol-defined treatment failure" was defined as an increase in HIV-1 RNA to detectable levels (=50 copies/mL) on 2 consecutive measurements, the second measurement taken no more than 14 days after the first measurement); 2. "Treatment failure": treatment failure (both virologic and non-virologic) was defined as a subject who met the protocol-defined treatment failure criterion or discontinued from the study; 3. "NRTI or NNRTI resistance mutations": nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or lersivirine-associated resistance-associated mutations (RAM) based on the International AIDS Society-USA (IAS-USA) RAM guidelines; 4. 'with result' meant an analyzed sample returned genotypic result or phenotypic result or both.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients must complete of 96 weeks of treatment with lersivirine (or comparator where
