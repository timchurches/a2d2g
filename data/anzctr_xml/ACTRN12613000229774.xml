  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with chronic hepatitis C who were not responsive or not suitable for standard interferon-based therapy are enrolled into this study. Patients are diagnosed first by Chinese herbal doctor to identified as dampness heat stasis and liver Qi stagnation by Bian-Zheng-lun-zhi (diagnosis and treatment with Traditional Chinese Medicine) and then randomized and allocated to receive Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang (a combination of long-dan-xie-gan-tang, jia-wei-xia-yao-san, dan-shen and hou-po and made into a pastille to be taken orally) 15gm per day and three times a day. After 2 weeks washout period, patients are crossed over to receive placebo for another 12 weeks. Furthermore, those patients who had response continue to receive a 24 weeks course of Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang to evaluate the sustained response 24 weeks after stopping treatment. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients with chronic hepatitis C are received placebo (starch which is made into a pastille to be taken orally) for 12weeks. After 2 weeks washout period, patients will be crossed over to receive Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang for another 12 weeks.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang therapy between the treatment group and the placebo group with sex stratified analysis for comparison of serum liver transaminases and HCV viral load reduction ratio uses Fishers Exact test. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes, fatigue scale, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) quality of life scale improvement between the two groups use Fisher's Exact test by categorical variables, and use the Mann Whitney U test by quantify variables. Values of serum liver transaminase, HCV viral load that patients treat with Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang, and other quantitative indicators use Wilcoxon signed rank test analysis and categorical variables use McNemar Chi-Square test analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates the clinical efficacy of Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang (a combination of long-dan-xie-gan-tang, jia-wei-xia-yao-san, dan-shen and hou-po) on patients with chronic hepatitis C. Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang and its ingredients have been proven to have in vitro or in vivo anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, immune modulation effect, and been commonly used in clinical practice of Chinese Medicine in Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Rong-Yang-Jyh-Gan-Tang in treating patients with chronic hepatitis C, particularly emphasize on the effect on serum liver transaminase and HCV RNA.</summary>
