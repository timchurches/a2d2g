    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 20 (ASAS 20) for the Comparison Between Apremilast 30 mg BID and Placebo at 16 Week of Treatment - ASAS 20 is defined as achieving an improvement from baseline of = 20% and = 1 unit in at least 3 of 4 ASAS domains on a scale of 0 to 10 units and no worsening from baseline of = 20% and = 1 unit in the remaining ASAS domain on a scale of 0 to 10 units. The 4 ASAS domains are:
Patient Global Assessment of Disease (0 - 10 unit Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]); participant marks a box with an X on a 0 - 10 unit NRS; the left-hand box of 0 = not active and the right-hand box = very active
Total Back Pain (0 to 10 unit NRS); participant marks a box with an X on a 0 - 10 unit NRS; the left-hand box of 0 = "no pain" and the right-hand box = "most severe pain"
Function (Bath AS Functional Index [BASFI] NRS 0 - 10 unit); participant provides a self-administered survey of 10 questions assessing for degree of mobility and functional ability
Inflammation domain is determined by the mean of 2 Bath AS Disease Activity Index NRS Questions #5 and #6 for morning stiffness) (0 - 10 unit)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) at Week 24 - The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a composite score based on a participant self-administered survey of ten questions using a 0 to 10 unit numerical rating scale (NRS) that assesses a participants' degree of mobility and functional ability. The questionnaire consists of eight questions regarding function in AS and the two last questions reflecting the participants' ability to cope with everyday life. The participant will be asked to mark the box with an X on a 0 to 10 unit NRS for each of the 10 questions, on which the left-hand box of 0 represents "easy," and the right-hand box represents "impossible." The resulting 0 to 100 score is divided by 10 to give a final 0 to 10 BASFI score. A higher BASFI score correlates to reduced functional ability.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 24 - The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a composite score based on a participant self-administered survey of six questions using a 0 to 10 unit numerical rating scale (NRS) that assesses the participants' five major symptoms of AS: 1) fatigue; 2) spinal pain; 3)peripheral joint pain/swelling; 4) areas of localized tenderness; 5a) morning stiffness severity upon wakening; 5b) morning stiffness duration upon wakening. The participant will be asked to mark the box with an X on a 0 to 10 unit NRS for each of the 6 questions. To give each of the five symptoms equal weighting, the mean of the two scores relating to morning stiffness is taken. The resulting 0 to 50 score is divided by 5 to give a final 0 to 10 BASDAI score. A BASDAI score of 4 or greater is considered to be indicative of active AS disease.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society 20 (ASAS 20) at Week 24, Compared Between Apremilast 20 mg and Placebo - ASAS 20 is defined as achieving an improvement from baseline of = 20% and = 1 unit in at least 3 of 4 ASAS domains on a scale of 0 to 10 units and no worsening from baseline of = 20% and = 1 unit in the remaining ASAS domain on a scale of 0 to 10 units.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) at Week 24 - The ASQoL is a validated disease specific patient reported outcomes instrument to assess the impact of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) on the quality of life of individuals with emphasis on the ability of the person to fulfill his or her needs. It consists of 18 items requesting a yes (score=1) or no (score=0) response to questions related to the impact of pain on sleep, mood, motivation, ability to cope, activities of daily living, independence, relationships, and social life. The summary score ranges 0-18 with higher scores indicating worse quality of life</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Physical Component Summary Score (PCS) of Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) at Week 24 - The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index-Linear (BASMI-Linear) at Week 24 - The BASMI-Linear was designed to assess axial status (ie, cervical, dorsal and lumbar spine, hips, and pelvic soft tissue) and to define clinically significant changes in spinal movement. Five dimensions of movement (lateral lumbar flexion, tragus to wall, forward lumbar flexion, maximal intermalleolar distance, and cervical rotation) are measured and normalized on 0 to 10 unit NRS. The average of these scores is the total BASMI score, with a higher value indicating more severe limitation in spinal mobility</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Radiographic Score Using the Modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (m-SASSS) at Week 104 - The modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS) is a scoring method used by experts to determine the amount or degree of ankylosing spondylitis disease that is in the spine based on x-ray radiographs of the spine.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During the Placebo Controlled Period - A TEAE is an adverse event with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of investigational product (IP) and no later than 28 days after the last dose of IP for participants who discontinued early. An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre existing condition) should be considered an AE. A serious AE is any which results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; constitutes an important medical event.</outcome>
