  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of a decision aid during the consultation by the medical oncologist and provision of the decision aid and audiotape for patient to take home. The decision aid contains information on potential managment decisions, risks and benefits of treatment options, side effects, treatment regimes, survival statistics, pros and cons of choices. The duration of use of the DA in the consultation is not set, it may be used as long as is required. The audiotapes is a recording of the content of the booklet. Participants may listen or read the decision aid as often as they wish and the DA and audiotape are theirs to keep.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have developed two user-friendly decision aids (DAs) for patients with incurable breast or bowel cancer. These include an instrument used by doctor and patient in the consultation, and a take-home booklet and audiotape for patients.  The DAs outline treatment options, benefits and likely side effects.  Information is presented in different visual formats.  This should help patients participate in their cancer treatment decisions.  Patients and doctors have reviewed the DAs, and their usefulness will now be tested in a randomised trial.

Hypotheses being examined in this study (in the randomised trial): Patients receiving DAs at the time of making a treatment decision about management of advanced cancer compared to patients not receiving DAs at this time will have enhanced achievement of their involvement preference, participate in decision-making more actively and have improved understanding of their prognosis, treatment goals and side effects, as well as be more satisfied with their care.  Doctors using the DAs in consultations will have enhanced satisfaction with treatment decision-making.

This project is also being run in Toronto, Canada.  The recruitment target of 210 includes 105 from Canada.  Recruitment is complete in all sites and analysis is underway.</summary>
