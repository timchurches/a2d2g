  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Efficacy Endpoint: - The percentage of patients with fistula maturation/usability defined as endoAVF that is free of stenosis or thrombosis, with brachial artery flow of at least 500 ml/min and at least 4 mm vein diameter (as measured by duplex ultrasound) OR patient was dialyzed using 2 needles.</outcome>
      <timepoint>within 3 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety Endpoint - The percentage of patients who experience one or more serious study device related adverse events during the first 3 months following AVF creation</outcome>
      <timepoint>within 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EndoAVF-related Re-intervention Rate - The re-intervention rate for endoAVF (defined as any intervention required to maintain or re-establish patency) will be calculated at 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Patency - Time from successful endoAVF creation to the first intervention designed to address thrombosis or stenosis, assist in maturation or cannulation of endoAVF, or endoAVF abandonment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cumulative Patency - Time from creation to the abandonment of endoAVF (censor patients with renal transplant)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Usability - 2-needle cannulation of the endoAVF for prescribed dialysis in = 2/3 of dialysis sessions over a 4 consecutive week period within 12 months of endoAVF creation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks post procedure, up to 12 months</timepoint>
