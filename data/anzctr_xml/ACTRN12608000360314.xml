  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron deficiency is relatively common in young women.  Dietary intervention is recommended as the first treatment for mild iron deficiency.  Dietary intervention can include a diet high in iron and also eating foods that enhance iron absorption such as foods containing vitamin C and carotenoids.  Iron absoriton from a breakfast cereal which is fortified with iron is likely to be enhanced if consumed with kiwifruit as kiwifruit is a rich source of vitamin C and carotenoids.  The aim of this study is to investigate whether consuming kiwifruit with a breakfast cereal fortified with iron improves iron status in iron deficient women, compared with the consumption of an iron fortified cereal and a banana (which is low in vitamin C and carotenoids).</summary>
