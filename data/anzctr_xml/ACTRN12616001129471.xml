  <interventions>
    <interventions>As a part of an evidence-based change in clinical practice, implemented from the 1st September 2016, intensive care unit clinicians will alter the mandatory respiratory rate of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit to achieve a target arterial carbon dioxide level of 50-55mmHg until end of mechanical ventilation. Participant's will be followed-up from enrolment until 28 days or until death.  Data associated with this practice change will be collected from September 2016 to June 2017.</interventions>
    <comparator>Prior to the clinical practice change,  intensive care unit clinicians altered the mandatory respiratory rate of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit to achieve a target arterial carbon dioxide level of 35-45mmHg (normocapnia) until end of mechanical ventilation.  Data associated with this practice change will be collected from January 2016 to August, 2016.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a single-centre pilot audit and the data generated from the sample will be used to determine statistically appropriate sample size of future studies.

Variables will be assessed for normality and log-transformed if appropriate.  Baseline comparisons will be performed using Fishers exact tests and reported as n (%). Continuous normally distributed variables will be compared using Student t-tests and reported as means (standard deviation), while non-normally distributed data will be compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and reported as medians [interquartile range]. Changes over time will be determined using repeated measures mixed linear modelling with each patient treated as a random effect, and therapy group, time and the interaction of therapy group and time as effect fixed effects.  A two-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered evidence of a significant difference in the study outcomes.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for on-going clinical management receive mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is the process by which a patients breathing is supported by a machine (ventilator). While receiving mechanical ventilation the patients intensive care clinicians make clinical decisions about their patients breathing.   Beginning in the second half of 2016, and based on emerging evidence, the ICU Consultant group has agreed to implement a practice change in their management of carbon dioxide levels in mechanically ventilated patients.  This practice change is termed permissive mild hypercapnia and involves clinicians targeting of arterial carbon dioxide tension values of 50-55 mmHg instead of the usual value of 35-45 mmHg.  This change applies to all adult mechanically ventilated patients, except for those who required extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) therapy, those in whom death is deemed imminent and those in whom a higher CO2 level is contraindicated for other clinical reasons.  We plan to systematically audit biochemical, physiological and patient-centred outcomes and compare such outcomes after the introduction of this practice change with outcomes in patients before the practice change. Importantly, the knowledge generated by this audit may inform future interventional studies aimed at further optimising disease-specific PaCO2strategies for the care of critically ill patients. This audit will take a similar path to the recent conservative oxygen therapy trial, where a practice change allowed slightly lower than usual oxygen levels to be targeted at Austin Hospital and a before and after audit was conducted and showed clear benefits in patient outcomes including an increase in earlier spontaneous ventilation. </summary>
