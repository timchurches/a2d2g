    <studytitle>A randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of Zopiclone on the uptake of and adherence to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi-arm, parallel-group study to assess and compare the efficacy of a 1 week versus 4 week treatment with zopiclone 7.5 mg in the initiation of and compliance with controlled positive airway  pressure (CPAP) treatment in patients with mild to moderately severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>A trial to assess and compare the efficacy of 28 days treatment vs 7 days treatment vs placebo of oral zopiclone 7.5mg once daily at bedtime in establishing CPAP therapy in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to determine if a short course of a mild sedative (zopiclone 7.5mg) at the onset of treatment improves long-term compliance with CPAP therapy as assessed by hours per night of use and numbers of nights per week at 12 months post treatment initiation. This is assessed by down-loading the data card in the CPAP device.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compliance with CPAP therapy as assessed by hours per night of use and numbers of nights per week at 6 months post treatment initiation. This is assessed by downloading the data card in the CPAP device.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if there is any advantage obtained with a 4 week treatment rather than a 1 week treatment in establishing therapy. Hours of use per night, and nights per week of use will be compared between the 2 groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To try to identify the main reasons behind the decision to discontinue CPAP treatment in those who cease using it. This will be assessed by means of strauctured interviews.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants who have been found to have mild to moderately severe OSA will be allocated to one of three treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio.  Participants will be allocated sequential study numbers, and randomly assigned following simple randomization procedures (computerized random numbers) to 1 of the 3 treatment arms. Allocation is by way of numbered containers. The unblinded pharmacist holds the unblinding codes, all other research staff, and the subject are blinded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep-related disorder which leads to frequent partial or complete airway obstruction during sleep. The resulting sleep fragmentation causes daytime symptoms of sleepiness, fatigue, headache and cognitive dysfunction. In addition OSA is associated with an increased incidence of arterial wall stiffness, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, work-related and motor vehicle accidents. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices provide an internal splint effect for the upper airway, and are thought to be the best treatment for moderate to severe OSA when used. However, compliance with CPAP therapy remains low with average adherence rates ranging rom 30% to 60%. Multiple international studies have shown that compliance shows an initial drop off in the first week of treatment, and patients who are non-adherent in this early period remain non-compliant hereafter. This is often related to the insomnia that many patients experience when first using CPAP. Our hypothesis is that treating this initial insomnia will result in increased long-term compliance with the therapy, and that this benefit will be seen with just one week of sedative treatment.</summary>
