  <interventions>
    <interventions>For oral feeds where the breastfeeding mother is not available, bottle feeds will be offered using differing bottle-feeding teats according to infant allocation.
Experimental group: a vacuum triggered bottle-feeding teat (Calmita starter or advanced, Medela AG) will be used throughout the infants stay in the study sites neonatal nurseries. Experimental group infants will use the Calmita starter teat (lower vacuum threshold), and will change to the advanced teat (higher vacuum threshold) upon demonstrating the ability to suck a full feed with the starter teat.
Adherence to use of the experimental teat will be monitored by research and nominated clinical staff on at least 4 days per week.

      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 2; Mean, peak and baseline intraoral vacuum for monitored breastfeeds and bottle-feeds
Intra-oral vacuum (relative to atmospheric pressure, mmHg) will be measured via a small Silastic tube (SNS, Medela AG, Switzerland) attached to a pressure transducer (Cobe Laboratories, Frenchs Forest, NSW, Australia) taped alongside and terminating just past the nipple or teat tip (2mm). The pressure transducer will be connected to a bridge amp (AD Instruments, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) via an interconnect cable (Cobe Laboratories). The output of the pressure transducer and ultrasound images will be channeled to a Power Lab (AD Instruments, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) and simultaneous recordings made using the software package Chart v4.5 (AD Instruments) on a laptop computer.

      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 6: Volume transferred from a full breast (expressed &gt;3hr prior to feed) and from an empty breast (expressed &lt;1hr prior to feed)
Estimation of Degree of Breast Fullness Breastmilk fat concentrations increase as the volume of milk available within the breast reduces. Changes in breastmilk fat concentration over the course of a breastfeed or expression provide an indication of fullness, and when pre/post samples are collected over a 24hr period, estimation of the degree of fullness can be made. A small milk sample (&lt;1.0mL) will be taken before and after monitored breastfeeds, and mothers will have the option of collecting pre/post samples over a 24hr period. The measurement of fat concentrations of samples will provide a more sensitive estimation of breast fullness.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation: The primary outcome measure for this study is the total volume transferred during a breastfeed. Meier reported average transfer volumes of 18.4mL +/- 13.2 and 3.9mL +/- 7.0 with and without nipple shield, respectively (Meier et al, 2000).  Samples sizes required to detect a clinically relevant effect of 5mL difference between feeds with full and empty breasts were calculated separately for these two conditions. The more conservative calculation is that the study would need 24 infants in each treatment group to have 80% power (Type I error rate a=0.05) of detecting a difference this large. Allowing for a possible dropout rate of 20%, as was observed in a similar study, 30 infants per group will need to be recruited at 33 weeks CGA. The sample size was calculated as if the data will be analysed using an independent samples t-test. Actual analyses will be more powerful, and thus will have power to detect smaller differences. 
Using this sample size, an independent samples t test would have the power to detect differences in secondary outcomes equivalent to 0.83 * SD. This is equivalent to differences of approximately 3.9 min total sucking duration, and 12 suck bursts per feed. As with the primary outcome, use of covariate data, repeated measurements and more powerful analytic techniques increase the likelihood of detecting smaller differences than those determined here. 

Data analysis: Data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis using R 2.15 or later versions (The R Core Team) with nlme, lattice and multcomp packages for linear mixed models, graphical exploration and general linear hypothesis tests, respectively. To monitor both safety and efficacy, interim analysis will be performed when complete data is available for 15 infants in each group, with p values set to p=0.029 for both interim and final analyses as per Pocock (p372). 
For the monitored breastfeeds, differences in milk transfer volume as well as measured sucking, physiological, and feeding variables, linear mixed effects modelling will be used, with grouping for the random effects at the participant level. Use of nipple shield (yes/no), breast fullness (full/empty) and relevant demographic variables will be considered as predictive factors.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the development of preterm breastfeeding skills and the impact of bottle-feeding teats, nipple shields and degree of breast fullness on the achievement of full oral feeding. As mothers are unable to be in the neonatal nursery for all of their infants suck feeds, bottle feeds are required occasionally.  There is evidence that an intraoral vacuum-triggered teat (Calmita, Medela AG) encourages a sucking action similar to breastfeeding and reduces the length of hospital stay and formula use at discharge compared to a conventional teat. We wish to examine the effects of different teats and breastfeeding support on feeding outcomes.
Objectives: 
1.	To track over time the maturation of intraoral vacuum, coordination of sucking, swallowing and breathing, and maintenance of a normal heart rate and oxygen saturation during feeding, and to determine if this is related to increased breastfeeding effectiveness and efficiency. 
2.	To explore the effect of the amount of milk available in the breast on the volume of milk transferred during breastfeeding at 34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). 
3.	To explore the use of a nipple shield on the volume of milk transferred at 35 weeks CGA.
4.	To compare suck-swallow-breathe coordination during breastfeeding with that during bottle feeding with Calmita, and bottle-feeding with a conventional teat. 
5.	To determine the effect of a vacuum triggered teat on timing of achievement of full breastfeeding and on breastfeeding duration
