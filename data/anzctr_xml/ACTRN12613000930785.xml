  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is raw banana skin cut to the size of the wart and placed under occlusion with a conventional medical occlusive tape for a period of 12 hours, once daily for 2 weeks. This treatment may be extended beyond two weeks or replaced with an alternative treatment (Cryotherapy or salicyclic acid cream) for up to a period of 16 weeks. The participant will be required to take a photograph the wart before application of the banana skin every night.</interventions>
    <comparator>Cryotherapy and or salicyclic acid cream.
The cyrotherapy will involve the direct application of liquid nitrogen to the wart until blanching of the surface of the wart. Treatment will be weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment with cryotherapy will be offered if  the participant is randomised to this treatment at recruitment. The wart will be photographed before the application of this treatment. The salicyclic acid treatment will be with over the counter cream following the directions of the manufacturer, usually applied as a thin smear across the wart each day. Treatment with salicyclic acid will follow either banana skin treatment or cyrotherapy if those treatments are unsuccessful. The wart will be photographed before the application of each treatment.</comparator>

      <outcome>Economic Analysis

The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-effectiveness analysis of the trial treatments. The evaluation will be carried out from the perspective of health services, which includes both Medicare and non-Medicare health related costs, over a time horizon of 12 weeks. The cost of resource use will be calculated for each trial participant using the data collected on the number of visits to healthcare professionals in relation to cutaneous wart treatment and cost of other wart treatments purchased by the patient. Staff costs will be calculated using standard Medicare costs . 
Topical treatments will be costed using the PBS Formulary  and manufacturer's costs where required.  Patient outcome will be measured as the primary outcome i.e. complete clearance of all warts at 16 weeks. The incremental mean difference in costs between the two trial arms and incremental difference in patient outcome will be calculated and we will calculate an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of cost per patient cured at 16 weeks. If cryotherapy is less costly than banana skin treatment and more effective or if cryotherapy is more costly but less effective, then one treatment clearly dominates the other and there is a clear choice about the treatment that is cost-effective. If non-dominance occurs we must weigh up the potential cost implications versus patient benefit to make a decision regarding cost-effectiveness. We will do this by relating the incremental mean costs between the two trial arms to the incremental mean outcome as a ratio, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER represents the additional cost per additional patient cured. Uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness analysis will be assessed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.

Total of 112 participants will be enrolled in the study and randomized using computer generated random numbers and distributed into two arms with 56 participants in each arm:

Arm 1: A trial of banana skin treatment
Arm 2: Immediate cryotherapy using liquid Nitrogen

Allocation will be concealed by central randomisation by computer

</concealment>
    <sequence>The study will be randomized using a randomization table created by computer software (i.e. computer sequence generation). The randomization will be performed using a permuted random blocking strategy, so that the numbers will accumulate to each arm of the study at an approximately equal rate.

The total of 112 participants enrolled in the study will be randomized using this computer software into two arms.

Arm 1: Receive Banana skin Treatment
Arm 2: Receive Cryotherapy Treatment

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Analysis:

Sample Size-
It is anticipated that 30.5% of warts will be clear as assessed from a photograph by a nurse following treatment with cryotherapy. A clearance of twice that proportion, similarly assessed from a photo by a nurse,  would be clinically significant. Therefore a sample of 56 cases for each type of treatment is required to test this hypothesis at 90 % power, 5% significance.

Randomization-
Prior to commencement of the study, a sequence of consecutive study numbers will be generated, and allocated to one treatment (Banana skin) or the other (Cryotherapy) using a computer generated random number. The randomization will be performed using a permuted random blocking strategy, so that the numbers will accumulate to each arm of the study at an approximately equal rate. Varying the block length will make it difficult to anticipate the next treatment before it is allocated. The treatment allocation schedule and study numbers will be kept in a secure place and only be accessible by a person dealing with administrative aspects of the study. The photographs of the warts will be reviewed by a practice nurse blind to the treatment group allocation.

Data Analysis-
We will use simple descriptive statistics to compare the 2 groups (banana vs cryo) at baseline, on the grounds of their demographic and health profile. We will use Chi square statistics or t-tests as appropriate to assess the significance of any difference between groups.
The primary hypothesis (clearance of the verucca at 4 weeks) will be assessed using the Chi-square statistic.
If there do appear to be any differences between groups at baseline, adjustments for these variables will be made by treating them as covariates in a logistic regression model. This model may also identify if the success of treatment is different for subjects with a particular profile (based on gender, age, comorbidities, for example). The analysis will be performed on an Intention to Treat (ITT) basis, where each subject will be classified according to their allocated treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received.
Analysis of the times to clearance will be performed initially using Kaplan-Meier methods. The log-rank test will be used to compare the curves. If adjustment for baseline data is deemed necessary, then a Cox Proportional Hazards model may be used. 
Pain killer use and overall satisfaction with treatment will be compared both at the end of the study (using either a non-parametric test or t-test), as well as at all data collection points during the study (using a repeated measures analysis - either a standard ANOVA for repeated measures, or a Friedmann's non-parametric test).
Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS statistical software, and a p value &lt; 0.05 will be taken to indicate a statistically significant association.

Economic Analysis-
The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-effectiveness analysis of the trial treatments. The evaluation will be carried out from the perspective of health services, which includes both Medicare and non-Medicare health related costs, over a time horizon of 12 weeks. The cost of resource use will be calculated for each trial participant using the data collected on the number of visits to healthcare professionals in relation to cutaneous wart treatment and cost of other wart treatments purchased by the patient. Staff costs will be calculated using standard Medicare costs.
Topical treatments will be costed using the PBS Formulary and manufacturer's costs where required. Patient outcome will be measured as the primary outcome i.e. complete clearance of treated warts. The incremental mean difference in costs between the two trial arms and incremental difference in patient outcome will be calculated and we will calculate an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of cost per patient cured at 16 weeks. If cryotherapy is less costly than banana skin treatment and more effective or if cryotherapy is more costly but less effective, then one treatment clearly dominated the other and there is clear choice about the treatment that is cost-effective. If non-dominance occurs we must weigh up the potential cost implications versus patient benefit to make a decision regarding cost-effectiveness. We will do this by relating the incremental mean costs between the two trial arms to the incremental mean outcome as a ratio, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER represents the additional cost per additional patient cured. Uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness analysis will be assessed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most cutaneous warts resolve spontaneously with time. Evidence for the effectiveness of medical treatment is lacking and results of treatment can be frustrating. Consequently, health practitioners view cutaneous warts as a low priority as far as providing treatments, but the adverse effect on the quality of life of some patients with cutaneous warts can be significant. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a 'natural remedy' the skin of bananas (Musaceae Musa) is an effective treatment. In this phase 2 randomized controlled trial the team will test the hypothesis that banana skin treatment can resolve cutaneous warts, in half the time and in twice the proportion of patients as those receiving cryotherapy.</summary>
