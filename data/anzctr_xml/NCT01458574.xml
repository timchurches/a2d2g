    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants In Remission at Week 52 - Remission in participants was defined by a total mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score was an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible sigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each subscore graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating higher disease severity. These subscores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12 where higher score indicating higher disease severity.</outcome>
