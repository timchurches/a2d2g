    <interventions>Intervention - experimental for PD Trainers
The TEACH-PD Train the Trainer Programme is based on the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis guidelines for teaching PD to patients and caregivers. All modules take a conversation approach which models patient-to-trainer feedback cycles . The programme requires all trainers complete the following activities within one month of on-site induction visit.

1. Induction Visit ( 1- 2 hours): 
This on-site meeting, presented by the investigators, will introduce the TEACH-PD curriculum including its learning outcomes, the online modules, overview of the patient training manuals, and an outline of assessment. 
PD Trainers must fulfill a pre-requisite knowledge requirement before starting the Module 1A. This will be assessed using an  20 multiple choice question test on-line covering topics of What is PD, PD complication and problem solving and integrating PD into the patient home.

2. Two interactive web-based training modules (each module 2 hours to complete) : 
	Module 1A  Home dialysis training  an overview
	Module 1B  Personalised approaches to home dialysis training 
Learning after each module will assessed using a 20 question multiple choice test. 

3. Two Interactive web-based Case Study based modules (each study 30  60 min to complete): 
Learning from each case study will be assessed via a 6 question multiple-choice test. Trainers will then develop a Patient summary report and Personalised lesson plan for one of the patients described in the case studies. The report and lesson plan will be assessed by an in-unit mentor / accredited assessor and feedback will be provided.

4. Nurse Competency Checklist:
This final assessment will be completed in partnership with the in-unit mentor / accredited assessor as a record of them having completed all parts of the TEACH-PD programme (above) and a list of practical competencies that must be demonstrated during hands-on training within the PD training unit. 

Intervention - experimental for PD patients

Eligible PD patients will be trained by a TEACH-PD Trainer using the Patient Manuals and via practical demonstrations. The 2 manuals include:  
 Manual 1: Getting Ready for Peritoneal Dialysis has been designed to provide the patient with information that is helpful as they are getting ready to go onto PD. This includes information about preparation of the home environment and equipment they will require.
 Manual 2: Peritoneal Dialysis Training and Competencies has been designed to provide the patient with information that is helpful as they are moving into PD training and preparing to go home on PD.  It includes an overview of PD and how to perform a PD exchange safely.

PD Trainers will conduct patient training at the hospital, clinic or within the patients home according to local policy and patient preference . Duration required for PD patients to complete the newly developed curriculum will be one of the outcomes being measured in this pilot study.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria for PD Trainers
To be eligible to participant in this trial as a PD Trainer, the participant must satisfy the following criteria:
1.	A registered nurse at the John Hunter and Logan Hospital PD units;
2.	Willing to undertake the TEACH-PD curriculum.
3.	Able to meet pre-requisite knowledge standards
Note on Inclusion Criterion 3: All nurse trainers are required to demonstrate nursing-level understanding of all clinical content areas covered by the PD Patient Training Manual Parts 1 and 2. This includes a combination of theory-based and practical knowledge relevant to the PD training environment and the nurse trainers role. A multiple-choice test containing 20 questions will assess the prerequisite knowledge about home dialysis modalities, in particular peritoneal dialysis, and training. The pass rate for this assessment is 90%. The trainer can have as many attempts as they need until they pass the assessment.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for PD patients
To be eligible to participate in this trial as a PD patient, the participant must satisfy the following inclusion criteria:
1.	Adult aged over 18 years of age;
2.	Incident patient due to undertake PD training for the first time;
3.	To be trained by a PD Trainer who has completed the TEACH-PD curriculum;
4.	Able to provide informed consent

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is an increasing number of people developing end-stage kidney disease in Australia every year. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the most cost-effective and user friendly form of dialysis, yet the rate of PD utilisation in Australia has been steadily falling since 2003.  A major contributor to low referral rates by physicians to PD and relatively high rates of PD technique failure is PD related peritonitis. Studies in a number of countries have shown that peritonitis rates vary greatly between PD units (between 5 to 20 fold variation). With PD critically dependent on patient self-management, research is required into potentially modifiable peritonitis risk factors, including patient training.   

The primary objective of the TEACH-PD (Targeted Education ApproaCH to improve Peritoneal Dialysis outcomes) pilot study is to refine the TEACH-PD training modules for PD patients and trainers.  

TEACH-PD pilot study is an investigator-initiated, single-armed, non-randomised, pilot trial assessing the use of training modules for both PD nurse trainers and incident PD patients undertaking PD training. A total of 10 PD trainers will be enrolled and at least 1 PD patient per trainer and at least 10 English speaking patients (between 10 and 20 patients in total) from PD units at John Hunter Hospital, New South Wales and Logan Hospital in Queensland.

PD trainers will complete train the trainer modules during the study which have a focus on adult learning principals and be provided with Patient Training Manuals. Once the PD trainers are assessed for competency with the modules, the trainers will then instruct the incident PD patient using the Patient Training Manuals and practical demonstrations.  
The primary objective of this pilot study is to further refine the TEACH-PD training modules designed for PD trainers and patients. 

The TEACH-PD training modules were developed by the Home Network, a group of health professionals focused on identifying and addressing barriers to home dialysis. The study is being coordinated by the Australasian Kidney Trial Network (AKTN).
