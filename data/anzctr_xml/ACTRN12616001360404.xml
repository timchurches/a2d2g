  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial investigates post-operative activity restrictions following lumbar discectomy.  Patients are randomized prior to lumbar microdiscectomy surgery at L3/4, L4/5 or L5/S1 intervertebral discs to receive either the intervention (no post-operative activity restrictions for a period of one month following the procedure) or control group (traditional post-operative activity restrictions- defined below).  The lumbar microdiscectomy operation is performed by Consultant Neurosurgeons or under the supervision of Consultant Neurosurgeons in participating hospitals in Melbourne.

Intervention group patients are advised by neurosurgical ward physiotherapists post-operatively  to return to all activities as soon as they feel ready with no restrictions placed on sitting, exercise, return to work or sexual activity.  The same information is communicated in an information sheet provided to patients.  Patients wear a portable electronic device for a period of one month following their procedure which records activity and position: lying, sitting, standing, walking, running or cycling.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group also receives the following advice from the ward physiotherapist in a 10-minute face-to-face discussion with an accompanying information sheet to restrict activity for a period of one month following lumbar microdiscetomy:
1.	Avoid sitting for longer than 15-30 minutes in any 2 hour period 
2.	No bending, lifting, twisting, pulling or pushing greater than 5 kilograms
3.	Avoid heavy domestic work such as vacuuming, laundry and making beds for the first fortnight
4.	Do not drive until reviewed in the outpatient clinic at one month
5.	Avoid sexual activity for two weeks
The control group also wears the portable monitoring device</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A well-defined and widely agreed definition of clinical success following lumbar microdiscectomy does not exist.  It is, however, accepted that such a definition of success should take account of outcome measures such as physical function, disability and pain.   The primary endpoint will be a composite outcome at six months consisting of:

1.	18 point reduction in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for lower back pain
2.	25 point reduction in VAS for leg pain
3.	15 point improvement in ODI score
4.	Absence of disc reherniation (defined as repeat surgery at the same level)
5.	No other secondary intervention (epidural or nerve root injection, medial branch block)

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disc Reherniation Rates- investigated upon clinical suspicion of recurrence with repeat MRI lumbar spine.  Confirmed with repeat MRI Lumbar Spine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months.
Disc Reherniation rates will be determined by clinical review and MRI if indicated at 6 months.  The monitoring device is only worn for a period of one month during which patients are asked to follow specific activity restrictions.  The 6 month time point is used to determine the longer term risk of disk reherniation after the period of activity restrictions.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An additional secondary outcome will consist of a composite of the below assessed on as treated basis (in contradistinction to the primary outcome assessed on an as-treated basis):

1.	18 point reduction in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for lower back pain
2.	25 point reduction in VAS for leg pain
3.	15 point improvement in ODI score
4.	Absence of disc reherniation (defined as repeat surgery at the same level)
5.	No other secondary intervention (epidural or nerve root injection, medial branch block)</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months.
The composite endpoint will be assessed on an as treated basis at 6 months.  The monitoring device is only worn for a period of one month during which patients are asked to follow specific activity restrictions.  The 6 month time point is used to determine the longer term outcome after the period of activity restrictions.</timepoint>

Power Calculation
To our knowledge, there is no previous RCT assessing our hypothesis. Previous studies have indicated a reherniation rate of ranging from 2-18%.   Annual reported reherniation rates have been closer to 4-5% in large series.   Reported rates of clinical success for lumbar discectomy vary widely dependent on the criteria.  Using the criteria detailed above we would anticipate a clinical success rate within the broad range reported in the literature of approximately 70-90%.  

In determining the power of this study, we assume that 80% of patients will meet the definition of treatment success.  The calculation of sample size can be based upon a threshold of a 25% difference in treatment success as clinically significant. In order to have 80% power to detect a 25% difference in the binomial outcome of treatment success defined at p=0.05 the sample size calculated would be 50 patients per group.  If we allow for a 20% drop-out rate, this bring the calculated sample size to 60 patients per group for a total of 120 patients in the trial.




Multivariate Analysis
Baseline multivariate analysis will be performed on enrolled patients once randomized to detect any underlying important difference in demographics.  The baseline characteristics to be assessed include:
Demographic/Baseline Characteristics
Age
Sex
Employment status- employed/unemployed
Work type (physical requirement)
Light
Medium
Heavy
Workers Compensation Status
Duration of symptoms


Operation information will also be recorded:
Operative level
Length of operation
Inadvertent durotomy
Length of admission


Populations for Analysis
Populations will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis. 

Primary Endpoints
The proportion of patients from each group achieving the primary endpoint at six months as defined above will be assessed on an intention to treat basis via the Two One-Sided T-Test.

Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints of VAS scores back and legs (absolute and change) and ODI (absolute and change) will also be assessed on an intention to treat basis.   Adherence to protocol will be assessed via interpretation of the data recorded by the electronic device over the one month post-operative period.  Disc reherniation rates will also be assessed on an intention to treat basis.  The composite endpoint will also be assessed on an as treated basis as determined by wearable device reported adherence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lumbar discectomy is the most commonly performed spine surgical procedure.  Lumbar discectomy is performed to treat radicular pain (pain radiating along the distribution of a nerve) unresponsive to conservative management, neurological deficit or less commonly cauda equina syndrome.  Lumbar discectomy has evolved to a relatively minimally invasive surgical procedure performed as a day procedure in many centres in North America.  Traditionally surgeons have advised patients to restrict post-operative activity due to the hypothesis that this may reduce the risk of disc reherniation and progressive instability at the operated level.  In contemporary practice many surgeons do not advise any post-operative activity restriction.  Observational studies conducted to date investigating the effect of removal of activity restrictions demonstrated similar outcomes to those reported in the literature for traditional post-operative care.  No randomized controlled trial has been performed to investigate this question.


The purpose of this study is to directly compare in a randomized controlled trial patients following post-operative activity restrictions and those without post-operative activity restrictions for a period of one month following lumbar microdiscectomy.  Patients will undergo standard lumbar microdiscectomy and then be randomized into either the treatment (no restrictions) or control (restrictions groups).  For a period of one month following their procedure patients will wear an electronic monitoring device that will record activity and posture.  Patients will complete surveys pre-operatively and post-operatively at day one, one month, three months and six months.  Patients will also undergo clinical review at one month following their operation.  

The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint of change in visual analogue scale for pain (for back and legs), Oswestry Disability Index, absence of disc herniation recurrence or reintervention at six months.  Additional secondary endpoints will also be assessed.
