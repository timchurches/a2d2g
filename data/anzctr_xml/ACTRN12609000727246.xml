  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma affects approximately 20% of  children, is a common cause of hospital admissions, and we do not know how to stop children developing it. Infantile eczema is also common, affecting about a third of children.  Infants with eczema often later develop asthma. It is hypothesised sensitisation to allergens can occur via damaged skin associated with eczema, which then increases the risk of asthma.   
If this hypothesis is correct, it may be possible to prevent asthma by improving the skin barrier function in infants.  There is evidence that a ceramide based emollient (which contains the major components of skin) can improve skin barrier function, while current treatments for eczema do not. 
This pilot study is aims to determine if a daily application of a ceramide dominant emollient can improve infant skin barrier function.</summary>
