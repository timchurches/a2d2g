  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will involve patients undergoing endovascular intervention (angioplasty +/- stenting) for stenosis/occlusion of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and/or popliteal artery. Imaging guidance is essential for the success of these procedures. Traditionally this guidance has been performed by the use of angiographic imaging. In this intervention intravascular ultrasound will be added as an adjunctive imaging method in additional to angiography. Previous observational studies in the peripheral arteries and studies from the coronary circulation suggest that the use of intravascular ultrasound allows for more accurate sizing of lesion and vessels and more precise balloon and stent sizing and placement. The addition of intravascular ultrasound adds an extra 15 minutes to the length of the procedure. It is hypothesized that the additional of intravascular ultrasound will result in better technical results for the interventional procedure and so reduce complication rates.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary patency - defined as vessel patency at the site of intervention without the need for a re-intervention procedure. Patency will be determined by imaging, in most cases this will be achieved with duplex ultrasound as this is the standard non-invasive surveillance modality (regular surveillance scans will be performed at 1,3,6 and 12 months) although in some cases CT, MRI or angiography may be used instead (due to clinical requirements) or in combination with ultrasound (to confirm ultrasound findings). Patency is defined as a continuous lumen demonstrated throughout the treated vessel.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patient will be enrolled in the study at the time of booking for the procedure (usually in the out-patient clinic or the hospital ward), at least one day before the procedure. The patient will be randomised at the time of the procedure with the interventionist unaware of the randomisation until after the pre-intervention angiography has been performed (to reduce the chance of bias from changes in angiographic methods due to knowledge of whether intravascular ultrasound data will be available during the procedure). Randomisation will be concealed through the use of an online random number generator that will accessed for allocation the subject at the time of the procedure (this is after the time of enrollment in the study).</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The main research question regarding differences in percentage of cases that do not have a &gt;/=50% restenosis and have not required re-intervention between treatment and control group will be addressed utilizing survival analysis. Required sample size was estimated using Log-rank tests subroutine 7 available in PASS 8 sample size estimation software. An overall sample size of 117 subjects (58 in the control group and 59 in the treatment group) will achieve 80% power at a 0.05 significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.51 when the proportion surviving in the control group is 0.5. The accrual pattern across time periods is uniform (all periods equal). Hypothesised proportion of cases that do not develop restenosis requiring re-intervention in one year in the control (angiography only) group is 0.5 which is in line with the reported combined literature for angioplasty and stenting. The hypothesised proportion of cases that do not require re-intervention (primary patency) in one year in the treatment (IVUS and angiography) group is equal 0.7. Due to the lack of data in peripheral vascular arteries this estimate has been driven by results from the coronary artery literature. Due to concerns about the generalisability of the coronary evidence to peripheral arteries, the estimated effect of the use of IVUS has been set at the lower end of that stated in the literature. The final required sample size will be overestimated by 25% to accommodate anticipated missing data (based on local data for death rate and loss to follow-up) resulting in 74 subjects to be enrolled in each arm of the trial.
Finally, agreement analyses will be undertaken to assess the degree of equivalence of various quantifiable blood vessels characteristics obtained from angiography and IVUS. The analyses will include reporting Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Fixed and proportional biases will be assessed with attention given to using an approach which will appropriate address that neither angiography or IVUS can be perceived as golden standard. Sample size determined by the primary outcome considerations should be more than sufficient for assessing agreement as per various rules of thumb reported in the agreement literature.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Narrowing or occlusion of the arteries of the lower limb, caused by atherosclerotic lesions, can lead to leg pain, ulceration and ultimately amputation. Endovascular revascularisation is a procedure in which the artery opened through the use of balloons or stents inserted under the guidance of a special x-ray technique called angiography. These procedures have a high rate of failure with about half developing a &gt;/=50% narrowing (or restenosis) within a year. Much of this failure rate is attributed to technical factors such as incorrect size of catheter or incorrect positioning and in part may relate to the limited view provided by angiography. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an alternative imaging method that provides a more complete view of the artery. It has been shown that IVUS adds more information when combined with angiography but it is unclear whether this results in changes to treatment and whether this then results in better outcomes for patients.
This aim of this study is to investigate whether the addition of IVUS improves the outcomes for endovascular revascularisation.
This is a randomised control trial comparing endovascular revascularisation procedures guided by angiography with procedures guided by both angiography and IVUS. The study sample of 150 patients will be recruited from patients requiring treatment of lesions in the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. Patients will be randomised into two groups of equal size; a control group having angiography guidance only and a second group having both angiography and IVUS guidance. All patients will have non-invasive tests of endothelial function (tests of the functioning the inner surface of the artery  an essential component in maintaining vascular wellbeing) before their and after the procedure as well as the standard blood tests and regular surveillance imaging that is normally scheduled for patients after these procedures.
The primary outcome measure will be &gt;/=50% restenosis of the treated artery. This degree of restenosis requires re-intervention to reopen the artery. At this point the original procedure will be deemed to have failed for the purposes of analysis. The restenosis rate will be compared for each group.
