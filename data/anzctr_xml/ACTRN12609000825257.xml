  <interventions>
    <interventions>The educational booklet in conjunction with 20 one-hour sessions of the comprehensive exercise program over 12 weeks. The program begins with specific cervical spine and scapular motor relearning exercises (8 sessions over 4 weeks) and transitions to a graded whole body activity program focussing on functional activities (12 sessions over 8 weeks). All exercise sessions are conducted one-on-one with a physiotherapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Educational booklet and one half-hour physiotherapy consultation. During the 12 week trial period, participants in this group will, if required, be able to contact the physiotherapist by phone on two occasions to clarify the information/exercise contained in the educational booklet.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the proposed research is to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive exercise program for chronic whiplash. Currently, for the majority of sufferers with chronic whiplash there are no proven therapies available to manage this personal and financially costly condition. Promising results have been identified in randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of different exercise programs, graded activity and specific exercise. However, success rates from these studies were too low to represent a solution to the problem of chronic whiplash and further development was necessary.

A comprehensive exercise program that combined both specific exercises and graded activity was developed. A small uncontrolled phase I/II trial provided evidence that this new exercise program had a much higher success rate with 56% of subjects having minimal or no disability at the end of the program. This success rate approximates that of radiofrequency neurotomy (58%) but avoids such invasive surgical techniques.

Based upon the exciting results of the pilot study and the strong biological rationale for the superior results with the combined program we now propose to definitively establish the effectiveness of the new program in a large phase III randomised controlled trial.</summary>
