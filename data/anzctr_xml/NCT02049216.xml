  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Flexible tape
Other interventions - Fixomull
Other interventions - Exercise

Sham Comparator: Sham tape - Fixomull tape only
Single piece of 10cm wide, 32cm long applied from inferior to tibial tuberosity, over patella and onto quadriceps muscle. Corners rounded. Tape to be applied with the knee in 90 degrees flexion.
Participants in both groups will also be prescribed an individualised home exercise program by a physiotherapist.

Experimental: Flexible tape - Flexible tape (rocktape brand) applied as follows:
First piece of tape 10 cm wide and 32cm long (length of a standard goniometer). Split down centre 18cm from 1 end. Second piece of tape 5cm wide and 14cm long.
Tape applied in 90 degrees knee flexion Applied with no tension in proximal and distal ends. 30% tension to un-split portion placed over quads. 50% tension to split portion placed either side of patella and crossing over at tibial tuberosity Additional piece of 5cm wide flexible tape applied with 80% tension over patella tendon, with no tension in 3cm from ends All tape corners rounded
Participants in both groups will also be prescribed an individualised home exercise program by a physiotherapist.


Other interventions: Flexible tape
Flexible, elasticised, adhesive athletic tape

Other interventions: Fixomull


Other interventions: Exercise
Participants in both groups will be prescribed a home exercise program to complete.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee attending The Alfred hospital will be invited to
      participate in a randomised controlled trial comparing two different types of knee taping.
      Both groups will also be prescribed an exercise program to assist in management of their knee
      OA.

      Hypothesis are as follows:

        1. Participants treated with flexible tape with have greater reductions in pain and
           improvements on timed performance based measures when compared to those treated with a
           placebo tape.

        2. Participants in both groups will have clinically significant improvements in pain and
           timed performance based measures compared to their baseline scores.</summary>
