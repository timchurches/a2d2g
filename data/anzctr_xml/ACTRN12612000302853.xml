    <interventions>Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) is a minimally invasive procedure done under sedation and with image guidance using x-rays called angiography. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours. A fine wire called a catheter containing a small inflatable balloon is moved through the veins to the point of narrowing. At that point the balloon is inflated stretching and opening the vein. The catheter and balloon are then pulled back and removed from the veins.  Participants will be randomised to the treatment group, angiography + PTA,or to the control group who will have the angiogram without the ballooning.  The participants and neurologists will not know who has had the treatment.  At 12 months all participants will have another angiogram.  The participants that were originally inthe control group will have the ballooning at 12 months.  The participants and neurologists will not know at which time point the ballooning was performed.</interventions>
    <comparator>PTA procedure compared to the control group. The control group will get a sham PTA procedure (the angiogram without the ballooning) at the beginning of the study. The control group will cross over to the treatment arm at 12 months. The study will be double blinded (the neurologist and the patients will not know at which time point, 0 or 12 months, the PTA procedure was performed.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants will have a consultation with the study radiologist and have the procedure and risks described. They will be given a copy of the the Participants Information and Consent Form and the research coordinators' contact number.  Potential participants will be asked to take time to consider their voluntary participation in the study. They will be told that if they decide to participate they will need to contact the research coordinators for an appointment.  The coordinators will question the potential participants about their understanding of the study, ask if they have any concerns or further questions prior to obtaining consent.  If further consultation is required with the radiologist for explanation of the procedure this will be organised.  If consent is obtained the potiential participants will then have their screening and baseline imaging and their neurological and cognitive assessment with the study neurologist to determine eligibility to participate.  When eligibility is confirmed the procedure (angiogram +/- PTA)  date will be scheduled.  The radiologist will be given the allocated randomisation for each participant at the start of the angiogram procedure .  The participants and neurologists will be blinded, that is they will not know at which time point, at start of the study or at 12 months, the PTA procedure was performed.</concealment>
    <sequence>The Alfred biostatistician will be asked to generate a randomisation list. Participants will be randomised to an angiogram plus the PTA or to just the angiogram without the PTA. Dark brown envelopes with sequential numbers one to 180 will be perpared.  The envelopes will contain the randomisation allocation as per the list generated by the biostatistician.  The envelopes will be stored in a locked cupboard; they will be given to the radiologist sequentially at the start of the angiography procedure.</sequence>
