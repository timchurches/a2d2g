  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will recruit patients with osteoporotic fracture presenting to outpatients clinic. The patients will have peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) test besides the routine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test during one one-hour site visit. This is a cross-sectional study and all the patients will only have one site visit. DXA is a routine test for patients with low-trauma fracture. Patients will still have DXA examinations even if they don't participate in this project. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>In the absence of preliminary data we have selected an opportunistic sample of 85 subjects. This sample size will be large enough to provide valuable information and is feasible based on clinic attendance rates. 
Multivariable analysis will be used to determine the correlations between low-trauma fracture risk and these factors while adjusting for the differences between groups and potential confounders. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is well established to assess bone strength in clinical settings; however, it
has many limitations. This research aims to evaluate the role of peripheral quantitative computed tomography
(pQCT), an alternative bone density testing method that is believed to provide more information than DXA, for the
assessment of bone strength. We will recruit patients with osteoporotic fracture and evaluate whether pQCT
measures are associated with bone strength. We have already obtained normal pQCT measures in healthy young
adults and calculated the means and standard deviations. We will compare patients pQCT results with the normal
values to achieve our research aim. We may also find new factors that may contribute to fracture prediction in older
patients.</summary>
