Arm 1: Abdominal preparation with Tinted red Chlorhexidine Gluconate 2% w/v, Ethanol 70% v/v (PharmAust)  and Vaginal/Vulvar preparation with Aqueous-based Chlorhexidine Gluconate 2% solution .

Arm 2: Abdominal preparation withiodine Antiseptic Solution- Povidone-Iodine 10% w/v equivalent to 1% w/v available Iodine (Aqueous based, HERRO) solution and Vaginal/Vulvar preparation with Riodine Antiseptic Solution- Povidone-Iodine 10% w/v equivalent to 1% w/v available Iodine (Aqueous based, HERRO).

    <statisticalmethods>As this is a pilot study and there is no existing data in the literature regarding surgical site infections (SSI) with different skin preparation solutions for gynaecological laparoscopies, a power calculation couldnt be carried out. If this pilot study will show a trend towards one of the arms- a fully powered randomized controlled trial will be designed with power calculations based on the findings of this study.
This study will be analysed on an "intention to treat" basis. At completion of the study analysis will involve comparing proportions of all types of SSI using Chi squared tests and comparing continuous variable measures using t-test. If the data does not have a normal distribution then a non-parametric tests such as the Mann Whitney U test will be used. When needed, results would be adjusted to confounding variables by using linear or logistic regression, as appropriate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgical Site Infections (SSI), including infections of the skin, subcutaneous tissue and internal organs, are one of the most common serious complications of surgery and anaesthesia. They are a leading cause of re-admissions and prolonged hospitalisations and they substantially increase the cost of care. Rates of SSI for individual procedures vary widely depending on the population, size of the hospital, type of surgery, experience of the surgeon and methods used for prevention and surveillance. Overall, it is estimated that SSI develops in up to 15 percent of patients undergoing surgical procedures.
Endoscopic gynaecologic surgery is a rapidly developing field. Laparoscopic surgery is nowadays used for many procedures that were traditionally performed via laparotomy. Up to date, there are no prospective studies that specifically evaluated the rates of SSI in laparoscopic gynaecologic surgeries or the preferred way of skin preparation to prevent them. 
Gynaecology units 1 and 2 of The Royal Women's Hospital perform over 700 laparoscopies annually. All patients who undergo planned surgery present to clinic before surgery. We aim to perform a Randomised Controlled Pilot Study comparing 3 solutions of skin preparation containing alcohol or aqueous based Povidone-Iodine or Chlorhexidine. Our hypothesis is that Incisional and organ/space SSI rates would be similar throughout all groups. Patients would be followed-up one and four weeks after surgery and SSI rates would be compared amongst groups. SSI would be documented and defined as per the CDC guidelines. The data gathered in this study will allow us to further perform a fully powered study aiming at decreasing the rates of surgical site infections
