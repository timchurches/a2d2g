  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be examining the use electronic homework reminder messages, delivered to participants via mobile phone text messaging. The messages will be tested in an outpatient group therapy setting. Treatment will consist of 9 two hour group therapy sessions conducted weekly, based on the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders. Both groups will have access to between session tasks to be completed by paper and pen. The intervention group will receive SMS messages from their therapists throughout the week, reminding them of homework tasks and providing tips. The standard treatment group will not receive SMS messages. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive the same 9 week group therapy programme. All therapy and activities will be equivalent. The control group will receive homework tasks in the standard pen and paper format rather than electronically.</comparator>
