  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oxytocin nasal spray.
Duration: 5 week treatment. First week, the dose will start at 3 International Units (IU) and increase by 3IU every 2 days. From the 7th day onwards, participants will receive 12IU for the remaining 4 weeks. The nasal spray will be delivered everyday, morning and night, one spray per nostril
This is a crossover study, so after the first course of treatment, participants will have a 4 week washout period and then commence the alternative treatment. The alternative treatment will follow the same dose escalation procedure as the first course of treatment.</interventions>

    <concealment>enrolling: A flyer advertising the study will be emailed to parents of children who attend the Lizards Childrenâ€™s centre. Potential participants will be referred to the Brain &amp; Mind Research Institute, The University of Sydney for a medical interview to determine eligibility for the active medication and a diagnostic assessment to confirm autism diagnosis. Caregivers of the participants will provide written informed consent before the assessment begins.

Participants will be randomly allocated either oxytocin or placebo during phase 1 treatment. Then the alternative treatment during phase 2. Each participant is assigned a prepacked numbered container containing either oxytocin or placebo according to the randomization schedule developed by the compounding chemist
randomized allocation:</concealment>
    <sequence>Random number generation using computer software. Each number is labeled with 'a' or 'b' where a or b could represent either oxytocin or placebo. This code has been developed by an independent pharmacist.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oxytocin is a natural hormone which plays a critical role in social behavior such as bonding, cooperativeness, trust, emotion recognition and face processing. Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by profound impairments in social behavior, communication and presence of repetitive behaviors. This study aims to assess the efficacy of oxytocin treatment in ameliorating social impairments in young children with autism. In particular, we aim to assess whether oxytocin treatment can improve the capacity for social interaction, face processing and reduce the occurrence of repetitive behaviors.</summary>
