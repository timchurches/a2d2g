  <interventions>
    <interventions>CYT997 administered as an oral capsule dose on a two weekly cycle for up to six cycles. The starting dose is 15mg/m2 and the dose escalates at 1.4x the previous dose. Dose escalation may occur every two weeks (ie at the completion of the first cycle for each successive patient in the dose-escalation phase). Dose-escalation will cease at the occurrence of drug-related Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 5 days or longer or associated with fever requiring antibiotics; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or non-haematological toxicity of Grade 3 or greater (excluding nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea with optimal treatment).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CYT997 following oral administration.  For an adverse event to qualify as a dose-limiting toxicity it must occur in the first cycle of therapy (for each patient).  Dose-escalation ceases when an adverse event which qualifies as a DLT occure in the first cycle of a given dose level and, in accordance with the protocol, further patients are enrolled at this dose level until the sooner of a second DLT or 6 patients are enrolled in total.  When a second DLT does occur, no further patients are enrolled at this dose and the MTD is determined.  Further patients may be enrolled at the previous dose level to define the recommended dose for Phase II studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>DLTs are assessed throughout the first cycle and the MTD is determined when two or more DLTs occur at a particular dose level.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of an experimental oral anti-cancer drug called CYT997, given every two weeks, to people with advanced cancer.

You may be eligible to join this study if you have an advanced solid tumour cancer and a life expectancy of more than three months.  

CYT997 is an experimental anti-cancer agent which targets the blood supply to the tumour.  Participants will receive CYT997 as an oral capsule dose on a two weekly cycle for up to six cycles.  

Most advanced cancers will eventually stop responding to cancer treatments. In this situation, for people who may be eligible for this drug trial, there may not be any alternative standard treatments.  Participants will receive supportive care and symptomatic treatments during the trial, in addition to receiving CYT997.  
The major focus of this trial is to test the safety of CYT997 when given orally every 2 weeks. The trial also aims to assess the effect (good and bad) that CYT997 may have on you and your cancer. This involves finding out the highest dose of CYT997 that can be given without causing severe side effects.


This is a study of an experimental oral anti-cancer drug called CYT997, given every two weeks, to people with advanced cancer.

You may be eligible to join this study if you have any sort of solid cancer and a life expectancy of greater than three months.  

Participants receive oral capsules of CYT997, which is an experimental anti-cancer agent which targets the blood supply to the cancer.  This trial aims to determine the safety and tolerability of CYT997 when given as an oral capsule dose on a two weekly cycle for up to six cycles.  

Most advanced cancers will eventually stop responding to cancer treatments. In this situation, there may not be an alternate standard treatment for people who may be suitable for this drug trial.  Participants will receive supportive care and symptomatic treatments during the trial in addition to CYT997.  This trial aims to find a maximum safe dose, and determine any side effects of CYT997 given orally every 2 weeks.</summary>
