  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomly selected patients who require breast conservation surgery and who have consented will be entered into the study. Patient numbers will be drawn from a box in theatre and this number will dictate either routine current surgical technique of wide local excision (control) or breast reshaping. In the breast reshaping, the breast tissue is mobilised superficially and deep from the skin and the pectoral muscles, respectively in order to close the defect (2/0 vicryl). Subsequently, deep dermal (2/0 vicryl) and skin sutures (3/0 monocryl subcuticular) are used to close the wound. The technique takes &lt;30minutes. The wounds will be infiltrated with Bupivacaine local anaesthetic  at a dose &lt;2.0 mg/kg.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the routine technique (control), deep dermal (2/0 vicryl) and skin stitches (3/0 monocryl subcuticular) are used to close the wound without attempting to close the defect in the breast tissue. The technique takes &lt;30minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective assessment of cosmesis on a scale of 0 to 10.
Independent assessment by a panel (consists of two trained observers) and by the patient. There will be a live and a photographic assessment of the photograph taken on the previous outpatient visit. There will be an independent assessment for the breast size, breast shape and overall cosmesis using the following scale :
-	Excellent cosmesis (9-10) :  treated breast is almost identical to normal breast
-	 Good cosmesis (7-8) :  slight difference
-	Fair (5-6) :  obvious diffference but no major deformity
-	Poor (4 or less) :  major distortion of the treated breast</outcome>

    <concealment>All patients under an identified Breast Surgeon's care who require breast conservation surgery will be asked to join the trial.  The study will be discussed with them in detail and a patient information sheet will be provided.  Patients will be asked to sign a separate consent form to participate in the study.  Patients who agree to participate in the trial will be randomised to either having breast reshaping or the routine surgical technique (control) as disscused before.  A sealed envelope containing a number is drawn from a box in theatre and this number will dictate either routine current surgical technique of wide local excision (control) or breast reshaping.</concealment>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The procedure of breast reshaping will be timed.  Patients will then have axillary surgery according to the recognised units protocol.  In both groups, the wounds will be infiltrated with Bupivacaine (&lt;2.0 mg/kg).  Patients will be discharged home as appropriate.

All patients will be seen in the outpatient clinic at two weeks postoperatively and thereafter at three months, and every 6 months for three years for both oncological and cosmetic follow up. The oncology treatment and further follow-up will be according to the units protocol and details of radiotherapy and all adjuvant treatment will be recorded.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy is currently considered as an effective treatment for early breast cancer.  The goals of this treatment are to achieve local tumours control and survival rates equivalent to mastectomy while preserving the appearance of the breast.  The cosmetic outcome of such treatment is very important for the psychological, social and sexual function of women.
The role of this study is to evaluate the effects of intraoperative breast reshaping, in the context of a full range of breast volume excisions in association with radiotherapy, on the long-term (three year) cosmetic outcome after breast conservation surgery.</summary>
