               -  Be at least 18 years old;

               -  Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed
                  by the investigator;

               -  Have ocular health findings considered to be "normal" and which would not prevent
                  the participant from safely wearing contact lenses;

               -  Has vision correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better at distance in each eye
                  with contact lenses;

               -  Be experienced at wearing contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-   Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and
             herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact
             lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;

               -  Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health

               -  An active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect
                  wearing of contact lenses;

               -  Use of any topical ocular medication during trial with the exception of saline
                  drops ;

               -  Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may
                  alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participant's ocular
                  health/physiology or contact lens performance

               -  Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;

               -  Previous corneal refractive surgery;

               -  Contraindications to contact lens wear;

               -  Participated or currently enrolled in another clinical trial that may have
                  affected vision or ocular physiology within the previous 2 weeks;

               -  Be pregnant (formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participant's verbal
                  report is sufficient);

               -  Worn soft contact lenses 2 calendar days or rigid gas permeable/ orthokeratology
                  lenses 7 calendar days prior.</exclusivecriteria>
