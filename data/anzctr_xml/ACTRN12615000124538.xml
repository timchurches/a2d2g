    <scientifictitle>Prospective observational cohort of unaffected first-degree relatives (FDR) of probands with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and healthy controls followed for five years with the simultaneous collection of tissue samples; designed to examine the role of genetic and environmental factors influencing the development and progression of RA-related autoimmunity and to identify and explore immunological alterations prior to the onset of disease, to establish the proportion of FDRs who develop RA defined by the ACR 2010 classification criteria at 5 years and to identify biomarkers in FDRs prior to and at onset of disease for disease prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of RA and to direct and guide treatment.

      <outcome>The identification of immunological factors contributing to the development of RA. Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be separated from collected whole blood and using various techniques including flow cytometry, cell sorting techniques, ELISA and qPCR; we will identify, enumerate and phenotype immune cells contributing to RA development.    </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify predictive risk biomarkers prior to the onset of disease. All genetic, microbial, environmental and immunological data will be analysed for potential biomarkers of disease development.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years after commencement of observation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will establish a large multi-centre prospective cohort and tissue bio-bank of unaffected first-degree relatives (FDR) of probands with RA designed to examine the role of genetic, environmental and microbial factors influencing the development and progression of RA-related autoimmunity. FDRs will be followed annually with an expected 15% likely to develop asymptomatic autoimmunity and to progress to RA within 5 years. This population cohort with accompanying genetic, environmental and immunological data will characterise more precisely people at risk of RA, allowing detection and risk stratification prior to symptoms becoming apparent.</summary>
