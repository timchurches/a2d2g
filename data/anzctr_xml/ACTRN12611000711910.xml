    <interventions>One capsule of sustained- release Morphine 20mg taken orally, daily for 7 days, 1-2 tablets of Coloxyl and Senna taken orally, daily for the same 7 days, then a washout period of one week before crossing over to the placebo treatment .
Tablets contain  Docusate Sodium 50mg total sennosides      (calculated as sennosideB) 8mg</interventions>
    <comparator>One capsule of sustained-release Morphine 20mg placebo taken orally, daily for 7 days.(This medication will be encased in an opaque capsule to ensure the  study medication and placebo look identical).This placebo capsule will contain granulated Microcrystalline cellulose. Also taken will be 1-2 tablets of Coloxyl and Senna placebo taken orally, daily for 7 days.( this placebo formulation will be lactose, starch maize, gelatin, magnesium stearate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, opadry brown and carnauba wax and will have the same outward appearance as the intervention tablets.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relief of breathlessness by the mean of the Dyspnoea Visual Analogue(VAS) scores. This will be calculated separately for morning (am) and evening (pm) scores. The unpleasantness of breathlessness will also be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On days 5,6 and 7, and days 19,20, and 21.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences in the frequency and severity of adverse effects between the two arms.The participant will be visited at home weekly and phoned weekly at times convenient to the patient, visits will last approximately 30-40 minutes. their blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be measured, their blood oxygen saturation by means of a pulse oximeter and their end tidal cardon dioxide by means of an end tidal carbon dioxide monitor. 
Using the Anticipated Adverse Event Assessment frequent side effects of morphine sulphate will be monitored and categorised according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events.This will be assessed at both the home and phone contacts.
Adverse events will also be monitored by asking the patient if they have "any other problems" and how they rate the effectiveness of breathlessness control, both assessed twice weekly.They are asked to fill out the Chronic Respiratiory Questionnaire - Dyspnoea Subscale (Mcmaster University) weekly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 4,7,14,18,21.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide.
A study nurse will visit the patient at home, at a time convenient to the patient to measure the respiratory rate and will use a pulse oximeter and an end tidal carbon dioxide monitor (all non invasive procedures).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline,Day 7, second baseline (Day 14) and day 21.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Profile of  the descriptive type(s) of the subjective sensation of dyspnoea that are more likely to be associated with mesothelioma, asbestosis or interstitial lung disease.
Participant will keep a diary for a maximum of 23 days, anticipated to take 5-10 minutes daily to fill out. They will be asked to indicate twice daily,the intensity of dyspnoea now on a modified Borg scale, the intensity and separately the unpleasantness of dyspnoea now, on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the intensity and unpleasantness of breathlessness on a  four point catagorical score. To indicate once daily, their average breathlessness, worst breathlessness and best breathlessness in in the last 24 hours, each utilising a VAS scale and their exercise tolerance using the Medical Research Council of Great Britain Scale for Dyspnoea. 
They will also be asked to indicate twice in their diary,at the end of each arm, (active and control) the level of dyspnoea control and the overall level of dyspnoea in the last 7 days and the level of satisfaction with medications received in the last 7 days.
(While measurements and analysis will be based upon the data from the last 3 days of each arm participants are also asked to provide responses once or twice daily to make sure they are comfortable with the pattern of participation prior to responding on the key census days).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 5, 6, 7 and 19, 20, 21.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Define any changes in quality of life generated by either arm of the study by using the McMaster Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - Dyspnoea Sub-scale. This will be filled by the patient 4 times at study nurse home visits.( visits will lasting about 30-40 minutes)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, day 7, second baseline (day 14) and Day 22</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Profile of the clinical characteristics of people who derive the greatest benefit from sustained release morphine in either clinical setting ( mesothelioma/asbestosis or interstitial lung disease).
This will be assessed from the subjective responses to questions relating to the sensation of breathlessness in the patient diary on the last 3 days of each arm of the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Baseline and days 5, 6,7,19,20,and 21</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine whether there is blinded preference for the net clinical benefit of one arm in the study. This will be assessed from questions asked of the patient in the daily diary, only asked at the end of both the active and contol arms.These questions will relate to the effectiveness of breathlessness control, the overall level of breathlessness, and their level of satisfaction with the medications received only in the last 3 days of each arm of the study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether morphine reduces the feeling of breathlessness in patients with mesothelioma, asbestosis or interstitial lung disease.

Who is it for?
you can join this study if you are 18 years or more, and suffer from a feeling of breathlessness (dyspnoea) as a result of maximally treated mesothelioma, asbestosis, or interstitial lung disease. You must be able to speak English and should not be taking regular opioid medication (painkillers).

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive either 20mg sustained-release morphine (by oral capsule) together with a laxitive Coloxyl and Senna, or placebo (sham) tablets for one week. They will receive no medication for the second week and will then  receive the alternate treatment ( morphine or placebo) for the third week. Participants will not know when they are taking  the active drug or placebo.

Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires and keep a diary over the 3 weeks of the trial to determine their response to treatment. They will also be phoned and visited at home by a nurse to monitor any side effects of treatment.</summary>
