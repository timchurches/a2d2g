  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supplementation with magnesium 28 days, oral tablets 250 mg, 2 times daily.
Text message will be sent at the time for administration and Mg tablets will be returned after intervention.
Participants will NOT undergo oxidative challenge, but participants will give blood samples so that their peripheral blood lymphocytes can be evaluated in an "in vitro" test with the hydrogen-peroxide solution.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the study 13 rugby players and 10 university students with sedentary life-style were involved. They were randomly assigned to intervention of supplementation with magnesium for 28 days. On the 29th day blood samples were taken and in peripheral blood lymphocytes, by using alkaline comet test, the level of DNA damage was examined.</summary>
