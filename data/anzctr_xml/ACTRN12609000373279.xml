  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of chemotherapy with the drug Omacetaxine in people with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who have the Philadelphia chromosome (T315I bcr-abl gene) mutation.


Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have:
- chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (cancer of blood cells) which is in chronic, accelerated, or blast phase 
- tested positive for the T315I bcr-abl point mutation 
- had no success with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (iminitab - Glivec) treatment.


Trial details
All participants will be treated with induction course cycles consisting of subcutaneous Omacetaxine administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days. Participants who demonstrate a response may receive maintenance therapy for up to 24 months, consisting of subcutaneous Omacetaxine twice daily for 7 days every 28 days. Participants will be evaluated every 7 days with complete blood and platelet counts while undergoing therapy; the number of consecutive doses of Omacetaxine or intervals between subsequent cycles may be adjusted as necessary, according to guidelines provided in the treatment plan.

Omacetaxine causes programmed cell death in myeloid cancer cells. Patients will be monitored from the beginning of treatment until any return of the disease or until they die. The study aims to measure the effectiveness of treatment, and investigates the tolerance to and toxicity of Omacetaxine.</summary>
