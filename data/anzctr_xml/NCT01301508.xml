  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Baseline (Day 1) - ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's atopic dermatitis (AD) affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 14 - ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition.</outcome>

      <outcome>Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 28 - ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition.

      <outcome>Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 42 - ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Decrease From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 28 - ADSI score was used to measure the severity of participant's AD affected lesion. It evaluated 5 signs of AD (erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation and lichenification) in each lesion. Each sign was rated by investigator on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Total ADSI score for each lesion was sum of scores of the 5 signs and ranged from 0 (none) to 15 (most severe), where higher score indicated more severe condition. Percentage of participants in whom the active lesion (ointment treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 in ADSI as compared to vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) and, in whom the vehicle lesion (vehicle treated) achieved a greater decrease from baseline to Day 28 as compared to active lesion (ointment treated) were reported in this outcome measure.</outcome>
