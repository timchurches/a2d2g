    <interventions>Patients will be segregated into 2 groups:
Group A: experimental group. In this group, patients will have their blood check the day before chemotherapy administration. Later in the day, patients will have either a phone call (for those living more than 35 km away) or a consultation with the oncologist at the clinic (for those living less than 35 km away). After that the oncologist will prescribe the chemotherapy that will be prepared by the pharmacist the day before administration. So in group A,blood test, consultation, prescription and chemotherapy preparation all occur on a single day, with chemotherapy administration occurring the following day.
Group B: control group. In this group, no modification will be brought to patient care. Meaning: blood check, consultation, prescription ,preparation and administration of the chemotherapy all the same day.
All patients attending the day care clinic and all their chemotherapy treatments will be included into the study. The change in our day care clinic organization is definitive. The allocated process will be continued until the end of chemotherapy. The duration of treatment will depend on the chemotherapy regimen choosen for each individual patient.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to improve quality of life of cancer patient coming to the day care clinic in order to receive intravenous chemotherapy. We will modify the process of day cares by performing blood check, consultation, prescription and preparation of the chemotherapy the day before administration. We will also analyze the impovement in workload for pharmacists and nurses. By modifying the whole process, we also expect improvement  in term of quality and security for the patient.</summary>
