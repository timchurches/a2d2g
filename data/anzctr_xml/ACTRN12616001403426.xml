  <interventions>
    <interventions>The MonaLisa Touch (MLT) procedure involves the superficial application of fractionated CO2 laser, to the vaginal mucosa by a specifically designed vaginal probe. The 5 minute treatment claims to 'rejuvenate' the mucosa and reverse postmenopausal vulvovaginal symptoms. Patients will receive the typical treatment course, which will consist of 3 treatments, each at least 4 weeks apart. These treatments will be performed by a suitably qualified gynaecologist.

Topical anaesthetic (2.5g of 4% lignocaine cream) will be applied the vulva for a minimum for 30 minutes. The treatment involves slow insertion of the vaginal probe into the vagina until it reaches the cervix or vaginal vault. The laser is set at dot power 40 watt, dwell time 1000 microseconds, dot spacing 1000 micrometres, smart stack parameter 2 and emission mode DP. The laser will then be activated as it is withdrawn to provide complete treatment of the vaginal walls. Energy is applied to vaginal walls in a pattern pre-determined by perforations in the probe matrix which covers the laser probe, allowing for even-spacing of energy and preventing treatment of confluent areas. Furthermore, a mirror at the end of the probe angled at 45 degrees protects the cervix from treatment. The duration of the procedure is anticipated to be approximately 5 minutes. 

Adherence will be monitored by in-person attendance.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will undergo the same treatment setup as in the intervention group, including application of topical anaesthetic, insertion and incremental withdrawal of the probe down the vagina. For the placebo treatment, laser will be set at lowest energy settings of 0.5W, dwell time of 100 microseconds, spacing of 2000 micrometres, smart stack of 1 and emission mode smart pulse. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vulvovaginal symptoms affect up to 50% of post-menopausal women. Thinning of the vaginal lining following the sudden drop of oestrogen post-menopause potentiates symptoms such as vaginal burning, vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and dysuria, which cause significant discomfort and impact the livelihoods of many women and their partners. 
First line treatments include topical vaginal moisturisers, lubricants and hormonal therapies; oestrogen hormone replacement therapy is indicated for systemic symptoms. However, patient compliance and efficacy are varied and limited, and some groups, namely women with a history of breast cancer or blood clots, are contraindicated to use of hormonal therapies. 

MonaLisa Touch (MLT) is a non-hormonal treatment of the vaginal lining, applying pin-point laser energy aiming to restore the skin to pre-menopausal state. The treatment is 5 minutes and claims to provide relief for vulvovaginal symptoms. Rapid uptake and FDA approval of the MLT procedure have proceeded on the basis of limited scientific evidence - only 2 prospective cohort studies, of a 12 week study period, exist to date.
Therefore, it is necessary to produce high-quality scientific evidence, with a long-term follow-up of patients, to effectively determine the safety and efficacy of the MLT procedure in relieving vulvovaginal symptoms in post-menopausal women. This study is a randomised, double-blinded trial with a 12 month follow-up period, to evaluate the efficacy of intra-vaginal fractional carbon dioxide treatment for the treatment of post-menopausal vulvovaginal symptoms. 

The study will enrol a minimum of 78 patients, who will undergo three treatments, at least 4 weeks apart. Clinical follow-up will continue for a minimum of 12 months after the initial treatment with assessors blinded to the initial treatment type. Treatment outcomes will include: symptom intensity, Vaginal Health Index scores, Quality of Life scores, vaginal skin histology, treatment discomfort, treatment acceptability and treatment complications. 
Data from this study will allow patients and practitioners to make a more informed decision regarding treatment of these symptoms. </summary>
