  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) will be administered intravenously over 3 cycles at a fixed dosage of 100mg/m2 to each study participant.  This dose will be administered weekly for the first 3 consecutive weeks, over the 4 week cycle, before commencing the second and third cycles. 

In addition to the fixed dose of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, all patients will receive a continuous daily oral dose of phenelzine sulfate across all three cycles,

Each of the five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively higher starting dose of phenelzine sulfate, consecutively.  Cohort A will start at 15mg/day and will be increased to 30mg/d  by week 2 and further increased to 45mg/d for week 3, which will be maintained throughout the study.  Cohort B will start at 45mg/d and will be held constant throughout the Study.  Similarly, Cohort C, D &amp; E will start at 60, 75 and 90mg/d, respectively, and will also be held on this dose throughout the study.  The decision to escalate the dose for the next cohort will be made on the basis of the number of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) events observed during the first 8 weeks in the preceding cohort group.

Phenelzine sulfate compliance will be monitored weekly based on drug tablet returns.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety of the therapeutic combination of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel and phenelzine sulfate.  Safety will be assessed by an evaluation of all adverse events, concomitant illnesses and medications, physical exam findings, vital signs, clinical haematology reports, ECG results and CT imaging data. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed weekly over the 3 cycles, with the first 56 consecutive dosing days representing the DLT window for dose escalation consideration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the therapeutic combination of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel and phenelzine sulfate.  This will be assessed in relation to the number of DLT events, using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed weekly over the 3 cycles. </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify relationships between pharmacokinetic characteristics of the treatment and the circulating tumor cell (CTC) / cancer stem cell (CSC) burden.  A flow cytometric method will be used to assess the CTC and CSC burden from a blood and solid tissue biopsy sample, respectively.  This method will be deployed using a DepArray machine.  The relationships will be assessed with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel alone and later in combination with phenelzine sulfate.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The pharmacokinetic relationships will be assessed on two separate occasions,  The first is at day 1 and is for the effect of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel alone.  The second is at day 57 and is for the combined effect with phenelzine sulfate.

In addition, the CTC and CSC burdens will be assessed on two further occasions, at day 29 and day 85, but not in relation to the pharmacokinetics of either drug.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify relationships between pharmacokinetic characteristics of the treatment and the composite expression of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGRF), cytokeratin and phosphorylated LSD1 with the CTC/CSC burden.  Theses relationships will be assessed with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel alone and later in combination with phenelzine sulfate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The pharmacokinetic relationships will be assessed on two separate occasions,  The first is at day 1 and is for the effect of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel alone.  The second is at day 57 and is for the combined effect with phenelzine sulfate.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the pharmacodynamic parameters for the treatment, which will include change over the course of the study in the CTC/CSC burden; immune response parameters; LSD1 and PKC-theta gene and protein expression, and in T cell cytokine profiles. These changes will be assessed with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel alone and later in combination with phenelzine sulfate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The pharmacodynamic parameters will be assessed on four separate occasions. The first is at day 1 and is for the effect of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel alone.  The second, third and fourth assessments are at day 29, 57 and 85, respectively, and are for the combined effect with phenelzine sulfate.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase 1b study will determine the safety and efficacy of combined treatment of  Abraxane and phenelzine sulfate (Nardil) for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer or inoperable locally advanced breast cancer.

Study details
All participants will receive a combination of intravenous Abraxane and an oral dose of phenelzine sulfate. Abraxane will be administered weekly for the first 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle for 3 consecutive cycles. Phenelzine sulfate will be taken daily for the duration of the 3 cycles. Five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively increasing dose of phenelzine sulfate. Safety and efficacy will be assessed weekly over the 3 cycles of treatment.

Although both drugs have been used in clinical care for more than a decade, they have not been intentionally combined together in a cancer therapy setting. This means that the combined effect of these two drugs has not been documented. This is being addressed in this study.
