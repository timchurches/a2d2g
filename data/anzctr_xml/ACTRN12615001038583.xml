  <interventions>
    <interventions>Undertake a preliminary investigation of pain, movement and activity in subjects undergoing SCS trial and implantation that will provide useful insights for the development of a larger randomised controlled study. ViMove wearable sensors will be worn by all subjects on their lower back.
Spinal cord stimulation delivers mild electrical impulses to the spinal cord that interrupt pain signals to the brain, replacing them with a tingling sensation. The stimulation to the spinal cord is delivered from the device through insulated wires called leads, which are placed adjacent to the spinal cord. Using a handheld device that works like a remote control, the stimulator can be adjusted to specific areas and levels of pain, depending on activities and pain levels during the day. SCS trial is when the leads are temporarily placed via needles to test the effectiveness of the device. This is an outpatient procedure, where the implant is tested for approximately one week at home in normal surroundings. SCS implantation involves surgery where a small incision in the back is needed to allow the leads to be placed underneath the skin, and another small incision is needed for the stimulator to be implanted permanently under the skin, usually in the buttocks or abdominal area.
ViMove are wearable sensors that measure movement and muscle activity. It is easily worn on the lower back through attaching with adhesives and can be worn throughout the day to objectively record and report to the clinician on a patient's movement and function. It will be worn in clinic for a short assessment and then for the rest of the day before SCS trial, during SCS trial and for those that go onto implantation will again be measured at 3 specific time points (4, 12 &amp; 26 weeks) post the implantation to clearly track how SCS impacts on movement and function.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will come from a number of sources. Primarily, they will be patients with chronic lower back pain who have been referred to Precision Brain Spine and Pain Centre, and determined to be suitable candidates for SCS by Dr. Richard Sullivan. If a patient is suitable, they will be invited to take part in this study by Dr. Tom Perkins (a Research Fellow at Precision Brain Spine and Pain Centre), and receive an abridged summary of the project. If they are interested, they will receive a detailed version of the protocol, and a consent form. Following their formal consent, their trial appointments will be arranged. In this study, their will be no control group or sham treatment. All patients involved in this study will take part in SCS, where their own baseline condition serves as the point of comparison.</concealment>
    <sequence>In this study, all participants who consent to take part in this research will undergo spinal stimulation. As there is no sham or control condition, randomization will not be required. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an open label pilot study to gather information to be used in a follow-up randomized study, and these measures are yet to be completed on a group of subjects with FBSS.  Therefore the variability between subjects is not able to be determined at this point. Estimates at this time would suggest that a sample of 23 participants would allow a correlation of 0.5 to be detected with 95% confidence level and power of 80%. Up to 50 subjects are predicted to be enrolled to result in 23 subjects to have the permanent implant. 
Correlation analysis will be completed to determine the relationship between variables. A paired t test analysis will be completed on pre- and post data with a repeated measures ANOVA completed on data collected over multiple time points.   All findings will be deemed significant with a p value of &lt;0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a treatment option for cases of persistent pain, refractory to other forms of treatment. The first wave of studies produced generally favourable results, with reductions in pain ranging from 49% (Alo, Redko &amp; Charnov, 2002), 55% (Villavicencio et al., 2000) to 74% (Dario et al., 2001). Since this time, a systematic review of 63 publications, predominantly comprised of case series, found that 58% of patients achieved clinically meaningful pain relief at two year follow up (Taylor et al., 2014). Taking this finding at face-value, it appears approximately 42% of chronic pain patients under-going SCS do not achieve significant pain relief. However, among this population, there is presently a scarcity of research to examine change to mobility and function. This is important, as it is plausible that the analgesic effects of SCS could be mitigated by patients increasing their mobility; a clinically important outcome in and of itself.  To the authors knowledge, objective measures of movement pre and post SCS have not been reported in the literature. 
Thus, the key aim of the present clinical trial is to objectively assess change to motion and mobility in patients with persistent pain following SCS, and its relationship to change in pain levels. On this basis, the following hypotheses were generated:
1.	Movement and pain will correlate in participants with FBSS undergoing SCS trial and implantation
2.	Activity and the ODI index will correlate in participants with FBSS undergoing SCS trial and implantation.
