  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  HIV-1 infection

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  HIV plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/ml for at least 3 years with at least one measurement
             per year and most recent viral load within 3 months of screening.

          -  Receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (at least 3 agents); subjects must be on
             a efavirenz-based or a ritonavir-based regimen

          -  Two CD4+ T cell counts greater than 350 cell/Âµl in the six months prior to screening

          -  Willing to abstain from any alcohol one day before, during the three day period in
             which disulfiram will be administered and the two week period immediately after
             disulfiram administration</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Current alcohol use disorder or hazardous alcohol use

          -  Current use of any drug formulation that contains alcohol or that might contain
             alcohol, including the gelatin capsule and liquid formulations of ritonavir,
             ritonavir/lopinavir, amprenavir and fosamprenavir.

          -  Current use of tipranavir or maraviroc.

          -  Current use of zidovudine, stavudine or didanosine (as disulfiram potentially has
             potent irreversible inhibitory effects on mitochondrial metabolism and hence could
             exacerbate the toxicity of these drugs).

          -  Concurrent use of rivaroxaban ( a CYP3A metabolized medication) as the cytochrome P450
             inhibitory effects of disulfiram on rivaroxaban are unknown.

          -  Current use of warfarin

          -  Patients who are intending to modify antiretroviral therapy in the next 2 weeks for
             any reason.

          -  Serious illness requiring hospitalization or parental antibiotics within preceding 3
             months

          -  A screening hemoglobin below 12.5 g/dL

          -  A screening TSH consistent with Hypothyroidism

          -  Significant renal disease or acute nephritis

          -  Significant myocardial disease or diagnosed coronary artery disease

          -  Significant respiratory disease

          -  History of psychosis, seizure disorder, abnormal electroencephalogram or brain damage
             with significant persisting neurological deficit.

          -  Clinically active hepatitis as evidenced by clinical jaundice or Grade 2 or higher
             liver function test abnormalities.

          -  Hepatic cirrhosis or decompensated chronic liver disease.

          -  Diabetes or current hypothyroidism.

          -  Concurrent treatment with immunomodulatory drugs, or exposure to any immunomodulatory
             drug in past 16 weeks.

          -  Recent exposure (within the preceding 8 weeks) to any vaccine.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test at screening and agree to use a double-barrier method of
             contraception throughout the study period.

          -  Significant substance use, which in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to
             interfere with the conduct of the study.

          -  Prior or current use of disulfiram, vorinostat or other experimental agent used with
             the intent to perturb the HIV-1 viral reservoir

          -  Current use of an antiretroviral regimen which does not include either efavirenz or a
             protease inhibitor</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, pharmacology and bioactivity of
      disulfiram in antiretroviral treated HIV-infected adults. The investigators primary
      hypothesis is that 3 days of disulfiram will result in an increase in HIV transcription in
      CD4+ T-cells in patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART).</summary>
