  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises prolonged exposure or cognitive restructuring. Participants are given 5 weekly 90-minute sessions of prolonged exposure (imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure) or 5 weekly 90-minute sessions of cognitive restructuring.  Exposure involves repeating trauma memories.  Cognitive restructuring involves identification and correction of irrational thoughts.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition involves patients in the wait list being assessed before treatment and re-assessed 6 weeks later.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute Stress Disorder is a psychiatric condition that develops after exposure to a traumatic event, and is strongly predictive of subsequent disorder. Although cognitive behaviour therapy effectively treats ASD, little is known about the optimal intervention strategies for treating ASD.  This study will compare 5 weekly sessions of either prolonged exposure, cognitive restructuring, or wait -list to determine the relative efficacies in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder at 6 months follow-up.</summary>
