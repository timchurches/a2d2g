  <interventions>
    <interventions>This DVD contains of a comprehensive series of exercise warnings and precautions, warm-ups, cool-downs and five series of progressive exercises targeting the neck, shoulder,   abdominals, lower back and hip regions. 

Participations are encouraged to undertake the exercise program on the DVD for a period of 12 weeks, at least twice weekly for a duration between 35-40mins.  Repetitions and sets, rest periods are stated at the end of each exercise.  Progression through the exercise series is clearly stated on the DVD.

Participants have access to a qualified physiotherapist via email or phone if they have any queries throughout the 12 week period of the trial.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The exercise DVD consists of three components: warm-ups, cool-downs &amp; stretches, and a comprehensive series of exercises designed specifically for professional orchestral musicians to target common injuries in this population. The purpose of the this trial is to evaluate: a) whether a flexible delivery of intervention will have an effect on participation and attrition levels, and b) its effect on the frequency and intensity of performance-related musculoskeletal disorders in the professional orchestral musician population. Information collected relating to changes in frequency and intensity of Performance-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders will be used to evaluate the effects of the exercise compared to a control group. Data obtained in muscle strength, flexibility, ability to manage a current performance and non-performance related musculoskeletal injury, posture, ease of movement, ability to cope with work and non-work related anxiety, energy levels, concentration will be evaluated for differences in the pre-intervention and post-intervention conditions.</summary>
