  <interventions>
    <interventions>1, Arm- Newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis B patients starting to receive pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN in a dose of 1.5 mcg per kg subcutaneously once weekly or 180 mcg subcutaneously once weekly, for 48 weeks)  based therapies in our Hepatology Clinic.
2, Arm- Newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis B patients starting to receive nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs:lamivudine 100 mg orally once daily, telbivudine 600 mg orally once daily, tenofovir 245 mg orally once daily, entecavir 0.5 mg orally once daily, until the HBe seroconversion occurs in HBeAg positive patients or until the HBs seroconversion occurs in Anti HBe antibody positive patients) in our Hepatology Clinic.
</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group. In Turkey hepatitis B virus infection is treated either by pegylated interferon or oral antiviral tablets (lamivudin, entecavir, tenofovir, telbivudin). In this study we aim to observe and follow up all those patients with regard to their HBs antigen titrarion. In another word all HBV patients under treatment  will be observed. So, both arms under observation are of 'equal weight'?

      <timepoint>Timepoint 1: Will be assessed  at baseline 4, 12, 24,  48,  72, 84, 100 weeks after the initiation of therapies (oral antiviral therapy or pegylated interferon).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to focus on the clinical utility of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) quantitation by assessing on-treatment serum HBsAg kinetics in newly diagnosed HBeAg-negative and positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who will be treated with pegylated interferon-based therapies or nucleos(t)ide analogues as endicated in our Hepatology Clinic.

   We suggest that approximately 100 eligible  CHB patients will participate and be followed up during 3 years in this prospective analysis.

    Serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, liver chemistry tests and HBsAg (Abbott Architect HBsAg QT assay) will be  assessed at baseline and during treatment (weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 52, 64, 72, 84, 100).

   Decline in HBsAg and HBV DNA over time will be determined, results will be stratified according to treatment groups and baseline characteristics  and then analyzed with regard to our primary and secondary outcomes.
