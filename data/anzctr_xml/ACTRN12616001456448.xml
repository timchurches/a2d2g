  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the TEMPIST study we will evaluate the standard list of emergency guidelines in current use in Australia. The Handbook of Emergency Medicine Protocols has been designed as a cognitive aid for medical staff who have to manage medical emergencies that are both life threatening and time critical. Current protocols have been reformatted as simple, single step by step pathways, The content of the protocols has not been altered.  Careful consideration has been given to the graphic design, text, diagrams and fonts used on each page, following consultation with experts from the aviation industry who design pilot manuals. Instructions are delivered in an easy to follow, step by step format designed to be read out loud during a resuscitation event. 

The TEMPIST trial will investigate the feasibility of using the Handbook Emergency Protocols during simulated medical emergencies.

Objective: The aim of this study is to determine whether the use of the Handbook of Emergency Protocols leads to, or detracts from, the provision of correct care, in accordance with current Australian and New Zealand Resuscitation Committee guidelines.

The research will be conducted in a high fidelity simulation laboratory. Study participants will be asked to manage four simulated emergency medicine scenarios.   Groups of medical staff will be asked to manage four simulated emergency medicine scenarios. Groups will receive either the Checklist scenario or usual care. Each group will manage two scenarios with the emergency protocol handbook and two scenarios using only the wall charts and drug administration handbooks that are found in every Australian Emergency Department. Each group will perform each scenario only once, either with or without the emergency protocol handbook.

The Groups will be randomly assigned, using a computer generated number table, to manage the emergency scenario, with or without, the Handbook of Emergency Protocols. 

 Each group will be given a verbal prompt leading into the scenario and advised whether the protocol book will or will not be available. Each group will then be asked to manage the emergency scenario within the simulation laboratory. Each scenario will be conducted in the simulation laboratory with a set up designed to replicate a resuscitation bay in an Emergency Department. High fidelity manikins will be used and the room will contain standard patient monitoring and resuscitation equipment.

The group being studied will be given a brief clinical prompt and then advised to proceed with the resuscitation.  Initial observations (Pulse, BP, ECG rhythm, Oxygen saturation) will be exactly the same, each time the scenario is performed. A video recording will be made of the resuscitation effort. If a group fails to intervene in a timely manner, the simulated patient will be programmed to deteriorate clinically. Correct interventions will be reflected by improving clinical observations where relevant. Each scenario will be limited to a 15 minute duration.

The four scenarios are:
1. Paediatric seizure 
2. Adult pulseless ventricular tachycardia
3. Newborn resuscitation
4. Tricyclic antidepressant overdose.

The patient will be a simulation manikin (Sim man 3G). The trial groups will be made up from doctors and nurses with a mixed level of emergency medical training. It is expected that use of the handbook will be at least as effective as current models of care.

 At the end of all 4 clinical scenarios, participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire to evaluate their subjective experience of using the emergency protocol handbook and to try and identify potential hurdles to its adoption.

      <outcome>There are 4 scenarios. .Each scenario will be recorded on video and the primary outcome measures will be a list of 15 predetermined tasks that are expected to be completed within the 15 minute time frame. Thus across four scenarios, each team will be measured on a total of 60 key processes for adherence (yes or no) with half the processes for a given team with the handbook available. Two clinicians will observe the video recorded data and rate whether the group has performed the required tasks. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Study participants will be recruited from qualified medical and nursing staff who have expressed interest in participating in education and training sessions within the simulation laboratory.  Potential participants will receive an information sheet regarding the trial. They will have opportunity to discuss trial participation with the investigators. If they decide to participate they will be required to sign a consent form. 
 Study participants will then  be asked to manage four simulated emergency medicine scenarios. The Groups will be randomly assigned, using a computer generated number table, to manage the emergency scenario, with or without, the Handbook of Emergency Protocols. 
A biostatistician, with no clinical involvement in the trial, will create a computer generated randomization sequence using a Microsoft Excel spread sheet random number generator. The researchers will prepare sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes enclosing the list of scenarios (identified by their number only) and the groups allocation as to whether they are to perform the scenario with or without the protocol book.
 
</concealment>
    <sequence>The simulation laboratory staff member running the workshop will assign the envelopes in numerical sequence to the groups, once they have agreed to participate in the study. This staff member will be ignorant towards the allocation contained in the envelope to prevent selection bias. The envelope will be opened by a member of the study group just prior to commencement of the scenario. Each group will be given a verbal prompt leading into the
scenario and advised whether the protocol book will or will not be available.</sequence>
