  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - AutoFuser Pain Pump
Treatment: drugs - Ropivacaine
Other interventions - Normal Saline (0.9%)

Experimental: Ropivacaine infusion - Following the insertion of the 2mm fenestrated catheter, the wound catheter will be connected to the 270mL AutoFuser Pain Pump. The intraperitoneal infusion with ropivacaine (0.2%) at 4 mL/hour will start immediately and continue for 68 hours post-operatively uninterrupted.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo infusion - In the same manner as described for the ropivacaine infusion arm, 0.9% Normal Saline will be administered over 68 hours.


Treatment: devices: AutoFuser Pain Pump
Closed loop local anaesthetic infusion system

Treatment: drugs: Ropivacaine
Commonly used local anaesthetic drug

Other interventions: Normal Saline (0.9%)
Normal saline is a sterile, non-pyrogenic solution for fluid and electrolyte replenishment for intravenous administration. This will be the solution used for the intraperitoneal infusion in the placebo/control group.

    <summary>Aim

      The general aim of this study is to improve post-operative pain and reduce morphine
      consumption following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR). We specifically aim to
      conduct a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial to investigate the effect of
      intra-peritoneal local anaesthesia infusions on post-operative morphine consumption and.

      Methods:

      Patients will be randomised by computer generated random numbers (random permutation) and
      opaque envelope methods. At closure, one small 2mm catheter belonging to the AutoFuser pain
      pump system will be placed in the peritoneal cavity between the onlay mesh and parietal
      peritoneum. In the treatment arm patients will receive 275mL of 0.2% ropivacaine at 4mL/h. In
      the placebo arm, 275mL of 0.9% normal saline will be used in a similar fashion. The infusions
      will run for 68 hours total. All members involved in patient care (with the exception of one
      independant research fellow) will be blinded to the above. After 68 hours the pump will be
      stopped and the catheter will be removed. Assessment of post-operative pain will be performed
      by visual analogue scale, and total opiate consumption will be collected and converted into
      morphine equivalents.

      Health significance:

      Local anaesthesia has become an important addition to multimodal regimens of analgesia
      following surgery. Recent studies have shown that local anaesthetic (LA) wound infiltration
      has improved post-operative pain when compared with standard opioid regimens for pain relief.
      Only one previous study looked at bupivacaine infusions into the hernia sac for three days
      following LVHR. This study found no improvement in post-operative pain or morphine
      consumption. We aim to demonstrate improved pain and reduced morphine consumption using an
      alternative catheter insertion technique and ropivacaine as the desired LA agent.</summary>
