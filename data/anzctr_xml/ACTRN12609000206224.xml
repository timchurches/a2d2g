  <interventions>
    <interventions>Hemihepatic Vascular Inflow Occlusion group (In hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion, the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct were dissected in the hilum by lowering the liver plate. Either the right or left portal pedicle was isolated en bloc and was controlled with a tourniquet or Santinsky clamp. The estimated duration is around 30 minutes.)
Portal Vein Inflow Occlusion group (In portal vein inflow occlusion, the portal vein was isolated and occluded with a tourniquet. The estimated duration is around 30 minutes.)</interventions>
    <comparator>Pringel Maneuver group (In Pringle maneuver group, the entire hepaticoduodenal ligament was encircled and tightened with a rubber tourniquet. The estimated duration is around 30 minutes.)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The impact of blood loss during liver resection and the need for perioperative blood transfusions have been shown to negatively impact perioperative morbidity and mortality as well as long term outcomes. The objective of this study is To compare the perioperative outcomes of partial hepatectomy using hemihepatic vascular inflow occlusion, portal vein inflow occlusion. and Pringle maneuver.</summary>
