Experimental: Previously treated patients (PTPs) - The investigator will assign subjects to either prophylaxis or on-demand treatment regimens for rVIII-SingleChain by intravenous injection. The investigator will determine the rVIII-SingleChain dose and dosing schedule for the subject based upon the subject's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, rVIII-SingleChain PK data, previous FVIII treatment regimen, and bleeding phenotype, if available.

Experimental: Previously untreated patients (PUPs) - The investigator will assign subjects to either prophylaxis or on-demand treatment regimens for rVIII-SingleChain by intravenous injection. The investigator will determine the rVIII-SingleChain dose and dosing schedule at their discretion, taking into consideration the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) guidelines, the type of bleeding episode, location of the bleeding, subject's age, and other disease characteristics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multicenter, open-label, phase 3 extension study will investigate the safety and
      efficacy of rVIII-SingleChain for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in
      at least 200 previously treated patients (PTPs) with severe congenital hemophilia A and
      previous exposure to FVIII products who achieve at least 100 exposure days (EDs) to
      rVIII-SingleChain in this study, as well as in at least 50 previously untreated patients
      (PUPs) with no previous exposure to any FVIII product who achieve at least 50 EDs to
      rVIII-SingleChain in this study. A substudy (open to both PTPs and PUPs) will investigate the
      use of rVIII-SingleChain in surgery. A substudy (open to PUPs who develop an inhibitor to
      rVIII-SingleChain) will investigate the use of rVIII-SingleChain in immune tolerance
      induction (ITI) therapy.</summary>
