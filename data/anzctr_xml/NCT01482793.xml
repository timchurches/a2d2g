    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Vertebroplasty

Active Comparator: AVAMAX - Avamax vertebroplasty kits provided by Care Fusion

No Intervention: Simulated injection procedure - Patient will be unaware as to whether the control procedure or vertebroplasty had been performed since full sterile preparation, sedation and simulated injection procedure will be used.


Treatment: surgery: Vertebroplasty
AVAmax radiopaque bone cement is injected into the vertebral body using a 13 G or 11 G vertebroplasty needle.

             regular analgesia.

          -  Patients with chronic back pain who regularly use medication containing any narcotic

          -  Patient does not have significant retropulsed fragment or spinal canal compromise of
             greater than 20% by retropulsed fragment.

             informed consent.

          -  Patient has no history of vertebral osteomyelitis.

          -  Patient has vertebral body collapse not greater than 60% relative to closest intact
             vertebra.

          -  Patient has no malignant tumour deposit (multiple myeloma), tumour mass, or tumour
             extension into the epidural space at the level of the fracture to be treated on MRI.

          -  Patient does not have severely immunocompromised health status (including any patient
             who is HIV positive, currently on chemotherapy, taking high doses of long term
             corticosteroids - defined as a dose of prednisone exceeding 10mg for greater than 3
             months in the last 12 months, has a hematologic malignancy, or a transplant
             recipient.)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to gather data regarding the efficacy, safety and
      cost-effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty in the acute fracture group with fractures
      less than 6 weeks old. The AVAMAX vertebroplasty kits (Care Fusion) will be used for all
      vertebroplasties.

      The primary effectiveness analysis will be based on the number of patients whose numeric
      rating pain score drops from above 7 out of 10 at baseline to below 4 out of 10 at two weeks
      post-intervention. Our hypothesis is that the vertebroplasty group will have a significantly
      larger proportion of patients achieving pain reduction than the control group. A secondary
      analysis will compare the change in mean pain scores and specific activity related pain
      scores between the two groups at 3 days, 14 days and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Another secondary
      effectiveness analysis will include the mean change in the back-pain specific limitation in
      function as quantified by the Roland Scale at these same data collection time points.</summary>
