  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two groups, experimental and control group. Patients will receive a single intervention and different in each group. The duration of te intervention in the two groups is one minute, and the patient will remain during that minute supine until to sound an alarm.
(experimental group):
The intervention will be apply by a physiotherapist and osteopath with enough experience. The rotation manipulation of atlas is applied for restricted cervical rotation, evaluated by the cervical flexion-rotation test. The procedure for restricted left cervical rotation is a left rotation manipulation of atlas:
The patient is lying supine. The therapist is located at the patient's head looking at the patient's feet. The left hand holds the patient's head with a contact on the temporal bone, and the right hand makes contact with the third phalanx of the index behind the right transverse process of the atlas. The head is gently flexed laterally to the right and rotated to the left, until slight tension is perceived in the tissues of the right contact. A high-velocity low-amplitude thrust is applied forward in the right transverse process of the atlas for a left rotation atlas.</interventions>
    <comparator>(control group):
The patient is evaluated by the cervical flexion-rotation test. For restricted left rotation:
The patient is lying supine with a little cervical left rotation, the therapist applies a disconnected ultrasound (US) without head motion behind the right transverse process of the atlas during one minute, simulating a static application of the US.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcomes are four variables of the stabilometry on force platform: Patients are standing with eyes closed and without contact between the teeth during 90 seconds.

Primary Outcome 1: Surface length ratio L / S (1 / mm) (factor measuring energy costs to maintain posture) (assessed with a force platform on standing position with eyes closed. Is the relationship between the area and the length which describes the projection of the center of gravity, that quantifies the energy cost to maintain the posture)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints of all variables: at baseline, immediately postintervention and at 7 and 15 days after intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: Surface area (mm2) (assessed with a force platform on standing position with eyes closed. Is the area that covers the path of the projection of the center of gravity)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline, immediately postintervention and at 7 and 15 days after intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 3: mean velocity (mm / s) (assessed with a force platform on standing position with eyes closed. Is the velocity with which the path of the projection of the center of gravity moves)</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline, immediately postintervention and at 7 and 15 days after intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: Range of motion of the limited cervical rotation (degrees) with the cervical flexion-rotation test.

With patients supine cervical range of motion (CROM) is measured during the cervical flexion-rotation test. The CROM is a floating compass (Plastimo Airguide Inc. (Compasses), Buffalo Groove, IL, USA) attached to the apex of the head by velcro straps. (positive below 33 degrees)

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was based on a pilot study, using the free software GRANMO simple size calculator (7.12 version).
Considering the Primary Outcome 1: Surface length ratio L / S (1 / mm), we determined that accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, a minimum of 22 subjects will be required in the first group and 22 in the second to detect a difference equal or greater than 0.44 (1 / mm). It is assumed that the common standard deviation is 0.4. It has been estimated rate of loss to follow 10%.
Data will be analysed by using the IBM-SPSS software package (version 21.0). Means and standard deviations will be calculated for each variable. A normal distribution of quantitative data will be assessed by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( p &gt; 0.05), a T-student test will be used at baseline to compare quantitative data of groups and a chi square test will be used for categorical data. Multivariate analysis of repeated measures (ANOVA) will be used to assess differences between groups, with covariants. The statistical analysis will be conducted at a 95% confidence level. A p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance in all analyses.
