  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study of the clinical outcomes of patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee treated by two different philosophies for knee joint replacement. Participants will be treated using either the Stryker MAKO Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR) using Robotic surgery (intervention) or
the Stryker Triathlon Total Knee System for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implanted using Stryker PrecisioN v4.0 Knee Navigation (control).

The Stryker MAKO UKR replaces the medial knee joint, using robot assistance for accurate cuts than if performed manually by a surgeon. The technique adds approximately 10 minutes to the procedure therefore the total time of the operation will be approximately 90 minutes. With better positioning of the implant, better outcomes are expected. The operations will be performed by consultant orthopaedic surgeons.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is the Stryker Triathlon Total Knee System for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implanted using Stryker PrecisioN v4.0 Knee Navigation (control). The navigation technique adds approximately 10 minutes to the procedure therefore the total time of the operation will be approximately 90 minutes. It involves the use of bony landmarks and computer navigation trackers to more accurately work out alignment of bony cuts aiding better positioning of the implant over not using it. The operations will be performed by consultant orthopaedic surgeons.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Justification
The New Zealand National Joint Registry reported a mean Oxford Knee Score of
37.05 (with a standard deviation of 8.30) at 6 months following total knee arthroplasty, using mostly conventional instruments (NZOA New Zealand Joint Registry, 2014).  

Beard et al. (2015) undertook a study comparing the clinical outcomes of Total Knee Replacement. They have determined that  a clinically meaningful change in Clinical trials is a 5-point change in Oxford Knee Scores. The distribution based minimal detectable change (MDC 90) was 4 points.

The power calculation has shown that to detect a 4 point change a minimum of 60 patients per group are required, based on an improvement of the Oxford Knee Score of 4 points, with 80% power, a standard deviation of 8.0 and a significance level of 5%. We have added an extra 10 patients to account for dropout, particularly from the UKA group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study of the clinical outcomes of patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee treated by two different philosophies for knee joint replacement. Participants will be treated using either the Stryker MAKO Unicompartmental Knee Replacement (UKR) using Robotic surgery (intervention) or
the Stryker Triathlon Total Knee System for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implanted using Stryker PrecisioN v4.0 Knee Navigation (control).
When compared to TKA, UKR knees have fewer complications, shorter hospital stay, better patient satisfaction, and a faster return to work. The downside to UKA is a higher revision rate when compared to TKA, particularly if components are implanted incorrectly. UKA surgery is more technically demanding than TKA, and errors in component positioning or ligament balancing can contribute to early failure.
Health status and functional outcome measures will be recorded to quantify functional status of subjects before surgery and at each followup interval. An economics analysis will also be conducted to compare costs associated with each technology platform.
A maximum of 65 cases will be enrolled in each group, for a total of 130 patients. It is expected that participants will be recruited over a 24 month period. Initial data analysis will occur at two year follow up, thus the total duration of the initial phase of the study is expected to be 4 years. Further follow up to monitor implant durability will continue for 10
years.
All participants (control and intervention groups) will be requested to attend visits preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 5 years and 10 years. At these visits participants will complete assessments relating to quality of life, pain and functional outcome.
Participants will have standard knee Xrays taken preoperatively and postoperatively.</summary>
