  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be divided into three groups according to the diagnosis: 1) infection with quick SOFA&lt;2, 2) sepsis, and 3)septic shock, according to the new definitions  (Singer M,  et al. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3). JAMA 2016;315:801-10).
The definition of sepsis will be given according to an increase in SOFA equal or greater than 2; while the definition of septic shock will require the use of vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and the presence of serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia. We will enroll prospectively the first 200 patients meeting the three diagnostic groups that enter the Emergency Department  of the Maggiore della Carita Hospital in Novara (this estimate will be refined on the basis of a pilot study).  We will also study a group of 30 healthy volunteers matched for gender and age.
 With this study we aim to demonstrate the presence and the prognostic role of endogenous autoantibodies and circulating mediators in the blood of the three groups of patients studied and in a group of controls.
Data and samples (blood and urine)  collection will be carried out at enrollment (T0), after 24 hours (T1), after 48 hours (T2) and after 7 days from the enrollment or at discharge (T3). We will also perform a telephonic follow-up 1 and 6 months after the enrollment in order to assess mortality.
Protein assays will be performed by using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in order to evaluate the blood or urine concentration of OPN and anti-OPN antibodies, IL-8 and anti-IL-8 IgM, ,  IL-6 and anti-IL-6,  GAS6 and sMer, suPAR, NGAL and KIM1.
Isolation and characterization of primary cultures of human kidney-derived endothelial cells will be carried out using typical endothelial markers (CD31, CD105, and von Willebrand factor). Plasma collected from septic patients will be incubated on these cells for specific in vitro assays: angiogenetic, apoptotic, quantification of nitric oxide (NO) generation and radical oxygen species (ROS) production assay.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>With this study we aim to demonstrate (as composite outcome) the presence and the prognostic role of endogenous autoantibodies and circulating mediators in the blood and urine of patients with 1) infection but quick SOFA&lt;2; 2) sepsis and 3) septic shock defined on the basis of the recently published new criteria. 
We will measure in blood and urine the concentration of OPN and anti-OPN antibodies, IL-8 and anti-IL-8 IgM,  IL-6 and anti-IL-6,  GAS6 and sMer, suPAR, NGAL and KIM1.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will evaluate the ability of the different biomarkers in blood and urine  (i.e.,OPN and anti-OPN antibodies, IL-8 and anti-IL-8 IgM,  IL-6 and anti-IL-6, GAS6 and sMer, suPAR, NGAL and KIM1). to  predict mortality at  1 and 6 months . Mortality will be assessed by looking at the medical records and by phone call,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mortality will be assessed at 1 and 6 months post enrolment.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>In order to perform our statistical analysis, patients will be divided into three groups (infection with quick SOFA less than 2, sepsis and septic shock) according to the diagnosis made by clinicians at the end of the study period. We will compute positive and negative predictive value for sepsis and septic shock of each biomarker and their ability in predicting 1 and 6-month mortality. We will also evaluate the survival during the 6-month follow-up period with Kaplan-Meier curves.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BACKGROUND: Sepsis represents an acute condition with high mortality.
Endogenous anti-cytokine autoantibodies are present in healthy subjects  and in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases. In autoimmune diseases, their role is detrimental as they cause dysfunction and worsen the illness.  Their presence and  role is sepsis is still not known.
AIM OF THE STUDY: With this study we aim to demonstrate the presence and the prognostic role of  autoantibodies and circulating mediators in the blood and urine of patients with sepsis and septic shock defined on the basis of the recently published new criteria. </summary>
