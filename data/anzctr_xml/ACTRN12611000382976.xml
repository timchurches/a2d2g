  <interventions>
    <interventions>The SHADE treatment program incorporates cognitive behaviour therapy and motivational enhancement strategies to encourage reductions in depression and alcohol/other drug use.  The program is available in two formats: (i) a 10-session program designed to be completed in a linear fashion, once weekly for 10 weeks, with content pre-programmed for each session; and (ii) a skill module program, where a series of shorter modules are presented based on themes related to depression and AOD use problems (e.g. coping with cravings, taking charge of my thoughts, staying well) arising from the 10-week program.  Clients and/or clinicians may choose to focus on just one skill module during a session, without having to complete the other skills and strategies contained in the resource.  Both versions of the SHADE program appear on the one DVD-Rom from which the program operates.  Text is pitched at a reading age of 14 years, with a voiceover available to read out all text contained in the resource.  Video case scenarios guide clients through a range of skills and strategies, and a range of handouts and worksheets are also available for clients/clinicians to print out and use during a session or as a homework activity.

This study is an intervention study, however the way in which the SHADE program is used is not prescribed or mandated by the research team.  Clinicians have received training in the use of the 10-session linear SHADE program (10 weekly sessions of approximately 60mins duration) and the SHADE SKill Modules (8 smaller modules of approximately 30 minutes duration) and asked to use either the linear or skill module program as per their clinical judgement.  This includes decisions based on whether to implement the full 10-session linear program or any of the skill modules, whether to complete the program during a session with a client at the Clinic, or to provide SHADE to the client to take home and complete as homework or in between sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual treatment within the Central Coast Drug and Alcohol Clinical Service (DACS), New South Wales, Australia.  The DACS forms part of a general health service, and provides a range of clinical interventions to residents within the catchment area with AOD use problems.  Services include counselling, detoxification (hospital-based and outreach), needle and syringe programs, pharmacotherapy services, a diversion program for people with AOD use problems and legal issues (Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment, MERIT), and a specialist service targeting clients with a primary drug of concern of marijuana.  A central intake service acts as the point of initial contact for access to DACS, with subsequent referrals made to relevant services as appropriate.  Client and Clinician participants will be recruited from the counselling services associated with the Central Coast DACS.  There are three counselling teams within this service, AOD Counselling, Marijuana Clinic and MERIT.</comparator>

    <concealment>All clients, new and ongoing, will be invited to partake in the study. Participants will be aged 18 years and over and residing on the Central Coast and surrounding areas of New South Wales.  Participants will consist of individuals attending counselling with primary presenting issues related to substance abuse or dependence. 

Following the provision of contact details to the research team via their clinician, current and ongoing clients of the Drug and Alcohol Clinical Service (DACS) are contacted to discuss consent to participate in the study.  Once consent is established, clients complete a baseline and 12-week follow-up assessment delivered over the telephone by research assistants independent from the DACS.  Clients are reimbursed $20 AUD for each completed assessment.

New referral to the DACS, via the centralized intake service, who have not been allocated to a clinician, will be contacted by AH, SW or MB (clinicians of the DACS) to discuss study participation and consent to release contact details to the research team.  Once these details have been provided to the research team, wait-list clients consent to complete a baseline and 12-week telephone assessment in the same manner as current/ongoing clients.  Wait-list clients are reimbursed $20 AUD for each completed assessment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>19 clinicians within an AOD service on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to the trial.  Consenting clinicians will participate in a baseline focus group discussion designed to explore their experiences and perceived barriers to adopting innovation in their clinical practice.  Computer comfort and openness to innovation will also be assessed.  Throughout the trial, current, new and wait-list clients will be referred to the research program via the clinical service, which will involve clients completing a baseline and 15-week follow-up clinical assessment with independent research assistants, comprising a range of mental health and AOD measures.  Clinicians will also complete session checklists following each clinical session with a client, outlining the extent to which the SHADE computer program was used.  Therapeutic alliance will be measured at intake and discharge from both the clinician and client perspectives.

This study will provide comprehensive data on the factors associated with the adoption of an innovative, computer-delivered evidence-based treatment program, SHADE, by clinicians working in an AOD service.  The results will contribute to the development of a model of dissemination of SHADE, which could be applied to a range of technological innovations.</summary>
