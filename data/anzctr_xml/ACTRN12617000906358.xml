    <scientifictitle>A prospective study to evaluate the safety and performance of a shape memory polymer foam embolization device for arterial or venous embolization of the peripheral vasculature system by assessing rates of  serious adverse events and unanticipated serious adverse device effects from the day of procedure through 30 days post-procedure.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The shape memory polymer foam embolization device  is intended for use by physicians trained and experienced in embolization techniques, angiographic techniques, and interventional procedures.  In this single arm study, each study subject will undergo a single index procedure for permanent device implantation by a qualified interventional radiolologist.  The pushable polymeric embolization device is designed to be delivered to the target vessel using a guidewire through a standard catheter, guided by angiography.  The plug delivery, deployment and verification procedures require about 10 minutes.</interventions>
