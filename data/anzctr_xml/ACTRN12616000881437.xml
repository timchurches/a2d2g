  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: 
Participants in Group 1 will receive one session of dry needling using the fast-in and fast-out technique described by Hong of the adductor pollicis muscle on the left hand.
 
- Materials: a felt-tip pen to mark the latent myofascial trigger point, alcohol, and disposable stainless-steel needles (0.3 Ã— 30 mm; Novasan, S.A., Madrid, Spain)

- Procedures: Participants will be placed in a supine position on the examination table.  The physiotherapist will locate and mark the latent myofascial trigger point of the adductor pollicis muscle on the left hand with a pincer palpation. Once the latent myofascial trigger point is located, the overlying skin will be cleaned with alcohol. The subject will put its forearm in a neutral pronosupination, and the needle will be inserted into the subject's skin over the palpated latent miofascial trigger point, from the dorsal zone to the palmar zone. The needle will be inserted so as to penetrate the skin 10 to 15 mm until a local twitch response is obtained.  Once this response is obtained, the needle will be moved up and down (2- to 3-mm vertical motions with no rotations) 12 times at approximately 1 Hz. As soon as the needle is pulled out from the subject's skin, the physiotherapist will press firmly the region of the needle insertion for at least 2 minutes, to prevent excessive bleeding.
 
- Who: the intervention will be provided by a university professor expert in dry needling. The professor itself will make all the interventions.
 
- The study will be carried out in a conditioned room of Alcala de Henares University
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is  Group 2
 
Participants in Group 2 will receive one session of sham dry needling of the adductor pollicis muscle on the left hand.
 
- Materials: a felt-tip pen to mark the latent myofascial trigger point and alcohol. In order to develop this technique, we will use Streitberger Placebo-needles.
 
- Procedures: Participants will be placed in a supine position on the examination table.  The physiotherapist will locate and mark the latent myofascial trigger point of the adductor pollicis muscle on the left hand with a pincer palpation. Once the latent myofascial trigger point is located, the overlying skin will be cleaned with alcohol. Later, the physiotherapist will apply the ring at this point. Then, he will cover and fix the ring with plaster. (This material is included in Streitberger Placebo-needles).  Finally, he will introduce the needle through the plaster inside the ring. As soon as the placebo needle touches the skin, the handle of the needle will have to be pushed over the needle. The movement of the needle will be repeated 12 times. After, the placebo needle will need to be removed quickly gripping it at the needle, not at the handle. Once, the placebo needle is removed, the physiotherapist will make pressure on the trigger point during 2 minutes as in Group 1. 

- Who: the intervention will be provided by a university professor expert in dry needling. The professor itself will make all the interventions.
 
- The study will be carried out in a conditioned room of Alcala de Henares University

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: One of the possible analgesic mechanisms of the dry needling is the analgesia caused by stress, produced by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Although it is known that some techniques as acupuncture produce some changes in the autonomic nervous system, there is still a knowledge gap about the relation between dry needling and the autonomic nervous system.
Aim: To determine if the application of dry needling causes the activation of the sympathetic nervous system generating an analgesic effect by stress in healthy subjects.
Methodology: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial was performed at the University of AlcalÃ¡, involving a sample of 65 healthy volunteer subjects who accomplish the selection criteria, with an average age of 27,78 (DT = 8,41) years, within which the 50,8 per cent are men and the 49,2 per cent are women. The participants have been assigned by random to participate in group 1, to which a deep dry needling has been applied; or in group 2, to which a placebo needling technique has been applied. The intervention technique was applied in the adductor pollicis muscle of the left hand in both groups. In order to evaluate the sympathetic nervous system, the skin conductance, the heart rate, the heart rate variability, the skin temperature and the breathing rate prior have been measured, during and twice after the intervenction; with the biofeedback Nexus 10 MK-II equipment, as well as the salivary cortisol levels before and after the intervenction. The pressure pain threshold has been collected in the adductor pollicis muscle of the left hand and of the right tibialis anterior with a hand algometer, before and after the intervention. Moreover, the pain during the dry needling has been registered through a Verbal Numerical Scale of pain and the elicited local twitch responses.
Key words: Dry needling, Physiological Effects, Autonomic Nervous System.</summary>
