  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single study split into 3 parts.  Data from part 1 will be used to determine dilution concentrations of DSM265 for Part 2 and safety data from Part 2 will determine proceeding to Part 3.  Healthy volunteers involved in Part 1 only . A single participant who was previously experienced a experienced a cutaneous allergic reaction to DSM265 will participate in Parts 2 and 3. 
Part 1:
Skin Prick Test with:
-4 incremental concentrations (1:1000, 1:100, 1: 10 and 1:1) of DSM265 solutions
- Positive control (histamine dihydrochloride)
-Negative control (glycerine-saline).  
All participants will receive all four doses of DSM265.  
Safety Assessments (clinical haematology and biochemistry blood tests, viral serology (HIV, Hep B, Hep C) vitals signs, ECG, urinalysis)
Urine Drug screening
Pregnancy Testing

Part 2:
Skin Prick Test: 
-3 incremental concentrations of the non-irritant dose of DSM265 determined from Part 1 (1:1, 1:10, 1:100)
-Positive control (histamine dihydrochloride)
-Negative control (glycerine-saline)
-Reference concentration (1:1000) of Polysorbate 80
Safety Assessments (clinical haematology and biochemistry blood tests, viral serology (HIV, Hep B, Hep C) vitals signs, ECG, urinalysis)
Urine Drug screening
Pregnancy Testing

Part 3:
Oral dose of DSM265 of up to 400mg .  The patient will be given an initial dose equivalent to 1:10 (40mg) of the previous dose linked to the cutaneous reaction in study QP15C11. 
If there has been no development of signs or symptoms of a reaction after 2 hours of the first dose, a second dose equivalent to 9:10 (360mg) of DSM 265 will be given and the patient observed for a further 3 hours.
Safety Assessments (clinical haematology and biochemistry blood tests, viral serology (HIV, Hep B, Hep C) vitals signs, ECG, urinalysis)
Urine Drug screening
Pregnancy Testing
skin biopsy (if required)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 1 (healthy volunteers): Local safety and tolerability of DSM265 during SPT procedure.  The largest diameter of the wheal of each individual test is measured, a positive reading being a wheal of greater than or equal to 3mm with or without erythema. In case of a positive reaction with the negative control, the SPT must be regarded as non-reliable. 
Similarly, the skin tests results to the two possible allergens (DSM265 and Polysorbate 80) will be interpreted independently of the size of the histamine reaction. Photographs of the skin may be taken to assist with interpretation of the reaction and kept as part of the study records.
Subjects will be monitored and safety data collected by way of clinical interviews, observations and examinations, through ECG reports and laboratory evaluations.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Part 1 Skin Prick Test results will be assessed for each participant 6 hours post skin prick test.  
Safety Review Meeting will be conducted within 7 days of SPT procedure to review the data and confirm safe to proceed to Part 2 and non-irritant dose of DSM265.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2 (single subject): SPT results (DSM265, polysorbate 80, histamine, glycerine-saline), The largest diameter of the wheal of each individual test is measured, a positive reading being a wheal of greater than or equal to 3mm with or without erythema. In case of a positive reaction with the negative control, the SPT must be regarded as non-reliable.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical research study investigating the allergic potential of the experimental anti-malarial drug DSM265. Following the occurrence of cutaneous rash in one healthy subject (hereafter, subject R107) involved in a clinical investigation of the antimalarial potential of DSM265 (QP15C11/P2142), the study sponsor intends to perform cutaneous testing with DSM265. This new study has 3 parts. In Part 1, skin prick testing with various concentrations of DSM265 will be carried out in 10 healthy volunteers, to determine a non-irritant concentration for subsequent testing. In Part 2, subject R107 will be skin prick tested for DSM265 allergy, as well as for allergy to polysorbate 80, an excipient used in the preparation and in many commercially available drugs. Part 3 of the study will proceed if subject R107 skin prick testing in Part 2 is negative or inconclusive: subject R107 will be administered DSM265 p.o. and assessed for allergic symptoms.</summary>
