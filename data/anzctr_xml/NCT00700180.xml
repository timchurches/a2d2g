  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) by Dichotomized Baseline Plasma Marker Level - Overall response was analyzed and correlated within dichotomized (low- and high-level) baseline plasma biomarker (basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF], E-selection, intracellular adhesion molecule [ICAM], placental growth factor [PlGF], vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGF A], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]-1, and VEGFR-2) subgroups: low-level equals (=) less than or equal to (=) median baseline level, high-level=greater than (&gt;) median baseline level. Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.0 CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR defined as greater than or equal to (=)30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease; no new lesions. Complete and partial responses must have been confirmed no less than 4 weeks after criteria for response were first met</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 21 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 (Bv + chemo), Day 21 of Cycles 7, 8, 9, and 10 (Bv), Day 21 of every other cycle (Bv), and at disease progression.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - Percentage of Participants With an Event - PFS was defined as the time between randomization and progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST criteria, or death due to any cause. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started. Disease progression was evaluated according to the RECIST using computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, X-ray, bone scans, or clinical examination. Participants without an event were censored at the date of last follow up for progression. Participants with no post baseline follow-up for progression were censored at the day of randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 1, weekly to disease progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - Time to Event - PFS was defined as the time between randomization and disease progression or death due to any cause. Participants without an event were censored at the date of last follow up for progression. Participants with no post baseline follow-up for progression were censored at the day of randomization. Disease progression was evaluated according to the RECIST using CT scans, MRI scans, X-ray, bone scans, or clinical examination. Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 1, weekly to disease progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Percentage of participants with CR or PR according to RECIST criteria. Per RECIST v1.0: CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as =30% decrease under baseline of the sum of the LD of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Complete and partial responses were confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 21 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, Day 21 of Cycles 7, 8, 9, and 10, Day 21 of every other cycle, and at disease progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Measurable Disease at Baseline Who Achieved CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 6 Weeks - Percentage of participants with measurable disease at baseline who on assessment achieved CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST. Per RECIST v1.0: CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions, non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. PR was defined as =30% decrease under baseline of the sum of the LD of all target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. SD defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since start of treatment. Complete and partial responses must have been confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met. For participants with SD, follow-up assessments must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 21 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, Day 21 of Cycles 7, 8, 9, and 10, Day 21 of every other cycle, and at disease progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Percentage of Participants With an Event - Duration of response is defined as time in months from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Participants without an event (documented progression or death) were censored at the date of last follow-up for progression. Duration of response was only calculated for participants who had a confirmed objective tumor response (CR or PR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 21 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, Day 21 of Cycles 7, 8, 9, and 10, Day 21 of every other cycle, and at disease progression</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Time to Event - The median time, in months, from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Participants without an event (documented progression or death) were censored at the date of last follow-up for progression. Duration of response was only calculated for participants who had a confirmed objective tumor response (CR or PR). Median Duration of Response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Percentage of Participants With an Event - Overall survival was defined as the time between randomization and death due to any cause. Participants without an event were censored at the last time they were known to be alive. Overall Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will explore the correlation of biomarkers with response rate, and the overall
      efficacy and safety, of Avastin in combination with carboplatin-based chemotherapy in
      patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be
      randomized to one of 2 groups, to receive either Avastin 7.5mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 week
      cycle, or Avastin 15mg/kg iv on day 1 of each 3 week cycle; all patients will also receive
      treatment with carboplatin and either gemcitabine or paclitaxel for a maximum of 6 cycles.
      The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample
      size is 100-500 individuals.</summary>
