  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study included a control group of 30 women without history of abortion who delivered at least one living child and an abortion group of 30 nulliparous women with history of two or more unexplained recurrent abortion. Trans-vaginal three dimensional pulsed color Doppler ultrasound was done at 21-23 day of the menstrual cycle to measure uterine arteries resistance and pulsation indices and the sub-endometrial vascular, flow and vascular-flow indicies. Isosorbid mononitrate 20 mg tablet was administered once only vaginally in the abortion group after the Doppler ultrasound was completed and after two hours the blood flow indices were measured again </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The control group included primipara who had a normal vaginal delivery and no history of abortion. The unexplained recurrent abortion group (URA) group had the following inclusion criteria: 1- Nullipara.  2- History of two or more successive URA. Diagnosis of URA entails1 presence of a normal uterine cavity by hysterography, no luteal phase defect (progesterone level greater than 10 ng / ml), normal thyroid function tests (TSH, T3 and T4), normal levels of lupus anticoagulant measured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (32 - 43 seconds), normal levels of anticardiolipin IgG (less than 20 GPL) and IgM (less than 15 MPL) antibodies measured by ELISA and normal karyotyping (done for 10 cases with more than three successive abortions). Patients treated with vasodilators were also excluded. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Decreased uterine blood flow has been claimed a cause of unexplained recurrent abortion. Nitric oxide plays a major role in increasing uterine blood flow during the luteal phase and early pregnancy and impaired nitric oxide synthesis may be a cause of recurrent abortion. The study was done to compare uterine artery and sub-endometrial blood flow indices during the luteal phase in patients with history of unexplained recurrent abortion compared to normal fertile women and to evaluate the effects of nitric oxide donors on blood flow indices in the abortion group. </summary>
