Treatment: devices - CP910/CP920

Other: Conventional CI - The conventional CI group will receive the noise reduction on and off signal processing test programs. This is a within subject repeated measures design, so all subjects will receive the same testing but in a counterbalanced order.

Other: Hybrid CI - The Hybrid CI group will receive the noise reduction on and off signal processing test programs. This is a within subject repeated measures design, so all subjects will receive the same testing but in a counterbalanced order.


Treatment: devices: CP910/CP920 with noise reduction on
This intervention uses the approved Nucleus 6 system (CP910/CP920 and accessories) but adds the investigational noise reduction algorithm.

Treatment: devices: CP910/CP920
The approved CP910 or CP920 Sound Processor.
