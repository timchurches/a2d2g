  <interventions>
    <interventions>People with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with a combiantion of artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS plus SP) and observed for 42 days. Artesunate tablets (100 mg) will be administered orally once a day at a dose of 4 mg/kg per day for three consecutive days. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine tablets (500/25 mg) will be administered orally once a day for three days. The number of tablets to be administered  is based on patient age  /5-11 months = half tablet; 1-6 years = 1 tablet; 7-13 years= 2 tablets; 13 years and over = 3 tablets).  The dosing regimen of artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine correspond to the standard of care for the treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria  in Afghanistan.</interventions>
