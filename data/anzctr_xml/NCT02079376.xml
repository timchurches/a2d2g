Experimental: Low blood TG patients - subjects with baseline blood triglyceride level = 1.7 mmol/l will have intervention device (DIAMOND Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG)) programmed to deliver GCM signal including the setting of automatic eating detection parameters for a 48 weeks period.

Experimental: High blood TG patients treated with blood TG lowering therapy - subjects with baseline blood triglyceride level &gt; 1.7 mmol/l will have their device programmed to deliver GCM signal including the setting of automatic eating detection parameters for a 48 weeks period and will receive fenofibrate at the dose of 160mg per day

Placebo Comparator: High blood TG patients - subjects with baseline blood triglyceride level &gt; 1.7 mmol/l will have their device programmed to deliver GCM signal including the setting of automatic eating detection parameters for a 48 weeks period and will receive placebo of fenofibrate administered in the same schedule as the drug.
