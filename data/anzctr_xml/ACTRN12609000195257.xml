  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants will be asked to taste three different concentrations of oral fish oil (100%, 40% and 10%), diluted with light olive oil, such that the total dosage of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) will not exceed 5g. The oral fish oil will be presented on fruit juice, and rinsed down by a further dose of fruit juice. The tastings will take place on the same day with approximately 2-3 minutes between samples.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Side effects - the day following the tasting, study participants will be contacted and asked to report any perceived side effects. Possible side effects, such as fishy after taste and loose bowels, described at time of consent and given to participants in writing on the information sheet.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Liquid fish oil is increasingly used in the treatment of a range of inflammatory conditions, however there has not been any work conducted which investigates the acceptability of fish oil to older adults. Considering the evidence that there are numerous factors which affect taste sensitivity in the older population, it may be that fish oil acceptability differs in this group. The aim of the study is to determine the level of acceptability of fish oil to older adults and identify any differences in acceptability between patient groups.</summary>
