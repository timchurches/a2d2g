    <interventions>Intervention: Group cognitive behavioural therapy for clinical perfectionism. In this intervention participants receive 8 x 2-hour sessions of group therapy over 8 weeks, where they learn strategies to reduce their clinical perfectionism. The strategies are derived from the book Overcoming Perfectionism: A Self-help Guide Using Cognitive Behavioural Techniques (Shafran, Egan &amp; Wade, 2010).</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist control group: Participants assigned to the waitlist condition will wait for 8 weeks, and then will receive the group cognitive behavioural therapy for clinical perfectionism intervention for eight weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>Individuals interested in the study who telephone the Curtin University Psychology and Speech Clinic will be emailed or posted the Concern over Mistakes subscale of the Frost Multi-dimensional Perfectionism Scale (Frost et al., 1990), an information sheet about the study and a consent form. Participants who score at 24.7 + on the Concern Over Mistakes subscale (i.e., have clinical levels of perfectionism) and consent to the study will be telephone- screened by Alicia Handley to assess their eligibility. Ineligible participants will be referred to external services. The telephone screening will involve administering the MINI-screen (Sheehan &amp; Lecrubier, 2006), the MINI modules corresponding to the exclusion criteria (Sheehan et al., 1998) and asking questions corresponding to the inclusion criteria. Ineligible individuals will be referred to external services. At this point the researcher has no knowledge of the condition that a participant will be in. Eligible individuals will be advised on the telephone that they will have a baseline assessment in a few days and that only after they have had this baseline assessment, they will be randomly allocated to either be in the intervention condition or the waitlist control condition. Eligible individuals then have their baseline assessment, where they will be administered a battery of assessment measures. At this point the researcher still does not know which condition the participant will be allocated to. The researcher will then use Saghaeiâ€™s (2004) Random Allocation computer software version 1.0 to randomly allocate participants to conditions. It is only after this random allocation has occurred that the researcher becomes aware which condition the participant has been allocated to.</concealment>
    <sequence>A simple random allocation procedure will be employed to randomly allocate participants to conditions. The researcher will use Saghaeiâ€™s (2004) Random Allocation software version 1.0, which generates randomised number lists. The number of individuals per group and the number of groups will be inputted into the system to ensure that group sizes are equal (Steele &amp; Wade, 2008).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will primarily examine whether a group psychological treatment for clinical perfectionism is better than being on an eight-week waitlist in a) reducing individuals' levels of clinical perfectionism, b) reducing their symptoms of anxiety, depression, and/or eating concerns and c) improving their quality of life. It is predicted that the group treatment will lead to greater reductions in clinical perfectionism, greater reductions in psychological symptoms, and greater increases in quality of life compared to the waitlist control condition. Additionally this project will examine whether group psychological treatment for clinical perfectionism produces treatment-related change in each individual and whether this is clinically significant.</summary>
