  <interventions>
    <interventions>This proposed research will be an experimental study trialling an autonomous paramedic model for pre-hospital thrombolysis (PHT) within St John Ambulance Service, New Zealands largest ambulance provider, without physician oversight and authorisation. We hypothesise that adopting this approach will lead to improved patient outcomes, with reduced hospital admission times compared to the physician-authorised telemetry model. Economic benefits are also likely.

Paramedics will provide the existing treatment of PHT following the existing drug regime. The criteria for autonomous paramedic-delivered PHT will include the following:

1. DEFINITE STEMI ONLY: Paramedic and heart monitor interpretation of STEMI (&gt;&gt;&gt; Acute MI &lt;&lt;&lt;)

2. ST elevation greater than or equal to 1mm in two or more limbs leads (I, II, III, aVL or aVF) or 

3. ST elevation greater than or equal to 2mm in two or more contiguous chest leads (V1-V6) AND

4. Symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia of less than 12hrs duration AND

5. Transport time to hospital greater than 15 minutes

The existing PHT drug regime that will be utilised includes:

*Aspirin 300mg per oral (PO)

*Enoxaparin 30mg intravenously (IV) for patients under 75yrs of age only

*Tenecteplase IV  dose dependent based on the patients weight using the graduations on the syringe

*Enoxaparin 1mg/kg subcutaneous based on the patients weight using the graduations on the syringe

*Clopidogrel 600mg PO for patients under 75yrs of age only. For patients over 75yrs give 300 mg PO.

The overall intervention period for this study will be 20 months.

</interventions>
    <comparator>We will compare two groups of STEMI patients both of which have received PHT from paramedics but by two different models of provision. The first group, a historic retrospective cohort, will have already received PHT from paramedics under the existing physician-authorised telemetry model. In contrast, the second group, a prospective cohort, will receive PHT from paramedics who make an autonomous clinical decision under protocol that PHT is indicated, without the need for telemetry or physician-authorisation. The difference between these two groups is the intervention  the new autonomous paramedic PHT protocol that permits this new independent model of paramedic PHT provision. 

Data for the historic cohort will be collected from patient medical records within the Ambulance Service and the receiving hospital. This will be within a 36 month period from October 2008 to October 2011.</comparator>

The sensitivity and specificity along with PPV and NPV of the paramedics clinical diagnoses will be determined from their identification of patients suitable for PHT or not. This will occur in the prospective cohort. Three independent cardiology consultants (experts) will review all cases to determine actual field diagnosis. Accuracy of paramedic protocol application will be measured against this gold standard. In addition, the rate of True Positive and True Negative cases, along with False Positive and False Negative cases will be determined in the prospective cohort. Each of these cases will be described as proportions of the total number of clinical decisions made. Causes of False Positives and False Negatives will also be investigated.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>a) The retrospective cohort (n = 54) will include patients at/or greater than 18 years of age who have received paramedic-delivered PHT under physician authorisation in the Northland and Hawkes Bay regions since this historic PHT model was established in 2008.

b) The prospective cohort (n = 54) will include; patients at/or greater than 18 years of age who receive autonomous paramedic-delivered PHT; or those who have been considered for the treatment over a 20 month period; in the Northland and Hawkes Bay regions; and in line with protocol criteria. In addition, during this 20-month prospective period, the study will also investigate all patients at/or greater than 18 years of age transported by paramedics without PHT treatment in the same regions, but who went on to receive in-hospital thrombolysis following an in-hospital diagnosis of STEMI.

    <designfeatures>This proposed study has a prospective analysis of differences design. Data from two separate groups of STEMI patients (an historic retrospective cohort and a prospective cohort) will be collected and analysed and a post-intervention comparison made. The Prospective data analysis enables standardisation of measures used in the study and provides stronger confidence in the design. A true experimental design with randomisation was considered neither ethical nor pragmatic due to the impossibility of blinding the protocol application, as well as the lengthy time frame required to reach statistically significant levels of patient numbers. Therefore, our selected design provides a reasonable alternative with efficient use of available patient data. Data will be collected from patient medical records within the Ambulance Service and the receiving hospital. Medical records provide an abundance of information that can be evaluated in context. However, inconsistencies may exist and information may be incomplete. For these reasons we intend to primarily draw on data in the records that are part of gold standard routine assessments conducted on all patients in context with the study. </designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on a previous New Zealand paramedic PHT study involving 100 patients and an a priori power analysis using their data, 108 patients are required, being 54 patients within each of the two observed groups. This was assuming a statistical significance level of alpha = 0.05, denoting a 95% confidence interval, a power of 0.80 and an expected effect size of 0.30.

The current version of SPSS statistical software will be used for statistical analysis and the significance level will be set at 0.05.  Initial analysis will be primarily descriptive, producing frequencies, mean and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges where relevant and testing for normal distributions of continuous measures e.g. time between events. If normality is not achieved, transformations such as the log of measure will be examined. 
To test Hypothesis One, the rates of True Positive and True Negative, along with False Positive and False Negative cases will be identified. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of paramedic protocol application will then be calculated. This will be achieved by use of a frequency score and subsequent presentation of results utilising a frequency distribution table, with comparison of scores to the standard (a dummy variable) as determined by three independent cardiologists (experts).
In order to test Hypotheses Two and Three, both observed groups will initially be compared using Chi-squared tests and comparisons of medians will be made using Mann-Whitney U tests. Primary analyses will compare the two groups using logistic regression for dichotomous outcome measures such as mortality, and general linear models for continuous measures such as length of hospital stay. Confounders such as time to PHT, time to hospital, patient demographics, time of day and severity of condition will also be examined. Presentation characteristics of patients before and after initiation of the intervention will be compared (e.g. demographics, distance from hospital, presentation symptoms). If significant differences are present, those characteristics will be added as covariates to the model after examination for potential correlations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart disease is the second leading cause of death in New Zealand, after cancer. At the acute end of the spectrum of this disease is ST-elevation myocardial Infarction (STEMI), a common type of heart attack and the most severe. However, specific treatments are available for STEMI patients, which have high rates of success, especially if they are performed early, within the first hours of symptom onset. One such treatment is thrombolysis which involves the administration of certain drugs. This treatment is time-dependent, with early provision conferring the greatest clinical benefits and results. Paramedics are able to play a key strategic role in achieving this objective, as they are often the first healthcare professionals to encounter the STEMI patient. 

Internationally, autonomous paramedic-delivered pre-hospital thrombolysis (PHT) has proven to be the most effective strategy in facilitating expedited delivery of this treatment modality. However, within New Zealand ambulance services have been slow to adopt and/or refine such paramedic-based approaches. Current New Zealand models rely on physician authorised telemetry-based systems which have proved problematic, particularly due to technological failings.

This proposed research will be an experimental study trialling an autonomous paramedic model for PHT within St John Ambulance Service, New Zealands largest ambulance provider, without physician oversight and authorisation. We hypothesise that adopting this approach will lead to improved patient outcomes, with reduced hospital admission times compared to the physician-authorised telemetry model. Economic benefits are also likely.
