  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two intervention arms will be included:
Eight weeks of high speed strengthening exercise program (twice per week)
or
Eight weeks of combination of high speed strengthening and balance exercises (twice per week).
High speed resistance training: the program will include 6-8 exercises targeting the lower limbs as follows: leg press, squat, step-up, lunges, going up stairs, sit to stand, calf raises. Exercise program will  be performed twice a week for 8 weeks for approximately 30min for each exercise session. Participants will be instructed to perform the exercises in a rapid and explosive manner.
The 8 weeks program will be divided into the following phases to allow gradual progression and increase of the resistance for the high speed resistance training exercises (weight/training load) as follows:
Phase 1  week 1-2 (4 sessions). Participants will perform 2 sets of 8-12 repetitions with 20-40% 1RM 
Phase 2  week  3-5 (6 sessions). Participants will perform 2 sets of 5-10 repetitions with 40-60% 1RM
Phase 3  week 6-8 (6 sessions). Participants will perform 2-3 sets of 2-5 repetitions with 60-80% 1RM
Intensity will be monitored using the RPE scale with expected RPE between 11-17/20.
High speed resistance and balance training: the program will include the same exercises as the high speed resistance training group with the addition of 6 balance exercises. Exercise program will  be performed twice a week for 8 weeks for approximately 45min for each exercise session. The balance exercises will include the following: walking forward and backward, single leg standing, single leg tapping, side stepping and backward walking. Each balance exercise will initially be of 15-30 seconds duration and be performed twice per session. 
Both exercise programs of both groups will be supervised by accredited exercise physiologist or physiotherapist. Exercise sessions will be one on one with the participants and will take place at Victoria University Exercise Rehabilitation Clinic, Footscray Campus. Attendance will be monitored using individual training log to be recorded by the supervisor.</interventions>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data collected for feasibility and safety will be analysed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) as follows: The percentage of participants who complete the intervention, overall percentage of sessions attended, number of participants who dropout, number of sessions and or number of exercises stopped due to pain, any adverse event or incident that stopped the participant from completing the prescribed exercise.
Reported pain level will also be analysed using descriptive statistic as follows: pain level during the exercise program, 2 hours and 24 hours after the a session, any substantial increase in pain level, and overall pain level before and at the completion of the program.
To determine statistical trends of effectiveness, analyses of the selected outcomes such as pain, strength, balance, physical function and executive functions will be performed to assess the changes within and between groups over time (pre/post). Therefore, repeated measure ANOVA with factors of intervention (exercise group 1, exercise group 2, control) and time (pre-post intervention) will be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the feasibility, safety, and patient satisfaction of a high speed resistance training program with and without balance exercises in people with knee osteoarthritis compared to a control group. Given the pain associated with knee osteoarthritis, it is crucial to determine what effect high speed resistance training that focuses on muscle power has on knee pain. The effect of the exercise interventions on strength, physiological and functional risk factors for falls, pain, and executive function will also be assessed.</summary>
