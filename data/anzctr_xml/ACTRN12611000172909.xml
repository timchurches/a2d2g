  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently an epidemic of caesarean sections performed in Australia and overseas. Although many caesarean sections are performed for concerns about fetal welfare, the majority of babies are shown to be well at birth, meaning that the operation, with its inherent short- and long-term risks, could have been avoided, without compromising the babys health. In this study, half the babies with a non-reassuring heart rate recording during labour will have a blood test to measure lactate and the other half will not. We will then determine whether having a lactate test makes a difference in the number women having caesarean births.</summary>
