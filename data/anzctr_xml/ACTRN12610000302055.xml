  <interventions>
    <interventions>Application of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) in the conventional manner (100Hertz and 60 microseconds) and cryotherapy in the form of ice compress over the soleus muscle. Both Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation and cryotherapy were used for 30 minutes in single session. All the subjects underwent three days of assessment after the following procedures were randomly applied:  TENS, cryotherapy or control. The application interval among the resources was of at least 24 hours</interventions>
    <comparator>In the affected limb, the recording of H-reflex, M response of the soleus muscle and electromyogram (EMG) of the tibialis anterior muscle occurred before and after the application of TENS and cryotherapy on different days. In the control, there was not treatment and the evaluation happened in two moments, before and after 30minutes, in a single day in agreement with the randomization. The non-affected limb was evaluated once for comparison with the affected limb.</comparator>

    <summary>Objectives. Investigate the hyperreflexia of patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and identify the immediate effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and cryotherapy on the spasticity and electromyographic activity of hemiparetic subjects.
Design: Nonrandomized Controlled Trial:
Setting: The experiment were conducted in the Laboratory of Analysis of the Human Movement of Physiology Laboratory of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte.
Subjects: 16 subjects with CVA-related sequel
Intervention: application of TENS in the conventional manner (100Hz and 60Âµs) and cryotherapy in the form of ice compress over the soleus muscle
Assessment measurements: H-reflex, M response, Hmax/Max, H-reflex latency and RMS value of surface EMG.
Results: The Hmax/Mmax was significantly higher in the affected limb (P=0.0245). H-reflex latency was significantly lower in the affected limb (P=0.0375). The EMG amplitude of the muscle antagonist of the spastic muscle was decreased in the compromised limb (P&lt; 0.0001). After TENS there was a reduction in the Hmax/Mmax ratio (P=0.0006) and therefore in hyperreflexia. However, soon after ice application there was an increase in the Hmax/Mmax ratio (P=0.0007) and an increase in the latency (P=0.0001). EMG amplitude was not significantly altered by any of the resources. Statistically significant differences were found when the Hmax/Mmax ratio (P&lt;0.0001) and H reflex latency (P&lt;0.0001) were compared between post-TENS, post-cryotherapy and control.
Conclusion: We conclude that TENS can be used for the immediate reduction of spasticity and that cryotherapy may increase hyperreflexia in spastic patients. However, the decrease or increase in spasticity after intervention did not alter electromyographic activity in the antagonist of the spastic muscle.</summary>
