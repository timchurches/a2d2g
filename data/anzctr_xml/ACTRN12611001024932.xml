  <interventions>
    <interventions>The RAVES Decision Aid (DA) was developed in accordance with the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS). The content was based on a literature review and consultation with experts, including urologists, radiation and medical oncologists, trialists, consumers and psycho-oncologists. The DA includes  an evidence-based representation of risk of prostate cancer recurrence for men eligible for the trial, their treatment options, the rationale for trials in general and the RAVES trial in particular. A description of the trial treatment arms and procedures, the randomisation process, the potential benefits and costs of trial participation, and a summary of treatment the procedures and schedules on each arm of the trial are presented together with a set of values clarification exercises to help men weigh up the pros and cons of participation in light of their values and life situation. The materials (DA or notebook) will be randomly distributed to eligible participants by the urologists and radiation oncologists involved in this study at their initial consultation. The materials will be part of a package that contains the patient information sheet, consent form and questionnaires. Additional questionnaires will be sent 1 month and 6 months later. This study will recruit patients over a total period of two years.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is a blank notebook for participants to write personal notes. The materials (DA or notebook) will be randomly distributed to eligible participants by the urologists and radiation oncologists involved in this study at their initial consultation. The materials will be part of a package that contains the patient information sheet, consent form and questionnaires. Additional questionnaires will be sent 1 month and 6 months later.</comparator>

    <concealment>All centres participating in the RAVES trial (TROG 08.03) will be invited to participate in the RAVES-DA study. Potential participants will be identified by their urologist or radiation oncologist, who will introduce the RAVES trial (TROG 08.03) and the associated DA study. The recruiter will be provided with a box of pre-randomised study packages by the DA researchers, and after brief introduction of the study and use of an eligibility/ineligibility checklist, will give consecutive packages to interested men considering the RAVES trial, whilst remaining blinded to the allocation.  The recruiter will record the ID from the front of the package and the man’s name and contact details on a form, which will be emailed securely to the DA researchers as a password protected document. The DA researchers will then call the participant to further explain the DA study, answer any questions, confirm consent to participate, and prompt return of the baseline questionnaire to the research team. Recruiters will also complete a fax sheet for men who decline, with the man’s initials and the reason for declining (if known).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed by a statistician blinded to the identity of participants, using computer-generated random numbers at the Psycho-Oncology Cooperative Research Group (PoCoG), at the University of Sydney. Randomisation will be stratified by recruiter.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a prospective evaluation and follow up looking at the utility of a decision aid for patients considering participation in a RAVES (Radiotherapy - Adjuvant Versus Early Salvage) Prostate Cancer trial (NCT00860652; TROG 08.03). It will compare participants who receive the decision-aid with those who receive a notebook to write down personal thoughts in relation to rates of recruitment and decision-making outcomes.
Clinical trials are crucial to determine the best possible care for patients. However, low accrual and retention rates slow the introduction of new treatments in health care. This study will assess whether a decision aid for participating in a clinical trial improves accrual and reduces dropout rates. This mechanism for standardising information delivery about trials may ease the pressure on health professionals and the health system and transform the process of gaining informed consent. 

Who is it for? 

You may be eligible for this study if you are 18 and above, male, and eligible to participate in RAVES (TROG 08.03), i.e. you have prostate cancer with positive margins and/or stage pT3 disease following radical prostatectomy.

Trial details

In this study you will receive either the RAVES Decision Aid (DA) including an evidence-based representation of risk of prostate cancer recurrence for men eligible for the trial, their treatment options, the rationale for trials in general and the RAVES trial in particular, or a blank notebook for participants to write personal notes. The materials (DA or notebook) will be randomly distributed to eligible participants by the urologists and radiation oncologists involved in this study at their initial consultation, and form part of a package that contains the patient information sheet, consent form and questionnaires. 
Each participant will be sent follow-up questionnaires at 1 month and 6 months after recruitment. Thus the duration of participation for individuals is about 6 months. Recruitment to the study will continue over a period of two years.</summary>
