  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety of G-FC3 and G-Clb as measured by the incidence of grade 3+ non-haematological and grade 4 haematological adverse events.  All non-haematological and haematological AEs (e.g. grade 3-4 infection and grade 3; thrombocytopenia, neutropenia) in the grades mentioned will be evaluated.  As there are 3 chemotherapeutic agents details are in the investigators brochure and patient information and consent form.</outcome>
      <timepoint>To assess the safety of protocol treatment, the primary endpoint will be defined as the incidence of any one of the following (according to NCI CTC version 4.0) from the commencement of the first cycle of therapy until 28 days following the last dose of GA101:
A grade 3+ non-haematological adverse event 
A grade 4 haematological adverse event 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate and compare the proportion of patients achieving minimal residual disease-negative complete remission (MRD negative) at final staging, two months after completion of protocol treatment in each treatment arm (G- FC3 versus G- Clb).</outcome>
      <timepoint>at final staging, two months after completion of protocol treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate and compare the two treatment arms in terms of the following additional measures of efficacy: 
-	Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the achievement of complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) at final staging, two months after completion of protocol treatment
-	Best overall response rate defined as the achievement of CR or PR during treatment or within 6 months of completion of protocol treatment
-	Event-free survival (EFS) 
-	Progression-free survival (PFS) 
-	Time to next therapy (TTNT)
-	Overall survival (OS).
The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method will be used to estimate EFS, PFS, OS and TTNT curves for each treatment arm. Annual survival probabilities and associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each treatment arm. For each endpoint, the difference between treatment arms will be estimated with a hazard ratio (HR) and associated 95% confidence interval, calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression. 
Cox proportional hazards regression models will also be used to investigate associations between patient pre-treatment characteristics and time-to-event endpoints. Patient characteristics that will be considered include: gender, age at time of randomisation, pre-treatment comorbidity assessments (including CIRS score), pre-treatment Beta-2 microglobulin, LDH, white-cell and platelet counts and CD38 expression as well as 17p deletion, 13q deletion, trisomy 12 and 11q deletion cytogenetic abnormalities and molecular genetics variables including NOTCH-1, SF3B1 and BRIC-3.
Efficacy will be assessed by the investigator according to the National Cancer Institute/International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (NCI/IWCLL) guidelines (Hallek et al. 2008; see Table 6 page 48) at the time points shown in the Schedule of Assessments. 

Patients will be followed by clinical/laboratory signs and symptoms until progression is identified.  A scan by computed tomography (CT) will be performed in patients who have achieved a complete or partial response two to three months after end of treatment.  In those patients who have achieved a CR (or cytopenic CR), bone marrow aspirates for biopsy and flow cytometry will be obtained.  If progressive disease is detected by physical examination in the absence of any objective haematological progression, a CT scan of the involved nodes will be performed.
 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) over the course of treatment and follow-up in patients in both treatment arms using overall health-related QOL scores obtained from the EuroQol EQ-5D and EORTC QLQ-C30 as well as the five individual EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient reported outcomes will be assessed during Screening, interim staging (after 3 cycles before the beginning of cycle 4), initial response assessment (1 month (+/-7 days) after beginning of cycle 6), final staging (2 months (+28 days) after Initial Response Assessment), 3 monthly during the first year of follow up and annually thereafter.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The ALLG CLL07 study plans to recruit 120 eligible patients, 60 in each treatment arm, from 15  20 ALLG centres. Assuming the incidence of treatment-related grade 3+ non-haematological and grade 4 haematological adverse events is expected to be approximately 70% in both treatment arms, a sample size of 120 patients will lead to an exact 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence interval of 61%  78% (a width of 17%) which is deemed sufficiently precise to draw valid conclusions for the primary event rate of interest. It will also be possible to estimate the incidence of treatment-related grade 3+ non-haematological and grade 4 haematological adverse events in each treatment arm separately with an exact 95% confidence interval (95% confidence interval) width of approximately 24%. 
This sample size of 60 patients per arm will also allow an improvement in the proportion of patients achieving MRD negative complete remission from 5% in the G-Clb arm to 25% in the G-FC3 arm to be detected with 85% power, assuming a two-sided significance level of 5%. These estimates are considered plausible based on published literature and a difference from 5% to 25% is considered to be a clinically meaningful improvement in the MRD negative complete remission rate.

    <summary>The study is evaluating the efficacy and safety for dose reduced fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and intravenous obinutuzumab (G-FC3) versus oral chlorambucil and intravenous obinutuzumab (G-Clb) in previously untreated, comorbid, elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 65 years and older, have documented CD20+ B-cell CLL according to NCI/IWCLL criteria, previously untreated CLL requiring treatment according to NCI/IWCLL criteria, CIRS score &gt;= 6, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2 at screening, able to comply with study protocol procedures and a minimum of 14 months of follow-up, and a life expectancy of at least 6 months. Trial details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive obinutuzumab (GA101) combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (G-FC3). GA101 will be administered intravenously, 100 mg day 1 cycle 1, 900 mg day 2 cycle 1, 1000 mg day 8 and 15 cycle 1, 1000 mg day 1 cycles 2-6. Fludarabine will be administered orally, 24mg/m2 day 1-3 cycles 1-6. Cyclophosphamide will be administered orally, 150mg/m2 days 1-3 cycle 1-6. Participants in the second study group will receive GA101 with chlorambucil (G-Clb). GA101 will be administered intravenously, 100 mg day 1 cycle 1, 900 mg day 2 cycle 1, 1000 mg day 8 and 15 cycle 1, 1000 mg day 1 cycles 2-6. Chlorambucil will be administered orally, 150mg/m2 days 1-3 cycle 1-6. A treatment cycle is 28 days in length. A maximum of 6 cycles of therapy will be administered to each patient.</summary>
