  <interventions>
    <interventions>At each of the four study visits, participants will have baseline lung function and complex lung mechanics (forced oscillation technique [FOT] and multiple breath nitrogen washout [MBNW]) measured. They will then be administered a single dose of either indacaterol 150 microg, glycopyrronium 50 microg, glycopyrronium/indacaterol 50/110 microg combination, or salmeterol 50 microg, via oral inhalation route. The lung function and complex lung mechanics will then be repeated at pre-specified time intervals up to 2 hours post-administration. Each study visit will be separated by a period of at least 48 hours to ensure washout of the previous medication.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each participant acts as their own control. The post-bronchodilator lung function measurements are compared to the pre-bronchodilator values at each visit.</comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>* Power calculations are based on pharmacodynamic data of indacaterol published by Bauwens et al. This data showed an 12% increase in the mean peak FVC (a better correlate of small airway function than FEV1) following a single 150 microgram dose of indacaterol administered via Breezhaler. Using a unimean power calculation (at a power of 80% and a significance of 0.05), the number of subjects required to detect this increase is 25.
* The change in mean FOT and MBNW parameters between pre- and post-bronchodilator testing will be analysed by paired t-test
* The relationship between change in FOT/MBNW parameters following glycopyrronium/indacaterol combination administration, indacaterol and glycopyrronium mono-administration will be assessed by 2-way repeated measures ANOVA
* The relationship between the time course of FOT parameter changes for indacaterol and salmeterol will be assessed by a mixed-effects model, as well as mean area under the curve by paired t-test</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This projects aims to study the effects of different inhaled bronchodilator medications used in the management of COPD. Clinical trials have demonstrated their effects on the large airways of the lungs, however their effects on the small airways are not yet known. This project will use sensitive tests of small airway function to identify the effects of bronchodilator therapy on the small airways in COPD. Specifically, we aim to determine if two different classes of bronchodilators have a greater effect when given in combination than when given alone. We hope to use this information to enhance our knowledge of how these medications work, which may help us improve the treatment of patients with COPD.</summary>
