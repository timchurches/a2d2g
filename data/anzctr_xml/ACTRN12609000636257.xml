    <interventions>6-8 page interactive booklet with information about eating related distress and mechanisms for readers (patients or family carers) to become more self aware about how they contribute to this psychosocial distress, and suggestions for how to address this distress. The way the participants read the booklet will not be monitored; however, post-intervention questions include one assessing for how long the participant read the intervention booklet. The experimental group participants will be given the intervention booklet at Time 1, and then after they have had it 1-3 weeks, they will be given the Time 2 questionnaires.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care for eating related distress is the nurse listening to the emotional pain manifest in eating related distress, then based on the nurse's empathic listening skills, using communication techniques such as open questions, restatements, or reflecting emotions. The nurse may make suggestions about how to minimize the distress, but these are likely to target dietary or nutritional aspects, not emotional aspects of eating. It is also possible the nurse may refer the patient or family carer to written resources about support terminally ill patients nutritionally. Thus, standard care is "soft" and varies with skill of the nurse, and includes information about nutrition, not emotional distress related to poor nutrition.</comparator>

    <sequence>A listing of all patients receiving hospice care from Mary Potter Hospice (MPH) at the time when the study is ready to commense Phase 2 data collection will be printed out in the order of when they entered the hospice's service (those being on service the longest being at the top of the listing). Then the patient (along with their respective family carer) will be allocated to the experimental or control group based on the randomization plan generated by Randomization.com using randonly permuted blocks. If additional participants are needed (ie, if at the time of Phase 2 data collection starting, the listing of patients does not produce the required 176 participants), patients subsequently entering MPH service will be randomized using the same method. That is, each successive patient entering MPH service will be allocated using the same randomization plan.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will generate evidence for an intervention (Phase 1) which addresses the psychosocial distress related to not eating amongst those at the end of life, and test the efficacy of this intervention (Phase 2), as well as examine relationships between ERD and other factors. It is hypothesized that the intervention will significantly reduce eating related distress and dyadic distress.</summary>
