  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study drugs were dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), atovaquone-proguanil (AP) and Chloroquine (CQ). One group was treated with DP over 3 days , another group was treated with AP over 3 days for P.f cases. In a separate group of patients with P. vivax malaria, CQ alone was used for treatment.

DP (oral tablet) with a dose of 4mg/kg for D and 20mg/kg for P  daily for 3 days

AP (oral tablet) with a dose of A at 15mg/kg and P at 6mg/kg daily for 3 days

CQ (oral tablets) at 10mg/kg on Day 1, 10mg/kg on Day 2and 5 mg/kg on Day3.</interventions>
    <comparator>No control and comparator group. This was a single group trial. In falciparum infected patients, DP was tested in Pailin.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and atovaquone-proguanil (AP) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 2 sites Pailin and Pursat, and chloroquine (CQ) for Plasmodium vivax in Pailin, Cambodia. The WHO 28-day and 42-day in vivo protocol was used. Patients with uncomplicated P.f or P.v malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated on site with DP or AP and monitored weekly for 28 days for P.v cases and 42 days for P.f cases. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients were classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period were used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis were used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection. The results of this study are being used to assist the Ministry of Health of Cambodia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. f and P.v malaria.</summary>
