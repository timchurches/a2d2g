  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of overweight and obese individuals has significantly increased in Australia over the past 20-30 years. Associated with high body mass is the  increased the risks of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers, sleep apnoea, osteoarthritis, psychological disorders and social problems.Overall, the aim of this study is to examine the gene changes during weight loss and identify the potential gene targets of a high-protein diet that may be important for preservation of muscle mass. Different protein preparations could then be tested looking specifically at these gene changes. Those protein preparations identified as important for preservation of muscle mass will be reported as a beneficial inclusion in high-protein weight loss and may aid in the maintenance of long-term weight reduction.</summary>
