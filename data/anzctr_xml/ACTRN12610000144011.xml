  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to one of 4 groups.  These 4 groups will be receiving different exposures: Group 1: CPAP and vardenafil; Group 2: sham CPAP and vardenafil; Group 3: CPAP and placebo; Group 4: sham CPAP and placebo.

CPAP will be delivered via a nasal mask at a pressure which has been titrated for each patients requirement to maintain an open airway, and will be in the range between 4-20cmH2O.

Sham CPAP will be delivered via nasal mask in the same manner as CPAP.  The pressure delivered is subtheraputic, typically below 1cmH2O.

Subjects are asked to use the CPAP or sham-CPAP every sleep period during the 12 week study period.  Typically, this exposure is 4-8hours per night.

Vardenafil and placebo are administered every evening, one hour before bed, via an oral capsule, for each of the nights in the 12 week study period.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo given is produced by the manufacturer of the active drug, Bayer Schering, and is identical to the active tablet in every way except that the active ingredient is not added.

Sham CPAP has the same physical appearance and method of use as a 'real' CPAP system - a modification of the Respironics REMstar PRO II.  This has internal modifications which limit the amount of airflow delivered to the patient. The patient interface (mask) has a modification to the mask elbow which allows for great-than-normal amounts of air to escape the system, eliminating accumulation of carbon dioxide in the mask dead space.</comparator>
