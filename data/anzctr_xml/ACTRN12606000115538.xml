    <interventions>The aim of this study is to test the capacity of a synbiotic (Hi-maize resistant starch + Bifidobacteria) administered in the diet to humans for improving the biomarkers associated with bowel health and reducing the potential risk of colorectal cancer.
We will enlist 20 people in a random cross over design with an initial wash out period  of 4 weeks (with no consumption of 'over the counter' products of Resistant Starch or Bifidobacteria) followed by three treatment phases, using the following variables:  
Synbiotic  resistant starch (RS) + Bifidobacteria. 4 wks
Probiotic only  Bifidobacteria. 4 wks
Prebiotic only - resistant starch. 4 wks</interventions>
    <comparator>No control arms, only 4 intervention arms</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will explore the potential of synbiotic combination of probiotic bacteria and resistant starch (RS) to improve health and reduce the risk of colon cancer. Participants will be asked to include in their diet either resistant starch or a probiotic or a combination of the two.
Markers of the health value of these dietary agents will then be examined in samples of faeces, blood and samples taken from the lining of the bowel wall. 
Since the greatest risk of CRC is due to lifestyle (in particular diet) rather than genetic predisposition (family/hereditary bias), defining the disease mechanism and finding ways to prevent its occurrence are of significant importance.  
The proposed study will help provide valuable information on how resistant starch can be used to improve colon health, provide data on the prebiotic use of resistant starch and detailed information on a synbiotic formulation that is already on the market.
The study participants (subjects) and the data analyst will be blinded.
The probiotic  bacteria will be in the form of boxes of capsules labelled - B
The resistant starch will be in powder form in sachets labelled - A
The combination will be A + B
The resistant starch placebo will be labelled - C
The placebo probiotic will be  labelled - D
Example: Pt 1 will be allocated with First 4 weeks A+B, then A and then final 4 weeks B
Their boxes and sachets will be labelled A+B, A+D &amp; B+C respectively.</summary>
