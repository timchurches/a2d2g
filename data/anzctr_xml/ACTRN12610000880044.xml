    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and he/she or a parent/guardian (in case of children) consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.
As it is a nonrandomised trial the first treatment regime ( coartem) will be given up to the required sample number(80 patients) followed by administering dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine phosphate regime to another group of (80 patients).</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for P.vivax in  Myit Kyi Nar Township, Kachin State.
Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in in  Myit Kyi Nar Township, Kachin State in Myanmar to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for the treatment of  Plasmodium vivax.  

Objective: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, and chloroquine for Plasmodium vivax in Myit Kyi Nar Township, Kachin State.

Methods: The participants will be febrile people above 6 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum or P. vivax infection. Patients will be treated with artemether-lumefantrine twice a day over 3 days or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine over 3 days, or chloroquine daily for 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. 

The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Myanmar in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum and vivax malaria.</summary>
