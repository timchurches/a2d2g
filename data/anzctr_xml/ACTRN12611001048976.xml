  <interventions>
    <interventions>'Music therapy' intraoperatively was given via head phones in the intervention group for surgeries lasting atleast 1 hour or more duration.
In the group  in which Music therapy was given,  patients opted music of their choice from 3 categories  spiritual, filmy orinstrumental all of which were in patients preferred language . patients were asked for their favourite category of music from above three broad category and their preferrence accordingly noted in their pre-anaesthetic record sheet.A portable music player(philips-Mp3 player) attached with larger ear head phones was placed in the intervention group and audio volume controll switch was placed in patients hands so that they could adjust volume of Music according to their wish.Music player was however covered in non transparent covering for blinding purposes.
This intervention was administered in addition to standard treatment i.e use of sedative drug  named midazolum whenever felt necessary.</interventions>

    <summary>THE EFFICACY OF MUSIC  IN LOWERING INTRA-OPERATIVE SEDATION REQUIREMENT AND RECALL OF INTRA OPERATIVE PROCESSES                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                            
Background: It has been known for a long time that music has characteristic psychological and physiological effects in humans. It is a non-pharmacological technique that is inexpensive, non invasive and has no major side effects. Surgery with music is being increasingly reported at many of the todays modern hospitals documenting Musics powerful soothing, calming, sedating effects on subjects  including a significant reduction in the amount of anesthesia needed.                                                                                                                                                    
Aims and Objectives: To find out whether  patients undergoing elective surgery under regional anesthesia, who hear a pre-selected music during surgery through a head-phone, need a lower dose of intra-operative sedatives and have a reduced recall of intra-operative processes  Methods:  60 Patients undergoing Elective Orthopedic,Gynaecological or Urological Surgeries under Regional anaesthesia between June to August 2009 were Randomized into either listening to Music(group M,n=30),or not listening to music(group C,n=30).Midazolum was given for sedation  in either of the groups to achieve a Observers Assessment Of sedation/alertness Score(OAS) of 3 or less.We noted the total dose of Midazolum required  and OAS scores  in both the groups.Post operative recall of Intraoperative processes by patient was assessed on answers to a  6 point Questionnaire and VAS score for pain ,discomfort and dissatisfaction with the sedative method employed was sought.  
                                                                                      Results:The Mean dose Of Midazolum to achieve Sedation was significantly lower (p&lt;0.01) in the patients that listened to Music during their surgery.Desirable OAS score (&lt;3) were significantly better in the Music group at 90 ant 120 min from start of the surgery .There was no Significant differences in the VAS scores for Pain ,Discomfort  or Dissatisfcation with the Sedative Method Employed in either groups(P&gt;0.01).Intra operative Instances of Conversations between the doctors/nurses and other OR staff and Sounds Of Monitors,Instruments,etc were more significantly recalled by those who did not listened to music during their surgery(P&lt;0.01). 
Conclusion: Our study concludes that patients undergoing elective surgery under regional anesthesia , who hear a pre-selected music during surgery through a head-phone, need a lower dose of intra-operative sedatives and have a reduced recall of intra-operative processes  thus creating an effective,safe and cheap  non pharmacological method of sedating conscious patients operated under regional anaesthesia.We recommend that Music of their choice  via headsets  be provided to all the patients who are fond of  music listening during the Surgical procedures averaging  one and half hour duration or more .</summary>
