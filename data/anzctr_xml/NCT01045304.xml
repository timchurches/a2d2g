    <summary>Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of iniparib (SAR240550) administered as a
           60min intravenous (IV) infusion twice weekly or weekly, in combination with
           gemcitabine/carboplatin chemotherapy regimen in patients with metastatic Triple Negative
           Breast Cancer (mTNBC).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the rate of complete response (CR),
           partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting at least 24 weeks;

        -  To assess Progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS);

        -  To assess the safety profile of each schedule of iniparib;

        -  To assess the biological activity in tumor tissue (substudy);

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of iniparib (substudy);

        -  To characterize molecular and biological profile of tumors (substudy);

        -  To assess the effect of iniparib on poly(ADP)-ribose (PAR) level in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMC) (substudy).</summary>
