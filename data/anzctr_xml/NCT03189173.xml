  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Oral appliance
Treatment: drugs - Oxygen
Other interventions - Oral appliance plus oxygen
Other interventions - No treatment

Experimental: All patients - Patients will receive all four interventions in randomized order.
Note: Data will not be analyzed separately for the 16 cross-over combinations of intervention order:
Interventions: Oral appliance | Oral appliance plus oxygen | Oxygen | No treatment


Treatment: devices: Oral appliance
An oral appliance (dental mouthpiece) will be used to improve upper airway patency. Patients who do not have their own custom dental oral appliance (various brands, commonly Herbst) will be provided with a device (BluePro, BlueSom) for the duration of the study.
Patients will also be administered sham (room air) at 4 L/min via nasal cannula.

Treatment: drugs: Oxygen
Supplemental oxygen will be delivered at 4 L/min via nasal cannula to improve ventilatory control stability.

Other interventions: Oral appliance plus oxygen
Both treatments will be administered simultaneously.

Other interventions: No treatment
Subjects will not wear an oral appliance, and will be administered sham (room air) at 4 L/min via nasal cannula.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study combines two treatments for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), oral appliances
      and supplemental inspired oxygen. The following aims will be tested:

      Aim 1. To determine whether supplemental inspired oxygen further reduces OSA severity
      (apnea-hypopnea index) in patients using an oral appliance.

      Aim 2. To determine whether baseline OSA phenotypes can predict the efficacy of oral
      appliances versus supplemental oxygen versus both treatments in combination. We will test
      whether responders to oral appliances have distinct pathophysiological characteristics
      compared with oxygen responders.</summary>
