  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Telaprevir
Treatment: drugs - Ribavirin
Treatment: drugs - Pegylated-Interferon-alfa-2a

Experimental: Telaprevir plus Pegylated-Interferon-alfa-2a /ribavirin (RBV) - All patients who will receive 12 weeks of treatment with telaprevir 750 mg q8h except for patients on efavirenz will receive 1125 mg every 8 hours (q8h) in combination with Pegylated-Interferon-alfa-2a (Peg-IFN-alfa-2a) 180 µg/week and RBV 800 mg/day. At Week 12, telaprevir dosing will end and the patients will continue on Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and RBV.


Treatment: drugs: Telaprevir
Type=exact number, unit=mg, number=750 or 1125, form=tablet, route=oral. the patients will receive 2 oral tablets every 8 hours for 12 weeks except for patients on efavirenz who will receive 1125mg (3 oral tablets) every 8 hours for 12 weeks.

Treatment: drugs: Ribavirin
Type=exact number, unit=mg, number=400, form=tablet, route=oral. The patients will receive 2 oral ribavirin tablets twice daily for 24 or 48 weeks, based on the response guided therapy.

Treatment: drugs: Pegylated-Interferon-alfa-2a
Type=exact number, unit=microgram, number=180, form=injection, route=subcutaneous The patients will receive Peg-IFN-alfa-2a 180 microgram once a week for 24 or 48 weeks; based on the response guided therapy.
