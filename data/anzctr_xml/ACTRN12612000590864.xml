    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Preschool patients with wheeze will be identified at triage, by the asigned nurse or medical staff caring for the patient in the emergency department of our tertiary children's hospital.
A PRAM score will be taken prior to the administration of any salbutamol.
Patients will receive standard treatment with salbutamol for wheeze. This is 3 dose of 6 puffs via spacer every 20 minutes. If the PRAM score reduces by 2 points or more then patients will be invited to take part in the study.
If they agree then the treating nurse will select a sequential envelope from a closed box. The card inside has the study number written on it corresponding to a number on the medication bottle. 
The study numbers have been randomised to treatment or placebo. 
The study cards have been radomised to the envelopes. 
The allocation of the study number and the cards to the envelopes are both random.
The nurse then calculates a dose in mls to be administered to the patient this is written on the bottle.
The bottles are identical.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation of study numbers to treatement or placebo was done using the random number generation feature in excel.

The allocation of study number cards to sequential envelopes was done using the random number generation feature in excel.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Wheeze in preschool children is the most common cause of admission to hospital in the age group. In older children and adults, oral corticosteroids are proven to be an effective treatment for wheeze (asthma). However a similar treatment effect has not been demonstrated in the preschool population and effective treatment for preschool wheeze has proved to be difficult to find. 
There have only been a handful of studies on the clinical effects of corticosteroids (usually prednisolone) in preschool children with wheeze. These have typically been small studies, had some study design problems and have produced conflicting results  some suggesting they work, some suggesting they dont. So currently no-one knows whether to continue to give preschool children with wheeze steroids.  Administrationof steroids  preschool wheeze use is included in clinical guidelines in New Zealand and internationally. However current practice varies greatly and often depends on personal presence.
None of the previous trials have measured salbutamol response or used this to guide treatment, although this is currently used by clinicians to help guide treatment. Salbutamol response is an indicator of airway responsiveness and we hypothesise that a positive response is likely to increase the chance of steroids being effective. We aim to determine the clinical effect of oral corticosteroids in salbutamol responsive preschool wheeze</summary>
