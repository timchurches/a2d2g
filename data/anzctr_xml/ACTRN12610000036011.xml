    <studytitle>Reducing Acute Coronary Syndrome Time in the Emergency Department for Patients with Non-Traumatic Chest Pain</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients presenting to an Emergency department with non-traumatic chest pain, does the introduction of a new multimatker strategy compared with the current standard practice of an 8 hour troponin, safely reduce the length of time spent in the emergency department?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the introduction of an accelerated multimarker based chest pain protocol, performing serum Myoglobin, Creatine kinase -MB and Troponin-I on arrival and either 2 hours later or at least 4 hours after the onset of the patients maximal pain, whichever is later</interventions>
    <comparator>We will compare retrospectively with patients managed using the standard 8 hour troponin recommended by current Australian national guidelines prior to the introduction of the protocol from November 2009 till December 2009</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) - a composite end point of any of the following:  Myocardial infarction, Cardiac death, cardiac arrest, major cardiac revascularization, cardiogenic shock, new ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment, 2nd or 3rd degree heart block requiring intervention.
These  events will be assessed by telephone followup of both the patient and the patient's General Practitioner (GP) as well as collection of data such as Electrocardiograms, cardiological investigations from their medical notes as well as a search through Western Australian Death registry for any patients lost to follow up, at the end of the trial.
Outcomes will be adjudicated by a consultant cardiologist and a consultant emergency physician not involved in data collection.  Any disagreements will be resolved by another consultant cardiologist.</outcome>

      <outcome>Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) - a composite end point of any of the following:  Myocardial infarction, Cardiac death, cardiac arrest, major cardiac revascularization, cardiogenic shock, new ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment, 2nd or 3rd degree heart block requiring intervention OR new onset of heart failure requiring treatment as adjudicated by the 2 consultants on our adjudciation panel.</outcome>

All patients presenting with non-traumatic chest pain will be managed with our new multimarker stategy. Our study is different in that it is using the latest generation of laboratory based super-sensitive troponin assays.  Patients will be identified at triage and photocopies of their notes will be placed in the study form collection box by the doctor on completion.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for presentation to Australian emergency departments.  Despite this little is known about the safety of our current practice, which often involves patients spending many hours in an Emergency department awaiting repeated blood tests and electrocardiograms.  Recent introduction of a latest generation super-sensistive troponin to our laboratory combined with an interest in an accelerated 'multimarker stratgey' already in widespread use throughout the UK and the USA (that back in 2006 was ranked as having the same level of evidence as our current practice by the American college of Emergency Physicians) and a desire to increase efficiency we have redesigned the way our department manages patients presenting with non-traumatic chest pain that allows us to confidently discharge patients as soon as 4 hours after the onset of their symptoms.
This trial is intended to compare the efficacy and safety of this new process, when compared to the old process.</summary>
