  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of early double J stent placement in treatment of renal tuberculosis. So we conducted the RCT and compared the therapeutic outcomes of the 2 groups. A group were 20 cases of early double J tube placement combined anti-tuberculous drug treatment and B group were 10 cases of anti-tuberculous drug treatment alone. We also want to get the optimal timing of surgery, so group A was divided into 2 arms, each with 10cases , patients in A1 arm double J stent were placed after starting anti-tuberculous drug treatment 2 weeks while in A2 arm were placed after starting anti-tuberculous drug treatment 6 weeks.</summary>
