  <interventions>
    <interventions>A brief computerised intervention aimed at improving childrens working memory called Robomemo, manufactured by Cogmed.

The program trains working memory skills using an interactive and motivating, game-format, computerised training program. It runs for 35 minutes a day for 20 sessions over 5-7 weeks. All training is conducted at school in small groups of 4 to 8 students under supervision. Eight tasks are completed every day. The children train on the same tasks for the first 5 days. A new task replaces one of the existing tasks on day 6 and every 5th day after this. Within each task, the adaptive nature of the program matches difficulty to the childs current working memory skill on a day-by-day basis, with all tasks increasing in complexity according to the childs current skill.

The intervention children will also receive information regarding classroom strategies (as will the control group- see below).</interventions>
    <comparator>Students randomised to the control group will receive information regarding strategies to prevent working memory overload in the classroom. This is the current standard care for children with working memory difficulties.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome: academic outcomes using the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT 4). This valid and reliable tool yields standard (mean 100, standard deviation (SD) 15) reading composite (word reading and sentence comprehension subtests) and maths computation scores. The WRAT will determine if early working memory benefits translate into subsequent learning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 24 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Working memory using the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA).  Standardised for ages 4-22 years, the AWMA is a computer-based, valid and reliable working memory assessment tool that yields composite and subtest scores (mean 100, SD 15). We will administer the following subtests: digit recall, listening recall, dot matrix, spatial span and backward digit recall (assessing verbal, visuo-spatial and central executive components of working memory). This will show whether short-term working memory gains are made and sustained over time.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All state primary schools in a single metropolitan Melbourne school district will be eligible following approval from the Reasearch in School department of the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD).  We will first approach each school’s principal for their agreement to take part; if a school declines (10-25% of schools in our previous studies), we will go to the next randomly-selected school on the back-up list, until we reach the required sample size of 2900 children for initial screening for eligibility.

Children’s allocation will be revealed to the research team via a web-based randomisation management system, which ensures allocation concealment until eligibility and consent have been confirmed. The randomisation schedule will be produced independently by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Learning difficulties are common and can cause school failure and poor self-esteem. They are associated with specific problems with temporarily remembering and using information (working memory). Research suggests that improving working memory might improve academic achievement. We will study this intervention in a large group of primary school children who have poor working memory. If successful, the intervention will provide a way to improve the learning skills of these high-risk children.</summary>
