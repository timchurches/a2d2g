  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be screened for small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) using a glucose breath test. Before consuming a 75g of glucose in 200ml of water the participants will provide a breath sample. They will then provide breath samples every 15 minutes for 2 hours. If they have a rise of &gt;=12 ppm of either hydrogen or methane from baseline this will be diagnosed as SIBO.

Participants will be seen for one 2 hour session with no follow for those without SIBO. Those with SIBO will be part of the associated randomised control trial.</interventions>

      <outcome>Comparing the colonic microbiome of IBS patients with and without small intestine bacteria overgrowth and healthy controls. Stool samples will be stored at -80C until the DNA is extracted. DNA will be extracted using the powersoil kit. The V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene will be amplified. DNA will be sequenced on the Ilumina platform. Data will be analysed using compositional data (CoDa) approaches (Gloor 2016) on R statistical programme. Specifically the ALDEx2 package will be used. Data will be presented as bi-plots, bar charts, dendograms and heat maps as appropriate.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>For the clinical trial we calculated that 66 participants were required. For the power calculation it was decided that a difference of 100 points on the IBS Symptom Severity Scoring System (IBS SS) would be a strong measure of clinical significance. This was based on the original paper describing the development of the IBS SS by Francis (1997). In this paper the mean for those with mild IBS was 133 (s.d 25), moderate was 243 (s.d 33) and severe 372 (s.d 66). Current did not attend rates for a dietetic service are approximately 20% and this figure was used as a proxy for likely drop outs. An alpha (p value) of 0.05 was selected with 80% power. It was calculated based on these numbers that 33 participants would be needed in each group. Approximately 1 in 4-5 people with IBS have SIBO when using the glucose breath test as a substrate for the test. Therefore to get 66 participants for the intervention we are likely to need to screen about 300.

For continuous variables in the symptom severity scoring system and the quality of life questionnaire students' ttests will be used to compare those with and without small intestine bacteria overgrowth. For categorical variables on the symptom severity scoring system chi squared tests will be used.

Student ttests will be used to compare nutrient intake between the two groups (from the diet history questionnaire.)

The microbiome and metabolomics data will be analysed using compositional data (CoDa) analysis methods (Gloor Ann Epidemiol. 2016;26(5):322-9.). This analysis will be done on the R statistics platform. Data will be presented in compositional biplots, bar charts of abundance, phylogenetic trees and heatmaps as appropriate</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The data for this observational study comparing the clinical characteristics and features of the microbiome is being collected at the screening phase of ACTRN12616001149459

In 371306 participants with diarrhoea predominant IBS and mixed type IBS are being screened for small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). 75g of glucose in 200ml of water is being provided as the test substrate. Prior to adminisitration of the glucose solution and every 15 minutes after consuming the test substrate for 2 hours participants are providing a breath sample. The breath sample is being analysed for hydrogen and methane. For participants with a rise of =&gt; than 12 ppm in either gas from baseline are defined as haing SIBO.

In this observational study we are aiming to see whether there is a diference in clinical characteristics and microbiome features between those with and without SIBO. 

Our hypothesis is that the clinical characteristics of those with and without SIBO will differ. Secondly we hypothesise that there will be differences in the products produced by the bacteria (detected in the urinary metabolome).

Prior to attending the screening survey participants will complete 8 surveys on line and they will provide a stool and a urine sample. The questionnaires they will complete are a demographic questionnaire, a simple health questionnaire, the IBS symptom severity scoring system (Francis 1997), and IBS quality of life questionnaire (Drossman 1998). the physical activity adult questionnaire (Garriguet 2015), the hospital anxiety and depression index (Zigmond 1983) and a foods avoided questionnaire and the diet history questionnaire version 2 (http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/dhq2/).

Faecal and urine samples will be stored at -80C until they are analysed. Faecal samples will be analysed for the bacteria present (in the colon) and urine samples will be analysed to see what the bacteria have been doing.
