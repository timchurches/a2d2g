    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and a parent/guardian consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>
    <sequence>This is a one arm prospective study in which all eligible patients are given test drug.</sequence>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, in sentinel sites of of the three islands (Ngazidja), Mwali et Ndzouani) of Comoros. Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Comoros to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrinefor the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The study will be conducted in Ngazidja (Moroni et Foumbouni), Mwali (Wanani et Nioumachoua) et Ndzouani (Pomoni et Domoni) islands. The participants will be febrile people between 6 and 59 months, inclusive, except in Mwali between 6 months and 12 years, inclusive. Patients will be treated with artemether-lumefantrine twice a day over 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Comoros in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum.</summary>
