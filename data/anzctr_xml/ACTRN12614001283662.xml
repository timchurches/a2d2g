  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the six week intervention period, the intervention group will replace their breakfast and lunch each day with either 2 Arnott's Lunch Slices or up to 6 Vita-Weat crispbreads based on personal preference, with a choice of prescribed toppings consisting of a protein, vegetable and condiment component. An Accredited Practising Dietitian will administer the intervention during a one on one, face to face consultation of approximately 30 minutes duration. 

To aid with dietary compliance, participants will be required to complete and return a 3 day diet diary (2 working days and 1 weekend day) at the first (Baseline) and final (Week 6) visits. Participants will receive enough product for the duration of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>During the six week intervention period, participants in the Control group will be given advice on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. The study dietitian will provide a guide as to the types of foods that can be bought and consumed. An Accredited Practising Dietitian will administer the intervention during a one on one, face to face consultation of approximately 30 minutes duration. 

To aid with dietary compliance, participants will be required to complete and return a 3 day diet diary (2 working days and 1 weekend day) at the first (Baseline) and final (Week 6) visits . Participants will receive a grocery voucher to buy food for their diet ($20 per week). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the efficacy of Vita-Weat food supplementation on weight loss in an overweight and obese group.

Weight loss will be assessed by comparing pre and post intervention weights obtained using calibrated scales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the difference in subjective appetite between the two diet groups.

Subjective appetite will be assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale scores. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks after randomisation.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the food acceptability of the two diet groups.

Food acceptability will be assessed using a Food Acceptability Questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine changes in body composition by waist circumference, fat mass and fat free mass between groups.

Waist circumference measurement is obtained by placing a tape measure at the midline of highest point of the iliac crest and lowest part of the costal margin in the mid-axillary line in expiration.

Fat mass and fat free mass will be assessed using a DEXA scan.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine changes in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors between groups.

This is a composite secondary outcome.

Changes in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors will be assessed using pathological parameters including fasting plasma glucose, insulin, glycated haemoglobin, and full lipid profile. Anthropometric measures such as waist circumference and blood pressure will also contribute to the assessment of this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming a mean reduction in percentage weight loss from baseline of 5% and 2% in the intervention and control treatments respectively (to Week 6), with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.5% and an estimated drop-out rate of 5%, a total of 76 participants would be required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference between the two groups (at a 2-sided significance level of 5%).
Based on these calculations, 76 participants (38 in each group) will be recruited and randomised to one of two treatment groups.
Data will be analysed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For analysis of differences between treatments, an independent sample t test, or the non-parametric equivalent Mann-Whitney U test, will be used. For within group changes, repeated measures ANOVA will be used. As well as an analysis of completers (those that attend the final visit), an intention to treat (ITT) analysis will also be included. For the ITT analysis, dropouts will be treated using a variety of sensitivity analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An area of research that receives a lot of attention currently relates to the physiological mechanisms that are involved in maintaining the feeling of fullness after people have eaten (referred to as satiety). Previous studies have shown that the most satisfying foods were found to be high in carbohydrate or protein, and most were also high in water and fibre. 

Considering the high carbohydrate (&gt; 60 grams per 100 grams) and high protein (&gt;10 grams per 100 grams) content of Campbell Arnotts Vita-Weat range, these products may produce greater satiety and hence help produce weight loss for those needing to lose weight.

The current randomised controlled trial is designed to investigate the beneficial effect of this food product in an overweight and obese population group.</summary>
