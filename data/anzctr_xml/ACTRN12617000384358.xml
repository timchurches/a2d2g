  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be studied on two consecutive days, in which they will receive either standard feed (1 kcal/ml) or energy dense feed (2 kcal/ml), in a randomised, double blind fashion. On each day, enteral feeding will be ceased four hours prior to the commencement of the study. Blood glucose levels will be managed according to the Royal Adelaide Hospital Intensive Care Unit protocol i.e. &lt;10 mmol/l. However, due to patients not receiving feeds following the test meal, exogenous insulin infusions will be ceased prior to the commencement of the test meal. Computer randomisation will be performed by a nuclear medicine technician, who will measure out the study feed and add the radioactive marker. This nuclear medicine technician will not be involved in the conduct of the study or interpretation of the results and will instill the study feed to ensure allocation concealment is maintained.

At t = -5, an intragastric meal will be infused over 5 minutes. The meal will contain 200 ml of Standard feed (Nutrison 1kcal/ml, Nutricia Australia, containing carbohydrate 49%, fat 35%, and protein 16%, osmolality 305 mOsm/kg H2O) or 100 ml of Energy dense feed (TwoCal 2kcal/ml, Abbott Nutrition, containing carbohydrate 43%, fat 40%, and protein 17%, osmolality 690 mOsm/kg H2O). The order in which standard or energy dense feeds are given will depend on randomisation. 

The meal will also contain 3 g of 3-O-Methyl-D-gluco-pyranose (3-OMG) (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 5 ml H2O and 20MBq 99mTc-calcium phytate colloid. Radioisotopic data will be acquired in dynamic mode every minute for the first 60 minutes and every 3 minutes thereafter for a total of 240 minutes using a gamma camera (DigiRad 2020tc, Gammasonics) with the patient lying in the semi-recumbent position. An arterial blood sample will be obtained every 15 minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes thereafter for measurement of blood glucose concentration, plasma GLP-1, CCK, PYY and Glucagon, and serum Insulin, C-peptide and 3-OMG. Enteral nutrition will be commenced immediately on study completion (4 hours following meal administration). </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will act as their own control group, and we expect there will be no difference between the two arms. The standard feed (1 kcal/ml) will be considered as the standard treatment.</comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint is gastric emptying response to energy dense feeds. This will be measured via scintigraphy, which remains the most accurate method to quantify gastric emptying in the critically ill. Scintigraphic data will be captured with the patient using a mobile gamma camera with 1-3 minute dynamic frame acquisition. A region of interest will be drawn around the total stomach, with gastric emptying curves generated over time and the intragastric retention at 15 minute intervals calculated. In addition, from these data, the kcal emptied into the duodenum can also be calculated. Data will analysed by the same individual blinded to the study conditions. Total areas under the curve from baseline to 240 minutes (AUC240) will be calculated for gastric emptying, calorie delivery and blood glucose using the trapezoidal rule. Data on gastric emptying from a previous scintigraphic study in the critically ill estimated the within subject variability of gastric retention to be 42%. Based on this, n=20 patients will achieve 80% power at 5% significance to determine non-inferiority of gastric retention with a non-inferiority margin of 24 percentage points. Non-inferiority will be indicated if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference in gastric retention is greater than the non-inferiority margin. That is, gastric retention at T=120 minutes for the 2 kcal/ml feed will be no more than 24 percentage points less than for the 1 kcal/ml feed. The non-inferiority margin is based on both expert opinion and previous research.. Secondary outcomes will be analysed via paired t-tests. Approval to recruit up to twenty-five patients is requested to allow for drop-outs.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Enteral feeding is standard of care in critically ill patients, however delivery is often  inadequate with observational studies reporting patients only receive 60% of estimated energy needs. A primary reason for inadequate nutrient delivery is delayed gastric emptying, which occurs in up to 50% of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients.

While standard enteral formulas contain 1 kcal/ml, it is common practice for an energy-dense formula (2kcal/ml) to be prescribed by clinicians to enable higher caloric delivery in a smaller volume, as a way of circumventing the effects of delayed gastric emptying. However, at present there is no evidence to support the concept that use of an energy-dense formula will enable greater calorie delivery and nutrient absorption. It has been demonstrated, in health, that gastric emptying occurs at a constant rate based on caloric delivery approximating 1-4 kcal/min and rather than volume dependent. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of calorie concentration on the rate of gastric emptying in critically ill patients.</summary>
