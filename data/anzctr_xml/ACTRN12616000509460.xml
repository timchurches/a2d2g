This sample size will provide 90% power to demonstrate similarity of the primary PK endpoint (AUCinf) based on assumptions between-subject variability (as measured by coefficient variation) of 40% for ABP 959, EU-authorized eculizumab, and FDA-licensed eculizumab, true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between ABP 959 and each eculizumab product, bioequivalence margins of (0.80, 1.25), a 5% dropout rate, and two 1-sided tests at a = 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will compare the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (the levels of drug in the blood) of 3 drugs when given intravenously (into a vein). The drugs tested are:
*a new drug called ABP 959,
*a marketed drug called Eculizumab (Soliris registered trademark) approved in United States (US)
*a marketed drug called Eculizumab (Soliris registered trademar) approved in European Union (EU)

The study is to test that these drugs behave the same in the body, for example, produce the same drug levels in the blood.

who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a healthy male  18 to 45 years of age, inclusive. Non-Japanese subjects will have a BMI of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening and check-in. Japanese subjects must have a BMI of 18.0 to 25.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at screening and check-in.


Trail Details
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated into one of three groups to receive either:
- ABP 959 300 mg intravenously once only.
- US approved Eculizumab 300 mg intravenously once only.
- EU approved Eculizumab 300 mg intravenously once only.

All participants will be followed-up at 50 days post allocation to one of the
three drugs used in this trial.</summary>
