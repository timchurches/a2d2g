  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention being studied is cold water immersion. Subjects will be immersed up to and including their shoulders in cold water for 14 minutes at 15 degrees celsius, as soon as practicable after returning from combat operations.  Each subject will undergo the CWI intervention twice and the passive recovery intervention twice in a crossover fashion.  The minimum period between interventions will be 4 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention is passive recovery, which will involve the subjects sitting quietly for 14 minutes as soon as practicable after returning from combat operations.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain measured on a numerical rating scale (0-10). Subjects will be asked to rate the worst pain that they currently have.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be measured on four occasions per intervention:
Baseline (within 24hrs prior to the operational mission)
After the mission before intervention
The morning after intervention
The second morning after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Power measured by vertical leap, utilising a VERTEC vertical leap assessment tower.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be measured on four occasions per intervention:
Baseline (within 24hrs prior to the operational mission)
After the mission before intervention
The morning after intervention
The second morning after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical fatigue measured on a numerical rating scale (0-10). Subjects will be asked to rate their current level of overall physical fatigue.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcomes will be measured on four occasions per intervention:
Baseline (within 24hrs prior to the operational mission)
After the mission before intervention
The morning after intervention
The second morning after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Flexibility measured via a sit and reach test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Flexibility will be measured on four occasions per intervention:
Baseline (within 24hrs prior to the operational mission)
After the mission before intervention

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers will be recruited from the deployed task group. 
Subjects will be allocated a subject number in the order that they sign up to the trial.

An intervention group allocation schedule will be created by an offsite investigator using computer generated random numbers. This schedule will be concealed from the on-site investigators until after the subjects have been allocated their subject numbers.  The schedule will then be provided to one on-site assistant who will advise the subjects of their intervention group. This assistant will not be involved in the collection of outcome measures. 
The subjects will be advised not to disclose which intervention they were involved in with the investigator taking outcome measures on each occasion.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of using cold water immersion (commonly referred to as ice baths and widely used by professional athletes)  for recovery in the military operational environment.

This project aims to assess whether cold water immersion can reduce pain and fatigue and preserve power and flexibility when compared to passive recovery following combat operations.</summary>
