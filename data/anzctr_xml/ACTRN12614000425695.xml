    <interventions>The READY (Resilience for Everyday) intervention was developed by Drs Pakenham and Burton at The University of Queensland (Burton et al., 2010; 2009). The program utilses an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy modality (ACT). ACT (Hayes et al., 2011) is a third wave cognitive behavioural therapy based on mindfulness and acceptance processes (Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda &amp; Lillis, 2006). ACT uses six interrelated core therapeutic processes: (1) acceptance - the active and aware embrace of internal experiences without changing their frequency or form, (2) cognitive defusion  observing thoughts rather than taking them literally, (3) contact with the present moment - ongoing non-judgmental and responsive awareness of present moment, (4) self-as context - awareness of ones own flow of experiences without attachment to them, (5) values  freely chosen verbally constructed and personally meaningful life directions, (6) committed action  values-guided effective action. Further, application of these processes to the practitioners own psychology is critical to keeping his or her therapeutic instrument in tune (Luoma, Hayes &amp; Walser, 2007). Early evidence suggests that ACT is more effective than control conditions, and that ACT constructs are correlated with better mental and physical health outcomes in a variety of populations including people with chronic medical conditions (for reviews see Hayes, &amp; Masuda et al., 2004; Hayes et al., 2006; Powers, Zum Vorde Sive Vording &amp; Emmelkamp, 2009; Ruiz, 2010).The READY (Resilience for Everyday) program aims to improve an individuals resilience protective factors identified from empirical literature (i.e. positive emotions, cognitive flexibility, social support, life meaning, and active coping) (Southwick et al, 2005). The strengthening of these protective factors builds resilience towards stress and adversity and improves QoL (Burton et al., 2010). 

The READY program in total is 5 sessions and includes one session per week, over a 5 week period. The first session is a 2 hour group session, and the 4 subsequent sessions are over the phone. Telephone consultations last 1 hour each.

The READY program is delivered by psychologists or provisionally registered psychologists who are currently completing postgraduate training and who receive supervision from an accredited supervisor.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resilience. The 15-item Resilience Scale (RS-15; Neill &amp; Dias, 2001) was used to assess psychological resilience. Each positively-phrased item is scored on a 7-point likert scale (1 = disagree; to 7 = agree) and asks participants to assess their beliefs about their ability to manage stress (e.g. I have self-discipline). Item scores are summed, with higher scores indicating higher global resilience. The RS-15 is a refined version of the original 25 item measure by Wagnild and Young (1993), with demonstrated improved reliability (Neill, 2011). Windle et al. (2011) note the RS-15 had the widest application of reviewed measures of resilience. The measure possesses a Cronbachs alpha of .91 (Neill &amp; Dias, 2001).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life.  WHOQOL-BREF. The 26-item The World Health Organisation Quality of Life Questionnaire  Brief Form (WHOQOL-BREF; WHO, 1998) was used to assess quality of life. It provides a measure of global quality of life and  four dimensions of quality of life (WHO, 1996): physical QoL (e.g. How satisfied are you with your sleep?; 1 = Very dissatisfied to 5 = Very satisfied); psychological QoL (e.g. To what extent do you feel your life to be meaningful?; 5 = Not at all to 1 = An extreme amount); social relations QoL, (How satisfied are you with your personal relationships?; 1 = Very dissatisfied to 5 = Very satisfied); and environmental QoL (How healthy is your physical environment?; 1 = Not at all to 5 = Extremely). Some items are reverse scored (To what extent do you feel that physical pain prevents you from doing what you need to do?; 5 = Not at all to 1 = An extreme amount). To develop scale sores, relevant items are reverse scored, domain items are summed, and the mean of this total score provides the domain score. Higher scores indicate higher quality of life. The WHOQOL BREF possesses similar psychometric properties to the full measure, demonstrating good discriminant validity, content validity, and test-retest reliability (WHO; 2004). The measure is a reliable and established measure of how disease impacts an individuals subjective wellbeing (WHO; 1997). Cronbachs alpha values for each of the six domain scores ranged from .71 (domain 4) to .86 (domain 5) (WHO, 1998). An interesting addition to the current studys assessment of QoL was analysis of self-rated QoL and health satisfaction. The WHOQOL-BREF Manual (WHO, 1997) recommends individual examination of Question 1 (How would you rate your quality of life?) and Question 2 (How satisfied are you with your health?).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mood (DASS21). The Short Version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995) was used to assess mood. The DASS-21 uses 21 self report items to assess the presence of negative affective states over the past two weeks. There are three subscales: depression (e.g. I couldnt seem to experience any positive feelings at all); anxiety (e.g. I felt I was using a lot of nervous energy); stress (e.g. I felt that I was rather touchy). In the present study, instructions were modified to query the presence of symptoms over the past week. This was done to reduce overlap with the intervention (i.e. assessing two weeks, rather than one, would have gained data on participants emotional states prior to the intervention being completed). Items are scored on a 4-point likert scale (0 = not at all to 3 = most of the time). Items are summed for each subscale, and then multiplied by two to give scores comparable to the full version, and higher scores indicate greater intensity of symptoms (DASS-42; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). The measure possesses excellent psychometric properties, with good convergent validity, and excellent internal consistency, temporal stability, and discriminant and convergent validity in both clinical and community samples (Brown et al., 1997; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995). Alpha coefficients for the depression, anxiety, and stress subscales were .91, .84, and .90 respectively (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQII; (Bond et al., 2011) assessed psychological flexibility and experiential avoidance. The AAQII asks participants to respond to ten 7-point likert-scaled items (1 = never true to 7 = always true) that examine willingness to accept uncomfortable feelings and thoughts (e.g. Im afraid of my feelings). Items are summed, and higher scores indicate greater acceptance, less experiential avoidance, and higher values-based, committed action. The measure demonstrates adequate structure, reliability, and validity (Bond et al., 2011), acceptable criterion validity, factorial validity (Hayes et al., 2006), and discriminant validity (Bond et al., 2011), and satisfactory reliability with group comparisons, with good incremental and construct validity (Fledderus et al., 2012). Alpha coefficients range from .80 - .87 (Bond et al., 2011).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health Behaviours (HBS-CHD). The Health Behaviour Scale-Congenital Heart Disease (HBS-CHD) measure includes 25 questions on 22 components of health risk behaviour, which evaluates the domains of; alcohol use, tobacco use, illicit drug use, dental hygeine, and physical activity levels. Items include, "do you consume alcohol from time to time? (by alcohol is meant: beer, wine, liquor, coolers)." The measure has been found to have good content validity, and capacity to detect clinical changes in health behaviour over time (Goossens, Luyckx, Mommen, Gewillig, Budts, Zupancic, &amp; Moons, 2013).

    <statisticalmethods>To date there have been no evaluation of psychological interventions with adult CHD patients (Kovacs, 2006). This is surprising given adult patients with CHD have indicated that they would like assistance with the following areas: stress management, coping, managing mood and anxiety, anger management, relationship difficulties and assistance with substance abuse (Kovacs et al., 2009). The aim of the proposed study is therefore to formally pilot an evaluation of the effectiveness of a psychological resilience training intervention called READY for adult patients with CHD.
