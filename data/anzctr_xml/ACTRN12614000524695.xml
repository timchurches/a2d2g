  <interventions>
    <interventions>Kinesiotape, a form of elastic therapeutic tape, was developed by Dr. Kenso Kase in the 1970s and is a relatively new elastic therapeutic tape used for treating a variety of injuries in clinical practice. The principle behind kinesiotape is the theory that it supports injured muscles and joints and helps to relieve pain by lifting the skin and allowing improved blood and lymph flow. Despite its popularity and widespread clinical use, there is relatively little high quality evidence available to support the effectiveness of kinesiotape for injuries, let alone specific upper limb overuse injuries, such as lateral elbow tendinosis. It is anticipated that the results of this research study will enhance evidence for the use of kinesiotape at a broader level. 

Participants in this study will be invited to undergo eight 30 minute hand therapy sessions for a period of 12 weeks. This will involve 4 weekly sessions followed by 4 fortnightly sessions. A free follow up will also be completed at 6 months which should take 30 minutes. These sessions will be administered on an individual basis by a hand therapist. 

All participants in the three groups will receive the same standard treatment for tennis elbow, which includes heat, massage, education of activity modification techniques and prescription of a progressive exercise program. With regards to the treatment and placebo/sham tape group, participants will be shown how to apply the tape on the first visit and will be provided with a roll of tape for use at home. The tape can last between 4-7 days and the participant will be educated on monitoring for signs of irritation. If so, the tape should be removed immediately. The kinesiotape is applied with along the forearm and crosses over the lateral epicondyle. Two additional small strips of tape will then be applied over the lateral epicondyle in a 'star' pattern. The tension and application procedure will follow the Kinesiotape application manual. For the placebo/sham tape group, the tape will be applied in exactly the same; however, with no tension. It is anticipated that participants will use this tape for a minimum of 4 weeks full time; however, this time frame may be shorter if side effects are noted.       </interventions>
    <comparator>There will be one comparator group and one control group. The first of these groups will still receive the standard treatment for tennis elbow (including heat, massage, activity modification advice and progressive exercises) in conjunction with the use of the elastic therapeutic tape; however, the tape will be applied with no stretch (the recommended application is to use the tape with tension). 

The second of these groups will receive the current treatment for lateral elbow tendinosis which includes massage, compression, activity modification advice and a graduated exercise and strengthening program.

Both the comparator and control groups will undergo the same treatment frequency as the intervention group which involves 4 weekly sessions (30 minutes each) followed by 4 fortnightly sessions (30 minutes each). This will be over a 3 month period. There will also be a free 6 month follow up session for these participants. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1. People who are self-referred or referred by their general practitioner or medical specialist for treatment for lateral epicondylitis will be invited to participate in the research study. As most patients book appointments over the phone, the receptionist at Toowoomba Hand Therapy (who is not directly involved in the research) will ask potential participants if they are interested in receiving the information sheet about the research study. If they are willing to consider participation in the study, the receptionist can then send the information sheet in the mail prior to their appointment. 
2. After they have read the information sheet and if they are willing to participate, they will be given a consent form by the receptionist (at the time of their appointment) to be signed. This consent form contains specific details and expectations about the research project. 
3. Once consent is gained, the researcher will then formally approach the participant and verbally explain the research project further and answer any questions the participant may have. 
4. Participants will be free to withdraw at any time.   
5. Allocation concealment wil be done by computer randomisation. This will be held within a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised into the three groups using simple randomisation through statistical software. The researcher will not be blinded as to which groups participants will be allocated to.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>For the purpose of this randomised controlled trial, it is planned to gain the largest sample size possible. This trial is part of a PhD degree through Monash; therefore, it is anticipated to gain as many participants over a one year period. 

It is planned for statistical analysis to be completed using SPSS to examine correlations between the use of elastic therapeutic tape with reductions in pain, improved function and increased grip strength when compared to taping without tension or no tape. As this is part of a PhD degree through Monash University, the researcher of this study will be able to access the support of a biostatistician through Monash to assist with the statistical analysis of these results.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The need for this research study is evident as work-related upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders have become increasingly common conditions being treated by hand therapists in recent years. It is for this reason that there is a continual need to enhance treatment methods that are in line with current evidence-based interventions used with clients. With this increase in work-related overuse injuries, there is a strong demand for both effective treatments and improved self-management strategies for these longstanding, debilitating injuries. Kinesiotape, a form of elastic therapeutic tape, was developed by Dr. Kenso Kase in the 1970s and is a relatively new elastic therapeutic tape used for treating a variety of injuries in clinical practice. The principle behind kinesiotape is the theory that it supports injured muscles and joints and helps to relieve pain by lifting the skin and allowing improved blood and lymph flow. Despite its popularity and widespread clinical use, there is relatively little high quality evidence available to support the effectiveness of kinesiotape for injuries, let alone specific upper limb overuse injuries. Amongst rehabilitation practitioners, there is a strong need for further research into the claims of kinesiotapes effectiveness, especially due to its recent widespread use. More rigorous higher level evidence is required so practitioners can be informed about using this treatment modality with their patients.

It is anticipated that the results of this research study will enhance evidence for the use of kinesiotape in treating upper limb overuse injuries at a broader level and, more specifically, lead to the development of a clinical pathway at Toowoomba Hand Therapy for the management of lateral epicondylitis with the use of kinesiotape. 

Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of elastic therapeutic tape in treating lateral epicondylitis in adults when compared to sham tape or exercise, massage and activity modification advice.
Aim 2: To assess the effectiveness of the use of elastic therapeutic tape in early return to work compared to sham tape or exercise, massage and activity modification advice.
Aim 3: To investigate peoples experience with using elastic therapeutic tape, adherence with treatment and the impact on their recovery, function and return to pre-injury roles.

It is hypothesised that the use of elastic therapeutic tape will play a role in the short term reduction of pain for people with lateral elbow tendinosis.
