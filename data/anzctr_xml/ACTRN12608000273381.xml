  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the Australian Cancer Trials Online website. This will be a website that provides up to date information about the cancer clinical trials currently recruiting patients in Australia. It will contain two decision support tools (a question prompt list and decision aid) and consumer support information which will help consumers make a decision whether to participate in a clinical trial and increase their knowledge and understanding of cancer clinical trials. Medical oncologists and patients in the intervention arm will have access to the website. The consultation between each of the participating medical oncologists and their patients will be audio-taped. Each patient will have their consultation audio-taped once. The duration of the intervention is for 6 months.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients invited to participate in the study must be: 1) Patients starting treatment for the first time. For example: new patients, patients not initially suitable for chemotherapy but are currently suitable due to symptomatic disease or improved performance status. 2) Patients in whom a treatment change is anticipated. For example: in the adjuvant setting a patient with early breast cancer finishing adjuvant chemotherapy and about to start adjuvant endocrine therapy and in the metastatic setting patients with progressive disease needing to change chemotherapy or all lines of chemotherapy utilised. 3) Patients with email and internet access. 4) Patients due to see their medical oncologist in 2 weeks time over a period of 4 to 8 weeks (longer may be necessary).</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Concealed allocation. Medical oncology sites will be randomly assigned to intervention or control using a central computer and allocation sequence to conceal allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified allocation. A random sample of 40 sites was obtained using a stratification procedure (NSW:Vic 1:1; rural:metro 1:2 and weighting given to larger sites). From these sites 1 medical oncologist at each site was sampled (40 medical oncologists in total). 30 medical oncology sites were randomised as above.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The trial is a cluster randomized trial in which doctors (medical oncologists) are the unit of randomization. 15 medical oncologists will be in the intervention (website) group and 15 medical oncologists will be in the control (no website access) group. Each of the 30 medical oncologists will invite 20 of their patients to participate in the trial ie 600 patients in total (300 in each arm of the study).</designfeatures>
