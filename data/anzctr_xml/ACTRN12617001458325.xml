  <interventions>
    <interventions>AeroFact is an investigational drug/device combination product consisting of a naturally-derived surfactant (Aerosolized Alveofact®) of bovine origin administered via inhalation at a dosage of 108 mg/kg, with up to 4 doses administered over the first 72 hours of life.

The AeroFact drug delivery system is designed to accurately and precisely administer aerosolized surfactant to the lungs of preterm infants who require supplemental oxygen and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) support via mechanical ventilation. The AeroFact drug delivery system consists of three commercially-available products, (1) Aerogen Solo/NIVO Nebulizer, (2) Aerogen Pro-X Controller, and (3) Sensirion Gas Flow Meter/Cable, which are connected to an investigational Aerogen Pharma Controller and investigational nCPAP prong interface.

In Part I of the study, infants will receive a single aerosol dose of the study medication. Following initial aerosol dose to the lung, infants will continue on nCPAP.
In Part II of the study, infants will receive an initial aerosol dose of the study medication. They will continue on nCPAP following the initial dose. Re-dosing of the study medication will occur if the Respiratory Severity Score to maintain oxygen saturation between 90 and 95% reaches 1.5 and at least six hours has elapsed since the previous dose. Up to three additional doses of study medication within 72 hours will be allowed.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes from baseline in oxygenation indices. This will be determined by measuring FiO2, oxygen saturation, and respiratory severity score.
FiO2 will be measured by the concentration of oxygen that is inhaled by the patient.
Oxygen saturation will be measured by pulse oximetry.
Respiratory Severity Score will be measured by multiplying the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and FiO2.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Oxygenation and respiratory parameters will be obtained prior to dosing, during dosing, and up to 72 hours post-dosing.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes from baseline in vital signs. This will be determined by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate, comparing prior to dosing to 24 hours post dosing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing, during dosing, and up to 24 hours post-dosing. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Monitoring of adverse events during treatment and post treatment.  Known adverse events of surfactant include oxygen desaturation, bradycardia, and apnea.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be monitored throughout the treatment period up until the time of discharge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The change in fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) as determined by the levels and duration of oxygen.
FiO2 will be measured by recording the concentration of oxygen that is inhaled by the patient, over time.
</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in the requirements of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) as determined by pressure levels and duration of nCPAP.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored prior to dosing, during dosing, and up to 72 hours post-dosing</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes to the need for surfactant rescue therapy as determined by number of instillations of surfactant administered compared to control group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored prior to dosing, during dosing, and up to 72 hours post-dosing</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes to the need for invasive respiratory support as determined by duration of mechanical ventilation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Need for invasive respiratory support; Timepoint  monitored prior to dosing, during dosing, and up to 72 hours post-dosing</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes to the need for endotracheal intubation as determined by the number of intubations, compared to control group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Need for endotracheal intubation; Timepoint - monitored prior to dosing, during dosing, and up to 72 hours post-dosing</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in bronchopulmonary dysplasia outcomes as determined by survival without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age.</outcome>
