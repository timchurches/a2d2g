             vaccine

             vaccine within six months preceding the study vaccination

             medical history and/or physical examination

          6. Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the administration of the
             study vaccine. An immunosuppressant dose of glucocorticoid will be defined as a
             systemic dose =10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topical, inhaled,
             and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

          7. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the administration of the study vaccine or during the study

          8. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever, or an oral temperature &gt;38.0°C on the planned
             day of vaccine administration)

          9. Presence of chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except
             hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic or metabolic (including
             diabetes mellitus) disorders, which would include the potential subject in a
             "high-risk" category for influenza and/or its complications

         10. Known disturbance of coagulation

         11. Women who are breastfeeding or plan to become pregnant during the study

         12. Suspicion or recent history (within one year of planned vaccination) of alcohol or
             other substance abuse

         13. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would pose a health risk to the
             subject if enrolled or could interfere with evaluation of the vaccine or
             interpretation of study results (including neurologic or psychiatric conditions deemed
             likely to impair the quality of safety reporting)</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the immune response of three dose levels of the
      Novavax Quadrivalent vaccine in healthy young adults (18-64). The study is broken down into 5
      treatment groups. Each group will enroll 100 subjects, for a total of 500 subjects. Group 1-3
      will receive one of three dose levels of the Novavax Quadrivalent vaccine, Group 4 will
      receive a dose of the Novavax Trivalent vaccine, and Group 5 will receive a commercially
      available trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). The study will also evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the Novavax Quadrivalent vaccine.</summary>
