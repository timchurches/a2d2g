          -  Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol
             abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  Positive test result at screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or
             anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab).

             genotype.

          -  History of severe, life-threatening or other significant sensitivity to any excipients
             of the study drug.</exclusivecriteria>
