  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sydney Intrusion Spring, Miniscrew skeletal anchorage, Bonded Hyrax rapid maxillary expander will be placed at the start of the intervention. These appliances are all well established and commonly used in clinical orthodontic practice. The SIS will provide a continous intrusive force to the maxillary posterior teeth from the start to the end of the intervention. Measurements for amount and rate of intrusion will be taken at 6 weekly intervals. Anticipated duration of the intervention is 6-9 months, depending on the severity of the initial open bite.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Skeletal anterior open bite malocclusion is one of the most difficult malocclusions to treat orthodontically. Traditional treatment was aimed at correcting the malocclusion through a combination of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery, once growth was completed. Although good results were achieved, the treatment was complicated and severe invasive. With the advent of skeletal anchorage and miniscrews it has now become possible to treat Skeletal anterior open bite malocclusions non-surgically through intrusion of the maxillary posterior teeth, resulting in the closure of the anterior open bite. However, the appliances currently used for the intrusion are crude adaptions of existing auxillaries, not meant for this purpose. The have significant short comings including tissue irritaion, trauma and the need for frequent reactivation. The Sydney Intrusion Spring (SIS) is an appliance that has been specifically designed for the intrusion of maxillary posterior teeth. The aim of the study is to analyse the efficacy of this appliance on the intrusion of maxillary posterior teeth.</summary>
