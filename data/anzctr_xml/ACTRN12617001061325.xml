    <interventions>Safety Run-In Phase
the first 3 patients enrolled will start on the first dosing level.  Participants will receive 1mg/kg of AGEN1884 via intravenous infusion every 6 weeks in combination with Pembrolizumab 200mg via intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 24 months, or until disease progression or discontinuation due to side effects.
If there are too many side effects at the first dose level by day 21, the study will proceed with the second dosing level (Dose Level 2) and another 3 participants will receive 0.3mg/kg of AGEN1884 via intravenous infusion every 6 weeks and Pembrolizumab 200mg via intravenous infusion every 3 weeks for up to 24 months, or until disease progression or discontinuation due to side effects.
Efficacy Phase
Once the first phase (Safety Run-in Phase) of the study is complete and the dose level of AGEN1884 is selected, the study will proceed to the second phase of the study (Efficacy Phase) using the selected dose level in combination with pembrolizumab for up to 24 months, or until disease progression or discontinuation due to side effects.  
If Dose Level 2 is found have too many side effects by day 21, further enrolment will be paused in order for Agenus and the study doctors to review the data and decide if the study should continue.  
Safety Follow Up
After discontinuing treatment, participants will be followed up for up to a further 12 months. 
At each visit the following assessments will be performed; 
Physical Examination: to assess general health. 
Vital signs: including body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure. 
Performance Status: Assess the impact the cancer has on  daily living activities. 
Routine blood samples: Up to 7 mL/ 1-2 teaspoons of blood to assess the health of patients liver, kidneys and blood cells.
Tumour Imaging: Tumour imaging by computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at weeks  6, 12 and then every 9 weeks.
Research Blood samples: Up to 45 mL/ 9 teaspoons of blood.

The maximum total study duration is approximately 37 months for each participant.

1.	Voluntarily agree to participate by giving written informed consent. The participation in the pharmacogenomics testing is optional. 
2.	Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.
3.	Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, is stage IV, does not have an EGFR sensitizing (activating) mutation or ALK translocation, and has not received prior systemic chemotherapy treatment for their metastatic NSCLC.
4.	Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 as determined by the site.
5.	Have a life expectancy of at least 3 months and a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status
6.	Have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory values:
a.	Adequate hematological function defined by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to  1.5 x 109/L, platelet count greater than or equal to   100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin greater than or equal to   9 g/dL (without transfusions within 2 weeks of first dose). 
b.	Adequate hepatic function based by a total bilirubin level less than or equal to the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level less than or equal to 1.5 x IULN, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level less than or equal to  1.5 x IULN, and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to  2.5 ULN.  
c.	Adequate renal function defined as Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x IULN OR calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min for subjects with creatinine levels greater than 1.5 x IULN (If no local guideline is available, creatinine clearance should be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault Method).
d.	Adequate coagulation defined by international normalized ratio (INR) or prothrombin time less than or equal to 1.5 x IULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy); and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) less than or equal to 1.5 x IULN (unless the subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy)
e.	Adequate endocrine function defined by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits. Note: if TSH is not within normal limits at baseline, the subject may still be eligible if T3 and free T4 are within normal limits.
7.	Subject has no history of prior malignancy, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, superficial bladder cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ cervical cancer, or has undergone potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 5 years since initiation of that therapy.
8.	Have provided a formalin fixed tumor tissue sample from a biopsy of a tumor lesion either at the time of or after the diagnosis of metastatic disease has been made AND from a site not previously irradiated to assess for PD-L1 status. 
	                Biopsies obtained PRIOR to the administration of any systemic therapy for the treatment of a subjects tumor (such as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy) will not be permitted for analysis. 
                       The tissue sample must be analyzed by the pathologist (site pathologist or Central Lab), using an FDA approved test. 
                       Fine needle aspirates, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or cell blocks are not acceptable. 
                       Needle or excisional biopsies, or resected tissue is required 
9.	The subjects tumor does not harbor an EGFR sensitizing (activating) mutation or ALK translocation. 
                       EGFR sensitizing mutations are those mutations that are amenable to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors including erlotinib, gefitinib, or afatanib. Investigators must be able to produce the source documentation of the EGFR mutation and ALK translocation status in all subjects with non-squamous histologies AND for subjects in whom testing is clinically recommended. 
                       If either an EGFR sensitizing mutation or ALK translocation is detected, additional information regarding the mutation status of the other molecule is not required. If unable to test for these molecular changes, formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue of any age should be submitted to a central laboratory designated by the sponsor for such testing. 
                        For subjects enrolled who are known to have a tumor of predominantly squamous histology, molecular testing for EGFR and ALK translocation will not be required as this is not standard of care and is not part of current diagnostic guidelines.
10.	The subjects tumor must have high PD-L1 expression (TPS greater than or equal to 50%) as determined by an FDA-approved test. 
11.	Female subjects must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study medication) if of childbearing potential or be of non-child bearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than medical reasons):
                Greater than or equal to 45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year,
                Amenorrheic for less than  2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and an follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) value in the postmenopausal range upon pretrial (screening) evaluation,
               Whose status is post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation.
12.	If of childbearing potential, female subjects must be willing to use two adequate barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. 
Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject.
13.	Male subjects with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential must agree to use two adequate barrier methods throughout the trial starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab is received.  Males with pregnant partners must agree to use a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.
Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject.
14.	Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and general activity of AGEN1884 in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have a confirmed diagnosis of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for which you have not received prior systemic chemotherapy treatment. 

Study details
Up to 26 participants will be enrolled over 2 possible dosing levels of AGEN1884 (1 mg/Kg or 0.3 mg/kg) in combination with standard pembrolizumab treatment over two study phases. The first phase of this study (Safety Run-in Phase) will evaluate which dose level to use for the second phase (Efficacy Phase). Pembrolizumab is already approved in Australia and will be administered every 3 weeks by intravenous infusion.  . AGEN1884 is not yet approved, and will be administered every 6 weeks by intravenous infusion. Treatment will continue for up to 24 months, or until disease progression or discontinuation due to side effects.

All participants will be monitored regularly for adverse events and treatment response. This will involve physical examination, imaging, and collection of blood samples. 

Advances in  understanding of immuno-oncology have shown that a tumours ability to evade the immune system can determine how well one controls and eradicates tumours.There is some evidence that the proposed regimen for this research study is more effective and may have a better safety profile than other combination regimens. Information from this study may help develop new treatments for NSCLC in the future. </summary>
