Allocation is concealed as the allocation involves contacting the holder of the allocation schedule (the Stroke Educator) at a central administration site. The Stroke Educator then utilises a centralised randomisation process using a remote, telephone based, computer generated procedure.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Each year 53,000 Australians have a stroke and 88% return home to the community. Stroke survivors struggle to recover quality of life at home.Self management programs are a new initiative designed to help people living with a chronic condition manage their day to day lives more effectively, improve quality of life and live a more healthy lifestyle. In 2004/06, the National Stroke Foundation developed and piloted a stroke self management program. The Phase 1 trial demonstrated positive outcomes for the participants. The aim of this Phase 2 trial is to test the proposed research protocol and outcome measures, whilst validating the effect size calculation in preparation for a Phase 3 larger RCT.
Participants will be recruited from six hospitals in Adelaide with a letter from the HEad of the Stroke Unit, through advertising in local Adelaide newspapers,  through Stroke SA, general practice or word of mouth. Stroke survivors returning home or already living in the community,3/12 after their stroke will be invited to participate. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three groups: The first group, "Standard Care" will receive their usual care when they are discharged from hospital. They may be managed by their GP, referred to community services, given information about life after stroke, or join a stroke support group. The second group will receive usual care and undertake the Chronic Condition Self Management Program. This generic, six week education
program runs with a range of disease groups including stroke. The third group will
receive usual care and undertake the Stroke Self Management Program. This eight week education program is designed to help "get life back on track" after stroke.
All participants will be assessed prior to admission to the program, at 6-8 weeks
and at 6 months. The assessor will be unaware of the group allocation. The primary outcome measure is improvements in positive and active engagement in life as
measured by the hei-Q. The hei-Q is designed to measures changes in self
management programs. Improvements in quality of life, mood and cost benefits
are secondary outcomes. This is the first time in the world that the impact of
cognition, language and physical disability on a person's ability to self manage will
be explored. An accurate record of adverse events shall be maintained. Participants will be informed of their right to withdraw at any time without prejudice</summary>
