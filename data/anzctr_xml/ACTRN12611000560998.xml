  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will recruit 128 participants with a family history of colorectal cancer. The trial will be a randomized double blind, parallel design intervention after a 3-week washout period on a controlled diet. The controlled diet to be used was developed by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Human Nutrition and this will be matched against known ingredients high in phenolic compounds. Blood and rectal biopsy samples will be collected for mucosal biomarkers measures. Randomized interventions will follow for 6 weeks with 100mL of dealcoholised red wine containing 50 mg resveratrol or a placebo consumed daily with the evening meal. Blood and biopsies will then be done again. The use of de-alcoholised wine will remove any risk of alcohol toxicity or cancer induction risk.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether Resveratrol (contained in red wine) may prevent colorectal cancer in people with a family history of the disease.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and are a carrier of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).

Trial details
Participants in this trial will eat a controlled diet developed by the CSIRO for a period of 3 weeks. They will then be randomly (by chance) divided into two groups. One group will consume 100ml of dealcoholised red wine containing 50 mg resveratrol daily with their evening meal for a period of 6 weeks. Participants in the other group will consume a placebo (sham) drink containing no resveratrol. Participants will not know which group they are in. 

Blood and rectal biopsy samples will be taken from participants at the beginning and end of this study to assess any changes in markers associated with colorectal cancer.</summary>
