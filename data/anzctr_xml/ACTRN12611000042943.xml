  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following a brief screening visit, eligible, healthy, adult volunteers will be enrolled (4 male &amp; 4 female) into the study.
Visit 1 (Friday)- baseline blood and urine samples will be taken and each participant will then be administered 100mg oral DHEA. They will also be provided with 100mg DHEA to take daily for the next 2 days.
Visit 2 (Monday)- prior to taking any study medication a blood and urine sample will be taken from each participant.
MEN will then be administered 100mg oral DHEA and 200mg oral Pregnenolone; and given 2 more days supply of each drug to take on the next 2 days (Tues &amp; Wed).
WOMEN will  be administered 100mg oral DHEA and 2.5mg oral Letrozole and will be provided with 2 more days supply of each drug to take on the next 2 days (Tues &amp; Wed).
Visit 3 (Thursday) blood and urine samples will be taken from all participants.  
Information will be collected regarding any adverse events, concomitant medications commenced during the study and blood will be taken for routine biochemistry and haematology as a safety measure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will act as their own controls. 
The aim of the study is to identify the serum and urine changes in the androgen profiles of volunteers after administration of DHEA with and without Pregnenolone ( in men) and with and without Letrozole (in women).
Blood and urine samples will be taken at baseline prior to any study medication, samples will be taken for comparison after 3 days of DHEA alone and again after 3 days of DHEA with pregnenolone (in men) or letrozole (in women).</comparator>

    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum steroid profile will be assayed using the LC-tandem MS method in order to determine if the dosage and duration of treatment show significant effects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A single blood sample will be collected from each participant prior to drug administration at day 1 (baseline) day 3 and day 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Urine steroid profile will be measured after conjugation and deconjugation by GC-MS method in order to determine if the dosage and duration of treatment show significant effects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A single urine sample will be collected from each participant prior to drug administration at day 1 (baseline) day 3 and day 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant safety will be monitored by 
1. screening to ensure good health prior to study enrolment and 
2. routine biochemistry and haematology review at end of study. 
Participants will be questioned at each visit about all adverse events occuring during the study period , and these will be recorded for medical review.
Side effects of DHEAreported in men includehair loss, weight gain, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, acne, rapid/irregular heartbeat. DHEA in women has been reported to cause greasy skin, acne, hirsutism, mood changes and menstrual disturbance. However the short duration of treament (6 Dyas0 is unlikely to cause any serious side effects.
Pregnenolone may increase the risk of seizures in men with epilepsy; who are therefore excluded from this study.
Letrozole is given at the same dose as used in adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer.  prolonged use can result in flushing, arthralgia, gastrointestinal disturbances, headache and dizzyness, fqtigue and weight gain.  Again the short duration of treament is unlikely to result in any prolonged or permanent side effects.</outcome>

    <concealment>Those interested in taking part in response to local advertising will be asked a series of questions initially to establish their eligibility to participate.
A screening visit will be arranged, where the participant will sign an informed consent, a brief medical history recorded and bloods taken for biochemistry and haematology.
If sucessfully screened the participant will commence the open label study as soon as possible. Treatment is neither blinded nor randomly allocated.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endogenous DHEA is banned for use in elite competitive sports, however its covert use in combination with other non banned steroid precursors (eg pregnenolone, letrozole) to increase testosterone levels is suspected. 
This pilot study aims to identify the serum and urine changes in the androgen profile of healthy men (n=4) following the administration of DHEA with and without pregnenolone and in healthy women (n=4) following the administration of DHEA with and without letrozole. 
We aim to  test the hypotheses that these drug combinations will result in increased androgenic effects in both men and women; thus requiring improved detection methods to detect this DHEA augmentation doping in both serum and urine.</summary>
