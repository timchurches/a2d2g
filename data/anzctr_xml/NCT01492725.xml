  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute ischaemic stroke, who are eligible
      for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours of stroke onset will be assessed for
      "dual target" major vessel occlusion and mismatch to determine their eligibility for
      randomisation into the trial. If the patient gives informed consent they will be randomised
      50:50 using central computerised allocation to intra-arterial clot retrieval after IV tPA or
      IV tPA alone. The trial is prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE)
      design.</summary>
