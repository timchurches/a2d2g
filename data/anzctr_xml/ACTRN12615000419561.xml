    <interventions>     Burns and associated wound care procedures are painful and distressing for children. In addition to being painful, burn injuries can also result in severe psychological distress. Previous research has indicated that a reciprocal relationship may exist between symptoms of psychological distress and burn pain. Thus, treatment options that alleviate distress in both symptom areas must be offered to patients in order to optimize care. However, this proves difficult in clinical practice because many patients indicate that dressing changes and mechanical debridement (i.e. cleaning/removal of dead tissue) of burn wounds are in fact more painful than the original burn insult, provoking intense anticipatory anxiety.
     To prepare patients for burn wound care procedures a variety of pharmacological analgesia protocols are employed. Non-pharmacological techniques such as medical hypnosis are used as an adjunct to pharmacological methods for control of pain and anxiety. Importantly, a reduction in pain during burn wound care procedures has a demonstrated improvement in rate of re-­epithelialisation, an essential component of wound-healing. Medical hypnosis helps patients focus their awareness and attention to lessen pain and anxiety and encourage faster wound-healing. The technique has been demonstrated to decrease pain and anxiety in the short-­term and decrease psychological distress over the long-term, thereby optimizing patient outcomes and complementing existing treatment modalities.
     A hypnotherapist is a healthcare worker trained to use medical hypnosis, a technique used to naturally guide patients into a trance state which allows them to process information, including pain sensation, differently from how it is processed in the regular alert state. The patient is guided into trance by listening to the words of the hypnotherapist and following their instructions; patients can also be taught self-hypnosis which allows them to enter trance by themselves. As a therapeutic tool, medical hypnosis can help patients decrease their pain and anxiety levels by becoming more comfortable and relaxed, in addition to other significant psychological, physiological, and behavioral benefits.
     In our study, patients in the experimental group will receive hypnotherapy in addition to standard care (i.e. standard analgesia and wound care procedures). A maximum of 5 hypnotherapy sessions will take place, depending on the time it takes the burn wound to heal (i.e. &gt;95% re-­epithelialisation). During each session, the patient will be guided into trance using hypnosis at the start of their burn wound care procedure (either their first application of dressings OR a subsequent dressing change, depending on their initial presentation to our Burns Unit). Each hypnotherapy session will last for the entire duration of the wound care procedure and will end after the new dressings are in place.

      <timepoint>Timepoint: Upon patient's second presentation to the Burns Clinic (for study dressing change #2), prior to removal of dressings.

To avoid interfering with a patients initial presentation to clinic but to obtain a rigorous, vetted measure of hypnotizability for experimental subjects, the Stanford Hypnotic Clinical Scale for Children will be used to assess and objectively record the child's hypnotizability. This Gold-standard assessment will be conducted within the Intervention Group only to ensure that control subjects remain naive to hypnosis/hypnotherapy.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measures are days to re-epithelialisation and pain. Previous data in paediatric burns patients demonstrated re-epithelialisation within 15 (SD = 4) days and a minimally clinically-important difference is 3 days. Thus sample size was calculated at 28 per group at 80% power with an alpha value of 0.05. Allowing for 10% loss to follow up, a total of 62 participants will be required. The LCCH treats 800 children per year with burns, thus recruitment for this study should be achievable. This sample size will also be adequate to find a significant difference in data collected from pain scores. Data will be entered into SPSS (SPSS, Chicago, 22.0). Demographics such as age, gender and mechanism of injury will be described and data presented as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range as appropriate. All data will be analysed as intention to treat and on a per protocol basis, with the intention to treat analysis being the primary approach for this trial. Differences between groups will be assessed using Students t-test or Mann-Whitney U test where appropriate. Total body surface area (TBSA), age and gender are considered a-priori to be potential confounding variables and will be incorporated into regression models when determining factors affecting re-epithelialisation. Statistical significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>     It is well­-documented that burns and the associated wound care procedures are painful and distressing for children. Non-­pharmacological techniques are used in addition to pharmacological methods for control of pain and anxiety. Medical hypnosis in adults undergoing burn wound debridement (wound-cleaning and removal of dead tissue) has resulted in reductions in pain and anxiety. To our knowledge, there have not been any randomised controlled trials that have examined the efficacy of medical hypnosis to decrease healing times and pain/anxiety scores in paediatric burn patients.
     The aim of this study is to investigate whether medical hypnosis reduces pain and anxiety and enhances re­-epithelialisation (i.e. wound-healing) in children with acute burn injury. We hypothesise that there will be significantly lower pain and anxiety scores, lower levels of biological stress markers (cortisol and alpha-­amylase) and faster wound re-epithelialisation in the intervention group compared with the control group.</summary>
