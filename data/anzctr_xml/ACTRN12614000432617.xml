    <interventions>Conventional Peritoneal Dialysis (Con-PD)
Con-PD is delivered as a series of identical exchanges, each consisting of a fill, dwell and drain of an identical volume of dialysate. The volume of dialysate is determined as a maximum of either 40ml/kg or 1300ml/m2, depending on physician preference and patient comfort. The length of each cycle and the number of cycles are determined by the results of the annual Peritoneal Equilibration Test(PET) which defines patients as low, medium or high transporters. The overall length of the nightly dialysis programme is also determined by the lead nephrologists experience with the patient and what regime is most acceptable to the family in terms of solute clearance (measured by blood tests), fluid removal/ultrafiltration (determined by weight, clinical exam and blood pressure) and the impact that time on dialysis has on the childs life (i.e. a baby will tolerate 12-14 hours on dialysis overnight whereas a teenager may be limited to 8-10 hours to facilitate school etc).
Adapted PD (Ad-PD)
Ad-PD is a new concept in PD and consists of several initial short, low volume cycles, followed by several long, higher volume cycles. In concept it is similar to how manual PD is frequently employed in intensive care, where there are more frequent changes made to cycle length and volume. Ad-PD uses the same machine, the same volume of fluid, and the same overall treatment time. As such there is no need for extra education of patients or parents. 
The trial will last 12 weeks with 6 weeks of Ad-PD and 6 weeks of Con-PD. The first week of the second treatment regime will be considered a wash-out period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each participant will act as their own control. 
The control/comparator treatment is conventional peritoneal dialysis.
This is a parallel cross over trial. Patients will be randomised into 2 groups, to start with either 6 weeks of Con-PD (Group A) or with 6 weeks of Ad-PD (Group B). They will then cross-over to a further 6 weeks of Ad-PD (Group A) or Con-PD (Group B). The dialysate used during the study will be the same in both treatment arms. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome measure is ultrafiltration(UF) volume/kg. This is the net volume of fluid removed during the dialysis program divided by the participants weight. The nightly UF volume is recorded on the individual removable card inserted into each dialysis machine and is downloaded routinely at the patients clinic appointment by the PD nurse co-ordinators.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed at each 2-weekly study visit for a total of 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure is clearance of urea. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be calculated from the blood, urine and dialysate samples taken in the 2-weekly clinic visit for a total of 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure is the metabolic cost of clearance as measured by glucose absorption. </outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients with a known impediment to higher volume exchanges such as previous abdominal wall problems or the presence of multiple adhesions will be excluded due to concerns with the larger volume fills. 
Patients with salt-losing nephropathies will be excluded as there is a concern that they may experience overly large fluid shifts with Ad-PD. 
The published study excluded those with an episode of peritonitis in the last 3 months, we will include these patients but will analyse their results separately.

    <concealment>Randomisation Procedures
Patients will be randomised to Group A or B by sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes, simple randomisation using coin-tossing.
Blinding Arrangements
This study will not be blinded as it would be impossible to blind parents to the delivered therapy since the programme is clearly displayed on the front screen of the dialysis machine. It would also be unsafe to blind the clinicians and nurse co-ordinators to the new PD regime as it may result in a changed UF and thus necessitate changes to the regime.

Sample size estimation
Discussion with Susan Donath from the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit has confirmed that there is insufficient data in the published paper to calculate a sample size for this study. However, since the published paper had 19 patients in the trial, we feel that it is reasonable to recruit a similar number in RCH and attempt to repeat the study. 
Population to be analysed
All patients in RCH treated with PD by the nephrology team who do not meet the exclusion criteria.
Statistical Analysis Plan 
Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA. Differences between the two dialysis regimes will be evaluated using the paired-samples t-test. Values of p less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The first week in each regime will be considered a wash-out period.
Interim Analyses 
There is no plan for interim analysis of the data. All data will be analysed at the end of the study.

    <summary>Title	Optimising Peritoneal Dialysis: A Comparison of Adapted and Conventional Peritoneal Dialysis
Objectives	To investigate the effect of varying the dwell time and fill volume of peritoneal dialysis to determine whether a new dialysis regime (Adapted Peritoneal Dialysis) offers better fluid removal and solute clearance than conventional peritoneal dialysis in patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis.
Patient Impact	Patients maintained on peritoneal dialysis are routinely seen in clinic with a blood test, clinical review and a review of their dialysis parameters and prescription every 2-4 weeks. Participation in this study will require a clinic review every 2 weeks. Therefore at most, participation will involve 3 extra visits with one extra blood test, usually taken via finger prick. For the majority of patients there will be no extra appointments required.
The protocol for the study has been drawn up in consultation with dialysis-nurse co-ordinators and one parent whose child is on nightly peritoneal dialysis.
