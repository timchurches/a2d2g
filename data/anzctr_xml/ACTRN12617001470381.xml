  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current treatments to control damaging immune responses during autoimmunity use broad immunosuppressive drugs associated with undesirable side effects. Alternative strategies to control damaging immune responses are desirable. DEN-181 offers a novel liposomal therapy that does not broadly suppress the immune system, with the associated increased risk of infectious complications, but rather is designed to specifically address the underlying pathology of Rheumatoid arthritis by re-programming the immune system towards tolerance for improved patient outcomes and minimal side effects. This trial will examine the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DEN-181 in Rheumatoid arthritis patients.</summary>
