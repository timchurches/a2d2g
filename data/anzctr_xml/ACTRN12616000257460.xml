  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in randomised to the intervention arm will be followed up within 2 weeks of hospital discharge using a single visit follow up clinic staffed by the Trauma Clinical Nurse Consultant Physiotherapist, Mental Health Nurse Practitioner and Trauma Surgery Registrar. The clinic will be conducted within the hospital at a designated consultation room within the Emergency Department. The clinic will review patient progress and make referrals to social work, physiotherapists and Mental Health Nurse Practitioners working within ED if required.  Referrals to Mental Health services from the trauma follow up clinic will be based on results of screening tests (Kessler-6 scale) which is routinely used by Mental Health Services at RPAH. Patients will also undertake post traumatic amnesia screening tests and be referred to appropriate outpatient services if found to be positive. Patients will undertake these screening surveys in person at the time of follow up clinic appointment.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>Patient population  Patients will be recruited after trauma team activation in ED who satisfy the following:

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusions - Patients excluded will be expectant death within 48 hours of admission, severe head injury, severe multisystem injury, patient identified after 48 hours of admission, penetrating injury, assault, self-inflicted injury, pre-existing mental health illness or cognitive impairment, pre-existing diagnosis of drug and alcohol use disorders, residence in an aged care facility, no fixed abode or contact details lack of adequate English speaking family member present at home. Exclusions are based on previous work at this institution that demonstrated poor telephone follow up rates. </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline descriptive statistics for the study population will be presented in tabular form. The primary outcome will be analysed using chi square tests and repeated measures logistic regression. SF12 scores will be converted to Mental and Physical Component scores and normalised using available Australian norms. Repeated measures will be compared using repeated measures mixed modelling. The anticipated sample size during the initial one year study pilot period will be around 250 patients based on the inclusion criteria and current trauma admission characteristics at this hospital. Assuming 200 patients are recruited, this will provide an 80% power of detecting a 20% difference (45% to 65%) in return to work or previous occupation at 6 months. Analysis will be by intention to treat  in the context of this study, control patients who request and receive early rehabilitation assessment independent of this study will still be analysed as a control patient.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aims to increase our understanding of post discharge follow up processes in trauma patients with predominantly minor injury.  The aim of the study is to determine whether a post discharge follow up clinic results in earlier return to work and baseline health status in patients sustaining minor injury. </summary>
