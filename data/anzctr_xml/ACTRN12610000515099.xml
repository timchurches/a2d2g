  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The recommended treatment for preventing asthma exacerbations in adults with moderate-severe asthma is regular inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combined with an inhaled long-acting beta-agonist drug (LABA).  This therapy is commonly prescribed as a fixed combination inhaler, such as Seretide (Registered Trademark), Symbicort (Registered Trademark) or Vannair (Registered Trademark) and is taken twice daily with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) used as rescue therapy in the event of an exacerbation ("STANDARD" regime).  An alternative regime in which patients take their Vannair (Registered Trademark)  combination inhaler both as Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (referred to as SMART) has recently been proposed.  A large clinical trial programme has shown that Symbicort (Registered Trademark) (budesonide/eformoterol) taken according to the SMART regime is more effective than the STANDARD regime.  However, these studies were undertaken under strict clinical trial conditions in highly selected populations.  Additionally it is not clear how the use of budesonide/eformoterol given according to the SMART regime improves outcomes, or whether its use by patients in the situation of worsening asthma or severe exacerbations is associated with significant risk.
This study aims to assess the effect on asthma control of budesonide/eformoterol given using the SMART regime in a population of high-risk asthmatics in real life and to measure (using electronic monitoring devices) the actual use of budesonide/eformoterol when used according to the SMART regime.</summary>
