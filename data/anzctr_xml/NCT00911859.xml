The raw score to each question ranged from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent). The raw mean score of health status/quality of life subscale is calculated for each participant and a linear transformation applied to standardize the raw score, so that scores range from 0 to 100; a higher score represents a higher ("better") health and quality of life.</outcome>
