    <summary>This study will compare safety, efficacy, and tolerability of a two drug regimen of
      dolutegravir (DTG) plus (+) lamivudine (3TC) administered once daily with DTG plus two
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Tenofovir [TDF]/Emtricitabine [FTC] fixed dose
      combination [FDC]) administered once daily in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 infected
      adult subjects that have not previously received antiretroviral therapy. The study is
      designed to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of DTG plus 3TC regimen to that
      of DTG plus TDF/FTC FDC and will characterise the long term antiviral activity, tolerability
      and safety of DTG plus 3TC through Week 148. Approximately, 700 subjects will be randomised
      1:1 to receive DTG + 3TC or DTG + TDF/FTC FDC. Subjects will be stratified by screening HIV 1
      ribonucleotide nucleic acid (RNA) levels and by screening CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4)
      cell count.</summary>
