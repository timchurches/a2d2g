             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40
             milli-international units per milliliter (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per
             milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is confirmatory. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods in listed in protocol if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation
             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least
             2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label, two part, six period- cross over, randomised, single dose, single
      centre study in healthy subjects. This is the first clinical study for the UD-DPI. This study
      is divided into two parts. Part A will ascertain whether the pharmacokinetic (PK) of
      salbutamol delivered via the UD-DPI is comparable to the salbutamol delivered via the Diskus
      or MDI. For this reason four treatment doses consisting of three dose strength and two
      percentage blends will be assessed in Part A delivered via UD-DPI. Part A will also provide
      preliminary PK variability estimates to allow for better sample size/precision calculations
      for Part B. Part B will explore whether the UD-DPI has a pharmacokinetic exposure profile
      that is comparable to either Diskus or MDI in the presence of the charcoal block.</summary>
