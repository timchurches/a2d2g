  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The number of people with asthma has been steadily increasing for many years in most countries of the world including New Zealand, but researchers are not sure why. Some studies have suggested that one reason could be the increasing use of paracetamol. We are aiming to find out if giving paracetamol to people with mild asthma has any effect on their asthma.</summary>
