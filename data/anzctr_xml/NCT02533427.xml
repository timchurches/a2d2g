  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - SOF/VEL/GS-9857
Treatment: drugs - GS-9857
Treatment: drugs - Norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol

Experimental: SOF/VEL/GS-9857+GS-9857 - Part A: Participants without a documented history of taking norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol for at least one menstrual cycle will receive norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol. Participants with a documented history of taking norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol may enroll directly into Part B of the study.
Part B: Participants will continue taking norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol for the remainder of the study and will receive SOF/VEL/GS-9857 FDC plus GS-9857.


Treatment: drugs: SOF/VEL/GS-9857
SOF/VEL/GS-9857 (400/100/100 mg) FDC tablet administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: GS-9857
GS-9857 100 mg tablet administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: Norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol
Norgestimate 0.180 mg/0.215 mg/0.25 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.025 mg tablet administered orally once daily according to the package insert

    <summary>This study will evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir (SOF)/velpatasvir (VEL)/GS-9857 fixed-dose
      combination (FDC) + GS-9857 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a representative hormonal
      contraceptive medication, norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol (Ortho Tri-Cyclen® Lo (OC)) and will
