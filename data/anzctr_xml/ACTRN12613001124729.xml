  <interventions>
    <interventions>unexplained infertility patients were randomized to a control group and a study group. The control group was treated with ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination and study group received the same treatment in addition to 20 mg isosorbid mononitrate tablet once daily applied vaginally starting from the fifth day of the cycle with the start of ovarian stimulation till diagnosis of pregnancy in a case of missed period or occurrence of menstruation. Patients were monitored during treatment by vaginal ultrasound and adherence to treatment was confirmed through drug tablet return     </interventions>
    <comparator>Active control group treated with ovarian stimulation with100 mg clomiphene citrate tablet once daily orally from cycle day 5-9. Follicular growth was monitored by ultrasound and 10.000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin given intramuscular when one or more follicles &gt;18mm. Intrauterine insemination was 36 hours later after ultrasound confirmation of ovulation </comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Unexplained infertility patients defined as the absence of a definable cause for a couple's failure to achieve pregnancy after 12 months of attempting conception despite a thorough evaluation. Inclusion criteria includes: 1- Normal semen analysis. 2- Patent fallopian tubes by HSG and laparoscopy when indicated. 3- Normal ovulation and luteal phase by serum progesterone at cycle days 21-23 of &gt; 10 ng/ml. </inclusivecriteria>

Result was represented by the mean and the standard deviation. Student t test was used to compare between two independent groups and the Z test to compare between two proportions. P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. 
The sample size was calculated according to the equation : N = Z2 x PQ / D2 where N is the minimum sample size required, Z is the area under the curve of normal distribution = 1.96 (constant), P is the proportion of the affected population, Q is the proportion of the non affected population and D is the magnitude of the absolute sampling error that can be tolerated = 0.04 (constant). If unexplained infertility is about 10% of all cases of infertility (20%), then N = (1.96)2 x 0.2 x 0.8 / (0.04)2 x 10 / 100 = 38  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Unexplained infertility is failure to get pregnant after one year of marriage in spite of normal semen analysis, patent fallopian tubes and normal ovulation. Good blood flow to the uterus is essential for successful implantation and pregnancy. Nitric oxide donors are drugs the release nitric oxide in the body and acts as vasodilators and perfusion enhancer. In this study we tested if its administration increases uterine blood flow and pregnancy rate in unexplained infertility patients treated with ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination  </summary>
