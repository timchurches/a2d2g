      <timepoint>Progression status will be reviewed prior to surgery, and then every 3 months until disease progression.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival will be measured from date of patient entry onto the study to date of death from any cause. Following completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up every 3 months for a minimum of 3 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity as measured by adverse events. Examples include febrile neutropaenia, nausea, vomiting and oesophagitis, which will be measured by clinican assessment and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (NCICTCAEv3.0). Late radiation toxicities including lung, heart and spinal cord will be measured by clinician assessment and graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer(RTOG/EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be assessed at baseline, at the end of every induction chemotherapy cycle, weekly during concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and 2 and 4 weeks post completion of chemoradiotherapy. Late radiation toxicities will then be assessed every 3 months for a minimum of 3 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility in terms of the extent of delivery of the planned treatment regimen</outcome>
      <timepoint>Extent of treatment delivery will be assessed at the completion of protocol treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Early Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) response (where assessed).</outcome>
      <timepoint>FDG PET will be performed at baseline. Another FDG PET will be performed 14-21 days after the commencment of induction chemotherapy, where available.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-treatment Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) response rate (where assessed)</outcome>
      <timepoint>FDG PET will be performed at baseline. Another FDG PET will be performed 4-6 weeks following the completion of chemoradiotherapy, where available.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although oesophageal cancer can be surgically removed, the cancer often comes back. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation before surgery might help, but standard treatment hasnt been defined and new therapies are needed urgently. This study will test a novel combination of chemotherapy and radiation, with and without a new type of antibody treatment. Effectiveness will be assessed by the amount of tumour left at the time of surgery, the length of time before the tumour begins to grow again, and length of life.</summary>
