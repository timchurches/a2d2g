  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individualized program; program conducted by a qualified physiotherapist during three weeks at 5 sessions a week in a one-on-one consultation for 45 minutes each sesssion.

1.- Surface thermotherapy, infrared for 15 minutes, at a distance of 50 cm from the source of emission.

2.- Therapeutic massage in neck area in the following pattern:
- Surface effleurage for 5 minutes.
- Deep friction for 5 minutes
- Petrissage for 5 minutes
- Surface effleurage for 5 minutes.
3.- Specific/analitic stretching in the following pattern on the muscles affected (trapezius, right and left, and levator scapular, right and left) :
- First, start stretching slowly and softly.
- Second, maintain the stretching
- Third, relaxing slowly
- Forth, keep the position for 15 seconds.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Group therapy/control group; program carried out by a quilified physiotherapist for the whole group.

1.- Relaxing exercises by means of abdominal breathing, for 5 minutes.
2.- Trapezius and levator scapular auto-stretching exercises maintaining each position during five seconds. This section includes 4 exercises. Each exercise was perfomed in series of repetitions, so that three series of three repetitions were executed. 
    Exercise 1.- Up and down shoulders.
    Exercise 2.- Flexion and extension of the neck
    Exercise 3.- Left and right neck rotation
    Exercise 4.- Left and right neck lateroflexion

3.- Isometric neck exercises, using the patient´s hand resistance, in the following pattern, (three series with three repetitions, each one for 6 seconds):

     Exercise 1.-  Neck flexion, resisted in forehead
     Exercise 2.- Neck extension, resisted in occipital area
     Exercise 3.- Neck sidebending, resisted in   
                         tempoparietal area (left and right)
     Exercise 4.- From a neck rotation of 30 degrees, try to flex it    
                         towards the homolateral shoulder. Repeat     
                         in the other side.
 4.- Ergonomic education in a session during 45 minutes, on postural hygiene standards in daily life activities. This session was carried out by a quilified physiotherapist for the whole group as a masterclass.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated with the G Power 3.0 program, the following parameters were selected depending on the type of study: one tail hipothesis, a large effect size (0.8), and a probabilistic alpha error of 0, 05.
n = 35 subjects for each study group was/were obtained as sample size. The sample was increased in a 30% in order to considering possible drop-outs, being n = 90 (45 in each group) the final sample.

The recorded data were processed using SPSS v.17.0 for Windows. All the variables were checked by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to know the normal distribution. 
Subsequently, descriptive analysis of the variables of the study (pre and posttest) and  Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed. 

Finally, to compare the effectiveness of both treatments, U Mann-Whitney test was conducted.

    <summary>Introduction:
Mechanical neck pain is one of the most common diseases, which has important implications for both, health and labor sector. Due to the heavy workload, the health authorities argue that its physiotherapy treatment should be performed in a group, rather than in a personalized way, how it has been done so far. The aim of this study is to know which of these two modalities of treatment is the most effective to improve this health problem. 
Material and Methods:
Our study is a randomized and controlled clinical trial, with two groups formed by simple chance, 90 subjects (45 per group) were included: 69 women (76.7%) and 21 men (23.3%) of 20-52 years (mean 39.50 and standard deviation 9.05). 
Personalized treatment was applied in one group and group treatment in the other one, both during 15 sessions. The following variables were measured at the beginning and the end of the treatment (pre and posttreatment): pain with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and algometer on trapezius and levator sacapulas trigger points; cervical joint range with inclinometer; neck disability with Neck Disability Index; and quality of life with SF-12 questionnaire. 
Data analysis were made by Wilcoxon signed ranks test and U Mann-Whitney test. A significance level of p &lt;0.05 was considered.
Results:
In personalized treatment group Wilcoxon test showed a significant decrease in pain and disability index and an increase in joint range and quality of life (p&gt; 0.05). 
Group treatment patients showed significant, but very small (not clinically relevant), differences between pretest and posttest values for all variables (p &lt;0.05).
The comparison between the two groups showed significant differences in favor of personalized treatment in all variables (p &lt;0.05) with a high or moderate effect size.
