    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation to treatment was done immediately prior to CPAP titration study by the laboratory technician from sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>The sequence of allocation was performed by simple randomisation using a urn with a 2, 1 schedule.  This involved removing a piece of paper from a closed urn. There were two pieces of paper one  which said 1=CPAP and the other 2=CFLEX, the paper was then returned to the urn for the next draw , and hence the sequence of intervention was generated.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine whether CFLEX, a type of CPAP treatment with exhalation pressure reduction, is used more by patients with obstructive sleep apnoea than standard CPAP.
The hypothesis of the study is that CFLEX will be used on average more than CPAP over a 3 month period in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea.</summary>
