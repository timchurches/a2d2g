  <interventions>
    <interventions>The internet-delivered Reboot Online program contains 8 lessons over
16 weeks delivering 'self-management' techniques in order to manage chronic pain better. The 'self-management' techniques are based on the components of a multi-disciplinary pain management program combining psychological cognitive behaviour therapy and a physical therapy component. Participants will learn skills to manage their pain based on these components, for example Pacing through a graded exercise program - the physical therapy component - alongside psychological skills and techniques such as Activity Scheduling, Thought Challenging and Stress Reduction. One lesson will be completed every 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons). The participant does not have to complete the whole lesson in one sitting. Each lesson will take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. Participants will access summaries after each lesson which contain homework exercises - this entails the participant practicing and implementing the skills that have been covered within the lesson content.The participant can also optionally view videos of physical exercises, expert talks and extra resources. There is no specific time requirement for the homework tasks but it is recommended that the participants spend roughly 3-4 hours per week re-reading the lesson content and resources, reviewing the homework summaries and practicing the skills in the program. All participants will receive email
contact from a clinician after the first two lessons then as required. The participant is able to contact a clinician via telephone or email throughout the program - they will have access to a registered psychologist, physiotherapist, anesthetist and psychiatrist. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their
scores increase by one or more standard deviation the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email. Strategies used to improve adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework and videos,
collection of data on how long participants spent reading the lessons and practicing the skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU) waitlist control group. These participants remain on the waitlist and receive their usual treatment for chronic pain until the immediate treatment group has completed their treatment (16 weeks), post-treatment  questionnaires (17 weeks) and three month follow-up. At week 30, the waitlist control group will be offered the online treatment program for pain. For all study participants, their chronic pain treatment will not change and will continue as usual "treatment as usual". For example, as part of usual treatment, participants will continue to receive regular monitoring from their appropriate physicians (and associated pain services like physiotherapy) and medication management from their GP or pain specialist.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A pre-to-post-treatment improvement of effect size (ES) 0.8 is expected for the Reboot online treatment group on the primary measures. This group is also expected to improve more than the control group by an ES of 0.6. Sample size is powered to have an 80% chance of detecting differences at p&lt;.05. Assuming effect size &gt;0.6, power at 80%, and alpha set at 0.05, a sample size of 44 per group is needed to detect between-groups differences. Therefore, a sample of N=100 will allow for a 20% attrition rate.  Clinical efficacy will be evaluated using two statistical analysis methods in order for the equivalence of these methods to be determined  mixed model repeated measures ANOVA and sequential method analysis. Mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) ANOVA will be conducted with measurement occasion as a within-groups factor and treatment condition as a between-groups factor. Separate analyses will be conducted for pain severity. All analyses will control for pre-treatment symptom severity.  Relationships between observations at different occasions will be modelled with an unstructured covariance matrix. For each symptom type, planned contrasts will be used to compare changes from baseline to post-treatment and 3-month follow-up. T-tests and chi-squared analyses will be used to determine equivalence between groups on pre-treatment scores and demographics. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to evaluate the acceptability and clinical efficacy of an online Pain Program Management program, 'Reboot' online. And to examine the moderators and
mediators of change during the Reboot program.
Up to 100 people with chronic pain will be randomly assigned to either
the active treatment group or a Treatment as Usual (TAU) control group. The treatment group will commence the Reboot program immediately, whereas the TAU group will commence once the treatment group has completed and a 3 month follow-up period has been completed.
The efficacy of the Reboot program will be determined by comparing
the pain severity, disability and interference levels of the two groups at the time the
treatment group completes treatment. Mediation analyses will be used to
explore the role of variables that may influence positive change.</summary>
