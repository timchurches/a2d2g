  <interventions>
    <interventions>An ApneaLink monitor will be used in the intervention group to measure baseline sleep apnoea severity and then again to measure the response to treatment. It is an overnight simplified sleep monitoring device. It will be used when the dentist feels that the oral appliance has been optimally titrated and then again if any further advancement is done. If the ApneaLink shows that the sleep apnoea is still inadequately treated, further advancement will be attempted and another ApneaLink study done. Thus the ApneaLink device will be used at least twice and it may be used several more times, depending on the adequacy of treatment and requirement for further advancement of the mandible with the oral appliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care. This involves an initial visit to the dentist to assess suitability for treatment with an oral appliance. A mould of the teeth is then taken and sent away for manufacture of the oral appliance. At the next visit, the oral appliance is fitted and advanced to the limits of patient comfort. Subsequently, patients are seen fortnightly with further advancement of the mandible as possible. Usually the patient visits the dentist 4 or 5 times before advancement is considered complete. At this time, an in-laboratory diagnostic sleep study will be done to assess treatment efficacy.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Apnoea Hypopnoea Index will be the primary outcome. This outcome will be measured by a full in-laboratory overnight polysomnogram.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For participants in the control arm this endpoint will be measured 1 month after participants are comfortable with using the oral appliance on a nightly basis. For participants in the intervention arm, it will be measured 1 month after advancement is considered to be optimal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life - measured by Functional Outcomes of sleep questionnaire and the sf36 questionnaire
Symptoms - measured by the Sleep Apnoea Symptom Questionnaire
Subjective Sleepiness - measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>For participants in the control arm this endpoint will be measured 1 month after participants are comfortable with using the oral appliance on a nightly basis. For participants in the intervention arm, it will be measured 1 month after advancement is considered to be optimal.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients referred to one of the 2 participating dentists will be considered for inclusion. If they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign informed consent, they will be randomly allocated to usual care or usual care plus portable sleep monitor. Randomisation will be done centrally, with an administrative research assistant allocating participants to a treatment arm. This will done by faxing participant details to the central site. Subjects will be stratified according to the severity of their sleep apnoea, with an apnoea hypopnoea index cutpoint of 25. The research assistant will then allocate the subject the next number on the list of random numbers that has been generated. Subjects with odd numbers will be allocated to the intervention arm, those with even numbers will be allocated to the control arm. 
The research assistant is not involved in recruiting, consenting or treating participants. She will fax the treatment allocation back to the treating dentist.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>All patients attending 2 dental practices for oral appliance therapy to treat obstructive sleep apnoea will be assessed for recruitment. Those who are able to sign informed consent will be enrolled. If a polysomnogram (PSG) has not been done, this will be done to confirm the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI). Participants will be randomised to either usual care or usual care plus an apnealink study to evaluate treatment response. Should treatment response be inadequate as indicated by the ApneaLink in this group, further advancement of the mandible will be attempted. A repeat ApneaLink study will then be done and the process repeated. One month after titration is considered optimal, repeat PSG will be done. A repeat PSG will be done 1 month after optimal titration has been achieved in the control group. Secondary outcome measures of quality of life, symptoms and subjective sleepiness will be measured at baseline and at the time of the repeat PSG in both groups.</summary>
