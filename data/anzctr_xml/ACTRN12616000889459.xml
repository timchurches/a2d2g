  <interventions>
    <interventions>A modified analgesia protocol will be followed prior to receiving the study intervention. The analgesia protocol will be as follows in all patients: paracetamol 1g orally PLUS oxycodone 10 mg orally. After this analgesia has been administered, the trial drug will be given to the patient. Patients with a history of a psychotic disorder, uncontrolled hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, tachyarrhythmia or pregnancy will not be included.

Patients will be given one dose of IV-infusion with ketamine 15 mg in 100 mL of normal saline over 15 minutes. The patient will be continuously monitored (ECG, pulse oximetry and non-invasive blood pressure), after which they will be admitted to the Emergency Department Observation Ward/Short Stay Unit. Study observations will also be performed at 30min, 1h, 2h, and 4h after the trial drug and immediately prior to discharge if kept in hospital for longer than this. Length of hospital stay is variable depending on the clinical condition of individual patients, 

The first oral 50 mg ketamine lozenge will be given at 2 hours while the patient is in hospital and every 6 hours afterwards (4 lozenges in total). Therefore patients will be discharged on any of the remaining four ketamine lozenges. The patient will be given a sheet explaining when to take the lozenges and will be asked to record the times the treatment drug is taken as well as any other pain medication on a data sheet that will be collected by researchers. If the patient does not take all four doses of the trial medication, the remaining medication will also be returned to researchers. The patient will be contacted via phone by researchers at 24 and 48 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinically significant  change in the severity of pain. Assessment of pain will be assessed using the verbal numerical rating score (VNRS), The treatement effect will be estimated as a mean reduction (and standard deviation) in the VNRS at 30min compared to baseline VNRS. In addition, a clinically significant change in the VNRS will be measured based on the Bird and Dickson for visual analogue scales. (see Bird SB, Dickson EW. Clinically significant changes in pain along the visual analog scale. Annals of emergency medicine. 2001;38(6):639-43) [ie. the change is dependent on the baseline starting point  2 or greater for baseline score of 0 to 3, greater than 3 for baseline score of 4 to 6, and 5 or greater for baseline score of 7 to 10.</outcome>

      <outcome>Adverse effects will be reported. Known side effects of ketamine include dissociative effects, dizziness, fatique, mood changes, hallucinations, nausea and head-ache.

a.	The spider causing the bite was clearly identified by the patient or clinician, OR
b.	A clinical syndrome consistent with typical red-back spider envenoming that is: the sensation of a bite followed by two or more of:
*increasing pain over the first hour
*radiating, regional or generalised pain
*local or regional diaphoresis

    <statisticalmethods>For this single-centred pilot study we will use the rule of 12 for continuous variables. Increasing the sample size to 12 participants makes a profound difference in the width of confidence intervals for mean response, whereas increasing the sample size beyond 12 participants does not.   At least 12 participants are recommended for pilot studies where the  primary focus is estimating average values and variability for planning larger subsequent studies. This size is practical for most early-stage investigators to conduct within single centres while still providing valuable preliminary information. It will also be able to be completed in one red-back season at this site.

    <summary>AIMS
To investigate the effectiveness of ketamine for the treatment of pain associated with red-back spider envenoming
HYPOTHESES
Ketamine will result in a significant change in the level of pain experienced by patients envenomed by red -back spider.
RESEARCH DESIGN
This pilot study will test the effectiveness of subanesthetic, intravenous ketamine infusions for red-back spider envenoming in a small single centre pilot trial. All patients will also receive standard opioid and nonopioid analgesia. Patients will be over 18 years old
with moderate to severe red-back spider envenoming. The primary outcome will be clinically significant reduction in pain 30 minutes after administration of the ketamine infusion (compared to baseline). Informed written consent will be obtained from the patient using usual procedures prior to trial entry. All participants will receive analgesia according to a standardised protocol, commenced prior to administration of the trial drug. Patients will be cared for in an acute care area with physiological monitoring and if required intravenous parenteral analgesia as rescue medication.
STUDY INTERVENTION
A standard analgesia protocol will be followed prior to receiving the study intervention. The analgesia protocol will be as follows in all patients: paracetamol 1g orally PLUS oxycodone 10 mg orally. After the standard analgesia has been administered, the trial drug will be given to the patient. Subjects will be given an IV infusion with ketamine 15 mg in
100 mL of normal saline over 15 minutes. Clinical observations and patient pain score will be recorded at baseline and then post treatment at 30 minutes, one hour, two hours, four hours and on discharge.
OUTCOMES: The primary outcome will be a clinically significant reduction in the severity of pain 30 min after the commencement of the ketamine infusion using the VNRS</summary>
