  <interventions>
    <interventions>341 people (from a private practice clinic) with diagnosed autoimmune inflammatory disease that have had mannose binding lectin levels recorded will be posted a questionnaire to determine the number and frequency of infection over the past 7 years. Those who fail to return the questionnaire will receive a follow up phone call 4 weeks later.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Details concerning the number of infections were obtained by conducting a retrospective audit of hospital admission records and a state-wide government Health database, for all participants.

    <statisticalmethods>This is an explorative study. We have 341 case records of females with autoimmune conditions. We will examine these to determine if there is a relationship between urinary tract infections and mannose binding lectin deficiencies. Since there is little published data on this relationship, we are unable to perform a power calculation based on prior research findings.
Descriptive statistics will be presented as means and standard deviations for continuous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. Statistical analysis will be carried out using simple parametric tests as well as Poisson regression models (to investigate factors related to the incidence of Serious Infections) and Logistic regression models (to investigate factors related to multiple serious infections). Rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Project Aim: 
To determine whether there is a relationship between low Mannose Binding Lectin concentrations (a protein produced in the liver, that acts in the recognition of disease causing pathogens)  and frequent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) in patients who have an autoimmune disease.  
Hypothesis: 
MBL deficiency predisposes to frequent UTIs in female patients with auto-immune diseases
