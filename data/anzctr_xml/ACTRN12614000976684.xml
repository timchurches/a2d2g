    <interventions>Cognitive training.
Cognitive training intervention uses tasks mainly focusing on executive functioning (cognitive flexibility, planning, speed of processing, reasoning and attention) thus stimulating presumably more frontal areas of the brain. The cognitive training program will be a clinically and neuropsychologically  relevant modification of the cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) , which is a training based intervention aimed to improve cognitive processes on psychiatric patients (Wykes et al 1999). The tasks will be tailored according to the participants' level of cognitive abilities, interests and adherence. The cognitive training takes place twice a week in Helsinki day centres in groups of 1-5 participants. Participants perform predetermined paper and pencil tasks for 45-60 min/day. Their work is directed, supported and assessed by a day centre trained assistant who will be trained by a neuropsychologist. Participants will be transferred to day centres by taxis and they will be provided also the normal day centre program. The whole day care will take approximately 4-6 hours and it includes also socializing with other participants. The intervention lasts 12 weeks. </interventions>

      <outcome>In a substudy 20 intervention + 20 patients with mild to moderate dementia (preferably Alzheimer disease) will undergo functional MRI at Aalto university Advanced Magnetic Imaging Centre (AMI) by 3T MRI (Magnetom Skyra, Siemens). We will use a visual n-back task during the fMRI with three load levels (0-back, 1-back and 2-back) in order to clarify the areas and intensity of patients brain areas involved with these tasks requiring attention and working memory. In the n-back task, memory load is increased in a parametric manner. At all memory load levels, the number of stimuli, and the number and type of responses remain the same. The memory load is modulated by changing the instruction given to the subject. The presentation of the stimuli is controlled by Presentation software (Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc.) which also collects information concerning responses (correct, incorrect, misses) and reaction times. The findings of intervention and  control participants will be described and compared. </outcome>

Exclusion criteria for fMRI substudy: Key exclusion criteria in fMRI:
Subjects with any kind of metal fragments in the body should not have an MR scan without further safety controls. This includes e.g. any electronic, magnetic or mechanical implants (such as a cardiac pacemaker, infusion pumps or cochlear implants), aneurysm clips in the brain or other surgical clips, or prostheses (such as artificial heart valves or dentures).

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After the baseline visit, those patient fulfilling inclusion criteria will be randomized either to intervention or control group using computer-generated randomly allocated numbers received by telephone from a randomization centre. We use block randomization in which patients from one day center will be randomized in blocks of mild, moderate or severe stage of dementia separately. </concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomized in order they have been assessed at baseline visit. The randomization will be performed using computer-generated randomly allocated numbers received by telephone from a randomization centre. A person not related to patient assessments calls to a person (neither related to patient assessments) at a randomization centre who is not aware the identities of potential participants. The person calling read the names from a paper list in the order which they had been assessed. Every randomization result will appear in the program after the participants name has been written and the person executing the randomization has confirmed the process with initials. This assures that neither the person calling, nor person doing the randomization cannot influence the result. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome measure ADAS-Cog. To ensure 80% power to detect a four point difference with standard deviation about nine (Jones et al. 2004) between the treatment and control groups at two-sided alfa=0.05, 79 participants are needed in each arm. The final sample size will be decided depending on the feasibility of intervention and drop-out rate. We aim to include at least 20 +20 participants into fMRI tests. 20 + 20 should be sufficient to show differences between those training and controls in fMRI but the recruited groups may be more heterogeneous in their AD than expected, there may be problems in compliance during the fMRI. To ensure sufficient sample size we might recruit 30+30.
All patients assessed at baseline and at 3 months will be included in the data analyses of the changes in cognitive functioning (intention-to-treat). The data will be presented as means with standard deviations, or numbers with percentages. 95% confidence intervals (CI) are given for the most important outcomes. Statistical comparison between the groups will be performed using t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or the Chi-Square test when appropriate. Repeated measures are analyzed using mixed-effect models with the appropriate contrast. All participants will be included in the use and costs of services analyses. As the data for costs will be highly skewed, bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap estimation will be used to derive 95% CIs. Differences between the means will be tested by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with appropriate contrast.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent advances in neuropathology of cognitive reserves provide hypotheses on effects of cognitive training among  patients with dementia.  Executive functioning may be affected in later stages of dementia after prefrontal areas of brain becoma affected. Executive functions are the brain functions needed to manage our daily functioning, our emotions and our behavior in pursuit of our goals. Efficient executive functioning might compensate other cognitive disorders, e.g. memory decline. Thus, rehearsing dementia patients' executive functioning may improve daily functioning and lead to compensation of impaired cognitive domains.
The aim this study is to investigate the efficacy of cognitive training (CoTr) focusing on executive functioning among community-dwelling patients with mild to severe dementia with a 24 months follow-up. The aim of this large RCT is to clarify the effects of CoTr on their global cognition, various domains of executive functioning and cognition, participants' daily functioning, HrQOL and use of health and social services.
In a parallel substudy with RCT design we aim to explore in detail the effects of  CoTr among mild to moderate AD patients in fMRI.
