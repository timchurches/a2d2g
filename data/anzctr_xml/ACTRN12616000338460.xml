  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible lung transplant patients diagnosed with new onset of CLAD will receive 4 infusions of allogenic bone - marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) or 4 infusions of placebo within 2 weeks (at the clinical discretion of the treating physician) with a 12 month follow up period. The MSC/placebo dose is 2 x 10 6 cells/kg administered intravenously twice a week for 2 weeks. 
Allogenic ex vivo expanded, bone marrow derived MSC are produced by Isopogen in Western Australia from a adult human healthy donor. MSCs are tested for possible infectious agents such as viruses or bacteria at several time points within the manufacturing of the MSC product. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation to receive MCS or placebo is random. Randomisation is performed centrally at the lead site. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be generated by a statistical software program (Stata) using permuted blocks. We will stratify for site/Clad phenotype and blocks. This means that we have equal numbers in each â€“ this has the benefit that if the trial stops early we will have similar numbers in each arm.
Randomisation will be stratified by site and by CLAD phenotype (R-CLAD vs BOS). To randomise a patient, the site will contact the responsible delegate at The Prince Charles Hospital. The delegate will assign a treatment arm from the sealed randomisation schedule. The randomisation schedule (confidential Excel spreadsheet list) will be provided to the lead site (unblinded staff member) by the manufacture of the cells (Isopogen). Isopogen will use simple allocation of The delegate will review available stored products at treatment site. If stock is available they will then determine which Unique Product Numbers to be used and inform the site. If stock is not available or CMV â€“ve product is required they will liaise with Isopogen to arrange shipment.  (CMV â€“ve products will be given to CMV â€“ve recipients).

    <statisticalmethods>The primary efficacy outcome is a 50% reduction in the number of patients experiencing CLAD progression (defined as a 10% fall in FEV1 from baseline to the end of the study at 12 months) or death. Currently, &gt;65% of patients with new onset CLAD will suffer a further 10% decline in FEV1 or death in the subsequent 12 months. Assuming a power of 80 % and a two-sided significance level of 5 %, with a 1:1 randomization, then to detect a 50% reduction in the expected 65% of patients meeting the endpoint, 41 patients are required in each of the MSC and placebo arms, giving a total of 82 patients in the study.
Logistical regression will be the statistical test used. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase 2 multi centre randomised study where consented Lung transplant patients that have met the criteria for new onset CLAD (and none of the exclusion criteria) will receive 4 doses of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)/placebo intravenous infusions over a period of 2 weeks.  Follow up review will be performed at weeks 3,6,10,14,28,41 and 54. 
It is hypothesied that MSC treatment will result in a progression free survival of patients with new-onset CLAD experiencing disease progression at 12 months.
