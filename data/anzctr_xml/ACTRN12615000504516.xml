  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will determine the feasibility of a second line combination chemotherapy of NAB-Paclitaxel and capecitabine for the treatment of advance biliary cancer.  

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have histologically proven unresectable biliary tract cancer and have had prior chemotherapy treatment with gemcitabine/platinum.

Study Details:
All participants will receive combination chemotherapy using NAB-Paclitaxel and Capecitabine for as long as their disease responds to treatment and will be followed up every 12 weeks (until death) after end of treatment with CT imaging, status and quality of life assessments in order to determine feasibility, clinical benefit, survival rates and impact of treatment on quality of life.  </summary>
