    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of sustained virological response among HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B patients who discontinue long-term NA therapy. The outcome is to be assessed by serum assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be closely followed for 2 years prospectively, at the following time points; 2 weeks post cessation, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 18 weeks, then from 6 months the visits will be 3 monthly out to two years, to observe for virological changes.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evaluation of the rate of sustained virological response among HBeAg-negativechronic
      hepatitis B patients who discontinue long-term NA therapy.

      During this study participants will cease their prescribed medications, this will occur with
      immediate effect once enrolled into the study. The duration of cessation will be indefinite,
      unless clinically indicated for NA therapy re-start. Participants will be monitored as per
      protocol following cessation, monitoring will be by clinic visit and through blood test to
      monitor virological response. Clinical visits will be at the intervals of week 2, week, 4,
      week 8, week 12, week 18, following this they will be every 3 months out to 2 years when the
      participant will have completed the trial. Once the participant has completed the trial they
      will not commence again, the aim is for an indefinite cessation of NA therapy.</summary>
