    <concealment>Participants will view http://www.swinburne.edu.au/lss/swinpsyche/etherapy/programs/wellbeing/ in response to advertising and they will find a link to register for the study. They first read an information statement and if they wish to take part they provide online consent. They will then be taken through the set of pre-program questionnaires. Randomisation will be computer generated, after participants have submitted the online consent form. When participants have completed the pre-program questionnaires they will be advised on their computer screen of which group they have been allocated to.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants in the intervention group receive the intervention after completing the pre-program assessment, which they can do at any time while the trial is open for recruitment. Participants in the waitlist control group receive the intervention group 3-weeks after completing the pre-program assessment. Therefore, participants will complete the program at different times over the course of the study depending on when they register</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the effectiveness of the online program, Living Well Feeling Well, for improving mental and physical health. The study is a randomised controlled trial with an intervention group and a waitlist control group. We are aiming to recruit 100 participants and to follow them up at 3 months. The Living Well Feeling Well program contains 5 sections designed to help people cope with challenging situations and enhance their mental and physical health. Participants are given 3 weeks to complete the program, which involves about 2 hours of reading material. Participants in the waitlist group are asked to wait 3 weeks before being offered the program. We predict that at post-intervention participants in the intervention group will report greater wellbeing and satisfaction with life, better coping with stress, and less psychological distress.</summary>
