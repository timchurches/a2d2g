    <studytitle>The High Flow Oxygen Therapy Study</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A pilot study to validate the use of high flow humidified oxygen therapy in a Cardiothoracic and Vascular Intensive Care Unit (CVICU), in patients requiring supplemental oxygen to treat hypoxia as assessed by arterial blood gas (PaO2).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive oxygen via a high flow humidified nasal interface. Once randomised, patients will remain on that mode of delivery until they are weaned/discontinued. Patients will be set to a target SpO2 of 95% and data from the patients' clinical charts recording arterial blood gas measurements, heart rate and respiratory rate will be taken at standard time points. 
Patient length of ICU stay from point of randomisation will be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised to receive oxygen either via a face mask as per standard care.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Arterial blood gas (PaO2 and PaCO2)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recorded at baseline, 30 minutes post-randomisation, 1 hour post, 2 hour post and 4 hours post.  After that arterial blood gas will be recorded as per hospital protocol.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes include heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured continuously whilst in the ICU/HDU.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Airway pressures whilst wearing the high flow humidified nasal interface will be measured via a hypopharyngeal catheter, in a subset of patients (n=15).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be recorded as soon as is practically possible once the patient is comfortable. It is anticipated this will be in the first 24 hours post randomisation for the majority of patients.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nasal prong oxygen therapy has several advantages over face mask oxygen such as: improved comfort and the ability to eat and talk while wearing the device. Warming and humidifying inspired gases means that high gas flows are able to be used. High gas flows delivered to the nose may mean that oxygen delivery is more efficient, however this has not been shown in cardiothoracic patients.
We intend to assess whether this new system means that patients are able to be transferred to the ward more quickly.</summary>
