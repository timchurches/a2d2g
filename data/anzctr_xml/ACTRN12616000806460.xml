  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Posterior lateral surgical approach (PLA)
PLA involves blunt dissection of the gluteus maximus, detachment of the external rotators and incision of the posterior part of the hip capsule. The hip is dislocated by internal rotation and flexion.
Arm 2: Anterior lateral surgical approach (ALA)
ALA involves detachment of the anterior one-third of the gluteus medius insertion and gluteus minimus insertion. Excision of the hip capsule is performed on the anterior side of the joint and the hip is dislocated by external rotation, adduction and flexion.
Arm 3: Direct anterior surgical approach (DAA)
DAA approaches the hip joint from the front of the joint, through a natural interval between the rectus femoris and gluteus medius muscles. There is no detachment of the gluteal muscles that attach to the posterior and lateral pelvis and femur.

Functional assessments and questionnaires on function and satisfaction will be completed at various timepoints up to 24 months post surgery.</interventions>

      <outcome>The performance and position of the prosthesis will be determined and monitored by assessing plain radiographs pre- and post-surgery at follow-up intervals. Measurements collected include:

Acetabular inclination

      <outcome>The CT protocol aims to provide specific information to investigators on the placement of participants prostheses, illustrating leg length, location of the hip joint centre, femoral off-set and acetabular cup position.

    <statisticalmethods>Previous studies suggest the value of EQ-5D in the arthroplasty setting pre- and post-operatively, indicating a sound basis for selection herein. The literature suggests a Cohens d of 0.3 (when converted to f = 0.15) for EQ-5D, demonstrating a small effect size when used in an orthopaedic setting. Convention suggests f effect size range of 0.1 small, 0.25 medium and 0.40 large. Therefore, we selected 0.15 for our sample size calculation. Thus for an effect size of f 0.15, a value of 0.05 and 1-beta power of 0.90, the total sample size calculated was 567. Assuming 10% drop-out or loss to follow-up, a total sample size n = 624 = 208 participants/group.
Given this is a longitudinal study, in order to investigate relationships over time for continuous outcomes from the PROMs and radiographic measures, a mixed model with repeated measures will be performed. Sub-group analyses of age, gender, and other surgery demographics will also be performed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hip replacement is a commonly performed procedure for the treatment of arthritic conditions of the hip joint and since 2003 the number of hip replacement procedures has significantly increased by 46.5% in Australia. The procedure is intended to relieve pain, restore function to the hip joint and ensure maximal longevity of the implant.

Different surgical approaches to hip replacement have been developed over many years with various levels of clinical support. However, anteriorly-based surgical approaches, which open the joint capsule from the front of the joint, have been increasingly used in recent times. 

The main aim of this study is to assess whether the surgical approach to hip replacement surgery impacts patient outcome. Three different surgical approaches will be assessed across a large patient sample, regardless of prosthesis type or surgeon. This will be assessed primarily by patient satisfaction with the surgery, following the collection of longitudinal functional (patient-reported outcomes), radiological data and gait analyses. 

The secondary aim of the study will be to define preoperative patient characteristics as predictors of outcome following different surgical approaches to THA. To illustrate any potential identifying criteria for future surgical approach selection. </summary>
