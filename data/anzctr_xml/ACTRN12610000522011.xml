    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study will be explained by the study investigator(s) verbally and with written information in the form of a participant information sheet provided in advance. Informed consent in written form will be obtained and the participant will be screened for eligibility. A randomisation sequence, determining the order in which the subjects receive the interventions, will be generated by a statistician. A third party, not directly involved with the study, will then file these sequences into 24 (24 = target subject number) sealed uniform opaque envelopes. Study investigators will have had no involvement with the generation of these envelopes. If eligible, subjects will be randomised to the order in which they receive their interventions as determined by one of the envelopes.

Note the above will occur for both the 24 participants recruited under tight exclusion criteria and the 24 participants recruited under fewer exclusion criteria.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random selection from a remotely generated set of uniform envelopes, each allocating the order in which to apply the interventions.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight individuals are at increased risk of a number of complications including obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). It has been shown that high concentration oxygen therapy increases arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) levels in patients with OHS.  We now seek to determine whether a similar response occurs in obese subjects, regardless of whether or not they have OHS.  This would be relevant to clinical practice as obese patients presenting to hospital with an acute medical condition may routinely given high flow oxygen therapy. This study aims to investigate whether the administration of high concentration oxygen leads to carbon dioxide retention in a group of obese hospital inpatients.</summary>

    <publicnotes>One of the transcutaneous TOSCA probes used in data collection for the first set of 24 participants was found to require re-surfacing when subsequently reviewed by the manufacturer. Another of the probes used during that time was advised not to be used further following ongoing difficulty with calibration. It is uncertain the extent to which the condition of these probes may have affected the accuracy of the data collected. The study was repeated, and only the data from the second set of 24 participants is to be analysed and submitted for peer reviewed publication.</publicnotes>
