  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventions are to be provided over a period of 3 years. Controlled Purchase Operations and visits to retailers to reduce sales of tobacco to minors will be repeated at 6 monthly intervals for the 3 years. Stop smoking quit attempts among parents, teachers and adults in the community will be prompted by invitations to make use of free quit coaching services and subsidised NRT products.  An educational DVD for parents about how to prevent their children from taking up smoking will be sent home with every student for free viewing at home.  Health promotion events at school for teachers, students and their families will be run once a year to inform parents about stopping smoking and other health services in their community, and to consolidate the relationship between parents, school and the research team.   A voluntary art competition for students will be run each year to engage students in thinking about smokefree messages and to generate artwork for promotion of the project within the community.  Feedback from each of the interventions will be sought in an evaluation sheet sent to parents at the end of each year.</interventions>
    <comparator>An active control consisting of a matched community and schools were also surveyed, but received no intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smoking prevalence among students at follow-up. Smoking prevalence will be assessed by NicAlert saliva testing of all consented students plus questionnaires completed by both students and parents.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up Year 2 will take place in November during term 4 after the intervention activities for that school year have been completed. Similarly follow-up Year 3 will take place in November during term 4 of Year 3.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived ease with which students can purchase tobacco.  This outcome will be assessed through a questionnaire administered to the students on a personal digital assistant device.  Students will be asked where and how often they access tobacco.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up Year 2 will take place at the end of year 2 after the intervention activities have been completed.  Follow-up Year 3 will take place at the end of year 3 after the intervention activities have been completed.</timepoint>

    <summary>Keeping Kids Smokefree aims to reduce smoking uptake among pre-adolescents living in an urban lower socioeconomic community in South Auckland, New Zealand. Keeping Kids Smokefree works with parents and teachers to encourage them to stop smoking, have smokefree homes and cars so they can reduce the chance their children will take up smoking. Local retailers who sell tobacco are visited and checks are done to ensure they do not sell cigarettes to minors.</summary>
