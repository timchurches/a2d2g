             time of first vaccination

          -  Written informed consent by the subject's legal representative(s), according to local
             requirements, and written informed assent of the subject, if applicable

          -  Female subjects: either no childbearing potential or negative pregnancy test. For
             females after menarche willingness to practice a reliable method of contraception.

          -  The subject is planning to travel to an area where JE is endemic after completion of
             the vaccination schedule. Exposure to JE should be avoided until 1 week after the
             second IC51 dose and subjects should return from travel to JE endemic areas before the
             Month 7 visit. The planned travel to JE endemic areas should not interfere with the
             study visits and can take place between Visit 2 + 7 days to Month 7.</inclusivecriteria>
