    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive improvement, based on (a) standardized neuropsychological tests covering the domains of "executive function, attention and working memory, visuospatial function, language, and episodic memory; (b) the ADAS-Cog and DRS-2 (c) experimental tasks (Attention Network Test, Ambiguous Patterns, and Structural Learning); and (d) autobiographical and Dodson source memory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Baseline, 8-9 weeks, 17-18 weeks and 6 months for (a) a restricted set of the neuropsychological tests (story memory, Stroop, and Symbol Digit Modalities Test) , (c) experimental tasks (Attention Network Test, Ambiguous Patterns, and Structural Learning) and (d) source memory.
2. Baseline vs 6 months for (a) standardized neuropsychological tests covering the domains of "executive function, attention and working memory, visuospatial function, language, and episodic memory; (b) the ADAS-Cog and DRS-2; and (d) autobiographical memory (autobiographical memory interview at baseline, then more detailed Test Episodique du Memoire du Passe Autobiographique at 6 months).</timepoint>

    <concealment>Central randomization by computer.  Participant ID used in randomized allocation. Inclusion in the trial made prior to randomization. Based on an earlier screen of 550 volunteers, baseline neuropsychological testing will identify 40 individuals meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment. These will be advised that they will receive cognitive enrichment or be wait-listed to receive cognitive enrichment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cognitive training has been used to improve mental functions in people with early dementia and those with mild cognitive impairment, who are at risk of future dementia. This is potentially the first study however, to examine systematically varied cognitive training aimed at enhancing the functions of a brain system, called the default mode system, which malfunctions in people progressing to dementia. We anticipate that people given our cognitive enrichment will show benefits in the structure and function of this brain system, in addition to improved mental functions.</summary>
