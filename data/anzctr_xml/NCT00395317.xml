             Screening. In addition, subjects experiencing a relapse between Screen and Visit 3
             will not be eligible to be randomized.

          -  A minimum of five T2 lesions on brain MRI at Visit 2 as determined by the central MRI

               -  are post-menopausal, defined as at least one year without menses in the absence

                  prior to Screening and should continue to use the same contraceptive method
                  throughout the study until at least 3 days after the last dose of investigational

               -  Spermicide in conjunction with either a diaphragm, cervical cap or condom. Male
                  partner sterilization (vasectomy) prior to female subject's entry into the study

          -  In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either

             non-systemic steroids are being used for other chronic inflammatory conditions,
             subjects may be included at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with
             the GSK medical monitor

          -  Use of an b-interferon product, glatiramer acetate or azathioprine within 3 months of

             immunoglobulin (IVIg), cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis, or any other
             immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment) in the past may be included on a case
             by case basis after discussion with the GSK medical monitor. None of these treatments
             will be allowed during this study

          -  Previous exposure to alemtuzumab, natalizumab or firategrast administration, bone

             alcohol abuse within the last 6 months prior to Screening

          -  Use of an investigational drug for condition other than MS within 30 days or five
             half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding Screening. Prior use of an investigational

          -  Any concurrent illness, disability or clinically significant abnormality (including
             laboratory tests) that may affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy or safety
             data or prevent the subject from safely completing the assessments required by the
             protocol</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>SB-683699 is an oral medication that is thought to reduce the number of active white blood
      cells entering the brain; these white blood cells are part of the disease process for MS.
      This study will look at whether different doses of SB-683699 are effective and safe in
      patients with relapsing remitting MS.</summary>
