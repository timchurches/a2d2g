    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed to determine differences in the primary outcome (renal function)  between the two groups and over time, using a conservative F-test for the interaction between time and treatment. Death, a binary outcome, will be analysed using the chi-square test with frequencies and percentages per treatment arm and odds-ratios or other measures of treatment effect reported along as summary measures. The Greenhouse-Geisser correction for the F-test will be used to adjust the degrees of freedom for deviation from sphericity. Logarithmic transformation of the data will be performed where appropriate. A post hoc correlation analysis by the Spearman rank-correlation method will be performed to evaluate the relationship between the changes in renal function from baseline to three, twelve and twenty four months following periodontal therapy. Effect sizes will be calculated by dividing the mean of change scores by the pooled estimate of the standard deviation. Effect measures will also be presented through calculation of number-needed-to-treat and its associated 95% confidence interval. The statistically significant level will be at P&lt;0.05.

Based on a recent study of Australian Aboriginal adults with periodontal disease, it was estimated that a sample size of 472 would be necessary to detect a 4% difference in cIMT (from 0.82 to 0.79 mm) at the significance criterion of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Allowing for 20% attrition, 592 participants would be necessary at base-line, rounded to 600 for convenience. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine if comprehensive periodontal treatment reduces progression of kidney disease among Aboriginal Australians living in Central Australia with kidney disease. The study hypothesis is that periodontal treatment will reduce progression of kidney disease. Kidney disease is a growing public health concern in Australia, especially among Aboriginal populations. Kidney disease consumes disproportionate healthcare resources and is the most common cause of hospitalisation among Aboriginal Australians. In spite of the unacceptably high social, medical and financial burden caused by kidney disease, there have been few RCTs that explore the impact of treatment to address key risk factors, such as periodontal disease, on, kidney disease progression . As a consequence, the management armamentarium currently available to slow the kidney disease progression  is extremely limited and only partially effective.</summary>
