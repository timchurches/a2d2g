  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fecal Immunochemical Tests (FIT) will be mailed to participants. An implementation plan will be included for the 3 intervention groups.  The implementation plans provided serve as 'cues to action' to provide a plan for goal achievement. Two intervention groups will receive an implementation plan that asks participants to think about, for example, how they will remember to do the test and to write down how they will remind themselves. One group will send a copy of this plan back to CSIRO, the other group will retain the plan. The 'prescriptive' implementation plan will 'tell' participants how to act, eg "place a reminder in a prominent place so that you do not forget to use the kit".

Intervention 1: FIT kit + implementation plan to complete and retain. Receipt of completed kit by Bowel Health Service (BHS) within 35 days
Intervention 2: FIT kit + implementation plan to complete and return to CSIRO. Receipt of completed kit by Bowel Health Service (BHS) within 35 days
Intervention 3: FIT kit + prescriptive implementation plan to complete and return to CSIRO. Receipt of completed kit by Bowel Health Service (BHS) within 35 days</interventions>

    <concealment>Allocation to intervention was performed by central randomisation by computer prior to the participant being approached.

    <sequence>The sample was stratified by gender. Thereafter, simple randomisation by using a randomisation table created by a computer software (i.e., computerised sequence generation) was used for allocation to intervention group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to investigate the role of cues to actions in motivating participation in screening for colorecetal cancer (CRC) using the faecal occult blood test (FOBT). Specifically, the focus in this study is upon the effect of 'implementation intentions', a practical concept which attempts to move individuals from a generalised intention to undertake screening to the formulation of a plan which deliberately deals with the concrete details necessary for actually carrying out the screening behaviour. It is hypothesised that those who draw up a plan of how they will go about completing the FOBT are more likely to return a completed kit compared to those who do not draw up a plan. The project fits in with the broader aim of attempting to understand the factors that motivate people to participate in CRC screening, and serves as a fundamental basis for tailoring consumer information designed to increase participation in CRC screening technologies.</summary>
