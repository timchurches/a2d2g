             absence of an LVEF measurement in a patient without a previous or current diagnosis of
             heart failure does not prohibit entry into the study.

             use of oral contraceptives or levonorgestrel; or a reliable barrier method of birth

          -  A total bilirubin that is &gt; ULN by local laboratory at screening, Visit 1

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5
             years of Visit 1 whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases,
             with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  History or evidence of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months of Visit 1.

          -  Current dependence on nicotine containing products.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, may place
             the patient at higher risk from his/her participation in the study, or is likely to
             prevent the patient from complying with the requirements of the study or completing
             the study.

          -  Use of any HIV and/or chemotherapy drugs, and/or antibiotics within 30 days or 5

             protocol.
