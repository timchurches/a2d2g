  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single centre, open-label, single application study in a total of 12 healthy participants.  

Eligible participants will receive a single application (3 day, 72 hour application time) of a transdermal oxymorphone patch (containing 19.2 mg oxymorphone) with a subsequent 4 day washout period.  The total duration of the intervention is 7 days.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of oxymorphone delivered transdermally using the oxymorphone patch, assessed through collection of blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic profile will be assessed through collection of blood samples at various time points. On Day 1 there will be an intensive blood sampling period in which samples will be collected every 1-2hrs and for the duration of the in-house period sample will be collected every 4-8hrs. A total of 43 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety/tolerability of oxymorphone delivered transdermally from the oxymorphone patch.

Safety/tolerability will be assessed by:
* The frequency of Adverse Events 
* The frequency of skin irritation at site 
* Clinically important changes in  Vital signs from baseline 
* Clinically important changes in  ECG measurements from baseline 
* Clinically laboratory tests and assessments </outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety/tolerability will be assessed by:
* The frequency of Adverse Events measured daily throughout the duration of the stuy
* The frequency of skin irritation measured after removal of the patch 
* Clinically important changes in  Vital signs from baseline, measured 4 hourly throughout the in-house period 
* Clinically important changes in  ECG measurements from baseline, measured 6 - 12 hourly throughout the in-house period  
* Clinically laboratory tests and assessments measured at baseline, day 4, discharge and f/up</timepoint>
