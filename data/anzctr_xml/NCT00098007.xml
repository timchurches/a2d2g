        Abnormal physical or laboratory findings of clinical significance within 2 weeks prior to
        study entry which would interfere with the objectives of the study.

        Inability to cooperate or communicate with the investigator. Female of childbearing
        potential to who are planning to become pregnant, who are pregnant and/or lactating, who

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is designed to evaluate whether Neoral dose optimization together with a
      therapeutic drug monitoring of Certican will prevent renal dysfunction as observed in the
      pivotal cardiac trial while maintaining the efficacy.

      This objective will be assessed by comparing renal function post-transplant between 2 groups
      of patients.</summary>
