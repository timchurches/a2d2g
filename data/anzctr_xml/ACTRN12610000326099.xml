</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nasopharyngel swabs will be taken from participants at enrolment and then 48 hours later (or as close to discharge as possible).

Nasopharyngel swabs will be batched and sent to the Queenslan'ds Paediatric Infectious Diseases lab throughout the trial. Batches will be sent at convenient times for this laboratory. One final batch will be sent for processing once the final child has been recruited. Laboratory staff remain blinded to participants treatment groups until after unblinding once analysis complete.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a previous study on bronchiolitis in Aboriginal children we found that 67% were from remote communties and required retrievals. A recent study has also shown that almost 2.5% of Aboriginal children in Australia's Northern Territory will be hospitalised for bronchiolitis more than once before reaching the age of 18 months. Multiple hospitalised respiratory infections and the severity of these infections are risk factors for developing chronic lung diseases including bronchiectisis and asthma. It is planned that this study will provide an estimation of the effect of azithromycin on the severity of bronchiolitis in Aboriginal and non Aboriginal infants. Assessing redmission for respiratory illness within 6 months may provide some indication of the medium term benefit of three doses of azithromycin, given to infants in the acute phase of viral bronchiolitis, in reducing the risk of further respiratory illness requiring hospitalisation.</summary>
