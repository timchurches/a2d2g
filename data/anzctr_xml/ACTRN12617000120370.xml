  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be tested 3 times (at first visit, after 1 month at second visit and after 2 month at third visit) using EEG (32 channels), MMSE, SF-36 test   and stabilometric platform (modified sensory organisation test and Posturography). The study group also between the second and third visit will undergo physiotherapy oriented imbalance (3 times a week during 1 month, each session 30 min.) by a qualified physiotherapist on stabilometric platform. Patients will train postural stability 15 minutes on hard surfaces and 15 minutes on foam with eyes closed and open. Patients will maintain the position of the equally load on both lower limbs. The therapy will be conducted face to face, individually on the balance platform located in the John Paul II Hospital in Krakow on the neurological department. The patient on the stabilometric platform will be coached postural stability on hard or soft ground, eyes closed or open, depending on the results obtained in the study during the second visitl clinic during the visit. In addition, during the visit it will be executed test MMS verifying patients with cognitive dysfunctions. Research on the stabilometric platform will be made with the use of medical equipment available on the neurological department in hospital </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will be tested 3 times every month. Patients between first and second visit  are without intervention (just normal daily living activities). Results from this period will be the control group for the results after intervention. Patients between the second and third examination will undergo physiotherapy. The patients results after month without intervention will provide a control group for phsyiotherapy.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Summation:
- As a result of seizures reported to affect the functioning of the central nervous system, which is responsible for maintaining balance. One of the functional components of locomotion is a balance which affects the movement of patients and thereby quality of life
- There are no standards of conduct in physiotherapy patients with idiopathic epilepsy
- Pilot study is the first step in the preparation of the December call for the application to the National Science Centre</summary>
