  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Galvus (vildagliptin) 50 mg (oral, single dose only) + intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline (for 210 minutes)
Arm 2: Placebo (oral, single dose only) + intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline (for 210 minutes)
Arm 3: Galvus (50 mg) (oral, single dose only) + exendin(9-39) (a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist, administered at a dose of 900 pmol/kg/min for 210 min)

Adherance will be monitored by the investigators who will administer the drugs in the laboratory. Plasma concentrations of GLP-1 will determine drug efficacy. 

This is a cross-over study, each visit will be separated by at least 7 days.

On each day, participants will receive an intraduodenal infusion of fat (Intralipid, 2 kcal/min for 120 min, administered 60 min after ingestion of vildagliptin/placebo and commencement of i.v. infusion of exendin9-39/saline). </interventions>

Post-hoc paired comparisons, corrected for multiple comparisons, will be performed if ANOVAs reveal significant effects.  Statistical significance will be accepted at P&lt;0.05.  

Power calculations, performed by our biostatistician, determined that the inclusion of 16 participants would enable the detection of a 75 kcal/day difference in the effect of ID fat on resting energy expenditure between treatments (assuming SD of differences is equal to or less than 76). Significance was set at P = 0.008 to enable correction for multiple post-hoc testing and power of 80%. 20 participants will be included to give a power of 90%. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When we ingest a meal a number of hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), are released from the small intestine.  These hormones play an important role in regulating the motor function of the gut, blood pressure, the levels of sugar and fat in the blood, and the rate at which the body uses energy.  The effect of these hormones is, however, limited by the fact that they undergo rapid degradation by an enzyme in the blood.  There is a new class of type 2 diabetic drugs that act by inhibiting this enzyme, and as a result, these drugs improve blood glucose levels.  We have recently shown that these drugs (e.g. vildagliptin) also enhance metabolic rate (an effect that may prevent weight gain) and decrease levels of triglycerides in the blood in healthy volunteers. This study aims to determine if these drugs have the same effects during fat infusion in patients with type 2 diabetes, and to determine the specific role of the gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in mediating these responses.</summary>
