      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) With Imputed Values to 12 Months Post Randomization - All Randomized Participants (Intent-to-Treat Population) - Calculated GFR assessment used the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula. GFR was measured as mL/min/1.73 m^2. For death or graft loss participants, calculated GFR (cGFR) value 10 was used, for other participants who had a post baseline cGFR value missing, but had baseline value and at least 2 post baseline values available, which were at least 120 days apart, linear regression model was used to impute the cGFR value. Baseline = value at screening. Randomization/First Dose was on Day 1.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in SF-36 Questionnaire Physical Component Score and in Mental Component Score at Month 12 - All Randomized Participants - SF-36 was a Participant-Reported Quality of Life (QoL) Short Form (SF) questionnaire. The subscale in the mental component (MCS) part of the instrument ranged from 1 to 6 with 1=all of the time and 6= none of the time. The subscale for physical component (PCS) ranged from 1 to 3 with 1=Yes, limited a lot and 3=No, not limited at all. The subscale for the extent that physical health or emotional problems interfered with normal activities ranged from 1 to 5 with 1=not at all and 5= extremely. Baseline was at randomization or prior to first dose. Baseline = value at screening. The subscale scores were transformed using norm-based methods that standardized the scores to a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general population. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline to Month 12 for Eight Domain Scores of Quality of Life (QoL) Instrument SF-36 - All Randomized Participants - SF-36 was a Participant-Reported Quality of Life (QoL) Short Form (SF) questionnaire measuring health-related quality of life (HRQL) covering 8 domains of physical and mental component summaries: physical function, role limitations due to physical problems, pain, general health perception, and vitality, social function, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health.
All domains were scored using norm-based methods that standardized the scores to a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general population. The scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ridit Score at Month 12 - All Randomized Participants - The Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale (MTSOSD-59R) was used to assess the occurrence (never, occasionally, regularly, almost always, always) and distress (0=no distress to 4=terrible distress) of symptoms associated with immunosuppressive therapies. Ridit (relative to an identified distribution) analysis (Fleiss JL. Statistical methods for rates and proportions. New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1991) was used. Ridit scores were calculated at 12 months for overall symptom occurrence score and overall symptom distress. The Ridit score reflects the probability that a score observed for an individual randomly selected from a group would be higher (worse symptom) than a score observed for a randomly selected individual from the reference group. The reference group was constituted by the frequency distribution of the responses of all participants on all items at baseline. The ridit of the reference group is by definition, 0.5.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants Meeting Marked Laboratory Abnormality Criteria From Baseline up to Month 12 - Randomized and Treated Participants - Upper limits of normal (ULL). Leukocytes: &lt; 2.0*10^3 cells per microliter (c/ÂµL); Lymphocytes (absolute): &lt; 0.5*10^3 c/ÂµL; bilirubin: &gt; 3.0*ULN milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL); Potassium: &lt; 3.0 milliequivalents per liter (meq/L) or &gt; 6.0 meq/L; Magnesium &gt;2.6 meq/L; Sodium: &lt; 130 meq/L; Phosphorus: &lt; 2.0 mg/dL; Uric Acid: &gt; 10 mg/dL.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Long Term Period: Mean Change From Baseline to 54 Months Post Randomization in Calculated GFR on Imputed Values at Specified Timepoints - Intent to Treat (ITT) Participants Who Entered LT Period - ITT=participants randomized to their original treatment arm and who entered the LT period are presented. Baseline=value at screening. Calculated GFR assessment used the MDRD formula. GFR was measured as mL/min/1.73 m^2. For death or graft loss participants, calculated GFR (cGFR) value of 0 was imputed and carried forward after death or graft loss up to the end of the analysis period. Sponsor discontinued the CNI treatment arm in Year 3, and participants treated with CNI could elect to switch to belatacept. If a participant did not switch to belatacept, they were required to discontinue from the study. Therefore, efficacy results from Month 36 through Month 54 are difficult to interpret. No formal comparisons were planned between the belatacept and CNI treatment groups post Month 36, and the data up to the final database lock should be interpreted with caution.</outcome>

      <outcome>Long Term Period: Number of Participants With Acute Rejection (AR) - All Randomized Participants in LT Period - AR was defined: if either a or b was satisfied: (a) the reason for clinical suspicion was reported to be an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine; or an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness and the episode was a case of biopsy proven AR (AR of Banff histopathologic classification grade IA or higher as assessed by the blinded central pathologist); (b) the reason for clinical suspicion was reported to be something other than: an unexplained rise of serum creatinine = 25% from baseline creatinine; or an unexplained decreased urine output; or fever and graft tenderness; the episode was a case of biopsy proven AR, and the participant was treated for this episode. Banff 97 working classification of kidney transplant pathology was used to categorize the severity of the AR.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Long Term Period: Number of Participants Who Survived With a Functioning Graft or Survived With Pure Graft Loss or Death With Functioning Graft - ITT Participants Who Entered the LT Period - Graft loss = either pure graft loss (participant survived to the end of the study period after graft loss) or death with functioning graft. Pure graft loss = either functional loss or physical loss. Functional loss = a sustained level of serum creatinine (SCr) = 6.0 mg/dL (530 Âµmol/L) for = 4 weeks or administration of a maintenance dialysis regimen for at least 56 days or impairment of renal function to such a degree that the participant undergoes re-transplantation. The table was designed with built-in redundancy to capture all possible combinations of death and/or graft loss, but not all lines can be summed to reach the total number surviving and the total number who die and/or lose grafts. If a participant experiences pure graft loss and dies at a later date independent of the graft loss event, they are counted only once in the cumulative tabulation of death or graft loss. Only the first event experienced by the participant counted toward the cumulative total.</outcome>
