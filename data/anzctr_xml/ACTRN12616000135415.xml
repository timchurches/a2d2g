    <interventions>Health education.
Participants will be invited to watch the three module intervention in their home accessing the web link by a password protected code, or CD ROM over three weeks. The hardware required to use the education intervention will be by internet access, or for those using CD ROM a television or DVD player. Users will be able to pace their learning with back, next, end, replay, pause and play buttons. The duration of teaching module will be 30 minutes. Participants are able to access the intervention as often as they wish.
The content of the intervention will comprise of three modules and include materials and resources to inform the consumer about  where to identify and obtain reliable information and credible sources of information about complementary medicines (CM), appraisal of health information, ability to find good information, and navigating the CM healthcare system. Information will be presented online using an education delivery package, and a video with a voice over.
Participants will be invited to read the three modules. One module involves interactive completion of questions using a multiple choice format.
Data will be collected from the web based intervention that document the length of time the web resource was used, and the number of times accessed.
</interventions>
    <comparator>An information booklet containing the same information as the web/CD ROM package but presented using only text will be compiled. The text will be set at 18 point Arial typeface and is written at a 6th grade reading level. We will encourage each module is completed over a one week period, in total three weeks will be allocated to the intervention.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>An intention to treat approach will compare differences in the primary and secondary endpoints between groups.  Chi square and repeated analysis of variance will be used to identify differences between groups for categorical and continuous variables respectively.

A sample size of 168 subjects, 84 per group is needed for this trial. The sample size effect is based on published data. It was estimated that a moderate effect size would be obtained (ie Cohen eta=0.5) responsive to change in the decision making before and after the intervention. With alpha set at 0.05, and power at 0.8 (80% chance that the expected effect size would be significant), a minimum sample size of 70 per group would be required.  Allowing for a 20% loss, we will recruit 168 subjects to the trial (84 per group).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older Australians are high consumers of complementary medicines (CMs) such as nutritional supplements (minerals and vitamins) and herbal medicines. CM may offer a way for older people to cope with their ill health, to engage in maintaining their health, and to improve their quality of life. National policy states consumers are responsible for: asking for and utilising information, to make decisions and take actions that enable medicines to be chosen and used wisely, being aware of the risks and benefits of medicines, developing skills and confidence to use medicines appropriately, and seeking help to solve problems when they arise. Our study identified older Australians had difficulties navigating the health care system to discuss and use CM; finding good CM information, and appraising this information. Our findings highlight the potential for older vulnerable people to be misinformed and to make inappropriate self-care decisions. To facilitate older Australians to take an active role in their health, we will develop and evaluate a novel educational intervention based on our preliminary research to support self-advice, good decision making, and improve health literacy skills. One hundred and sixty residents  in Western Sydney, NSW will be invited to participate in a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of an education intervention to increase their decision making regarding CM and self-care, health literacy and their ability to actively engage and navigate the health care systems. </summary>
