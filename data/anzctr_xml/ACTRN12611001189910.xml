  <interventions>
    <interventions>Insertion of SLIPA
Insertion technique is based on manufacturer's recommendation.
To insert the device, the mouth is opened and the toe of the SLIPA is put into the mouth and advanced towards the posterior pharyngeal arch. At this stage, a 'jaw thrust' is applied by left hand and SLIPA is advanced caudally until the SLIPA slip into correct position.
Insertion may takes about 30 second and SLIPA may be used during the operation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Insertion of LMA-P Insertion technique is based on manufacturer's recommendation. To insert the device, the mouth is opened and the toe of the LMA-P is put into the mouth and advanced towards the posterior pharyngeal arch. At this stage, a 'jaw thrust' is applied by left hand and LMA-P is advanced caudally until the LMA-P slip into correct position. Insertion may takes about 30 second and LMA-P may be used during the operation. As the SLIPA and LMA-P are the types of supralaryngeal airway, the technique to insert LMA-P and SLIPA is overally the same.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Degree of gastric distension
The surgeon, who did not know which devices were used, scored gastric distension score by direct visualizing laparoscope using visual analogue scale was from 0 to 10 (0 = empty stomach, 10 = distension that interfered with surgical exposure)</outcome>
      <timepoint>after creation of pneumoperitoneum, and at the end of surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Respiratory mechanics
Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), plateau pressure(Ppla), inspiratory tidal volume(VT), expiratory VT, static respiratory system compliance(Cst,rs), inspiratory resistance(RI, rs) will be measured using spirometry module (S/5TM Compact anaesthesia monitor; Datex-Ohmeda, Tewksbury, MA, USA). All manipulations of the patients will be halted during the measurement, and respiratory mechanics variables will be measured in triplicate and averaged for each measurement, such that each measured data will be used as a single observation and contribute only once to each overall data set.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after insertion and after pneumoperitoneum</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>severity of sore throat
30 min after arrival in the recovery room, patients will be asked by the independent investigator to score throat pain on an eleven-point visual analogue scale(0-10)</outcome>
      <timepoint>after operation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>anatomical fit
Anatomical fit will be checked using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-3C40, Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and this was graded by consent of second anesthesiologist. 
The fiberoptic view at the deflection bulb of the SLIPA and distal end of airway tube of LMA-P will be assessed by 3 factor: epiglottis (0 = not visible, 1 = posterior aspect of epiglottis seen, 2 = only tip or partial epiglottis seen, 3 = anterior or nearly total epiglottis seen), anterior and posterior aspect of vocal cord (0 = not visible, 1 = visible).</outcome>
      <timepoint>after insertion of SLIPA or LMA-P</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Streamlined linear of the pharryngeal airway(SLIPA) is a new type of supralaryngeal airway(SLA), use of which has increased because it is inexpensive, disposable and easy to insert.
Although other SLA(eg, laryngeal mask airway(LMA), laryngeal tube) have been used safely in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, there are few reports compare the characteristics of the SLIPA or proseal LMA(LMA-P) when used in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
The aim of this study is to compare the quantitative clinical performances of the SLIPA with the LMA-P with regard to the incidence of gastric insufflations when used in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</summary>
