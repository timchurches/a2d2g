  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in platelet content of the pro-inflammatory protein thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP). This would be assessed via immunohistochemical assay (Sverdlov et al, Int J of Cardiol. 2013; 168: 4624-4630). </outcome>
      <timepoint>two weeks after perhexiline therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparisons of extent of perhexiline effects with:
(1) Presence or absence of concomitant therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, using analysis of variance. 
(2) Plasma perhexiline concentrations. Correlations will be performed between plasma perhexiline concentrations and the extent of effects. </outcome>

      <timepoint>two weeks after perhexiline therapy</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma thrombospondin-1 concentrations (R&amp;D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, Minn). </outcome>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Diabetic or pre-diabetic patients who are clinically indicated for perhexiline therapy will be recruited: blood samples will be obtained at baseline and two weeks after perhexiline therapy. </concealment>
    <sequence>No randomisation </sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Single group</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Analysis will be done comparing the effects before and after perhexiline; subgroup analysis will be performed to assess the effects of perhexiline in patients who have never receive ACE-inhibitor/ Angiotensin II receptor blocker</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacodynamics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation is based on Sverdlov et al 2013 Int J Cardiol. In the previous study, 2-week of ramipril treatment reduces TXNIP from 286 +/- 20 (SEM) to 175 +/- 20 (SEM) in 15 patients. Therefore, in order to detect 25% change, n=30 will provide ~76% power  at 0.5 SD. 
Results will be compared by paired t-test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Perhexiline is medication known to improve the efficiency of energy used by the heart. It works by reducing fatty acid and thereby improving glucose utilisation by the heart. The hypothesis of the current study is that perhexiline administration reduces pro-inflammatory markers, and improves insulin sensitivity. Analysis will be performed before and after perhexiline therapy in the diabetic patients, and further analysis will be performed to evaluate the extent of changes in the presence or absence of a type of commonly used heart medication in the diabetics (ACE-inhibitors). </summary>
