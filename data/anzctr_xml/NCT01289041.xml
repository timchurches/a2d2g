  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) According to PI3K Activation Pathway Status - BOR was determined based on investigator assessment of overall lesion response using RECIST criteria guidelines.
BOR = objective responses rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) or clinical benefit rate (CBR). ORR = (complete response (CR) or partial response(PR); DCR = (CR or PR or Stable disease (SD); CBR = (CR or PR od SD &gt;= 24 weeks)</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) According to PI3K Activation Pathway Status - PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS will be censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) According to PI3K Activation Pathway Status - Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival was censored at the last date of contact. OS was to be reported at extension and after 3-year follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier median was used to analyze the OS.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective multi-center, open-label, single arm, Phase II study to investigate the
      safety and efficacy of BKM120 in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma whose disease
      progressed on or after a first-line antineoplastic treatment. Patients will receive BKM120
      orally at a dose of 100 mg/day. Availability of tumor specimen (either archival tissue or a
      fixed fresh biopsy) is mandatory for assessment of the PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase
      (PI3K) pathway activation status.</summary>
