A positive stool test for Clostridium difficile (by toxin EIA and/or PCR, depending on the laboratory protocol of the study site) will also be recorded. This endpoint is important since one of the purposes of establishing an alternative to carbapenem therapy is to reduce infections with multi-drug resistant organisms and assess the comparative risk of C. difficile. </outcome>

This will be determined in accordance with laboratory methods and susceptibility breakpoints defined by EUCAST standards (www. eucast.org).    Resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime or cefotaxime would not preclude inclusion provided the isolate remained susceptible to both trial agents.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients will have an initial screening visit which will include a clinical record review, discussion with the treating team and brief patient interview to determine suitability for inclusion.  The patient will then have the study explained to them and be offered an opportunity to be recruited &amp; consent. Patients will then be randomly assigned to either meropenem or piperacillin-tazobactam in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomisation list prepared in advance.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random sequence will be generated using random permuted blocks of unequal length. The randomisation process will be overseen by the Queensland Clinical Trials &amp; Biostatistics Centre (QCTBC) of The University of Queensland, and will be facilitated by an online module within the REDCap data management system.  

Treatment blinding will not be performed given the different dosing regimens of the two agents. Although clinical and vital sign parameters will be recorded by the study team, assessment of the primary and secondary end-points will be performed by an independent assessor, blinded to the treatment allocations.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infections of the blood are extremely serious and require intravenous antibiotic treatment. When the infection results from antibiotic resistant bacteria, the choice of antibiotic is an extremely important decision. Some types of bacteria produce enzymes that may inactivate essential antibiotics, related to penicillin, called 'beta-lactams'.  Furthermore high level production of these enzymes can occur during therapy and lead to clinical failure, even when an antibiotic appears effective by laboratory testing. However, this risk of this occurring in clinical practice has only been well described in a limited range of antibiotic classes in a type of bacteria called Enterobacter.  There is currently uncertainty as to whether a commonly used, and highly effective antibiotic, called piperacillin-tazobactam is subject to the same risk of resistance developing while on treatment. Infections caused by Enterobacter (and other bacteria with similar resistance mechanisms) are often treated with an alternative drug called meropenem (a carbapenem antibiotic), which is effective but has an extremely broad-spectrum of activity.  Excessive use of carbapenems is driving further resistance to this antibiotic class - which represent our 'last-line' of antibiotic defence. As such, we need studies to help us see whether alternatives to meropenem are an effective and safe choice. No study has ever directly tested whether these two antibiotics have the same effectiveness for this type of infection. The purpose of this study is to randomly assign patients with blood infection caused by Enterobacter or related bacteria to either meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam in order to test whether these antibiotics have similar effectiveness.</summary>
