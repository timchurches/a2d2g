  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a multi-centre randomised (allocation concealed) trial of the effects of two surgical interventions in the management of Otitis Media with effusion (OME) / recurrent Acute Otitis Media (rAOM) with the primary outcome determined by a blinded assessor. 

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and non-Indigenous children from the same communities, between the ages of 3-10 years of age will be randomized into 3 groups according to age, sex, and desert or tropical dweller: 
1. adenoidectomy with ventilation tubes (VTA) 
2. adenoidectomy with myringotomy (MA)
3. medical treatment as clinically indicated

All 3 treatments are currently acceptable for this condition. The study will test whether there is an advantage of VTA or MA over medical therapy in controlling OME/rAOM.  

Only children who have been referred to ENT clinics for treatment of chronic OM will be eligible for recruitment.  The children will be treated using one of these 3 interventions whether they participate in the trial or not.  The difference will be the choice of treatment by the surgeon (non-participants) or by computer allocation (participants).

The surgical interventions may take up to 30 minutes per child. The surgery will occur once per child only.   Children allocated to the medical intervention may be given surgical treatment after 12 months if deemed necessary by the ENT specialist.

TREATMENT PROTOCOLS
Adenoidectomy will be performed under direct vision utilizing a suction diathermy or curette technique followed by five days of the oral antibiotic, amoxycillin (or cotrimoxazole if allergic to penicillin) to reduce the risk of postoperative infection, bleeding and halitosis.  Adenoidal tissue will be biopsied for culture and histopathological analysis. 

Ventilation tube insertion will be of a standardized tube (Shephards) in the anterior inferior segment of the tympanic membrane after aspiration of the middle ear fluid. All children having ventilation tubes will be prescribed post-operative Ciprofloxacin ear drops (Ciloxan / registered trademark) with three drops three times a day for three days to reduce post operative otorrhoea and blockage of the tube.

Myringotomy alone will be a small radial incision to the anterior inferior segment of the tympanic membrane with suction of middle ear fluid. 

The parents/carers will be counselled to seek medical attention if there are signs of secondary haemorrhage from the adenoid region. Paracetamol or similar analgesia (rather than non-steroidal medications) will be prescribed post operatively.

Children allocated to the medical control arm will have already failed standard medical care.  These children will receive additional specialist attention.  This will include advice (written and verbal information with an interpreter if required) about the management of hearing and effective communication strategies and further antibiotic treatment (if appropriate).  Referral to audiological services will ensure that children with more significant conductive hearing loss receive appropriate hearing support in the 12 months after randomisation.  

All children will be followed up with monthly phone calls to the Community Health Worker who will determine and report the presence or absence of aural discharge.
All children will be followed up by the study staff visiting them in the  community for full audiometric / tympanometry / video-otoscopy assessment at 12 months post op.</interventions>
    <comparator>Medical treatment will be determined after randomisation at the discretion of the ENT surgeon. It will comprise antibiotic therapy and monthly review (by phone call to local health worker). 
All children in the trial will be followed up 12 months post intervention.
For those in the medical group surgery may still be required at the discretion of the treating ENT specialist at that time.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>a reduction in the prevalence of Otitis Media with effusion (OME) / recurrent Acute Otitis Media (rAOM)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Audiometry, tympanometry, video-otoscopy data will be collected at randomisation and 12 months later to determine improvement in total ear health.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of hearing impairment,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Audiometry &amp; tympanometry at randomisation and 12 months post intervention.

An improvement in the rate of hearing loss is defined as an improvement of 10 dB or more, over, at least two frequencies.  
The study will provide estimates of the rate of hearing loss in each group.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of aural discharge,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Aural &amp; nasal swabs will be collected at randomisation &amp; 12 months from all participants. 
Adenoid tissue &amp; middle ear fluid (if present) will be collected from those in the 2 surgical groups during surgery. 

Monthly review of the presence of aural discharge will be reported by the Community Health Worker.

 Standard methods will be used for culturing, quantification of bacterial load and sensitivity testing of respiratory pathogens (Steptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis).  

For ear discharge specimens, we will also use standard methods for identifying common chronic suppurative otitis media pathogens.    The analysis of microbiological outcomes will be descriptive. 

We will determine the effect of adenoidectomy on nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage, by quantitative assessment through colony counts and real-time quantitative PCR21 and culture of the main pathological bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrahlis) before and after the proposed interventions.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of aural perforation,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Video-otoscopy with photographs at randomisation and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>review of effect of treatment on nasal colonisation with pathogenic bacteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Culture &amp; sensitivity of aural &amp; nasal swabs at randomisation &amp; 12 months.

Bacterial load estimates of nose swabs will be used to determine whether this measure is able to predict which children are most likely to develop ear discharge and whether adenoidectomy reduces bacterial load in the nasopharynx of Aboriginal children.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure systemic and mucosal antibody responses (including IgA, IgG, IgG subclasses &amp; IgE)  and their functionality, to pneumococcal and NTHi surface antigens in serum, saliva and middle ear effusion in indigenous children undergoing surgical intervention for chronic OM.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline: 
- saliva samples from all participants
- serum samples from children in surgical groups (taken while  under GA)

12 months:
- saliva samples from all participants</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ear infection (otitis media) is a major problem amongst children living in remote Australian communities. Medical treatment often fails, and ear nose and throat surgeons are called upon to provide surgical care. 

This clinical trial will provide surgeons with evidence so that they can recommend the best possible operation for children living in desert and tropical regions, most of whom are indigenous, to improve hearing and reduce the prevalence of ear infection and discharging ears.</summary>
