  <interventions>
    <interventions>An assessment of the speed of a participants lymphatic flow rates is made using lymphoscintigraphy - a baseline measurement is established. Two weeks later, a spinal anaesthetic is performed (the exposure). The spinal anaesthetic provides complete sympathetic blockade to the lower limbs. Immediately following the exposure, a second lymphoscintigram is performed and the results are compared. 
1. Both of the lymphoscintigrams are performed over two hours. A 0.4ml bleb of colloid tracer is injected between the first and second toes. The passage of the colloid flow up the leg is followed using gamma camera imaging. The patient lies flat through this procedure. The transient discomfort of the injection is the only harm to the patient. We have received ethics approval for the use of the (harmless) low dose radio-isotope injection. 
2. The spinal anaesthestic is routinely performed for these patients as they are receiving brachytherapy that requires applicator insertion into the cervix or prostate. The lymphoscintigraphy is being performed after the procedure has been completed, but with the spinal anaesthetic still active. A typical spinal anaesthetic dose is 12miligrams of intrathecal bupivicaine and 20micrograms of intrathecal Fentanyl.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The bodys lymphatics vessels have an important function and move fluid outside blood vessels through lymph glands. This role in clean up of cell debris after surgery is very important to understand as these lymphatic channels are also mechanisms of spread of cancer cells. Lymph glands are a common site where cancer recurs after surgery. There is evidence to suggest that the movement of lymph through lymphatic channels alters under epidural/spinal anaesthesia. These sorts of anaesthesia techniques are sometimes performed at the time of surgery for pain relief; this study will consider whether they also have a role in the reduction of lymph flow at the time of surgery. Doctors may therefore be able to utilise another technique to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence after surgery.
Primary research hypothesis:
Lymphatic flow in the lower limb is reduced by sympathetic blockade (spinal anaesthesia).</summary>
