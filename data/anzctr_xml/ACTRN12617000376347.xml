  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 2-arm randomised waitlist-controlled trial with a primary endpoint at 3 months and a 6-month follow-up, testing the efficacy of a mobile device delivered (smartphone or tablet) program to improve physical activity and sleep. The 12-week intervention will be delivered using a combination of a mobile app and a message-based support service.

The mobile app will operationalise goal-setting, self-monitoring and feedback strategies in relation to physical activity and sleep health. The message-based support service (Email and text messaging)  will  provide feedback on progress towards goals, prompts to practice the two behaviours and review/adjust goals, daily reminders (optional) and tool sheets on goal-setting, action planning and stress management. 

Participants will be asked to self-monitor their daily physical activity and sleep behaviours and set personal goals for both behaviours within the app. We will advise participants to log both behaviours on a daily basis, whereas goals can be reset at any time (if need be) or otherwise will remain unchanged. A summary report, which is sent to participants once weekly will assist with the process of goal review. Goal achievement is considered successful, if participants are within 20% of their goal. For example, if a participant aimed for 30 min of activity, their feedback dashboard (traffic light) will display a green light and their goal is reached , if the participant logged at least 24 min of activity or more for that day. Reference values for an orange light are 20-35% of goal and &gt;35% of goal for a red light. Multiple entries per day are possible.

In detail, the physical activity section of the app allows entries for moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, a step count and resistance training sessions. The sleep section allows entries for bed and wake times, a sleep quality rating and a set of sleep hygiene behaviours (e.g. reducing the impact of noise and light in the bedroom, avoiding caffeine before bedtime, etc.). Based on the data entered by the participant, the app will generate instant feedback in the form of a traffic light, which changes colours by comparing individual goals against the data participants entered. In addition, progress charts will illustrate progress over time (daily, 1-week and 3-month charts) for both behaviours. 

A pedometer will be shipped to participants to facilitate the logging of a daily step count. Participants will be asked to set relevant and achievable goals (guidance provided); however, we will encourage individuals to gradually work towards the recommended minimum of physical activity (PA) and sleep as per national guidelines, which is 150 min/wk (plus 2 days of resistance training) for PA and 7-9 hours of sleep per night. 

The entirely remotely delivered trial will be advertised nationwide using social media and the baseline, 3-month and 6-month assessments will collect self-report measures of physical activity and sleep as well as secondary outcomes (mental health, health-related quality of life, sleep hygiene) and potential mediators (social cognitive correlates of physical activity and sleep) via online surveys. Fidelity and adherence will be assessed and reported as part of a process evaluation. 

The app and all other components are informed by social cognitive theories and follow behaviour change taxonomies to ensure consistency with implementation standards and reporting. Participants will be given continuous access to the app.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the waitlist-control arm will not receive an intervention and be asked to not change their usual physical activity and sleep behaviours between baseline and the 6-month time point. They will however, receive full access to an identical program following completion of their 6-month assessment. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power: Based on estimated changes in physical activity and sleep using data from meta-analyses and a pilot study that targeted similar outcomes in a sample with similar characteristics, using similar intervention approaches and assuming an alpha of 0.025 (due to measuring two main outcomes), power of 0.80, a moderate effect size (d = 0.45 for physical activity; d = 0.65 for sleep) and a correlation between measures of 0.6, a total of 60 participants per group is required for physical activity and 35 per group for sleep quality. Therefore, the larger sample size is used.  A drop-out rate of 25% is assumed and the sample is inflated to account for this. In summary, the total sample size is 80 participants per group or 160 in total.

Analyses: All analyses will follow an intention-to-treat principle. Any analyses to be conducted will be blinded to group allocation and overseen by an independent statistician. The primary aim is to examine differences in sleep quality and physical activity between the control group and intervention group at the 3-month time point. Between-group differences in physical activity and sleep quality (PSQI) will be estimated using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) adjusting for baseline sleep quality (ANCOVA), including all available data in the analysis. Two separate GLMM will be used to examine changes in physical activity and sleep. Group differences in secondary outcome measures will be estimated using the same linear mixed modelling approach, setting an alpha of 0.025 for each outcome. Potential moderators of intervention group effects (secondary aims) will be explored by behaviour using linear mixed models with interaction terms, or stratification.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A 2-arm randomised waitlist-controlled trial to test the efficacy of a m-health intervention to promote physical activity and sleep health in adults. The two main outcomes (MVPA and sleep quality) will be assessed after 3 months (primary endpoint) and followed up at the 6-month time point. The study will deliver a combined program including an app and message-based support to facilitate goal-setting, self-monitoring and feedback on progress towards goal for both behaviours. 

Physical inactivity is highly prevalent among adults and a large proportion of the population reports poor sleep health (characterised by inadequate sleep duration, low quality of sleep and inappropriate sleep timing, leaving people feeling insufficiently refreshed and unsatisfied with their sleep). 

Both behaviours independently influence risks for chronic disease and mortality and may have a bidirectional relationship, as such synergistic effects on health may be achieved. No studies to date have targeted the two behaviours simultaneously in a mobile device-delivered behaviour change intervention. In addition to testing the efficacy of such an intervention, we  seek to identify potential moderators of intervention efficacy (e.g., age, gender, education) and test mediators of behaviour change (social cognitive factors, sleep hygiene).</summary>
