  <interventions>
    <interventions>Provision of standardised education; Group 1  Lay carer prepares, labels and stores injections for subsequent administration; Group 2 - Registered nurse prepares, labels and stores injections for subsequent administration by the lay carer. 
The visiting registered nurse will deliver the standardised education component face to face, as a one on one session to all lay caregivers participating in the study, occurring once when the need to administer subcutaneous injections becomes apparent.  The session is expected to last between 30  60 minutes.  During this time caregivers will be given the opportunity to prepare and practice giving the injections under the supervision of the registered nurse.  The topics covered include: a) how to manage symptoms; b) commonly used medications for symptom control; c) access  to medications in the community; and d) Safe storage and disposal of medications.  At the completion of the session registered nurses will work through a competency checklist with caregivers.   
The standardised education package includes the following resources: a) a DVD How to prepare and administer a subcutaneous injection. This DVD demonstrates aspects of subcutaneous injecting and trouble shooting; b) a booklet Palliative subcutaneous medication administration: a guide for carers. This booklet covers topics such as frequently asked questions, importance of symptom control, management of common palliative symptoms, commonly used subcutaneous medications and processes of injecting; c) charts  illustrated step by step guides concerning how to prepare and administer subcutaneous injections; d) colour coded medication labels; e) a daily diary to document aspects of care; and f) a practice demonstration kit that includes a cannula and other equipment involved with subcutaneous injections.	
Types of injections will depend upon the symptoms displayed by the patient as well as the medications and doses contained within subcutaneous injections.
The trial period is determined by the amount of time the lay carer is required to administer subcutaneous medications up to a maximum of 14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 3- Pharmacist control group.  Pharmacist prepares, labels and delivers injections to lay carer for subsequent administration as required for symptom management.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Palliative care services strive to support patients to die within the setting of their choice, usually home, with optimal symptom control and a pattern of care that is supportive of caregivers. Palliative care professionals appreciate that, due to resource constraints, the likelihood of patients remaining symptomatically well managed at home depends upon input from lay carers, usually family members. 
This study has been designed to evaluate an intervention that supports and educates caregivers to safely and appropriately administer subcutaneous medications for the purpose of symptom control.

The study has two components:
1. To implement a standardised education and support package for lay carers living in urban, regional and rural settings within Queensland and to evaluate that package across the domains of content, efficacy, safety and satisfaction. The package will be evaluated using two lay carer questionnaires.  The first will be completed immediately following the delivery of the standardised package.  The second will be repeated four weeks after their completion on the trial.  The questionnaires will rate the usefulness of the education delivered and resources provided.

2. To identify possible differences in outcomes for lay carers, in terms of confidence, safety, satisfaction, and stress measures with the preparation and injection of subcutaneous medications across three different conditions.
I. The lay carer prepares, labels and stores daily breakthrough medications for subsequent injection
II. A registered nurse prepares and labels daily breakthrough medications for subsequent storage and injection by lay carers
III. A clinical trial pharmacist prepares and labels daily breakthrough medications for subsequent storage and injection by lay carers.

Differences in outcomes will be measured using surveys and Likert scales and statistically analysed.  In addition, caregivers will be invited to record their experience in a daily diary.</summary>
