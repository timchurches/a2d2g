  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phase 1

 

This is a trial of an anti-cancer treatment known as BDCA-BDC-01 which is a preparation of blood dendritic cells (BDC-1 type) loaded with antigens. The treatment is for immune therapy of distant secondary cancer (metastases) of the prostate when this no longer responds to hormone treatment (hormone-refractory).

 

Who is it for?

You can take part in this trial if you have distant secondary prostate cancer which has not responded to androgen deprivation therapy (therapy to reduce levels of the hormone testosterone in your body). 

 

Trial details

Participants receive injections either under the skin or intravenously with a BDC-1 blood dendritic cell preparation which is loaded with special proteins (antigens that prompt the formation of antibodies). This happens once a month for 3 months. The trial aims to induce an immune response against the cancer and assess the safety and effectiveness of this treatment.

 

Dendritic cells are important immune cells which are normally present in the human body. BDC-1 dendritic cells are a type of dendritic cell. Dendritic cells can be prepared with special proteins from the prostate cancer to enhance the immune response. The standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer that is not responding to androgen deprivation is chemotherapy.</summary>
