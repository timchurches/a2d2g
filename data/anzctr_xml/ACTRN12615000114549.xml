  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1: '10 Top Tips' aims to increase habitual performance of healthy lifestyle behaviours such as 'Keep a food diary', 'Switch to low fat food', 'Practice portion control' etc. The tips are provided to the participants in the form of a single pamphlet which is provided at baseline. A tracking diary is also provided for record keeping. The intervention period is 12 weeks.

Intervention 2: 'Do Something Different' aims to break daily habits and increase behavioural flexibility by assigning participants a different task to perform each day. Examples of these tasks include: 'Take a different route to work', 'Write a short story', 'Wear something you've never worn before' etc. These tasks are emailed or text messaged to the participants depending on their preference. Adherence is not monitored. The intervention period is 9 weeks. 

No intervention group will receive both interventions. Both interventions explained above will be administered by the principle researcher of this study who is a qualified dietitian.</interventions>

    <concealment>We will identify potential participants via a local televised news segment as well as local ABC radio interview. Participants will be initially screened on the telephone for eligibility. All participants will be require to attend an initial interview in order to provide informed consent and be formally recruited in to the study. 

Eligible participants will be enrolled into the study. Non eligible participants will be  informed of so and recommended to see their general practitioner for weight management advice and further referral to a dietitian or appropriate weight loss program. 

Randomisation:
Computer generated randomisation will occurred once eligible participants have attended the initial baseline appointment. We will use minimisation stratified on BMI categories (overweight, obese class I, II, III), age categories (18-32, 33-47, 48-62, 63-75 years); and gender. After randomisation, participants in the active intervention groups (Ten Top Tips and Do Something Different) will attend a group meeting for their intervention with the primary researcher to commence the program. Participants randomised to the wait list group will be offered either the DSD or TTT intervention after waiting 12 weeks. 

Allocation concealment will be achieved as each participant will be coded upon recruitment and their individual data (BMI, age, gender) will be entered into a minimsation software (MINIM). MINIM will automatically generate the intervention allocation. This information will only be available to the 4 researchers working on this study. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindless eating or habitual eating has been described as the most plausible factor to explain why we struggle to keep our excess weight off. Once we form a habit, it can be difficult to act in non-habitual ways despite our best intentions. Therefore the primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of 2 weight management interventions which focus on habitual behaviour and assess whether we can maintain weight loss for at least 12 months if habits are altered. </summary>
