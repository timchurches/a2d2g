    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK2110183 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel

Experimental: GSK2110183, carboplatin and paclitaxel - Subjects will be treated with a maximum of six doses of carboplatin + paclitaxel in combination with continuous daily GSK2110183 followed by single agent GSK2110183 at the single-agent MTD of 125 mg or above oral daily.


Treatment: drugs: GSK2110183 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
Phase I is a dose escalation evaluation of increasing doses of GSK2110183 administered on a continuous daily schedule in combination with carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175mg/m2 given every three weeks for a maximum 6 cycles. The dosing regimen identified in Phase I will then be evaluated in Phase II, a single arm study focused on clinical efficacy. Treatment with the three drug regimen will continue for a maximum of 6 x 21 day cycles followed by continuous GSK2110183 at the single agent MTD. Subjects may continue on study drug until progression, death or unacceptable toxicity.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase I - Dose Escalation - Determine the safety and tolerability of GSK2110183 administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer which will be used to identify the dosing regimen to be evaluated in Phase II.
Endpoints:
AEs, SAEs, dose reduction or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and changes in laboratory values and vital signs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase II - Efficacy - Evaluate the clinical efficacy (measured by overall response rate) of GSK2110183 administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Endpoint:
Overall response rate defined as the percentage of subjects with confirmed complete response or partial response using RECIST v1.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase II - Efficacy - Evaluate the efficacy (measured by CA 125 responses and response criteria incorporating both CA125 and RECIST observations) of GSK2110183 administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Evaluate the (6 month) progression free survival of subjects with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with GSK2110183 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Endpoints:
Response rate as defined by GCIG CA 125 criteria and combination of RECIST 1.1 criteria and CA 125 criteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase II - Safety - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the dosing combination of GSK2110183 administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel identified in Phase I.
Endpoints:
AEs, SAEs, dose reduction or delays, withdrawals due to toxicities and changes in laboratory values and vital signs</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 weeks</timepoint>
