    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of Patients With ACR20 at Week 24, Comparison Between Fostamatinib and Placebo. - ACR20: American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria, based on count of swollen and tender joints (out of 28 joints), blood test measures of inflammation (such as CRP) and the physician and patient's own assessments of disease activity, pain and physical function. Non-responder imputation has been applied by carrying the baseline observation forward. BID=twice daily, CRP=C-reactive protein, DMARD=disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, PO=orally, QD=once a day.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in mTSS, Comparison Between Fostamatinib and Placebo. - mTSS: modified total Sharp score, a measure of structural progression based upon X-rays. Hand and foot joints are scored for erosions and joint space narrowing and the results summed to give a value between 0 and 448. A higher value represents more serious progression of the disease. After disregarding ineligible records, patients with 2 or more non-missing values have had missing data imputed via linear extrapolation/interpolation methods. Patients with only 1 result have been excluded from the analysis. ANCOVA=analysis of covariance, BID=twice daily, DMARD=disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, IP=investigational product, PO=orally, QD=once a day.</outcome>

      <outcome>ACRn - Comparison Between Fostamatinib and Placebo at Week 24 - ACRn: American College of Rheumatology index of RA improvement, based on smallest percentage improvement in the count of swollen joints (out of 28 joints), count of tender joints (out of 28 joints), or in blood test measures of inflammation (such as CRP) or the physician or patient's own assessments of disease activity, pain and physical function. Scores are reported as a percentage improvement on a scale of -100 to +100, with larger values representing a better clinical outcome. BID=twice daily, CI=confidence interval, CRP=C-reactive protein, DMARD=Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, PO=orally, QD=once a day, RA=rheumatoid arthritis. Mean refers to change at Week 24.</outcome>

Scores can take any positive value with a lower value indicating a better clinical condition. A DAS28-CRP score of &lt;2.6 is indicative of remission of RA symptoms.

      <outcome>HAQ-DI Response - Comparison of the Change (&gt;=0.22) From Baseline Between Fostamatinib and Placebo at Week 24 - HAQ-DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index, a measure of physical function. The HAQ-DI score is calculated by summing scores from 8 sub-categories (ie, scores for patient ability in dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities) and dividing by the number of categories completed. The HAQ-DI score takes values between 0 and 3, with higher score indicating greater disability. HAQ-DI response: a reduction from baseline in HAQ-DI greater than or equal to the minimally important difference (0.22). BID=twice daily, DMARD=disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, OR=odds ratio, PO=orally, QD=once a day.</outcome>

      <outcome>SF-36 - Comparison of the Change in PCS From Baseline Between Fostamatinib and Placebo at Week 24 - SF-36: 36 item Short Form Health Survey, a measure of health-related QoL. Scores for 8 sub-domains (Physical Functioning, Role-physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Function, Role-emotional &amp; Mental Health) are derived &amp; normalised to a scale of 0-100. Physical Component Scores (PCS) are derived by multiplying each of these 8 scores by a constant, summing them &amp; standardising against a population with mean of 50, standard deviation of 10. Higher scores represent a better QoL. Mean changes from baseline score are presented at each visit as increases from baseline (defined as post-baseline minus baseline); larger changes indicate a better clinical condition. ANCOVA=analysis of covariance, BID=twice daily, DMARD=disease modifying antirheumatic drug, PO=orally, QD=once daily, QoL=quality of life.</outcome>
