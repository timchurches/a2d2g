  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Patients shall be given a moderate course of Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) intervention. NET is a mind-body based chiropractic intervention, that utilises muscle testing, semantics and chinese element theory to determine a neuro emotional complex (NEC). A neuroemotional complex is said to be associated with many pain syndromes. The NEC's are assessed through referential statements, through the use of muscle testing. The intervention is created by applying a mechanical mobilisation device (activator) to specific spinal segments whilst the participant contemplates a recalled memory and the recents cause of the pain syndrome. This is believed to help disassociate the emotional content and a pain syndrome to facilitate the return to health. During this time pain is said to be reduced or normalised. Duration of Intervention: The intervention is applied in less than one second mobilising bursts of less than one centimetre amplitude. The burst are repeated 5 times bilaterally at three separate facet joint articulation of the spine. Participants shall receive the intervention at a frequency of 2 sessions per week for one month, followed by one session per month for 5 months (12 sessions).</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham: Patients shall be given sham NET intervention. This included enthusiastic treatment of muscle testing and semantic testing which does not pertain to any emotional complexed. The referential statements provided were not relevant to the presentation and thus were deemed to have no therapeutic value. Participants shall receive the SHAM treatment at a frequency of 2 sessions per week for one month, followed by one session per month for 5 months (12 sessions).</comparator>
