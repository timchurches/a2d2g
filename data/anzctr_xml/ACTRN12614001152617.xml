    <scientifictitle>An Open-label, Randomized, Single-dose, 4-way Crossover Study to Assess the Relative Bioavailability of Axelopran and Oxycodone Administered as a Fixed-Dose Combination and as Individual Components to Healthy Subjects with a Naltrexone Block Under Fasting Conditions</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional product, axelopran 10mg, will be co-formulated with an oxycodone 20mg tablet and administered orally under fasting conditions.  Both products will also be administered together but as separate tablets, and also as individual doses, so that study participants will each receive each of the 4 treatment options, separated by a week between dosing.  In each Period, subjects will also receive co-treatment with naltrexone 50 mg orally (a single 50 mg dose 15 and 3 hours before and 9 and 21 hours after dosing with Study Treatment).   </interventions>
    <comparator>No comparator will be utilised for this study.  The axelopran will be given alone and with the oxycodone in order to assess how the body handles these drugs in combination and separately.  Naltrexone will be co-administered to each study participant in order to block the peripheral and central effects of opiate administration.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to determine the relative bioavailability of axelopran and oxycodone (by assessment of plasma concentrations) after oral administration as a fixed-dose combination compared to the individual components when administered together to healthy subjects under fasting conditions</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements to be taken up to 72 hours following each dose administration.  Blood samples for plasma PK analysis of axelopran and oxycodone will be collected at pre-dose and at approximately 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours postdose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the relative bioavailability of axelopran and oxycodone when administered as individual, single ingredient drug products relative to when co-administered either as the individual components or as a fixed-dose combination</outcome>
      <timepoint>To be assessed up to 72 hours following each dose.  Blood samples for plasma PK analysis of axelopran and oxycodone will be collected at pre-dose and at approximately 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours postdose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety of single doses of axelopran and oxycodone administered (through evaluation of vital signs (including blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation), physical examination, electrocardiography, adverse events, and laboratory safety tests) as a fixed-dose combination, co-administered as individual components, and administered as separate treatments to healthy subjects under fasting conditions. The study will monitor for all adverse events, including events that might be related to axelopran or the opioid.   Any adverse event (either new or an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition) with an onset date after study drug administration will be recorded as an adverse event. The definition of an adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  In addition to the vital sign and laboratory assessments listed above, trial subjects will be assessed by site staff and questioned on how they are feeling and any adverse signs or symptoms will be recorded as adverse events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For Safety assessment, blood pressure and temperature will be measured within 30 minutes predose and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after dosing in each period. Heart rate and respiratory rate will be measured within 30 minutes predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,  2.5, 3, 3.5,  4,  4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after dosing in each period. Continuous SaO2 will be measured beginning predose through 8 hours after dosing, and then checked at 12 and 24 hours (and as medically indicated). ECGs (12-lead) will be collected in triplicate within 5 minutes at Screening, on admission to the clinical research unit on Day -1, within 60 minutes prior to study drug dose, and at 4 hours post dose on Day 1 and prior to discharge on Day 4 of each Period. Physical examinations will be assessed on Day -1 and Day 4 of each Period.   Adverse events will be assessed at least daily and recorded when reported or observed.  </timepoint>
