  <interventions>
    <interventions>Asymmetries in the lower limbs are easy to see at patellar level as a longitudinal
misalignment of the patellar borders. A statistical measurement of this misalignment has never been carried
out. In this study, we have used a new instrument, invented by us, to measure the longitudinal misalignment
of the upper borders of the patella. This instrument has been called "Dismetrometro". The name "Dismetrometro" comes from the term dysmetria. The Dismetrometro is an instrument for measuring misalignments. Using our instrument in this study, we carried out the statistical measurement of
the misalignment of the patellar borders. During our study we assessed 100 healthy individuals using the Dismetrometro device. Each individual had a negative anamnesis for orthopaedic pathologies of the lower limbs. Data collection was been completed in one month.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three different operators (OP1, OP2, OP3) measure the same sample of subjects three times (first session). This procedure is repeated after one week (second session). The measurements collected in the dataset are in millimetres to one decimal point.
The patellar superior border misalignment measurements are performed by three different operators for all subjects.</comparator>

      <timepoint>The measurement trial consisted of two following sessions. The second session was carried out a week apart. In each session three different operators have measured the misalignment in every subjects.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Dismetrometro is an instrument for measuring misalignments. Using this instrument, we carried out the statistical measurement of the misalignment of the patellar upper borders.
During our study we assessed 100 healthy individuals using the Dismetrometro device. Each individual had a negative anamnesis for orthopaedic pathologies of the lower limbs. The average measurement of the
vertical distance between the two sides was 6.9 +/- 0.5 mm (S.D). This measurement is irrespective of gender and age, repeatable over a period of time and reproducible between different operators.</summary>
