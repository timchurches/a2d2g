  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study neonate undergoing heel prick procedure for blood collection will get in random order - Oral sucrose (Sterile 24%), Music therapy and combination of the above two methods in addition to standrad practice of swaddling and oral pacifier. 

Intervention I (MT) - Music therapy 

Intervention II (S) - Oral sucrose (24 %) with no music

Intervention III (MT+S) - Oral sucrose (24 %) with music therapy 

MT group - In MT group the neonate will be exposed to Passive music therapy with instrumental lullabies with sounds up to 65 dB starting 20 minutes before the heel prick, continuing for 6 minutes after the painful procedure.

S group  In S group the neonates will have no music. He/she will have oral sucrose (24 % sterile solution) 0.5 ml, two minutes prior to the beginning of the heel prick as per the current hospital protocol. 

MT+S group - In MT+S group the neonate will be exposed to Passive music therapy with instrumental lullabies with sounds up to 65 dB starting 20 minutes before the heel prick, continuing for 6 minutes after the painful procedure. In addition he/she will then have oral sucrose (24 % sterile solution) 0.5 ml, two minutes prior to the beginning of the heel prick as per the current hospital protocol. 

This is a crossover study with each neonate getting all three interventions in random order. There will be a minimum of 40 minutes of 'wash-out' period between subsequent interventions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is Music therapy or combination of music therapy with sucrose better for pain relief during heel prick procedure when compared with oral sucrose using PIPP score for neonates.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is the heart rate more stable in neonates exposed to music therapy as compared to sucrose 24 %. The heart rate will be assessed by continuous video recording of the pulse oximeter, connected to the newborn with saturation probe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 30 second (1/2 minute) time slot assessment for seven minutes after heel prick.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    <concealment>Eligible infants with inclusion criterion would be recruited from high dependency and special care unit of the hospital NICU. 

The parents would be approached and be informed in detail about the study, inviting any questions from parents. They will be provided with parent information sheet outlining the study in detail. 

Each infant will be exposed to all three therapies (Music Therapy, Oral Sucrose and combination of the two) in random sequence. Allocation concealment of the sequence of therapy will be done by sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

    <summary>Does the use of Music Therapy or Combination of music therapy with sucrose (24 % sterile sugar water) provide similar or better pain relief compared to Sucrose during the heel prick procedure. 

The research is aimmed to see if we can reduce the usage of sucrose, especially repeated and higher dosages in NICU with the help of music therapy which is relatively safe (within the recommened sound dose levels) and developementally appropriate intervention.</summary>
