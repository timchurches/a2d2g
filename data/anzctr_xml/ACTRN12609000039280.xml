  <interventions>
    <interventions>Using specific immunoassay, peptide sequencing, mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we will determine the amino acid structure of plasma B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP). A single 50ml blood sample will be collected at admission from people who present to hospital within 8 hours of onset of symptoms with evidence of an acute myocardial infarction. This study is limited to the collection of a single blood sample only and will continue until 70 samples of 50 mls each have been collected.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early clinical detection of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) can be difficult. In particular, distinction between cardiac and non-cardiac events may entail 12-36 hours of delay whilst serial biomarker results are awaited and/or subsequent tests (such as exercise electrocardiography) are performed. We have achieved the first ever identification of a signal peptide in the circulation (B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP)) and shown that it has potential to specifically and rapidly identify cardiac ischemia. Using specific immunoassay, peptide sequencing, mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we will determine the amino acid structure of BNP-SP. In order to complete this detailed analysis, we need approximately 3.5L of blood from patients who have recently suffered an acute myocardial infarction to provide sufficient BNP-SP We therefore require a single venous blood sample of 50 mls each from 70 people taken within 8 hours of onset of symptoms of heart attack. This sample can be taken in conjunction with routine blood tests upon admission to hospital.</summary>
