  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Trauma and severe injuries defined as damages to the body due to a sudden force which is external to the recipient. These damages include sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, concussions, contusions, penetration, and cuts. Typical examples of trauma among children are severe injuries due to motor-vehicle crashes.</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>A case management approach using senior trauma nurses in providing trauma care services to children who have been moderately or severely injured and hospitalised. Roles of theTrauma Case Manager (TCM) include the following functions:
 Coordinates care with other health care providers.
 Conducts initial and ongoing assessment to ensure the efficient use of resources
 Develops and monitors the use of clinical care protocols
 Manages outcomes
 Protects the financial interests of the hospital
 Promotes continuity of care through discharge
 Enhances the patient and familys perception of the institution
 Advocates for the patient to get the required care and services

The intervention will be applied once consent has been obtained from the parent/carer of the patient until the patient is discharged from the hospital.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control group will receive standard medical treatment as per their injury situation. These patients will be under the care of a surgical registrar according to the existing clinical guidelines stipulated by the Children's Hospital at Westmead policy and procedures.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effectiveness of the case management approach using a senior nurse as the case manager for services delivery with outcomes of improving clinical information gathering and service quality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured via the audit of the medical records, standardised and mandatory clinical forms on the day when the patient is discharged from the hospital.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes are the length of stay in hospital and clinician-patient-parent communication and thus patients satisfaction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These will also be measured on the day when the patient is discharged from the hospital.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eligible subjects for this study will include children and adolescents, who are admitted to the hospital more than 4 hours following traumatic injuries and who meet the criteria for activation of a trauma call. Patients who meet the criteria for activation of a trauma call are likely to have an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 9 or above. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Trauma patients who are admitted but for unpredicted reasons will not complete their treatment and management at Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW) will be excluded from the study. Trauma patients who are admitted to the hospital, but died soon after without having the opportunity for a complete management regime will also be excluded from the study. Patients who are presented to the hospital with a trauma call but are admitted less than 4 hours will also be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim for the proposed study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a case management approach using senior trauma nurses in providing trauma care services to children who have been moderately or severely injured and hospitalised. We aim to determine the effectiveness of such an approach using a randomised control trial with outcomes of improving clinical information gathering, service quality, and clinician-patient-parent communication and thus patients satisfaction. It is hypothesised that the case management approach can achieve twice the clinical information gathered in comparison to the controls. It is further hypothesised that the case management approach can improve both patient and family satisfaction significantly.</summary>
