  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Hall Technique is a method of managing dental caries in primary molar teeth by cementing a preformed stainless steel crown onto a tooth. This is without carious tissue removal and without local anaesthesia and takes approximately 10 minutes. Children will receive the Hall Technique treatment on one visit, and the conventional technique on a separate visit. The order of treatment (which comes first) and the tooth to receive the Hall technique will be randomised. The dental therapist will conduct the treatment, and the interval between appointments will be a minimum of 1 week, and maximum of 1 month.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional SSC involves tooth preparation with carious tissue removal and local anaesthesia when needed and cementing a preformed stainless steel crown onto a tooth which takes approximately 30 minutes. Children will receive the Hall Technique treatment on one visit, and the conventional technique on a separate visit. The order of treatment (which comes first) and the tooth to receive the Hall technique will be randomised. The dental therapist will conduct the treatment, and the interval between appointments will be a minimum of 1 week, and maximum of 1 month.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analyses will be performed using Stata Version IC12 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Estimates of failure rates for conventional restorations (25%) and Hall technique SSCs (10%) are supported by our feasibility study and previous research. Data analysis will be conducted in four stages. In the first stage, descriptive statistics will be utilised to describe socio-demographic characteristics of participants in both intervention arms. In the second stage, Poisson regression will be applied to the primary outcomes of clinical and radiographic success, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and clustering for types of dental caries lesions. In the third stage, each scalar measure will be analysed using ordinal logistic regression, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and clustering for types of dental caries lesions. Qualitative data will be analysed to look for themes. Triangualtion will be used to ensure all themes are identified.


Power Analysis &amp; Sample Size Calculation

A feasibility study conducted in 2011-2012 indicated procedural success rates of 88.4% for conventional treatment and 96.0% for the Hall Technique at six-month follow-up. Utilising these data for sample size calculations, a conservative power analysis suggested a minimum of 288 children is needed  (assuming alpha=0.05 and beta=0.90). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tooth decay is a really common problem. For years decayed teeth have been fixed by drilling out the decay and then placing fillings. We know that in childrens teeth, fillings dont last for as long as they do in adults, and that this often means fillings are done again and again in the same tooth.
The Hall Technique is a new way of treating decayed childrens primary molar (back) teeth. In the Hall Technique, a stainless steel crown (SSC) is glued on over the decayed tooth without injections or drilling. This seals in the decay and stops it from getting worse, and the stainless steel crown lasts for longer than any other type of filling, so retreatment is less likely to be needed.
This study will measure the success of Hall Technique, and children's acceptance of the treatment, compared to the treatment with conventional SSCs for children who attend the Northland District Health Board Community Oral Health Service dental clinics. </summary>
