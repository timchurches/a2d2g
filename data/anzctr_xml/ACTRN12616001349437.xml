  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mobile mindfulness-based app intervention for weight loss using mindfulness based stress reduction techniques (e.g body scan, Hatha Yoga, walking and sitting meditation, and breathing exercises) and mindful eating techniques. The app will also have basic educational information on basic dietary and physical activity guideline information from The WHO guidelines on Physical activity and dietary intake.The app will be compatible with iPhone and android. The mobile app will enable mindful eating and minduflness-based stress reduction text messages to be sent as push notifications. It will further have written educational information, mindfulness meditation and yoga videos, meditation audios, photos that inspire mindfulness, and an electronic diary for self-monitoring of mindfulness activities. Push notifications will also be sent at a frequency of 1-2 per week.
Mode of Delivery: by Mobile Phone
Duration: 12 weeks
Location: University of Queensland St Lucia and Herston Campuses
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive an electronic self-monitoring diary table of dietary intake and physical  as a word document which may be printed. There will also be a link at the top of the table as a reference to the WHO's diet and physical activity fact sheets.</comparator>

As this will be the first mobile mindfulness-based text message intervention for weight loss, there are no previous effect sizes that may give a precise same size calculation. However, an estimate was based on likely effects including related mHealth studies . Assuming a moderate effect size with alpha =0.05 and  80% power to detect a difference, a sample size of 58 would be required for 10% drop out and 66 would be required to account for 20% drop out. This trial will aim to recruit over 58 participants, with the aim of recruiting more to take into account a possibly weaker effect size (doubling).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness app for weight loss and changing weight related behaviors (diet/physical activity) in college students. This research will aim to determine if a  mindfulness app is feasible, acceptable, and effective for weight loss and weight related behaviors than a standard control group receiving an information leaflet on diet/physical activity. The research will also aim to determine if the intervention reduces stress as a secondary outcome of interest. It is anticipated that the mindfulness app intervention will be more effective for improving these outcomes than the control.</summary>
