Experimental: Nexus (S9) CPAP device - Fifty subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), established on CPAP therapy (= 6 months) were recruited into this study. These patients use their CPAP device every night while sleeping to treat their OSA.
Nexus (S9) is a new CPAP device with improved humidification system (heated tube and climate control), reduced noise, improved comfort of breathing and new user interface. During the study, patients will use this CPAP every night in place of their own CPAP for a period of 4 weeks. Compliance data from the Nexus will then be compared to the patient's usual CPAP pre trialling Nexus and post trialling Nexus.


Treatment: devices: CPAP Pre Nexus (S9)
This is the patient's own CPAP prior to trialling the Nexus (S9). 4 weeks of data will be downloaded from this device and compared to 4 weeks using Nexus (S9), and 4 weeks usage post trialling Nexus (S9)

Treatment: devices: Nexus (S9)
The patient will use the new Nexus (S9) CPAP for four weeks in place of their usual CPAP every night when they sleep to treat their OSA. Compliance data will be compared between four weeks on this device to the last four weeks on their current device (CPAP Pre S9). After using the Nexus (S9) CPAP for four weeks, participants will return to their current device for four weeks. Data from this post-trial period will be compared with both the Nexus (S9) four weeks, and the four weeks pre Nexus (S9) usage.

Treatment: devices: CPAP Post Nexus (S9)
After trialling the Nexus (S9) for four weeks, patients will return to their usual CPAP. Data from the patient's usual CPAP for four weeks will be compared to data while using the Nexus (S9), and data from the patient's usual device pre trialling S9 (CPAP Pre Nexus)

      <outcome>Compliance on CPAP - Compliance on CPAP was measured as average daily usage</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Usability of the Nexus (S9) CPAP. - The usability quesitonnaire was administered at the end of the 4 week trial of Nexus (S9). Usability was defined as ease of using the Nexus (S9) and overall satisfaction with the Nexus (S9) CPAP. The outcome measure was collected through 11 point Likert questionnaires, where 0 = very poor usability and 10 = excellent usability.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by a partial or complete collapse of the
      upper airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive airway
      pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. Humidification is used during CPAP therapy
      to improve the comfort of the delivered air and to alleviate nasal dryness/congestion.

      The latest design of a CPAP device, known as Nexus (S9), encompasses new features including
      an improved humidification system (heated tube and climate control), reduced noise, improved
      comfort of breathing, and a new user interface.

      This study will assess whether compliance on CPAP therapy is improved on the Nexus (S9) CPAP,
      and will assess the usability of the Nexus (S9) CPAP</summary>
