  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.	This is an observational trial of best practice.  This is not an interventional trial.  Malabsorption symptoms - each patient will be assessed by the dietician, or clinical nurse specialist or palliative physician for malabsorption and offered treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). If the patient consents to taking PERT, symptoms will be recorded at the initial assessment and at 7 and 21 days after taking PERT or until the following endpoints - the patient is unable to swallow tablets, is discharged from the service or dies.  Any side effects of PERT (e.g. constipation) will be also noted. 
2.	Nutritional assessment - the dietician will perform a nutritional assessment and recommend dietary changes based on the patients identified needs. If the patient agrees to commence PERT, the dietician will provide an education pamphlet on the action of PERT for the patient and carer. The dietician will also liaise with the Hospice Medical Specialist regarding appropriate dosages of PERT to be prescribed according to the patients meal requirements. The effectiveness of PERT on malabsorption symptoms will be reviewed weekly and dosages increased through GP liaison. 
3.	This study will also measure quality of life in this patient group using the EORTC QLQ C30 and PAN26 instruments.  The PAN26 instrument has been tested internationally and comprises 26 questions assessing pain, dietary changes, jaundice, altered bowel habit, emotional problems related to pancreatic cancer, and other symptoms (cachexia, indigestion, flatulence, dry mouth, taste changes). Measurement of quality of life will be recorded at the initial visit and then at 7 and 21 days after taking PERT or until the following endpoints - the patient is unable to swallow tablets, is discharged from the service or dies.  </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer referred to Nurse Maude's Palliative Care (NMPC) service will be eligible for the study until 50 patients in total have been recruited. The intervention will be given to patients who have had pancreatic surgery and those who have not, as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) can be caused by tumour-related pancreatic duct obstruction (Fieker et al, 2009). </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 results were analysed in accordance with the EORTC manual .  Missing data was assigned the mean value of the answered items of each domain if more than 50% of the items were completed.  There were no clear patterns evident for the missing data except that many did not complete the sex domain questions and therefore these have not been summarised. Mean changes for each domain between the baseline and two follow-up periods were analysed using paired t-tests. All analyses were undertaken using SPSS v22.0 (SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). A two tailed p-value &lt;0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction:  Advanced pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis and is associated with a constellation of symptoms leading to poor quality of life.  Malabsorption (MA) due to pancreatic exocrine dysfunction is common and can cause bloating/fullness, flatulence, weight loss and steatorrhoea, and may develop without obvious clinical signs. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which can alleviate MA, is underutilised in advanced pancreatic cancer (APC). A recent study found 80% of advanced pancreatic cancer patients were not prescribed PERT, in spite of exhibiting symptoms consistent with MA.

Objectives: To determine the efficacy of PERT in improving MA symptoms, and consequent impact on global and pancreas-specific quality of life (QOL) in APC patients.
Method:  Consecutive patients with advanced pancreatic cancer referred to Nurse Maude Hospice Palliative Care Service not previously prescribed PERT were enrolled on this study. PERT (CREON 25,000) was initiated following dietary and symptom assessment by a specialist dietitian. QOL was assessed using the EORTC-QLQ C30 v3 and PAN26 questionnaires at baseline and at 1 and 3 weeks of PERT
