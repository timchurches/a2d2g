  <interventions>
    <interventions>Conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Subjects will be observed for 4 hours in the emergency department and a repeat x-ray taken. If they are clinically stable and able to mobilise comfortably they will be discharged home and followed as an outpatient with a review at 24-72 hours, and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard interventional treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. A small bore (less than or equal to 12Fr) Seldinger chest drain will be inserted. If aspiration is unsuccessful underwater drainage will continue and the patient will be admitted to hospital. Further management, including the use of suction or need for surgery, will be at the discretion of the treating physician</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs when a lung collapses due to air escaping from a small hole in the surface lining. It occurs predominantly in young people who have no other lung disease. The symptoms are variable but may include chest pain and breathlessness. Currently the treatment recommended by international guidelines is to try to remove the air from the chest and re-expand the lung by inserting a plastic tube through the chest wall. This is done using local anaesthetic but can be uncomfortable and may be associated with complications. It may take up to a week for the lung to re-inflate, during which time the patient must remain in hospital. In some cases air continues to leak out of the lung and surgery is required. However, there are historical reports suggesting that simply observing a pneumothorax and allowing it to re-expand slowly may be as effective as inserting a tube in hospital, although it may take 4-6 weeks to fully resolve. This study will compare the current standard treatment using a tube, to simple observation, in a group of 342 patients with pneumothorax. The proportion in each group who have resolved on an X-ray at 8 weeks will be compared.</summary>
