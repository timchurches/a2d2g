  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of the randomized controlled research project are to investigate the effects of five consecutive daily sessions (1 x 30 minute session/ treatment day) of both:
1) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
2) transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
in improving pain intensity, physical functioning, mental health and quality of life in a chronic pain population awaiting pain clinic intervention. The study also aims to investigate whether prior treatment with consecutive daily sessions of both tDCS and TENS improves the outcomes of pain clinic intervention. 

Outcome measures and methods that will be used to achieve these aims will include:
1) asking subjects to complete self-reported questionnaires that include questions related to measures of pain, physical function, mental health and quality of life
2) measuring the subject's sensitivity to mechanical, electrical and thermal induced pain stimuli (i.e. the stimulus intensity will be increased until the subject can confidently perceive that the pain elicited by the stimulus matches the level of intensity of their current pain problem) delivered to the subject's dominant hand using a pressure algometer, electric current stimulator and thermal stimulus respectively
3) collecting subject's saliva to assess induced changes to pain related biomarkers using immunohistochemical techniques.</summary>
