    <interventions>Participants randomised to postoperative placement of earplugs in ICU
Trial participants randomised to receive ear plugs will have ear plugs placed within 30 minutes of arrival in the ICU from the operating theater. Ear plugs will remain in situ until a clinical decision has been made to either reduce or cease sedative agents with the objective of allowing the patient to regain consciousness, to assess neurological status, or otherwise at the request of the treating clinician or bedside nurse. Ear plugs will be reinserted if a clinical decision is made for the dose of the sedative agents to be increased or to achieve a deeper level of sedation or at the end of neurological assessment. 
It is normal practice for the treating clinician to order reduction or cessation in the administration of sedation in conjunction with the gradual reduction in mechanical ventilatory assistance via an endotracheal tube (weaning of sedation and weaning of ventilation).  At the commencement of this period of weaning of sedation or ventilation or both, earplugs will be removed. Following the removal of the patients endotracheal tube, earplugs will be reinserted while the patient is admitted to the ICU between the hours of 2200-0600, and at any other time of planned sleep or as requested by the participant. Ear plugs will be removed at any time as requested by the patient or if the patient becomes agitated. All other treatment will be according to standard perioperative care at the direction of the treating team.
The duration of the intervention period is the duration of the ICU stay.
The earplugs to be used are memory foam earplugs to be replaced daily.
Adherence will be monitored using a log of earplug use time.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to standard care
For trial participants randomised to standard care, all usual treatments, pre-operative, anaesthetic, surgical and post-operative will be as per the treating team.  The provision of earplugs to the patient by staff is prohibited while the patient is in the ICU. This is because ear plugs are neither available nor provided at this time and are being made available by the ICU only to patients who are allocated to receive ear plugs within the trial.  Earplugs will not be provided to patients who are otherwise eligible for the study but have declined to participate.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be study feasibility. A phase III RCT of ear plugs as a sound abatement strategy in ICU will be deemed feasible if all three of the following criteria are met:
	less than or equal to 10% of eligible patients refuse to participate on the basis of concerns over the placement of ear plugs

more than or equal to 90% of patients randomised to receive earplugs receive them in the 6 hour period immediately following postoperative ICU admission

more than or equal to 90% of patients randomised to receive earplugs receive them on the first night in ICU that occurs immediately after extubation 

less than or equal to 10% of patients who are randomised to not receive earplugs receive earplugs at any time whilst admitted to the ICU

These outcome criteria will be assessed by review of the study records
