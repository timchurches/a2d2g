  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be run according to a prespecified  algorithm based on plasma level pf Procalcitonin:
1. if Procalcitonin level &lt;0.1 antibiotics ceased.
2. if Procalcitonin level is rising, type of antibiotics and dosage to be changed based on clinical opinion.
3. Procalcitonin levels will be done daily up to 7 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Procalcitonin level will not be known in the control group. The clinician in charge, in consultation with infect disease team,  will dictate the antibiotic prescribed on clinical grounds until discharge from intensive care according to antimicrobial stewardship strategies used.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to determine if Procalcitonin (PCT) guided antibiotic therapy, compared with conventionally guided antibiotic treatment in intensive care unit patients, reduces the median number of antibiotic exposure days by 25%. This will be assessed according to number of days antibiotics are given in each arm amd recorded in drug chart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed by data linkage to medical records.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Procalcitonin (PCT) is a marker of bacterial infection, severity of infection and response to therapy. This study aims to examine the use of this biomarker to guide antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients. We assume that a 25% reduction in exposure to antibiotic days can be produced by using a PCT guided algorithm.</summary>
