  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding is defined as a case of overt bleeding (haematemesis, bloody gastric aspirate, melaena or haematochezia) plus any of the following 1. In the absence of another cause (e.g. drug induced, new sepsis) a reduction in mean arterial pressure of 20 mmHg within 24 hours of bleeding;
2. A reduction in haemoglobin of 20 g/L (regardless of the need for blood transfusion), within 24 hours of bleeding;
3. A need for surgery to control gastrointestinal bleeding
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The drug will be administered for a maximum of 14 days and data will be collected for a maximum of 21 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (defined as):

Ventilator-associated condition - greater than or equal to 2 calender days of stable or decreasing daily minimum positive end-expiratory pressure or daily minimum fraction of inspired oxygen, followed by a rise in the daily minimum positive end-expiratory pressure of greater than or equal to 3cm of water or a rise in the daily minimum percentage of inspired oxygen by &gt;20 points sustained for greater than or equal to 2 calender days   

Infection-related Ventilator-associated Complication (iVAC) - VAC plus a temp &lt;36 degrees Celsius or &gt;38 degrees Celsius or a leukocyte count of less than or equal to 4000 or greater than or equal to 12,000 per cubic millimeter, plus one or more new antibiotics continued for at least 4 days within 2 calender days before or after onset of a VAC (excluding the first 2 days of ventilation)

Possible Pneumonia - iVAC plus Gram's staining of endotracheal aspirated or bronchoalveolar lavage showing greater than or equal to 25 neutrophils and less than or equal to 10 epithelial cells per lower-power field, or a positive culture for a potentially pathogenic organism, within 2 calender before or after onset of a VAC (excluding the first 2 days of ventilation) 

Probable Pneumonia - iVAC plus Gram's staining of endotracheal aspirated or bronchoalveolar lavage showing greater than or equal to 25 neutrophils and less than or equal to 10 epithelial cells per lower-power field, plus endotracheal aspirate with greater than or equal to 10x5 colony-forming units per millilitre or broncho-alveolar-lavage culture with greater than or equal to 10x4 colony-forming units per millilitre, or endotraeal-aspirate or bronchoalveolar-lavage semiquantitative equivalent, within 2 calender days before or after onset of a VAC (excluding the first 2 days of ventilation)

2. Pregnancy
3. Patients admitted with suspected or proven gastrointestinal bleeding
4. Patients with a history of proven peptic ulcer disease
5. Patients receiving &gt; 400 mg/day of hydrocortisone (or equivalent of prednisolone (100mg) or dexamethasone (15mg))
6. History of surgery on the oesophagus, stomach or duodenum during the current hospital admission
7. Patients where the treating consultant intensive care physician believes that stress ulcer prophylaxis is either clearly indicated or contraindicated
8. Patients who are Jehovahs Witnesses
9. Patients who do not receive their first dose of study medication within 36 hours of initiation of mechanical ventilation (this criterion is required to avoid contamination of cohorts as if stress ulcer prophylaxis is beneficial it is likely to be of benefit when commenced as early as possible and patients who have been ventilated at another hospital for &gt; 24 hours may have received stress ulcer prophylaxis).
10. Patients admitted for palliative care.
11. Patients readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit

    <statisticalmethods>. It is acknowledged that the study may be underpowered to determine a difference between any of the three primary outcomes. Indeed, because of insufficient observational data we are unable to accurate estimate a cohort number required using a power calculation. However, a 12-month period will be sufficient to identify whether the current protocol at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (i.e. to not administer stress ulcer prophylaxis) is overtly harmful and provides us with far more data to base our decision on than we currently have.

Data will be presented and analysed using parametric and/or non-parametric approaches as appropriate based on distribution of data. As the primary outcomes are disparate the null hypothesis will be rejected at the 0.05 significance</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>To evaluate whether routine administration of proton pump inhibitor (intravenous pantoprazole) to mechanically-ventilated critically ill patients:

(1)	Reduces the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal bleeding; and

(2)	Increases the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and/or Clostridium difficile infection
