  <interventions>
    <interventions>Like most western countries, Australia is currently facing a dementia epidemic.  The prevalence of dementia in Australia is expected to reach over 1.1 million in 2050 (Alzheimer's Australia, 2009). By the 2060s, spending on dementia is set to outstrip that of any other health condition (Alzheimer's Australia, 2015).. 
 
Dementia syndrome affects a person in the three domains of cognition, behaviour and function. Impairment of functional abilities represents a crucial and necessary component of dementia diagnosis (McGrory S, Shenkin S, Austin E &amp; Starr J, 2014). Therefore, functional or daily living skills assessment must play a major role in contributing to cognitive diagnosis. However, how a quantitative measurement of activities of daily living (ADL) can contribute to the differential diagnoses, similar to the use of cognitive function tests, has not been extensively studied.

The Lawtons Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale is a popular, reliable and validated instrument to assess independent living, and has been endorsed by the Australian Government for the use in various Aged Care Service Programmes.

The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of the Australian Modified Lawtons IADL scale (revised version of the Lawtons IADL Scale) to differentiate cognitive diagnoses by determining cut-off scores between Normal Cognition (NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Dementia (D). The availability of this objective measure would contribute significantly to an earlier and more confident cognitive diagnosis. 

An Occupational Therapist (OT) will assess Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) Memory Clinic patients prior to medical assessment and therefore clinical diagnosis. The Australian Modified Lawtons IADL scores are then compared to the eventual diagnosis made by the Geriatrician (Principal Investigator) and the multidisciplinary team. This analysis will determine the range of scores on the IADL scale for the three diagnostic groups, NC, MCI and D, and the cut-off points between groups.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation:
Previous data indicates that the diagnostic rates in the SCGH memory clinic of D, MCI and NC controls are approximately 63%, 22% and 15%, respectively and that a significant relationship exists between diagnostic groups and the Modified Lawtons score (p&lt;0.0001). Following the guidelines set out by Peduzzi et al. where p represents the proportion of the population with the response and k the number of covariates considered (1  Modified Lawtons Score) in the logistic regression model, the total sample size required for modelling the responses in dementia and healthy controls is 54 and 131, respectively.

Internal validation of the cut-off scores (as determined from ROC analyses) will be conducted with a hold out sample. It is estimated that over the time period of the study, 250 cases will be attainable. This will allow for a 60:40 split of the data for initial (N=150) and validation (N=100) datasets whilst also satisfying the minimum sample size required for the logistic regression analyses.

Statistical Analysis Plan:
Data from 250 patients will be separated into a training set (N=150) and a validation set (N=100) with an equal mix of NC, MCI and D patients in each set. Data from the training group will be used to determine the optimal Lawton Score cut-offs whilst data from the validation group will be used to prospectively assess the accuracy of these cut-offs. Cut-offs will be determined using two logistic regression models with receiver operator characteristic curves. The first analysis will compare NC to MCI and D patients combined to determine the Modified Lawtons Score that separates healthy patients from the rest. The second analysis will compare D patients to NC and MCI patients combined in order to determine the Modified Lawtons Score that separates D patients from the rest. 

A parallel analysis will also be conducted similar to above where the MMSE score will be used as the response. As the MMSE has been shown to categorise NC, MCI and D patients with a high degree of accuracy we will compare the predictions to those from the Modified Lawtons score. Correlations between MMSE and Modified Lawtons will also be investigated. 

All statistical analyses will be conducted using the R environment for statistical computing.

    <summary>AIM

The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of the Australian Modified Lawtons IADL scale to differentiate cognitive impairment by determining cut-off scores between Normal Cognition (NC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Dementia (D).

HYPOTHESIS 

The Australian Modified Lawtons IADL scale scores will have significant association with the diagnoses of MCI and D, hence contribute to the assessment and diagnosis of older persons presenting with cognitive decline according to standard diagnostic criteria.

STUDY DESIGN

This is a prospective single-blind single-centre study of patients newly referred to the Memory Clinic.  

METHOD

The study cohort consists of older persons with no significant physical disability referred for assessment of subjective or objective cognitive decline to the Memory Service. The participants will undergo an occupational therapy (OT) clinic assessment which includes scoring the Australian Modified Lawtons IADL scale. The assessment will consist of a comprehensive interview of usual daily living activities and performance of several ADL based tasks. The carer is invited to be part of the interview. They will be provided with an information sheet on the research project. The occupational therapist is blinded to the diagnosis because the assessment occurs prior to any diagnosis by medical clinicians.

The OT assessment is followed by medical assessment including cognitive assessment in the outpatient Memory Clinic. This will include completion of a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), according to the standard procedure. The final cognitive diagnosis is determined by the Geriatrician, according to DSM V criteria. 

The Australian Modified Lawtons IADL scale scores are then analysed to determine the range of scores on the scale stratified by the three diagnostic groups of NC, MCI and D and to determine the between-group cut off points.
