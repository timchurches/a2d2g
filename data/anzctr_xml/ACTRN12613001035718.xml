  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial intervention is a purpose-designed screening information booklet containing information on breast screening benefits and harms over 20 years of participation, including evidence-based quantitative estimates of breast cancer mortality benefit, false positives, and overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis  also called overdetection  means finding a breast cancer through screening that would otherwise never cause any symptoms or health problems for the woman during her life.</interventions>
    <comparator>The trial comparator is a purpose-designed screening information booklet containing information on breast screening benefits and harms over 20 years of participation, including evidence-based quantitative estimates of breast cancer mortality benefit and false positives (as in the intervention) but with NO overdiagnosis information.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Informed choice, assessed as the proportion of participants who make an informed choice about whether to screen or not. For the individual, making an informed choice is defined as (i) having adequate knowledge and (ii) expressing intentions that are consistent with ones attitudes. Knowledge will be measured by assessing womens understanding of the conceptual and numerical information in the booklets, using items adapted from previous screening decision aid trials (Mathieu 2007; Smith 2010). Attitudes towards breast screening will be assessed using a validated, theory-based generic screening attitudes scale (Dormandy 2006). A single item will measure intentions about having a screening mammogram (or not) within the next 2-3 years, using a set of 5 response options (Gwyn 2003; Watson 2006).

    <concealment>Names and addresses of a random sample of NSW women aged 48-49 years will be extracted from the electoral roll. Matching telephone numbers will be retrieved from the electronic telephone directory. A database will be provided to the Hunter Valley Research Foundation (HVRF), an experienced independent non-profit organisation. HVRF interviewers will telephone women sampled randomly from the database and determine study eligibility using a series of simple questions. Eligible women will be informed about the study and invited to participate. Consent will be obtained orally and documented.
Allocation to intervention or control will occur subsequently, using a randomisation sequence generated centrally by a statistician who has no contact with participants. The HVRF interviewers conducting recruitment will not be aware of the randomisation sequence and hence will not know which booklet will be allocated.
</concealment>
    <sequence>A statistician who has no contact with participants will generate a permuted block randomisation sequence to allocate each participant to one of the two groups (intervention or control), using a permuted block size of 4 and 8.
A random sample of approximately 66 participants will be randomised to the intervention or control within a qualitative sub-study that captures additional outcomes via qualitative interviews.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by intention to treat, comparing the 2 study arms on the proportion of women who have made an informed choice about whether or not to have screening, measured at 2 weeks post intervention. Assuming conservatively that one of these proportions is 50%, we need 407 women per study arm to achieve 80% power to detect a 10% difference between the groups.
The total target sample size comprises the two arms of the main study as described above, plus the qualitative sub-study, plus additional numbers to allow for attrition between recruitment and outcome data collection.
We will use the chi-squared test to analyse binary outcomes and the two sample t test for continuous outcomes. We will use multiple imputation and sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of missing data on results.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a newly developed information booklet for women about breast cancer screening.

Who is it for?
People may be eligible to join this study if they are women aged 48-50 years residing in NSW. Women will not be eligible if they have a personal or strong family history of breast cancer, or if they have undergone any mammogram in the past 2 years. Potentially eligible participants will be randomly selected from the electoral roll and contacted by researchers.

Study details
Women in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to receive one of two different versions of a booklet. The booklets aim to provide clear and useful information about the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening, in order to enable women to make an informed decision about screening. The researchers will look at how women understand and interpret the information, as well as how it affects their screening attitudes, decisions, and experiences.</summary>
