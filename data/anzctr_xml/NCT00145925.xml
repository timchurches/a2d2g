             target of 6.5% or less

          5. A definite indication for long-term full-dose or bed-time insulin therapy

          6. Participation in a trial within the month prior to the Registration Visit or current
             participation in another trial

        Other potential reasons for ineligibility include:

          -  High probability of non-adherence to study treatment or follow-up

          -  Current clinical instability (e.g. a major cerebral or coronary event or
             sight-threatening retinopathy or macular oedema within the previous few weeks)

          -  Life threatening non-vascular disease other than diabetes and its complications

          -  Moderate or severe dementia

          -  Major disability that is likely to prevent regular attendance at study clinics

        Final decisions about eligibility were made at the discretion of the study investigator and
        the potential study participant, in the light of any requirements or guidance from local
        ethics committees and other regulatory bodies.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to provide information on the risks and benefits of routine
      blood pressure lowering (regardless of blood pressure level), and intensive lowering of blood
      glucose levels, in patients with Type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular events. The
      major outcomes of the study will be cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke or dying as a
      result of cardiovascular disease), as well as new or worsening diabetic eye and kidney
      disease.</summary>
