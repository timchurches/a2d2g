      <outcome>Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYS).
The (QALY) is a measure of disease burden, including both the quality and the quantity of life lived. It is used in assessing the value for money of a medical intervention. The QALY model requires utility independent, risk neutral, and constant proportional tradeoff behaviour. The QALY is based on the number of years of life that would be added by the intervention. Each year in perfect health is assigned the value of 1.0 down to a value of 0.0 for death.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Method 1: Domiciliary/geriatric assessment services at the three campuses will approach new clients about their willingness to consider participation in this study and be approached by researchers. 

Method 2: Using similar approaches, investigator clinicians and other geriatrician/gerontology colleagues will refer consenting subjects from their rehabilitative, ambulatory or outreach services for further contact and review by the research officer. Any subjects who have only recently been in hospital will be enrolled into the study 3 months after the last hospitalization and once health status is stabilized.

Method 3: Television or newspaper advertisement.

Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was off-site.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be randomised to one of two study groups (n= Ëœ100/group) by a stratification system to ensure that an equal number of men and women will be allocated to each treatment. There will be stratification by study site to allow for possible differences in subjects recruited between sites, within each sex at each site.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Weight loss and under-nutrition is common in older people and associated with poor outcomes.  This includes increased rates of hospital admissions.
In a pilot study of ndernourished older, community dwelling people we found that daily treatment for one year with a combination of testosterone tablets and a nutritional supplement produced a significant reduction in hospitalizations.  We propose a larger, multicentre study to explore and hopefully confirm this exciting, potentially important finding.</summary>
