  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multi-site study of effect of practice of reaching movements in virtual reality (VR) environments: Site 1 = 3D VR; Site 2 = 2D VR. Arm pointing movements are practiced in VR environment  designed to resemble items on a shelf in the supermarket containing everyday products like juice, yogourt, peas and soda. One VR environment was created using three-dimensional software (3D VR) and the second VR environment was created using two-dimensional software (2D VR). Pointing targets were placed on two rows in the contralateral, central and ipsilateral arm workspace above and below shoulder height. In each VR, participants practiced pointing movements 72 times per one-hour session, 3 days a week for 4 weeks (12 sessions).</interventions>
    <comparator>Practice of arm pointing movements in control environments - Site 1 = physical laboratory environment (PE); Site 2= physical home program (HP).  Participants practiced pointing movements to six targets (numbered 1-6) in the PE and HP. Movements were the same except that practice was done in different settings and subjects in HP received no performance feedback. Subjects in the PE received performance feedback in the form of an auditory signal ('whoosh') from the computer if they used excessive trunk displaceemnt. Pointing
 targets were placed on two rows in the contralateral, central and ipsilateral arm workspace above and below shoulder height. Participants practiced pointing movements 72 times per one-hour session, 3 days a week for 4 weeks (12 sessions).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this research is to compare the effects of training arm movements in four different environments where each environment offers a different level of motivation and feedback to the learner. We will also determine how learners with different initial movement and cognitive problems can use the information provided by each environment to improve their arm movement and whether this may be related to their own level of motivation. A physical therapist and psychologist will measure each peson's level of arm movement and cognitive ability. People will then be divivded according to whether their problems in each area are mild or moderate and then they will be randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups. Each group will practice arm movements to 6 different targets for 12 seesions. Two groups will practice movements in a virtual reality game like environment and two will practice in a physical environment. Three of the 4 groups(3D VR, 2D VR &amp; PE) will receive feedback on how well they make arm movements. Before and after practice and at a 3 month follow-up period, we will record how each participant points to targets.</summary>
