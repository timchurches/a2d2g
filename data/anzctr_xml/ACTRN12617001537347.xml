    <statisticalmethods>Basic description summaries of data will be performed (mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range or n(%) as appropriate) and assessed for normality. Differences in continuous and categorical outcome variables between those in the placebo and melatonin groups will be assessed using parametric or non-parametric tests as appropriate.  To assess each of the aims, univariate analysis will be performed for all variables to assess for difference between the melatonin and the placebo group. For the continuous variables, a student t-test will be used for parametric data and Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Differences in categorical variables will be reported using chi-square analysis. Multivariable analysis will be performed using linear regression for any of the significant outcome variables and potential confounding variables identified in the univariate analysis. A p-value threshold of &lt; 0.05 will be used to denote statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delirium is an acute confusional state that is a medical emergency and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Delirium can often disrupt the times when someone is sleeping or awake. Although the main management of delirium is based on treatment of the underlying causes, specific medications are sometimes necessary to manage delirium-related behaviours. These interventions include the use of sedating medications that are associated with an increased risk of substantial harm. 

Melatonin is a natural-occurring substance made in the brain that helps regulate the timing of sleep and wakefulness. It is a well-established treatment for insomnia, has a good safety profile and has a potential theoretical benefit in the management of delirium by correcting the sleep-wake cycle disruption commonly seen in delirium. Although it has been used to manage delirium in hospitals around the world for some years, there have been no scientific trials to examine its effectiveness. Melatonin is approved in Australia to treat insomnia. However it is not approved to manage delirium. Therefore, it is an experimental treatment for delirium. This means that it must be tested to see if it is an effective treatment for delirium.

This study aims to examine the effect of melatonin on delirium.
