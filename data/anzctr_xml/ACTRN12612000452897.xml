    <interventions>Arm 1: Vitamin D in powder form, 50,000 IU / dose. Given orally.
50,000 IU/ week for 8 weeks then 50,000 IU / month for 10 months. The vitamin D powder will be mixed with a cup of plain water and can be consume anytime of the day (before or after meal)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in any cardiometabolic risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia measured by fasting blood lipid profile, insulin resistance measure using HOMA-IR and high blood pressure</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 6 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in proportion of patients with metabolic syndromes. Metabolic syndrome is defined as the presence of three or more metabolic risk factors that exist in one person that is central obesity which is measured by waist circumference (men: &gt; 40 inches; women: &gt; 35 inches); fasting blood triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dL or taking medication for triglycerides, low HDL level (men: &lt; 40 mg/dL; women: &lt; 50 mg/dL) or taking medication for low HDL, fasting blood sugar of 100 mg/dL or higher or taking medication for high blood sugar (all measured by biochemical analysis test) and elevated blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or more or taking medication for high BP (measured twice by a digital sphygmomanometer).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 6 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increment in serum 25(OH)D levels.  The methods used for analysis of serum 25(OH)D measurement, will be using the radioimmunoassay  analysis method (DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 6 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in health-related quality of life. SF-36v2 health survey will be used to assess participant?s health-related quality of life on regards to physical and emotional well being for people with vitamin D deficiency and to assess if any improvements of health-related quality of life after intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 12 months</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment procedures are using the seal opaque envelope that will be kept by an independent third party who will match the participants with the allocation using the name list and allocation sequence list and put it in the envelope. The envelope will only be open by third party person when it is time to allocate the interventions during the labelling of prepacked bottles of active supplements and placebo. However, the label will only state the name of participants but not the contents to maintain the allocation concealment</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization sequence will be created using Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) statistical software and will be a 1:1 allocation by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent evidence has indicates that apart of vitamin D classical role in musculoskeletal diseases, vitamin D deficiency also associated with cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterol. Although Malaysia is a sunshine-abundant country, recent studies have found that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is significantly high. However, no study done to measure its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors in Malaysia with very limited clinical trials globally to measure the relationship between vitamin D and both the cardiometabolic risk and quality of life. This is a parallel randomized placebo control trial that investigating the effect of vitamin D supplements on both the cardiometabolic risk and quality of life in urban healthy population in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The objective of this study is to investigate whether vitamin D supplements can reduce the cardiometabolic risk and quality of life in urban premenopausal women with vitamin D deficiency.</summary>
