  <interventions>
    <interventions>High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) - heated, humidifed gas (blended air/oxygen) delivered at gas flows between 6-8 Litres per minute via the Fisher &amp; Paykel 'Optiflow Junior' circuit and prongs. HFNC will be weaned/ceased when the infant has no supplemental oxygen requirement, or has required &lt;25% supplemental oxygen for &gt;24 hours. </interventions>
    <comparator>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) - the use of short binasal prongs or mask to deliver heated, humidifed gas (blended air/oxygen) using a "bubble" CPAP device (any brand of CPAP device may be used) with set pressures between 6-8 centimetres of water. CPAP will be weaned/ceased when the infant has no supplemental oxygen requirement, or has required &lt;25% supplemental oxygen for &gt;24 hours.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment failure within 72 hours of randomisation. Treatment failure has occurred if any of the following conditions are satisfied within 72 hours of an infant being randomised:
1. The infant is receiving maximal therapy (CPAP 8 cm H2O or HFNC 8 L/min) and has a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) greater than or equal to 0.40 for more than 1 hour to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) 91-95%
2. The infant is receiving maximal therapy (CPAP 8 cm H2O or HFNC 8 L/min) and has both a pH &lt;7.20 and pCO2 &gt;60 mm Hg on two blood gas samples (which can be capillary, venous or arterial). The first sample should be collected at least 1 hour after initiation of the assigned treatment, and the second taken at least 1 hour after the first. 
3. The infant is receiving maximal therapy (CPAP 8 cm H2O or HFNC 8 L/min) and has &gt;1 apnoea receiving positive pressure ventilation within any 24-hour period, or &gt;6 apnoeas in any 6 hour period receiving intervention (stimulation or increased oxygen)
4. The treating paediatrician determines that urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation is required
5. The treating paediatrician determines that the infant requires transfer to a tertiary centre through consultation with the local newborn emergency transport service (NETS NSW or PIPER Victoria).

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be by intention-to-treat. A per protocol analysis will also be performed for the primary outcome and any important differences reported. Data will be exported from an electronic database to an electronic statistical package for analysis. 

This is a non-inferiority trial with a margin of non-inferiority of 10%. Based on data from all six potential participating centres, we estimate the rate of the primary outcome in the CPAP group will be 17%. A sample size of 750 infants (375 infants in each group) is required to demonstrate non-inferiority of HFNC with 90% power: i.e. to be 90% sure that the upper limit of a two-sided 95% CI will exclude a difference in favour of CPAP or more than 10% (www.sealedenvelope.com/power/binary-noninferior). 


The difference between the groups in the incidence of the primary outcome will be investigated using risk difference (95% confidence interval). Subgroup analysis by gestational age at birth will be performed for the primary outcome and some secondary outcomes. Secondary dichomotous outcomes will be compared with risk difference (95% CI) and a Chi-squared test. Continuous secondary outcomes will be compared with the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test.
