  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interrupted time-series study to assess the effect of the introduction of a peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) device assessment and removal tool in 3 Queensland hospitals.
There will be four study phases, Pre-baseline (T0) (one month), and Baseline (T1), Intervention (T2), and Evaluation (T3), each of 4 months duration.

Pre-baseline (T0) - 1 month. . Clinicometric testing of the I-DECIDED tool will be undertaken, including content validity assessment, clinical utility and feasibility, inter-rater and intra-rater reliability assessments.

Baseline (T1) - 4 months. Baseline observations will include: usual clinical practice of PIVC assessment and documentation; device utilisation ratios; prevalence of redundant PIVCs; IV complications; loose, moist or soiled dressings; primary BSI data. Consultation with key stakeholders, staff focus groups (n = 6 groups), bedside interviews with patients (n = 24), PIVC assessments (n = 720), and chart audits (n = 720) will be conducted.

Implementation (T2) - 4 months. The I-DECIDED tool will be implemented in 6 wards across 3 hospitals. Regular three-monthly meetings with key local opinion leaders will continue during this period. Two staff champions per ward will be identified and trained to support other staff in the use of the tool and facilitate implementation. Education sessions for staff and education brochures for patients will be developed and provided. Regular ward updates, and informal discussions about the I-DECIDED study will be conducted. Data collection will not occur during this phase.

Evaluation (T3) - 4 months. During this period the tool will continue to be used and the activities of T1 (staff focus groups (n = 6), IV assessments (n = 720), chart audits (n = 720), and patient bedside interviews (n = 24)) will be repeated. Regular meetings with key local opinion leaders will continue, and ongoing education and feedback to staff will be provided at ward in-service sessions. The purpose of this phase is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of the I-DECIDED tool for IV assessment, management and documentation of IV care.

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study, designed to ascertain feasibility of conducting a larger study, and as such is not powered for statistical significance. The predicted outcome of implementing this simple but comprehensive tool is an improved experience of IV therapy, early detection of complications, fewer redundant PIVCs, and improved documentation. The current sample size has been based upon predicted participant availability, based on data from the participating hospitals. As the study has already received enthusiastic verbal support from nursing management at each site, staff recruitment to participate in focus groups is unlikely to be difficult. The I-DECIDED tool encourages patient participation in PIVC assessment, and from our groups previous research in consumer experience of PIVCs, it is likely that the majority of patients will consent to be involved.
	Content validity assessment (T0) = 56 vascular access experts and 5-6 clinicians experienced in PIVC assessment
	Think aloud assessments (T0) = 5 staff nurses experienced in PIVC assessment
	PIVC assessments and chart audits: approximately 30 assessments/hospital x 3 hospitals x 8 time-points x 2 phases (T1, T3) = 1,440.
	Staff focus groups: 46 staff/ward x 6 wards x 2 phases (T1, T3) = 4872 staff
	Patient bedside interviews: 4 patients/ward x 6 wards x 2 phases (T1, T3) = 48 patients

Data analysis
Clinicometric properties (reliability, validity, acceptability, feasibility) of the I-DECIDED tool will be analysed [Cronbachs alpha (internal consistency), kappa calculations (inter-rater reliability), interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and content validity index (CVI)] and the tool will be modified accordingly. 
CI Ray-Barruel and statistician will have access to the final dataset. Analysis and reporting will follow the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines. Clinical effectiveness of the I-DECIDED tool will be measured by statistical comparison of prevalence trends (PIVC utilisation, redundancy, all complications, BSI rates, substandard dressings, and missing documentation) across time-points before (n = 8) and after (n = 8) the intervention. Statistical process control (SPC) analysis to assess the effects of the intervention will be used.63 SPC charts will display data collected at the 16 time-points and indicate patterns of variation over the duration of the study, with built-in thresholds (upper and lower limits) to highlight significant variations in practice, such as seasonal bed occupancy. Bed occupancy data and staffing ratios will be collected on the study screening log at each time-point for this purpose.
Taped interviews with staff and patients will be transcribed and data analysed based on Norwood's framework using an inductive analysis process to allow themes to emerge from the data. Two researchers will independently conduct a simple thematic analysis of the audio transcripts and field notes of the focus groups and bedside interviews. Key themes and concepts will be categorised, and then the researchers will meet to discuss and achieve consensus on the meaning of the data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To test the effectiveness of an invasive device assessment and removal tool (I-DECIDED) in improving Intravenous (IV) catheter care in hospital patients.
Significance: Each year in Australia, almost 10 million patients are admitted to hospital. Around 70% will need an IV catheter for fluids or medicines. Yet 30-50% of IVs have painful complications or stop working before treatment is finished. Complications leading to failure include infiltration, extravasation, occlusion, accidental removal, or symptoms of phlebitis (pain, redness, swelling, palpable cord, hardness of the vein, red streak along the vein, and/or purulence). The failure of an IV catheter before treatment is completed requires the re-siting of a new device, leading to discomfort for the patient and often delays in treatment. A recent economic analysis of data from a multi-site Queensland randomised trial showed the mean cost of catheter replacement was approximately $70 when staff time and equipment was calculated.
Expected outcomes and benefits: As well as being an assessment tool, the I-DECIDED mnemonic encourages patient participation. I-DECIDED is also an audit and education tool, teaching nurses and doctors the essential components of IV care. A structured and comprehensive approach to IV assessment and care would promote early detection of complications, and prompt removal of IV catheters when no longer needed. This will reduce unnecessary pain and suffering for patients, decrease the risk of potentially deadly bloodstream infection, and reduce treatment delays and hospital costs. This could benefit millions of Australians annually.
Future directions
The proposed study will test the utility of the I-DECIDED tool in guiding assessment and care of peripheral IV catheters. Following the collection of pilot data and feedback from staff and patients, it is likely that the study will be expanded to test the tool for assessing other IV catheters (non-tunnelled central venous catheters, peripherally-inserted central venous catheters) in other hospital units. Additional approvals will be sought at that time, as appropriate.
I will work towards I-DECIDED being implemented in partnership with the Australian Commission of Safety &amp; Quality in Healthcare. I-DECIDED will provide a platform for innovation and research projects in other invasive medical devices, including urinary catheters. The mnemonic I-DECIDED works in Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian, and could be made global. Nurse collaborators from my existing Australian and international research networks have expressed interest in trialling the I-DECIDED tool.
