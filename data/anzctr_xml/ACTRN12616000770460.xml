  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will have abnormal blood vessels about the study knee embolised. Participants will receive a local anaesthetic (1% lignocaine) injected into their groin. Femoral artery access will be obtained with a 3French sheath and a micro-catheter introduced. Digital subtraction angiogram using contrast (iodine-containing contrast medium) will be obtained of the knee identifying abnormal neovasculature arising from the genicular arterial branches. The abnormal vessels will be embolised with &lt;500um embolic material. The guide wire will be removed. A dressing will be applied to the puncture site.

All procedures will be conducted by a fully qualified interventional radiologist who is trained to perform vascular embolisation.

The procedure is expected to take 30-60minutes depending on the number of vessels embolised.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Adverse events
Close monitoring for adverse events will occur in the first month post intervention. Participants will be observed for 4 hours post intervention and discharged home if no adverse events occur. Participants will then be assessed for adverse events the next day (phone) and at weekly intervals (alternating phone and in person) until four weeks.

Pain, function, and quality of life
The primary analysis will be performed on the transformed KOOS pain scale, using percentage reduction from baseline and a two-sample t-test if no dropout occurs and all 12 month data is available on each participant. Normality of the outcomes will be assessed, and if the assumptions are not met, the primary analysis will be conducted using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. 

In the case of dropouts or missing data at 12 months, the primary analysis will be conducted under a linear regression model, with random effects accounting for intra-individual correlations.

Secondary outcomes:
Outcome data that is available at multiple time points will also be analysed using linear regression model, with random effects accounting for intra-individual correlations. Differences between intervention and placebo arms will be analysed and presented for each timepoint using a time-by-intervention product term. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability around the world. OA involves the breakdown of joint cartilage, but it also appears to include the proliferation of blood vessels and nerves about the joint. It is suggested that these blood vessels and nerves contribute to the experience of pain. One pilot study found that embolising abnormal vessels about the knee substantially improved individual's pain.

Prior to a full randomised trial, five participants will be recruited to this non-randomised pilot study. The purpose of the pilot study is to test the protocol for feasibility and assess for effects on pain and function and any unexpected effects due to the intervention in the first month post procedure.

All pilot study participants will unblinded and will receive the intervention. Participants will be reassessed the day following the intervention and then once a week for the first month. At each assessment, participants will complete an abbreviated assessment (KOOS, Global Assessment of Change, Six Minute Walk Test and 30-second Chair Stand Test). Participants will then complete full assessments (using all assessment tools) at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months following the procedure.</summary>
