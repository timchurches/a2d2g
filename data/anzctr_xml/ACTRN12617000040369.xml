  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the treatment arm of the trial will swallow four 15mm long soft-gel capsules of fish oil every day for six months. This will equate to a daily dose of 1990mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 470mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Participants will be asked to take all four capsules in the morning with breakfast and a glass of water, however the timing may be altered for any participants who do not tolerate this, or do not consume breakfast; the daily dose will not be altered. The supplement will be issued by trained personnel from various Concussion Clinics, with information regarding dose and storage presented in both written and oral format. Participants will be provided with a diary to record when they have taken each dose, and note any potential side effects. They will be contacted via telephone by the lead researcher each month,  to discuss tolerance and adherence to the treatment. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control arm of the trial will swallow four 15mm long soft-gel capsules of sunflower oil every day for six months, equating to a daily dose of 4000mg sunflower oil. These capsules are identical to the fish oil capsules of the treatment arm of the trial. Participants will be asked to take all four capsules in the morning with breakfast and a glass of water, however the timing may be altered for any participants who do not tolerate this, or do not consume breakfast; the daily dose will not be altered. The supplement will be issued by trained personnel from various Concussion Clinics, with information regarding dose and storage presented in both written and oral format. Participants will be provided with a diary to record when they have taken each dose, and note any potential side effects.

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis was conducted to calculate the minimum sample size needed. To detect an effect size of partial eta squared =.02 and provide a statistical power equal to 0.8 at an a level of .05, a minimum sample size of 82 participants is required. In order to utilise the full amount of available supplement, 96 participants will be recruited. 

Independent samples T-tests will be used to test for equivalence between groups on all dependent measures at baseline. 

One way mixed between-within analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests will analyse the outcome variables. The between subjects factor for this model will be the group at two levels: treatment and control. The within subjects factor will be the outcome measures at baseline, time two, and time three. Such models will be created for each outcome variable. 

Correlation analysis will be used to examine the relationship between injury beliefs and outcome. 
	
Data will be analysed using the latest available version of SPSS for Windows.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, is a major public health problem  for many countries. In New Zealand, over 90% of traumatic brain injuries are mild and occur most frequently as a result of falls, motor vehicle accidents, and assaults. The symptoms of mTBI can last anywhere from days to several months, or even years, after the initial incident. Symptoms may be physical (e.g. dizziness, headaches) emotional (e.g. anxiety, depression), and/or cognitive (e.g. difficulty with memory, attention, and processing speed). Naturally, many individuals struggle to perform the duties of their work and/or everyday life while suffering such symptoms, thus effective treatments are being sought. Fish oil is a commonly consumed over-the-counter nutritional supplement that may be effective for treating the symptoms of mTBI. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a key component of fish oil, is the most abundant lipid in the human brain. It is important for brain development, both the structure and function of mature brain cells, and has shown efficacy at treating mTBI in rodents, as well as enhancing cognition in human adults. This supplement has not yet been the focus of a randomised control trial for treating mTBI in humans, which is necessary before it can be considered an effective treatment. For the present study, 96 mTBI sufferers will be assigned to either the treatment group consuming 4g fish oil (1990mg DHA) per day, or the control group consuming 4g sunflower oil per day, for six months. Participants will undergo cognitive testing and mood screening via telephone at baseline, three months, and six months before results are analysed for change over time and groups are compared. It is hypothesised that the fish oil group will display fewer mTBI symptoms than the placebo group at the three month and six month time points, thus exhibiting a quicker recovery. </summary>
