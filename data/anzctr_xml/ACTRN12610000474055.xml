    <interventions>This research is a cross-sectional study comparing the lower limb electromiographic (EMG) activation pattern between females with and without patellofemoral pain during sit to stand and ascent stair tasks.  Subjects will be reported to the Laboratory for a single testing session. 
After cleaning the skin with isopropyl alcohol, active surface
EMG recording electrodes (Ag/Ag Cl) will placed on quadriceps muscle, at standardized sites on the dominant leg,  determined as the one with which they would kick a ball. A ground electrode will attached to distal tibial region . All electrodes will taped to the skin to reduce movement artifacts and remained in place throughout the study. EMG signals will sampled by a 12-bit A/D converter board with a 4 kHz frequency, and band-pass filtered at
0.011.5 kHz. Raw EMG data were digitally filtered at frequency bandwidth of 20500 Hz and the root mean square (RMS) was calculated. Each group will realized two types of exercises. All subjects wearing differents shoes stood in front of the stair. The subjects were made ready
to ascend the stair with complete heel contact of the dominant leg, and when instructed to start they detached their opposite leg at a rate of 80 steps/min, stepping side to side for 3 s with the aid of a metronome. 
Squats: Participants were seated on a standard chair of height 50 cm, with their feet a comfortable width apart. Foot position was kept the same between tests.
They were then asked to stand, in their own time without using their arms to assist, and remain standing until requested to sit. For all the requested activities, the volunteer will be using two different types of footwear: tennis and high-heeled shoes. The duration of study will be of 6 months. The approximate duration of the single testing session was 60-90 minutes (20 minutes with no shoes, 20 minutes with tennis shoes and 20 minutes with high-heeled shoes).The first 20 minutes involved performing a physical evaluation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In our society, it is observed an increasing number of models, heights and types of high heels. The frequent use of high-heeled shoes can be responsible for alterations of the corporal mechanics. Considering the importance of appropriate support for the lower limbs, the aim of this study was to assess, by using  EMG, whether the type of shoes has any influence on quadriceps muscles activity changes.</summary>
