  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participation in a Bipolar Disorder Clinic involving Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy and medication management over an 18 month period. The intervention will be delivered to individuals initially on a weekly basis, followed by fortnightly and then monthly. Apart from the initial 12 weekly sessions the frequency of sessions is determined by participant's needs. The psychotherapy sessions will be delivered by experienced psychotherapists (nurses and social workers) and are of 60 minutes duration. The medication management involves regular two-monthly sessions with a psychiatrist and additional sessions as required.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lower rates of relapse at 18 months because of better self-management than patients randomised to general practice. The primary outcome measure is the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the Bipolar Disorder Clinic will prove more cost-effective than usual care over the 18 month intervention period. 1)	A cost analysis of service use with all direct costs (inpatient admission; outpatient admission, emergency department visit, GP visit) taken into account. Data will be collected from computerised patient records for which an electronic protocol has been developed. All unit costs based on aggregated cost estimates derived from averaged CDHB data will be calculated from randomization for both intervention and control groups. In addition the costs associated with the intervention (therapist time and psychiatrist time) will be calculated in 30 minute units.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised controlled trial of a Bipolar Disorder Clinic in which one group of patients will receive usual care (usually general practice follow-up) and the other group will participate in a Bipolar Disorder Clinic that focuses on a combination of psychotherapy and medication management. The intervention focuses on promoting self-management skills such as medication use, early warning signs, lifestyle patterns, and triggers. The primary aim is to decrease the patients mood episodes and the secondary aim is to reduce service utilization and thus be more cost effective than usual care. The trial addresses a current gap in mental health care for bipolar disorder by examining the clinical effectiveness of a long-term model of care delivery that takes a patient-centred approach. It is envisaged that this pragmatic, multi-disciplinary study will enable patients with bipolar disorder to have more skills and confidence in managing their disorder.</summary>
