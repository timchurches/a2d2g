  <interventions>
    <interventions>6-week dietary intervention using a diet containing 25% energy from fat. Core foods for the diet will be delivered to the subjects. Such foods include: low fat milk and yoghurts (including frozen yoghurt), oils, low fat bran muffins and lean meats. These foods will be incorporated into the daily diet of the subjects and so they will consume these foods when they would normally have their meals and snacks. These foods will replace the higher fat alternatives in the subjects' diets.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A recent discovery in our laboratory demonstrated that in comparison with lean subjects, the alimentary canal (oral and gastrointestinal tract) response to fats and fatty acids in foods was attenuated in overweight and obese human subjects. This data supports evidence that overweight and obese individuals consume excess dietary fat. There are two possibilities for these findings, first, that consumption of a high-fat diet induces environmental adaptive changes in the bodys sensitivity to fat, or, second, that genetic predisposition determines an individuals fat sensitivity. Using both monozygous and dizygous twin pairs; we will estimate the magnitude of fat sensitivity heritability and its links to obesity.</summary>
