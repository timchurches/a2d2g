    <interventions>Evaluation of impact and efficacy in a public psychiatric service of a device using micro-current applied at the ear lobe, for major, mild and minor depressive disorders, and generalized anxiety disorders. The intervention comprises: A cycle of auricular treatment protocol with Radioelectric Asymetric Conveyer (REAC). The REAC is a Radioelectric medical device. The REAC protocol used, called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF), involves the application of a probe of the REAC on specific points of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The ONPF protocol is activated in a precise sequence on seven auricular points. The protocol envisages 18 sessions lasting 3.5 seconds each (7X 500 mms) on alternating days, for eight (8) weeks. Assessment, at baseline and immediately at the end of treatment, with Symptomatic Check List (SCL-90R) and Hamilton Test</interventions>
