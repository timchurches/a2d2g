  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study will examine the efficacy of modafinil to counteract possible daytime sleepiness after CPAP withdrawal in long-term CPAP users. Subjects will be given an 'Autoset' CPAP machine to take home to assess their CPAP compliance and subjects will also be given an Actiwatch to assess sleep-wake activity for 7 days. Subjects will then report to the laboratory where they will undergo overnight polysomnographies using CPAP for two nights and then for two nights without using CPAP. During the waking hours subjects will complete a variety of neurocognitive tasks and questionniares. After a washout period of 28 days, subjects will repeat the protocol, receiving the other study medication.</interventions>
    <comparator>Modafinil (200mg) or placebo tablets will be adminstered orally in the morning once daily, on mornings after CPAP withdrawal. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcomes that will be measured include psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performanceanalysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PVT will be measured whilst subjects are reporting to the laboratory at 2 hourly intervals from 0730 to 2130 hrs</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcomes that will be measured include EEG power spectral analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>EEG will be recorded concurrently during the driving simulator task which will occur at 1345hrs</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective sleepiness which will be measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale using a subset of the IntegNeuro Cognitive Performance Profile. </outcome>
      <timepoint>These outcome variables will be recorded whilst subjects are reporting to the laboratory between 0730 and 2130 hrs, except symptoms of sleep disordered breathing which will form part of overnight polysomnographies.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Driving simulator performance (AusEd Driving Simulator), symptoms of sleep disordered breathing, sleep architecture, latency and duration will also be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These outcome variables will be recorded whilst subjects are reporting to the laboratory between 0730 and 2130 hrs, except symptoms of sleep disordered breathing which will form part of overnight polysomnographies.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
