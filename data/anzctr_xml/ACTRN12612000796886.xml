  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will utilise a crossover placebo-controlled, single-blind mixed design. 

The two investigational products under examination will include 0.50g/kg and 0.65g/kg alcohol (vodka; 37.5% alcohol by volume Smirnoff Red Label No. 21) and 250ml, 500ml, and 750ml Red Bull (Registered Trademark) Energy Drink (Red Bull GmBH, Austria). The alcohol doses were selected to achieve an average peak blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 0.08% and the energy drink dose is equivalent to one, two, and three standard energy drinks servings (i.e., 250ml containing 21g sucrose, 5g glucose, 1g taurine, 80mg caffeine, 60mg glucuronolactone, 50mg inositol, and B vitamins). The alcohol dose will be decreased to 85% for females due to their decreased body water to fat ratio. 

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three alcohol treatment conditions (placebo, 0.50g/kg, or 0.65g/kg) counterbalanced for sex. They will then attend four experimental sessions in which they will receive their allocated alcohol dose with a different energy drink dose (placebo, 250ml, 500ml, and 750ml Red Bull Energy Drink), administered in counterbalanced order. 

Administration of placebo and active alcohol and energy drink treatment conditions will be identical. The alcohol and energy drink portions will be poured together to form a mixed beverage, which will then be split into four portions and served in opaque lidded cups with a straw. Participants will have four successive five minutes blocks to orally consume each portion at their own pace, resulting in a total consumption time of 20 minutes.

Experimental sessions will be conducted at the same time of day for each participant between the hours of 0900 and 1900, with a minimum of two days and a maximum of 10 days separating sessions to ensure washout.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo alcohol will be achieved by floating 5ml alcohol/250ml energy drink on top of the energy drink constituent and spraying the opaque lidded cup with a fine alcohol mist. Placebo energy drink will be achieved via administration of a Red Bull Energy Drink minus the active ingredients (excluding glucose and sucrose). Those active ingredients removed will include caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, inositol,and vitamin B complex.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been argued that alcohol mixed with energy drink (AmED) consumption results in a misperception of intoxication, whereby participants recorded lower subjective ratings on specific indices of intoxication following AmED consumption relative to alcohol only consumption, despite simliar alcohol-induced deficits on objective performance outcomes. However, previous studies have yielded equivocal findings in regards to the subjective and objective physiological, cognitive performance, and motor performance outcomes of AmED consumption relative to alcohol only consumption, and there has been relatively no exploration of the dose-dependent effects of these substances on such indices.  Furthermore, while this misperception of intoxication has been argued to result in increased risk-taking, there has been no objective measurement of risk-taking post-AmED consumption. Consequently, the aim of the current study will be to establish the dose-dependent impact of ED and alcohol ingested independently and in combination on (i) objective measures of cognitive and motor performance, physiology (e.g., heart rate), and behavioural risk-taking, and (ii) subjective measures of intoxication.</summary>
