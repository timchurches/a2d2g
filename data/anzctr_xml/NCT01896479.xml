  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral cabozantinib at a
      60 mg dose compared with a 140 mg dose in subjects with progressive, metastatic MTC. It will
      test if the lower dose results in similar progression free survival (PFS) and overall
      response rate (ORR) with fewer adverse events compared to the PFS, ORR and adverse events
      found in previous clinical trials of 140 mg.</summary>
