  <interventions>
    <interventions>The UWS School Holiday Basketball Program is a five-day basketball program assessing whether coaches who attended coach education sessions can increase their female athletes' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and reduce their time spent inactive.

Half of the coaches enrolled will attend two coach education sessions following the first two days of the UWS School Holiday Basketball Program; lasting approximately two hours each session. Coach education sessions will only run on the first two days of the program. During these sessions, strategies to increase MVPA and decrease inactivity will be discussed. Coaches will also receive feedback on the physical activity levels of the athletes they coached during the program that day; as well as lesson context information based on a direct observation system (System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time; McKenzie, Sallis, &amp; Nader, 1991). 

The use of feedback allows coaches to see how active their athletes were and how they're spending their time during training (in what lesson contexts). The aims of the coach education sessions, then, are to assist coaches in identifying areas of their training sessions where it is likely they can incorporate more physical activity at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity and decrease the time spent inactive. 

Intervention coaches will continue to receive feedback on the physical activity levels of the athletes as well as their lesson context information at the end of each day of the five-day program. A researcher will discretely deliver the feedback form to intervention coaches at the end of each program day.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Athletes will be enrolled if a parent/guardian contacts the primary researcher and the parent/guardian's daughter meets inclusion/exclusion criteria (1. female, 2. aged 9-12, 3. intends on attending the program for its duration). If eligible, parents will be provided with informed consent/assent forms.

Participants interested in coaching the program will be enrolled if they have basketball coaching credentials and experience coaching girls basketball. They will also be informed that participation may involve attending two coach education sessions. 

Once baseline data is obtained, coaches will be pair-matched by average group step counts per minute during training and one coach out of each pair will be randomly selected to attend coach education sessions (intervention). A computer generated program will be used to randomly assign a coach from each pair to either intervention or control conditions.

A computer generated program will be also be used to randomly assign half of the athletes to either intervention or control conditions. Simple randomisation will be used.
 
The allocation will be concealed as it will be done by central randomisation by computer.

    <sequence>Computer generated random numbers will be used for athletes. 

Coaches will be pair-matched using the average step counts their group of athletes accumulated during their baseline training sessions.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>On the basis of 80% power to detect a significant change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) between groups, using an effect size of d = 0.6, a sample size of 36 female athletes for each group will be needed. Assuming a 10% attrition rate, a total sample of 80 female athletes will be required.

Our effect size (d = 0.6) is consistent with the findings of a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of interventions designed to increase children and adolescents' MVPA in a similar setting (physical education), d = 0.62 (Lonsdale et al., 2013).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aims of this two-armed randomised controlled trial are to assess whether coaches who attended coach education sessions can increase their female athletes' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and reduce their time spent inactive during training sessions over a 5-day basketball program; compared to a no-treatment control group. Therefore, we hypothesise that:

1) Girls who are being coached by coaches who have attended coach education sessions will spend a greater percentage of time moderately-to-vigorously physically active compared to girls who are coached by coaches who did not attend coach education sessions.

2) Girls who are being coached by coaches who have attended coach education sessions will spend a lower percentage of time inactive compared to girls who are coached by coaches who did not attend coach education sessions.

The target population for this study will be girls aged 9-12 years willing to partake in a 5-day basketball camp; and coaches, with basketball coaching certification and experience coaching girls, willing to coach a 5-day basketball camp. </summary>
