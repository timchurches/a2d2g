    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Lenalidomide 15mg
Treatment: drugs - Brentuximab Vedotin 1.8 mg/Kg

Experimental: Lenalidomide &amp; brentuximab vedotin - Brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/Kg Lenalidomide 15 mg


Treatment: drugs: Lenalidomide 15mg
At commencement of study : Lenalidomide will commence at 15 mg daily for days 1-14 of each cycle. Maximum number of cycles = 16. This is a dose finding study so doses will be adjusted depending on toxicity assessment over the course of the study. Dose may vary from 5 mg -25 mg daily depending on dose escalation results and recommendation of safety committee

Treatment: drugs: Brentuximab Vedotin 1.8 mg/Kg
At commencement of study : Brentuximab vedotin 1.8mg/kg IV on day 1, repeated every 21 days. Maximum number of cycles = 16. This is a dose finding study so doses will be adjusted depending on toxicity assessment over the course of the study. Dose may be either 1.2 mg/Kg q21 days or 1.8 mg/kg q21 days depending on dose escalation results and recommendation of safety committee

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is investigating the combination of Brentuximab vedotin and lenalidomide in the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma or cutaneous T cell lymphoma or
      Hodgkin lymphoma.

      It is hypothesised that lenalidomide may augment the actions of Brentuximab vedotin in these
      patient groups. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      of the combination treatment, which can be used in subsequent studies. The study will also
      investigate disease response and survival.

      Participants will receive Brentuximab vedotin (once every 21 days i.e. 1 cycle) and
      lenalidomide (daily from day 1 -14 of each cycle) for a maximum of 48 weeks and will be
      followed for a subsequent 6 months after the end of treatment.</summary>
