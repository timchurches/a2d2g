  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive 12 x 45-minute training sessions with a physiotherapist (trainer) over 4-weeks (3 sessions per week). Individualised training will involve repetitive and incrementally progressed task-oriented reaching in sitting. Participants will be instructed to push their arm along a linear slide at a comfortable speed while receiving real-time visual feedback of performance. To augment full range movement, electrical stimulation to muscles of the arm will be applied as required using the Empi 300PV unit (St Paul, MN, USA). Stimulation parameters will consist of a 1 second ascending ramp, and a 4 to 20 second duration of 200-sec pulse width biphasic stimulation at 35 Hz. All training will be recorded by the trainer in a logbook.
Training will be combined with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). Stimulation will occur for the first 5-seconds of each movement attempt to augment voluntary motor drive. Stimulation will be delivered by a battery-driven non-invasive brain stimulator (Neuroconn, Germany) through conductive rubber electrodes, placed in saline soaked sponges. The noise signal will contain all frequencies (101  640 Hz) up to half the sampling rate (1280 sps). The electrodes will be positioned over C3/C4 as per the 10/20 international system for EEG electrode placement: the stimulation electrode positioned over the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) and the reference electrode positioned over the contralateral supra-orbital region. All tRNS parameters will be recorded in a separate log by an unblinded intervener. The stimulating unit will be placed out of sight of the participant and trainer at all times.</interventions>

To determine the effect of tRNS on clinical outcome measures, a non-parametric, mixed effects model in a 2 group (active tRNS, sham-tRNS) Ã— 3 phases (0, 4, 12 weeks) design will be implemented for each variable. This will be followed by between-groups comparisons.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke survivors with severe upper limb paresis have the poorest functional prognosis. There is growing evidence of the benefits of repetitive training to promote recovery of upper limb function. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as tRNS, can augment activity within the cortical areas that are engaged during various forms of training. The aim of this study is to investigate the therapeutic and neuroplastic effects of combining repetitive training with tRNS in stroke survivors with chronic and severe upper limb paresis. A triple-blind randomised controlled pilot trial will be conducted. Ten stroke survivors will be randomly allocated to 4-weeks of SMART Arm training with active tRNS or sham-tRNS. To determine the clinical benefit, all participants will be assessed pre- and post-training and 2-months follow-up using a range of impairment, activity, participation and quality of life measures. To determine the structural (DTI) and functional (resting state fMRI) connectivity of cortical motor regions, all participants will undergo a 3T MRI pre- and post-training. </summary>
