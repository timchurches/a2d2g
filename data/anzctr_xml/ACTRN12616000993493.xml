  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention will be enrolled into a supervised exercise program, whereby they will attend a group exercise classes and be lead through the exercises. An Accredited Exercise Physiologist will be employed to conduct the supervised exercise program, and have no involvement with the assessments.
The exercise program consists of a warmup, followed by a series of eight exercises that were developed by the Chief Investigator to strengthen the foot muscles (Short Foot exercise, heel raises, ankle inversion/eversion/dorsiflexion, toe/hallux flexion and big toe pulls). Most exercises will be performed using exercise bands (66fit latex, Physio Supplies, Spalding, UK), with the resistance level starting from light (yellow) and progressing through to xheavy (blue). The level of exercise difficulty is progressively increased throughout the 12 week program, by increasing either the strength of the resistance bands or the number of repetitions. The number of repetitions and resistance is prescribed each week, however, if a participant finds an exercise too difficult the resistance is not increased and attempted at the next session.
All participants will be asked to attend the exercise classes (45 minutes) three times a week, for 12 weeks. Class attendance is recorded by the EP.</interventions>

      <outcome>Single-leg balance time will be used as a  clinical measure of balance. Participants stand with their weight evenly distributed across both feet, with their eyes open and focused on a point on the wall/floor.  Keeping their arms by their sides, each participant will be asked to lift the non-test foot off the floor and try to maintain their balance as long as possible. The test (and timer) was stopped after 60 s or when the lifted foot was placed on the floor.  Participants will be given two attempts on each leg unless they were able to complete 60 s on their first attempt.  If a participant can complete at least 10 s on the eyes-open component, the task progresses to performing the test with their eyes closed.  </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses: Data will initially be checked for normality and determine any differences between groups in baseline data.  Main comparative analyses between groups will then be performed using a repeated measures analysis of variance.  A comparison between pre and post will allow us to determine whether changes in the intervention are greater than the control group. 
Scores from the Foot Health Status Questionnaire will not be normally distributed, so the between-group difference will be determined by comparing the change in score between baseline and follow-up using a Kruskal-Wallis test.  
Sample size: A total of 64 patients are needed for this two-treatment parallel-design study. The probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true difference in toe strength between treatments is 1.800 units. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the response variable is 2.5. An additional 18% is required for the intervention group to allow for drop-out.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is one of Australias greatest health issues, affecting more than 1.5 million Australians. One of the most devastating consequences of the disease is deterioration in foot health that, in severe cases, can lead to amputation. The feet are one of the
first parts of the body to be affected by diabetes resulting in muscle weakness, poor circulation and a loss of sensitivity. Clearly, addressing the loss of foot muscle strength and restoring normal foot function will have important implications for the thousands of
adults with diabetes who suffer from poor foot health.
This study will determine the feasibility and effectiveness an exercise intervention that aims to increase foot muscle strength in people with diabetes. Upon recruitment into the project, participants will undergo a baseline assessment and will then be randomised into either a control or supervised exercise group. We hypothesise that after completing the resistance training program, participants will display improved foot muscle strength and decreased forefoot plantar pressures. 
The research will address critical health issues related to the ageing foot, with ancillary benefits in the context of falls prevention and foot care for at risk populations. The outcomes of the project will provide vital evidence to develop treatments to restore foot function to this vulnerable group within our community.</summary>
