  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is 'Goal Directed Nutrition Therapy' involving the use of indirect calorimetry (IC) to assess energy expenditure, and then targeting the provision of energy from enteral or parenteral nutrition to match this.
To use IC to measure a ventilated patients energy expenditure, the indirect calorimeter is connected to their ventilator circuit to measure the gas exchange and calculate expended energy.
Participants in the intervention group will have IC within 24 hours of enrollment and then twice weekly until 14 days or extubation. The test will be carried out by a dietitian. The duration of each test will vary depending on the patient, however the usual duration is 5-20 minutes.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients will be screened for eligibility in The Alfred ICU. Those meeting the inclusion criteria and exempt of the exclusion criteria should be considered for enrolment. Patients will be screened daily on weekdays using patient lists and ward round by the project manager.
Patients will be unable to provide prospective informed consent, as they will be sedated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Informed consent will be obtained from the most appropriate Person Responsible, in accordance with section 4.4.10 of the NHMRC National Statement. Delayed consent for continued participation and long-term follow up will be sought from the participant when they have suitably recovered capacity.
Eligible patients will be enrolled by study personnel and then randomised using a manual randomisation technique.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation. 40 opaque envelopes contained "goal directed nutrition" and 40 contained "standard care", these were shuffled and then when a patient in enrolled the front envelope was taken to allocate the patient. 10 envelopes from each arm were labelled before recruitment commenced to identify those who will also be enrolled in the sub-study.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The proposed sample size is based on data from previous nutrition studies conducted in Australia and New Zealand. Assuming a mean daily energy delivery of 1300+/-400 kcal/day in the control (usual treatment) group and expecting at least a 20% increase in targeted energy group, using a 2-groups t-test at 5% significance and 80% power, the estimated minimum required sample size is: n=38 per group (i.e. 76 in total).

Data analysis will be carried out using the Statistical package for the social sciences, version 20 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Data will be assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data will be expressed as means or medians and standard deviations (SDs) or standard error of the mean (SEM).
Appropriate statistical tests (parametric and non parametric tests) will be carried out to determine differences between and within groups. Where significance is observed, appropriate post-hoc tests will be employed.  Statistical significance will be determined as p&lt;0.05.
A biostatistician will be consulted to ensure correct statistical procedures are employed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study of 80 obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30Kg/m2) ICU patients we will estimate requirements and deliver nutrition as per current standard practice in 40 patients; the remaining 40 patients will have their energy requirements measured using indirect calorimetry and the provision of nutrition therapy will be targeted to meet this value. We will measure important outcomes to enable us to determine whether this goal directed approach allows nutrition therapy to better meet the patients requirements, and also whether this difference impacts on the patients recovery.
We hypothesize that patients who receive Goal Directed Nutrition Therapy will receive a higher proportion of their energy needs (energy delivered divided by measured energy expenditure) and that this may lead to improved clinical and functional outcomes.</summary>
