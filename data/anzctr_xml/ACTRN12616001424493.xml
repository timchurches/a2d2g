  <interventions>
    <interventions> The  written draft  of structured educational program about anemia during pregnancy was converted to a single video for 15- minutes duration.  The information in the video record will be given by the voice of Specialist midwife in combination of PowerPoint slides 
The areas covered in the video records were: Introduction to pregnancy and anemia of pregnancy, causes and predisposing factors of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy, the effect of anemia in pregnancy, signs, and symptoms, management of iron deficiency anemia, which includes iron therapy, dietary management, and prevention of anemia. 
The video and its content were validated by specialists in the field of obstetric health nursing.
The intervention will be given as video record  to participants in the experimental group 
 from the researcher via a WhatsApp  application on their smartphones, to make sure that the participant will adhere to the intervention and all of them will watch the video, WhatsApp application will show two blue check marks   next to  send messages,  that indicate the recipient has read the message or seen the video.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a health information package in terms of empowering the pregnant women to modify their health care behavior and take appropriate action to combat anemia in pregnancy. 
This aim was achieved through the following:
Assessing knowledge and knowledge related practices of pregnant women regarding iron deficiency anemia.
Adopt and implement health information package program for pregnant women with IDA regarding knowledge of IDA risk factors, iron rich foods and the importance of intake of iron supplementation and their practice toward iron intake.
Evaluating the effect of health information package program on the compliance, knowledge and hemoglobin level among anemic pregnant women. 
we hypothesized that Jordanian pregnant women who receive health information package program will experience a higher level of knowledge, compliance and a higher hemoglobin level than those who will not receive the planned health educational program
