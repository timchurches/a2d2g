  <interventions>
    <interventions>The device is a muscle-stimulator garment that incorporates a wireless-triggered stimulator cuff which emitts electrical impulses known as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES). The garment is worn on the forearm and triggered when the user clicks his/her teeth. The tooth clicks (vibrations) are detected by an earpiece, similar to a hearing aid, that sends a radio signal to the stimulator cuff. This in turn stimulates the hand to open or close, allowing the patients to grasp and release objects. The garmet will be used five times a week for up to one hour each session, over the 8 week intervention period. Patients will continue to receive standard care while participating in the study. The study intervention will be in addition to standard care. 

The stimulator system has been approved by the Canadian Standards Association. The device is not yet available in Australia, but will be obtained from the inventor, Professor Arthur Prochazka, University of Alberta, Canada when funding for the study becomes available.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group for this study will be standard care already provided for hand function to patients with a spinal cord injury. Standard care will provided as per the individual patients standard treatment plan for their injury.</comparator>

    <concealment>Partiticpants will participate in a screening visit and a baseline visit prior to randomisation.
Eligible participants will be randomised to one of two groups, namely:
1. Group A - Experimental group: FES-assisted hand exercise plus standard care,
2. Group B - Control group: standard care alone. 

Randomisation will be stratified by site and baseline Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) score (&lt;=21 versus &gt;21) and co-ordinated by a central randomisation unit. Upon completion of all screening and baseline assessments and suitability checks, a participant eligibility checklist will be completed by the Site Coordinator and signed by the Principal Investigator. This checklist will be sent to the central randomisation unit who will notify the Site Coordinator of treatment assignment in writing. This will not be disclosed to the Blinded Assessors.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomised controlled phase III trial in patients with tetraplegia (a spinal cord injury). A total of 78 participants will be randomised into two groups; 1. the experimental group and 2. the control group. The control group will receive standard rehabilitation care, while the experimental group will receive standard rehabilitation care plus the study treatment which involves one hour of extra hand training using a specialised glove and computer workstation, 5 times a week.
The primary objective is to determine if the study treatment is more effective than standard rehabilitation care alone in participants with tetraplegia. The secondary objectives involve collecting exploratory data to support primary objective, including an economic analysis. 
Total study duration is 3 years, including an 18 month recruitment period, an 8-week treatment period followed by 6 month and 12 month follow up assessments. 
The study treatment will be assessed by a blinded assessor (the assessor will not know which group the participants are in) using standard physiotherapy/occupational therapy assessments which involve grasping and releasing different objects and performing everyday tasks as well as quality of life questionnaires.

Functional electrical stimulation combined with task-specific training provided in addition to standard care is more effective in improving hand function than standard care alone.</summary>
