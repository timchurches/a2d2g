  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of 0 or 1 (Efficacy of Ixekizumab in Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque Ps Measure: sPGA) - The sPGA is the physician's determination of the participant's Ps lesions overall at a given time point. Lesions were categorized by descriptions for induration, erythema, and scaling. Participants Ps were assessed as 0 (clear), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe), or 5 (very severe). An sPGA responder was defined as having a post-baseline sPGA score of "0" or "1" with at least a 2-point improvement from baseline.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving =75% Improvement in Ps Area and Severity Index (PASI75) (Efficacy of Ixekizumab in Participants With Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Measure: PASI) - The PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0 (0%) to 6 (90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema, induration and scaling with a scores range from 0 (no involvement) to 4 (severe involvement). Each area is scored separately and the scores then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as: sum of severity parameters for each region * area score * weighing factor [head (0.1), upper limbs (0.2), trunk (0.3), lower limbs (0.4)]. Overall scores range from 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the most severe disease). Participants achieving PASI75 were defined as having an improvement of =75% in the PASI score compared to baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Dermatology-Specific Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Score - DLQI is a participant-administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include 0 (not at all), 1 (a little), 2 (a lot), and 3 (very much) and unanswered ("not relevant") responses were scored as "0." Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher score indicating greater quality of life is impairment. A 5-point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) - The NAPSI is a numeric, reproducible, objective tool for evaluation of fingernail Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps by area of involvement in the fingernail unit. The fingernail is divided with imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the fingernail) and fingernail matrix Ps 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in 4 quadrants of the matrix), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of any of the features of fingernail bed or matrix Ps in each quadrant. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores in fingernail bed and fingernail matrix from each quadrant (maximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, then the sum of all fingernails equals the total NAPSI score with a range from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating more severe psoriasis. LS mean change from baseline was calculated using MMRM.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of Body Surface Area (BSA) Involvement of Ps - BSA is a physician rating of the percentage of involvement of Ps for each participant. BSA is assessed on a continuous scale from 0% (no involvement) to 100% (full involvement), where 1% corresponds to the size of the participants hand (includes the palm, fingers and thumb). Total BSA is the sum of handprints from the affected areas. LS mean change from baseline was calculated using MMRM.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) - The PSSI is a physician assessment of erythema, induration and desquamation and percent of scalp that is covered with a scores range from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The composite score is derived from the sum of scores for erythema, induration, and desquamation multiplied by the score recorded for the extent of the scalp area involved, 1 (&lt;10%) to 6 (90%-100%) with a total scores range from 0 to 72, with lower scores indicating less severity. LS mean change from baseline was calculated using MMRM.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in All Scores of the Work Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Psoriasis (WPAI-PSO) (Quality of Life and Outcome Assessments. Measures: Participant Reported Outcomes [PRO]) - WPAI-PSO is a participant administered, 6-item instrument used to assess the impact of Ps on the productivity impairment within the past 7 days. WPAI-PSO has 4 domains: absenteeism, presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score, and impairment in daily activities performed outside of work. Four scores are derived as percentages: absenteeism, presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), overall work impairment (absenteeism and presenteeism), and impairment in activities performed outside of work. Percentage is calculated as: each score * 100 with greater scores indicating greater impairment. LS mean change from baseline was calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Reported 16 Items (QIDS-SR16) - QIDS-SR16 is a participant-administered, 16-item instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. A participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days and rate each on a 4-point scale: 0 (best) to 3 (worst). The sum of the 16 items corresponding to 9 depression domains [sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance (initial, middle and late insomnia or hypersomnia), decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and psychomotor agitation/retardation] to give a single total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. LS mean change from baseline was calculated using ANCOVA.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) - The SF-36 is a self-reported instrument that measures the participant's health status during the previous 7 days. It comprises 36-items covering 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and general health. Items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths. The 8 domains are regrouped in the PCS and MCS scores. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better levels of function and/or better health. LS mean change from baseline was calculated using ANCOVA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Severity (PatGA) - The PatGA is a single-item self-reported instrument asking the participant to rate the severity of their psoriasis "today" by circling a number on the numeric rating scale from 0 (Clear = no psoriasis) to 5 (Severe = the worst their psoriasis has ever been). LS mean change from baseline calculated using MMRM.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Palmoplantar PASI (PPASI) of =50% (PPASI50), =75% (PPASI75), or 100% (PPASI100) Improvement - The Palmoplantar PASI is a composite score derived from the sum of scores for erythema, induration, and desquamation [scores range from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) for each] multiplied by the score for the extent of palm and sole area involvement [scores range from 0 (0%) to 6 (90 to100%)], with a total scores range from 0 to 72. Participants achieving PPASI50, PPASI75 or PASI100 were defined as having an improvement of at least 50%, 90%, or of 100%, respectively, in the PPASI scores compared to baseline.</outcome>
