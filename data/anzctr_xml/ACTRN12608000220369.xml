  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise programme - exercise training will run for 12 months, 3 x per week for approx 1 hr each session. A trainer will meet women at their local community gym 3 x per week for the first 4 weeks then reducing to once a month for the rest of the year. The program will consist of 5 min warm-up, 25 min high impact exercise using steps (jumping, running, hopping)25 mins resistance exercise in the limbs and trunk using free weights and resistance equipment, and 5 min cool down. * Daily Calcium carbonate (1200mg) and vitamin D (1000 IU) supplements</interventions>

Taken bisphosphonates within the past 6 months.
Received prior treatment with continuous systemic glucocorticoids within the past 6 months.
Current treatments with any drugs known to affect the skeleton (eg Calcitonin, calcitrol, mithramycin or gallium nitrate).
A history of diseases that influence bone metabolism, such as Paget's disease or ongoing thyroid toxicosis.

    <concealment>Particpants will be recruited from Royal Prince Alfred, Concord General Repatriation, Strathfield Private, and Westmead Hospitals.
A person not involved with the project will prepare sequentially numbered opaque envelopes with the group allocation sealed inside.</concealment>
    <sequence>Immediately after baseline assessment, women will be randomly allocated by the research assistant to either the Exercise or the control group.  The randomisation list will be computer generated in permuted blocks and stratified by whether the woman has previously used Tamoxifen.   The randomisation process should distribute equally to the two groups the women receiving other therapies (eg, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), and other aspects of breast cancer management.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer affects 1 in 11 women.  Aromatase inhibitors, a first-line treatment for the postmenopausal women treated for breast cancer, have improved the prognosis of breast cancer by at least 20%. However, one side-effect is a rapid decrease in bone mineral density. Without an effective intervention to address the osteoporosis, health costs will increase significantly. The aim of the proposed study is to determine whether the decline in BMD induced by use of
aromatase inhibitors for treatment of breast cancer can be reversed in postmenopausal women.
We will undertake a randomized controlled trial to determine whether high impact exercise prevents loss of bone mineral density more effectively than usual care. Participants in both groups will
receive vitamin D and calcium supplements.</summary>
