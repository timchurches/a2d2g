  <interventions>
    <interventions>30 ml emulsion consisted of 10 g canola oil (2000 mg linoleic acid (LA), and 1000 mg a-linolenic acid (ALA), n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio 2:1). This intervention was administered once daily. The duration of the intervention was 12 weeks. The mode of administration was oral syrup, monitored weekly by bringing back the bottles.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Morbidity of obesity increases in population of most countries as a result of high carbohydrate and fat diet as well as sedentary lifestyle. Lipid accumulation in obesity is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This condition is precipitated by a high ratio of n-6:n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) commonly found in daily intake of most population. Therefore, diet intervention that might reduce the n6:n3 PUFA ratio would eventually help reduce obesity and improve NAFLD.

Methods: We conducted a triple blind (subjects, assessors, and investigators) randomized clinical trial, involving 66 young obese females in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. Subjects were divided into two groups: 33 with (+CO) and 33 without (-CO) canola oil intervention, for 12 weeks. Data were collected before the study (pre), at 6 weeks (mid) and 12 weeks (post). The +CO group was supplemented with 30 ml emulsion consisted of 10 g canola oil (2000 mg linoleic acid (LA), and 1000 mg a-linolenic acid (ALA), n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio 2:1), and the -CO group with 30 ml emulsion of placebo. All subjects were recommended for restricted daily energy intake below 1500 kcal and exercise once a week. Independent variables of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), triglyceride (TG), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were measured. Liver steatosis was assessed using ultrasonography (USG). Lipid accumulation product (LAP) and fatty liver index (FLI) were calculated.

Results: We observed significant decrease of LAP and FLI  in the +CO group, respectively. Canola oil supplementation for twelve weeks has prevented and improved liver steatosis of obese subjects. Independently from the intervention, there were strong correlations among LAP, FLI and liver steatosis. Strong correlations were also observed between pre and mid LAP and FLI to post liver steatosis. FLI showed a consistent specific correlation with all stages of liver steatosis, and the correlation was even stronger in higher stage of liver steatosis.

Conclusion: Supplementation of 10 g canola oil daily for 12 weeks decreased LAP, FLI, and liver steatosis in young obese females in Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia. LAP and FLI were good predictors of liver steatosis. However, FLI was a better and more specific predictor for progression of higher stage of liver steatosis when compared to LAP.
