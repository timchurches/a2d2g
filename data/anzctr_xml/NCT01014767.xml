Experimental: Standard Arm (1) - Alternating chemotherapy cycles with etoposide 100 mg/m2 over 1 hour on days 1-5, carboplatin 350 mg/m2 over 2 hours on day 2 and 3, vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 on day 5 alternating with: etoposide 100 mg/m2 over 1 hour on days 1-5, cyclophosphamide 1 g/m2 over 1 hour on day 2 and 3, vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 on day 5. Six blocks are given in 4 week intervals (day1 to day1).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a "tissue banking and data review" research study that also has a "clinical" research
      part:

        -  The goal of the tissue banking part of this study is to store tissue in a research
           tissue bank by the International Society for Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) at an
           international reference center for choroid plexus tumors. The tissue will be used in
           future research related to cancer.

        -  The goal of the data review part of this study is to collect information from the
           medical records of patients with choroid plexus tumors, and to store the information in
           SIOP databases for use in future research related to cancer.

        -  The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 4 chemotherapy treatments for
           choroid plexus tumors. The safety and level of effectiveness of these study treatments
           will be compared and studied. The study drugs include different combinations of
           etoposide, carboplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin,
           cisplatin, dactinomycin, temozolomide, and irinotecan.</summary>
