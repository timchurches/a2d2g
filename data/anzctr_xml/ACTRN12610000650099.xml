    <concealment>Screening will occur when subjects come for their usual visit to their treating physician. The patient will have an initial consultation with a study renal physician to discuss study participation. This will include a preliminary eligibility check.
Randomisation will occur on the day that trial consent is obtained or within 1 week of consent being obtained. This will include a check to ensure that the patient is still eligible. Randomisation will be conducted utilising a web-based database to allocate the patient to a trial arm using dynamically allocated methods.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective of the study is to determine whether use of a phosphate binder (lanthanum carbonate) in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3b and 4 will reduce the risk and burden of cardiovascular disease. Patients with CKD 3b and 4 have a substantially higher incidence of cardiovascular disease contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Phosphate imbalance is a putative non-traditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease in this population (association studies) and lowering of serum phosphate levels with a phosphate binder may be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality. The use of lanthanum carbonate to reduce phosphate and calcium-phosphate product may improve arterial compliance and attenuate the development and/or progression of vascular calcification, reduce the incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and potentially reduce the rate of CKD progression.</summary>
