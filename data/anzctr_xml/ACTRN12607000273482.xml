    <interventions>This trial aims to investigate the efficacy of a new intervention for alcohol craving.  This new intervention incorporates traditional Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) strategies, as well as new craving reduction and management strategies based on Elaborated Intrusion Theory (Kavanagh, Andrade &amp; May, 2005), such as competing imagery tasks.  This new 12-hour craving treatment is delivered over 9 sessions over 11 weeks and is compared against two other evidence-based treatments.  One of the comparison treatments is 12 hours of CBT (delivered in 9 sessions over 11 weeks also), incorporating traditional alcohol management strategies such as behavioural scheduling and risk situation planning.  The second comparison treatment is a one session 2-hour brief motivational intervention, incorporating Motivational Interviewing, goal setting and basic problem solving for difficult situations.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare a new intervention for alcohol craving with two other evidence-based treatments for alcohol use; 12 hours of CBT and a 2 hour brief motivational intervention.  It is hypothesised that the new craving intervention will produce reductions in alcohol consumption and cravings greater than those achieved by the other two treatments.</summary>
