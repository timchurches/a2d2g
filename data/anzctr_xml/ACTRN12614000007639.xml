    <interventions>Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories of type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion. In the other, the much more prevalent category of type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. The type 2 diabetes is thus, characterized by both fasting and postprandial hyperglycemia. In both situations, the degree of hyperglycemia is determined by the difference between the amount of glucose entering and leaving the circulation. With a view on the intimate relationship of pancreas and splenic hilum in particular and with the spleen in general, involvement of the spleen in asthenic pancreas can lead to the insulin production of and secretion from pancreas injured. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that has a significant impact on the health, quality of life, and life expectancy of patients. Therefore, the effectiveness of treatment of spleen and pancreas based splanchnic approach has thoroughly been studied in controlling and treating the chronic hyperglycemia of type 2 diabetes. In this study, a kind of 500 mg pill was prepared and named as ANIVINA, and described as below:
- ANIVINA was prepared from 120 mg of dried extract powder of Rhizoma Homalomenae, 120 mg of dried extract powder of Ananas comosus rhizome 120 mg of dried extract powder of Dioscorea opposite rhizome, 120 mg of dried extract powder of Croton tonkinensis and  50 mg of extract powder of Pueraria thomsonii Benth in a form of viscous solution, and then hand - rolled into pills of around 500 mg, each.
ANIVINA is a combination of bioactive compounds that inhibits antioxidants activity, anti-inflammatory effects and potential use in conditions related to improving the splenic function as well as intestinal tract.
Ninety four patients with chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes who come from different parts of Vietnam, were randomly selected and included in the study. Their age range was 5285 years. All patients were desperately suffering from disease of type 2 diabetes and many of them were hospitalized and measured value of HbA1C over prolonged period of time. of which the shortest disease history was 5 years and the longest was 14 years taking ANIVINA orally with a single dose of 1200 mg/kg daily for 93 days. ANIVINA was in the form of pill which was prepared from dried extract powder of Rhizoma Homalomenae, dried extract powder of Ananas  comosus rhizome, dried extract powder of Croton tonkinensis  and dried extract powder of Dioscorea opposite rhizome (with the ratio of 1:1:1:1) in presence of sufficient viscous solution of  Pueraria thomsonii Benth used as anemic and chelating agent.  Similar to the conventional treatment of diabetes mellitus, sets of blood glucose and splenic function tests were monthly conducted for checking the reduction of the concentration of blood glucose, if any. HbA1c test was performed by using Direct Enzymatic HbA1c Method</interventions>

    <summary>AIMS: to investigate the effects of naturally occurring bioactive compounds on the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

METHODS:Ninety four patients with chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes who come from different parts of Vietnam, were randomly selected and included in the study. Their age range was 5285 years (44 Male) with the average value of blood glucose was 180-220 mg/dl). All patients were desperately suffering from disease of type 2 diabetes and many of them were hospitalized and measured value of HbA1C over prolonged period of time. of which the shortest disease history was 5 years and the longest was 14 years taking ANIVINA with a single dose of 1200 mg/kg daily for 93 days. ANIVINA was in the form of pill which was prepared from dried extract powder of Rhizoma Homalomenae, dried extract powder of Ananas comosus rhizome, dried extract powder of Croton tonkinensis and dried extract powder of Dioscorea opposite rhizome in presence of sufficient viscous solution of Pueraria thomsonii Benth used as anemic and chelating agent. Similar to the conventional treatment of diabetes mellitus, sets of blood glucose and splenic function tests were monthly conducted for checking the reduction of the concentration of blood glucose, if any.

RESULTS: All the diabetic patients were were fully or almost fully recovered after taking the ANIVINA for 183 consecutive days.

CONCLUSIONS: By and large, the ANIVINA can help improving the splenic function and gastro intestinal tract, and as a consequence, it helps lowering the blood glucose levels

    <publicnotes>The principal investigator of this study and  his co- workers were many times asked by the desperately suffered patients to help identify their diseases as they were hospitalized and measured high value of HbA1C over prolonged period of time. The patients, therefore, were voluntarily  involved in the study after they were informed and explained about the risks and potential benefits for participants.</publicnotes>
