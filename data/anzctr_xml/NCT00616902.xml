  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) Over 48 Weeks Measured by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) - Change from Baseline in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 48 weeks measured by cardiac MRI. The effects of paricalcitol injection on progression or regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in participants with Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) compared to placebo. Left Ventricular Mass is normalized to the participant's height by the following equation to obtain LVMI: LVM (g) divided by height (m)2.7.
The primary comparison was between the 4 mcg paricalcitol injection and the placebo treatment groups in the change from baseline to Week 48.</outcome>
