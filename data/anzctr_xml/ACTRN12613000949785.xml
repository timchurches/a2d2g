  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Get Healthy-Stay Healthy (GHSH) intervention is specifically designed to follow-on from the Get Healthy Coaching Service (GHS). The 6-month GHSH extended-contact intervention is primarily delivered via text messages that are individually-tailored in terms of frequency, timing, content and wording. In order to tailor the text message content and to negotiate the participants text messaging preferences, participants receive two tailoring telephone calls, e.g. 20-30 minutes; one call at the start of the intervention; and another call at mid-intervention. During the GHSH extended contact intervention participants choose whether they focus on a weight loss (no more than 2kg per month) or weight maintenance goal and whether they focus on physical activity or diet or both behaviours (with targets consistent with national guidelines for physical activity and healthy eating). </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group receives no contact, except for the evaluations at baseline, 6- and 12-months. Following completion of each assessment, control group participants are posted brief written feedback on their data. This feedback is to reduce attrition in the control group in the study. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants for this study were recruited on a rolling basis from the pool of participants who completed the GHS between August 2012 and February 2013. During the recruitment timeframe, all GHS completers were invited to register their interest for the GHSH study by their GHS coach during the final coaching call. Verbal consent to contact was recorded and then GHS coaches emailed client contact details to the researchers. Interested participants were mailed a Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form and then contacted via telephone to establish their eligibility and willingness to consent to participate in the GHSH trial. Verbal consent to participation was audio recorded, and participants returned the signed Consent Form via reply paid post.
Once informed verbal consent was obtained, the participants underwent the GHSH baseline assessment and were then randomised to one of the study groups. Participants were stratified based on their change in weight during the Get Healthy Service (using the  median weight loss of 3kg). Randomisation was conducted using a randomisation website (www.randomization.com), and allocation was conducted by a trained research assistant with no involvement in participant recruitment</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimates are driven by the between-group differences expected for physical activity, as this required the largest sample. Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, the targeted sample size is 103 participants per group (206 in total). This sample size will provide a minimum adequate power (80%) to detect a between groups change between baseline and 6 months of 30 minutes/week of objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity (assuming a standard deviation of 70mins/wk). 


Data will be analysed using intention-to-treat principles. Once a participant is randomised into a study group, they will be considered a trial participant and analysed according to their allocated group, regardless of missing data for follow-ups or the amount of intervention received. Patterns of missing data will be examined to determine the type of missing data (i.e. MCAR, MAR, NMAR) at each assessment point and will be treated accordingly (i.e. completers analysis, multiple imputation). Change in each primary outcome will be modelled using mixed linear models with random intercepts, the fixed effects of study group, time and a group by time interaction as well as baseline values (to account for regression to the mean). Potential confounders include baseline characteristics, change in behaviours and weight during the initial GHS, and the factors used to balance groups by minimisation. Confounders will be identified by forwards and backwards selection. Inclusion in the final model will require the addition or omission of the potential confounder to elicit a substantial change in the coefficient for the effect of intervention. A 20% change in coefficient will be considered substantial unless the coefficient is close to zero. Data analysis will be performed using the software SAS system for Windows (Version 9.3). Statistical significance will be set at the conventional two-tailed 5% level.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate, in a randomised controlled trial, the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a text message-delivered intervention to enhance physical activity, dietary change and weight loss among adults who have completed the 6-month Get Healthy Coaching Service. It is expected that this extended contact via text messaging will lead to sustained behaviour change and weight loss compared to no on-going contact.
