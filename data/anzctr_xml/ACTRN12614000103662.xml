  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study measuring the change in maternal cardiac output ten minutes after injection of spinal anaesthetic in the presence of intravenous ephedrine used to maintain systolic blood pressure within 90% of baseline.
The cardiac output will be measured by transthoracic echocardiography. The systolic blood pressure will be monitored until delivery of the baby.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The range of values for cardiac output and stroke volume.

Heart rate (HR) will be measured from a standard 3-lead ECG continuous recording. Automated non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurements will be taken at 1 minute intervals from the commencement of the ephedrine infusion with a cuff placed on the upper arm using the oscillometric method. One-minutely NIBP and HR readings will be retrieved post-operatively from the memory of the anaesthetic machine.  

Transthoracic echocardiographic measurement of the cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) will be determined using the following method. In the parasternal long axis (PLAX) view, a good quality image of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) will be obtained. This is defined as an image in which the aortic valve can be seen and the structure looks tubular. This image is zoomed and frozen during systole and then stored. The apical five chamber (A5C) view will then be used to ascertain the LVOT velocity time integral (VTI). A good quality image is one with maximal chamber size, a vertical long axis and maximal mitral valve opening size. Pulse wave Doppler will be used with a 3 mm sample volume placed within the LVOT approximately 0.5 cm proximal to the aortic valve. The angle of Doppler interrogation of flow will be less than 20 degrees. At least three consecutive beats will be recorded and the images stored. Following the completion of the scans the images will be used to calculate the cardiac output.
In regard to LVOT diameter the PLAX image will allow the measurement of the LVOT diameter (in cm) perpendicularly to the aortic root from the junction of the anterior coronary cusp and the interventricular septum to the junction of the posterior non-coronary aortic cusp and the anterior mitral valve leaflet. 
The VTI shall be measured by tracing the leading edge of the velocity spectrum of three consecutive beats. The VTI used to calculate CO will be the average of these three beats. Heart rate will be measured from the Doppler spectral display from the time between two consecutive beats in the VTI tracing.
 For calculation of SV and CO: 
a)	SV (ml) = [(LVOT diameter)^2 x 0.785](cm^2) x VTI(cm). (where [(LVOT)^2 x 0.785 = p x LVOT radius^2 = cross sectional area of the LVOT)
b)	CO (ml/min) = heart rate(beats/min) x [(LVOT diameter)^2 x 0.785](cm^2) x VTI(cm).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Demographic data will be presented as mean (SD), median [25th  75th percentile] and number (%) according to type and distribution. Summary measures for primary (HR, LVOT, VTI) and derived (SV and CO) outcome measurements will be presented for both measurement times along with change scores for the two derived measures. These will include 95% confidence intervals for HR, CO, CI and SV.
Assessment of compliance with mean arterial pressure control (MAP) will be performed: (i) across all 10+ blood pressure measurements using proportion within target interval (90  110% of baseline) and (ii) for the T9-T11 (one minute each side of the T10 measurement) using a dichotomous marker equals to 1 if all three readings lie within the target interval. 
Assessment of the relationship between HR, SV and CO will be explored graphically. 
Assessment of change in CO will be made using change score ANOVA if change scores are approximately normally distributed or following transformation to normality if not. A Wilcoxon sign rank test on change scores may also be used. 
Sample size calculation is based upon within patient change in cardiac output, at a detectable difference of 600 ml, mean baseline CO 4400 ml, two-sided significance level 0.05 and power 0.8. There is no data available to estimate SD for the within patient change score.  We used the SD (1000 ml) found on the baseline CO data of 28 patients in previously published work. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most common types of anaesthetic used for caesarean section is a spinal anaesthetic. In order for women to be comfortable during the operation a large number of nerves are blocked. In addition to the pain nerves it is very common for other nerves to be affected, including those which are responsible for other types of sensation, movement in the legs and also those which normally help control blood pressure. Significantly low blood pressure in the mother may be associated with side-effects including nausea and vomiting, dizziness and possibly loss of consciousness and in extreme situations the baby may also receive a reduced blood supply from the placenta. For the anaesthetist to provide a safe anaesthetic it is very important to monitor these effects and especially any changes to blood pressure and how the womans body responds to it. This is particularly important during the first 5 to 10 minutes after the injection of the spinal anaesthetic. During this period it is usual to closely measure blood pressure, heart rate, the amount of oxygen in the blood and the electrical activity of the heart from an electrocardiogram. 
Recently, it has also become possible to directly observe the function of the heart relatively quickly and easily via a hand-held ultrasound probe placed on the chest  a transthoracic echocardiogram or TTE. These devices are very similar to those used for obtaining images of the baby during pregnancy. It is known from the use of these devices in other situations, including in pregnant women, that valuable information may be obtained about how the heart is performing. Until now this has not been done in healthy women having a spinal anaesthetic for an elective caesarean section. Hence, the purpose of our study is to document the effects of a standard spinal anaesthetic on the output of the heart by comparing measurements at approximately 10 minutes after the spinal injection with measurements taken immediately before the spinal using TTE. In keeping with usual practice, drugs will be given to help maintain normal blood pressure throughout.
Information obtained from this study will be helpful in further understanding the impact of spinal anaesthetics on the cardiovascular system in pregnant women which is likely to help guide anaesthetists to reduce side effects and improve safety.
