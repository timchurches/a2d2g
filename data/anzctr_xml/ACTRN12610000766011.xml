    <interventions>Accelerated Arm - Diagnostic assessment using an accelerated chest pain pathway. The pathway incorporates using (i) a risk stratification tool, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score (TIMI score), (ii) Electrocardiographs (ECGs) AND (iii) troponin blood test over a 2 hour time period from presentation to the hospital.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Arm - Conventional diagnostic assessment pathway according to hospital guidelines involving ECGs and troponin blood test on hospital presentation and a further troponin blood test 8 to 12 hours after pain onset from presentation to the hospital.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients successfully discharged home after Emergency Department (ED) assessment (without admission under another medical specialty to an in-patient ward). Sucessfully discharges is defined as discharged home within 6 hours of arrival at ED and have no serious adverse events. Serious adverse events include;
Death
Cardiac Arrest
Cardiogenic Shock
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
non-ST segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
Ventricular Arrhythmia
High Level  atrioventricular (AV) Block
The research nurses will track the patient's in-hospital progress in real time and use direct questioning of clinicians and patient records in order to record management decisions at initial attendance and admission, extract resource use data and identify subsequent attendances, admissions, and serious adverse events up to three months</outcome>
      <timepoint>Discharge home within 6 hours of arrival at ED. - Discharge with no serious adverse event during the following 30 days as determined by follow-up at three months.</timepoint>

The research nurses will track the patient's in-hospital progress in real time and use direct questioning of clinicians and patient records in order to record management decisions at initial attendance and admission, extract resource use data and identify subsequent attendances, admissions, and adverse events  up to three months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over the 3 months following initial presentation to ED.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Re-attendance at and/or re-admission to hospital.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research will provide an innovative and workable change to the medical decision making involved in the investigation, and service delivery for patients presenting acutely to Emergency Departments (EDs) with possible cardiac chest pain. It is a randomised trial comparing current care with a new fast-track pathway. This research will support research knowledge translation by proving the effectiveness in real-time clinical practice, of the findings of recent, promising, cutting edge, New Zealand research. This research suggests that for significant numbers of patients, an accelerated chest pain pathway can rule-out Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) sooner, enabling earlier progression to the next phase of chest pain investigation(s) and, importantly, allow early discharge from ED, without hospital admission. It is beneficial for the health service, which avoids unnecessary admissions, duplication of staff activities and pressure upon urgent care services.</summary>
