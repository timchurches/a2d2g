Experimental: Treatment (induction therapy, consolidation therapy, ASCT) - INDUCTION THERAPY:
COURSES 1-2: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15-30 minutes and topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses.
COURSES 3 AND 5: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-4 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses.
COURSE 4: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-6 hours on days 1-2, vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1-3, and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 1 course.
Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning 4-8 weeks following the 5th course of induction therapy, patients receive busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -3 and melphalan IV on day -1. Patients undergo ASCT on day 0.
Some patients also undergo EBRT after induction and consolidation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot clinical trial studies busulfan, melphalan, and stem cell transplant after
      chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed neuroblastoma that is likely to come
      back or spread. Giving chemotherapy to the entire body before a stem cell transplant stops
      the growth of tumor cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. After treatment,
      stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored. More chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem cells are
      then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed by the
      chemotherapy.</summary>
