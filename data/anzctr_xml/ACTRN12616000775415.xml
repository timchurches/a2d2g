  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study duration is a total of 16 weeks; 2-week lead in, 4-week intervention, 4-week washout, 4-week intervention, and final 2-week follow up. The cross-over design will be completed using the kiwifruit intervention (3 SunGold kiwifruit per day (Actinidia chinensis 'Zesy002)), compared to a positive control intervention of psyllium (Two and a half teaspoons of Metamucil(Registered trademark) per day providing 5.0g fibre). The kiwifruit and Metamucil (Registered trademark) can be consumed in two doses, preferably one dose in the morning and one dose at night. There is no restriction as to what other foods are consumed with them. Adherence to the treatments is measured by a daily diary and food diaries at the end of each treatment. The lead-in period requires individuals to stop taking laxatives and kiwifruit.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be asked to consume two and a half teaspoons of Metamucil(Registered Trademark) as the control for this study. This treatment phase is 4 weeks in duration. The Metamucil(Registered Trademark) will be provided as a powder and participants will be instructed to consume the Metamucil(Registered Trademark) in conjunction with sufficient cool fluid (at least 250ml). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete Spontaneous Bowel Movement (CSBM) Frequency (CSBM/week)  as a measure of overall bowel function in constipation. The number, or occurrence, of CSBM is recorded by all participants in a daily dairy recording bowel movements. A spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) is defined as a stool not induced by rescue medication. A CSBM is defined as a SBM associated with a sensation of complete evacuation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>CSBM will be measured daily across the 16 week study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The frequency of bowel movements (BM)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily through the daily dairy for the entire 16 week duration of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease of defecation/level of straining. Measured by a question in the daily diary (e.g. Did you have to use strain in order to defecate at any of the times you had a bowel movement?)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily through the daily dairy for the entire 16 week duration of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stool form (Bristol Stool Scale).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily through the daily dairy for the entire 16 week duration of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS). Used to determine the potential effect of kiwifruit on the gastrointestinal symptoms and pain, together with stool habit. The GSRS uses questions to assess symptom severity using a 7-grade Likert scale ranging from 1 ("no discomfort at all") to 7 ("very severe discomfort") </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured weekly during the entire 16 week duration of the study through an interview with a researcher. Participants will be asked to answer questions in relation to the previous week.  </timepoint>

      <outcome>Quality of life. This is measured via an End of Study Period Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) Evaluation.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is designed to detect an increase of 1.0 or more CSBM per week in functionally constipated and Irritable Bowel Syndrome individuals with constipation. 

An initial calculation has been completed using available data.  Based on previous studies, the standard deviation for the primary outcome (number of CSBM per week) is 1.41. In order to detect an increase in CSBM of 1.0 per week in the treatment group compared to the control group, with 80% power and 5% significance, 47 subjects are required to complete the trial. This is based on an unpublished study carried out in Europe in 2014. In order to allow for dropouts, a total of 50 individuals will be recruited.

All statistical analysis will be completed by an independent bio-statistician. Statistical analysis will describe the relationship between the consumption of kiwifruit and the parameters of bowel habit and digestive comfort measured. In addition the analysis will compare the effects of the two treatment (kiwifruit and Metamucil(Registered Trademark)) and determine the effects of the two treatments. P values of 0.05 or less will be considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gastrointestinal discomfort, including constipation, is a common condition throughout the world, which often leads to a reduction in the quality of life. The prevelance of constipation is reported to affect around 15% of adults in the western world. The consumption of green kiwifruit is recognised to assist with the relief of constipation and provide potential relief of gastrointestinal symptoms. A more recently commerecialised cultivar marketed as SunGold may also have a similar effect. 
The aim of this study is to examine the effect of daily consumption of three SunGold kiwifruit in individuals who suffer from functional constipation or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation to determine if kiwifruit can improve bowel regularity, digestive discomfort, digestive health and function and gut health.
The effect of the kiwifruit will be compared with psyllium (Metamucil(Registered Trademark)), a bowel bulking agent that has been shown to be an effective treatment for constipation. The trial is a randomised, single-blinded cross-over study where individuals will consume either 3 SunGold kiwifruit daily for four weeks or 2.5 teaspoons of Metamucil(Registered Trademark) powder for four weeks. There will be a four week washout period and then the participants will swap over treatments for a further four weeks. The trial will start and finish with a 2 week washout period. Participants will be asked to complete a daily diary to record bowel movement and general wellbeing during the study. Faecal samples and blood will be collected at the beginning of the trial and at the end of each treatment period. Participants will also be asked to complete at questionnaire relating to bowel health at these points.</summary>
