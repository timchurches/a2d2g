  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to determine the DNA damage, lipid and micronutrient profile of ApoE4 carriers compared to non-carriers, and to determine if DNA damage in lymphocytes of ApoE4 carriers can be prevented with nutritional supplementation. A single fasted blood and cheek cell sample will be collected to determine DNA, micronutrient and fat content status, which may be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Dietary and lifestyle questionnaires and a short cognitive assessment will also be administered to measure mineral and vitamin intake and assess any lifestyle activities that may impact upon Alzheimer disease and dementia risk. All samples will be collected and questionnaires performed during the single visit. No dietary or drug treatment is involved.  Recruitment will occur over approximately 5-6 months or until target sample size has been reached.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine DNA damage, micronutrient and lipid profile of ApoE4 carriers compared to non-carriers using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Only one sample collection is involved.  Samples are set up fresh to determine DNA damage and lipid profile of the volunteers.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if nutritional supplementation with lipophilic antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, in vitro can prevent DNA damage in ApoE4 carriers compared to non-carriers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is performed in the lab on lymphocytes isolated from the blood, once the DNA damage, micronutrient and lipid profiles have been established.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, currently affecting at least 35 million people worldwide and expected to double every 20 years. The risk of acquiring Alzheimers doubles every five years after the age of 65 and may be affected by common alterations in the fat transporter gene (APOE). The brain contains large proportions of fats such as cholesterol and omega-3 fatty acids. APOE plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy fat distribution such as cholesterol and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as brain cell repair and scavenging of toxins. Common alterations in the APOE gene, may directly or indirectly increase DNA damage and accelerate brain aging and degeneration.  This disease is currently considered incurable and greatly highlights the need for preventative measures and therapeutic interventions, such as nutritional supplementation, that may improve DNA stability and mental health.</summary>
