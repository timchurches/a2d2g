  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten sessions (30 minutes) of physiotherapy functional restoration over a 10-week period. This will involve core stabilising exercises, progressive functional exercises, and condition-specific education and advice. Frequency will be twice a week initially, progressing to fortnightly towards the end of the program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two sessions (30 minutes ) of physiotherapy advice over a 10-week period. This will involve condition-specific advice regarding the prognosis and self-management of the condition. The frequency of the sessions will be: first session will be as soon as possible following randomisation, with the second at 5 weeks following randomisation.</comparator>

      <outcome>Rate and nature of adverse events (therapist reporting and open questions to participants). The adverse events will be documented on a recording form. Adverse events will be categorised into minor, significant, and serious. 

Minor adverse event - any symptom or event reported that may potentially be related to the intervention. eg short term pain associated with exercises. 

Significant - any symptom or event potentially related to the intervention that interrupts the participants ability to continue with the Randomised controlled trail (RCT) intervention. eg deterioration in leg symptoms for more than 1 week. 

Serious adverse event - any symptom or event potentially related to the intervention that results in admission to hospital or permanent disability, or is life threatening.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers who respond to advertising, or who are referred by a medical practitioner or health care professional will undergo a phone screening and baseline physical assessment to determine eligibility. Eligible volunteers who consent to participate will complete baseline outcome measures prior to being randomised to the functional restoration or advice group. This will be done by the assessor contacting an off-site trial administrator who will hold the randomisation schedule, and will not be involved in assessing, enrolling or treating participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher at La Trobe University who will have no contact with participants will generate a randomisation schedule prior to trial commencement. Permuted block randomisation with random block sizes will be undertaken using a web-based randomisation program. Randomisation will be stratified by developing a separate schedule for each of the 14 physiotherapy treatment clinics.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>All participants who are allocated to the functional restoration group will be invited to attend a one-on-one semi-structured interview at the completion of the 10-week intervention period to gain their perspectives on the treatment program.</designfeatures>

    <summary>The primary aim of this trial is to compare the outcomes and adverse events of two different physiotherapy treatment approaches for people with lumbar non-reducible discogenic pain.
A secondary aim is to determine the perspectives of participants on the functional restoration program utilised in the trial.</summary>
