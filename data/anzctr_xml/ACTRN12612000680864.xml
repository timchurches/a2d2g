    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Random allocation of subjects to intervention (individualized counseling) and control (standard care) groups will be carried out using pre-prepared, serially-numbered, opaque envelopes containing a card indicating either “Intervention” or “Control”. The clinician enrolling a patient will pick the next numbered envelope from the top the stack to determine allocation and record this in the case reporting form (CRF). The envelopes will be prepared by JH who will not be involved in subject enrollment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random sequence for cards will be computer generated with an appropriate block size to ensure balanced allocation in the two groups. Stratification will not be conducted unless a blinded interim analysis reveals unbalanced distributions of an important confounding factor such as the body mass index (BMI).</sequence>
