  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the intervention phase, HIV-infected women and their infants aged less than 28 days presenting at the health facility will be invited to participate. At approximately six weeks post-delivery, enrolled infants will have either a heel prick or venous blood sample taken  depending on the local hospital guidelines - and tested for HIV infection using the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test. In addition, up to six dried blood spot circles (from the same blood draw as for the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test) will be collected, up to five for the HIV PCR laboratory-based assay to assess Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test performance and confirm diagnosis, and one to be stored for quality assurance purposes. In total, 300 microlitres will be collected from each infant for standard of care and storage, and 100 microlitres for the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test (total 400 microlitres). It is anticipated that the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test will be performed the same day by a trained health worker or assigned clinic staff member. Test results will be communicated to the parent / caregiver as soon as the test result is available or soon thereafter. The Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test takes 90 minutes to complete, therefore it is anticipated that results will be conveyed to the parent/caregiver after 90 minutes. Infants testing positive on the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL test (or once confirmed by the HIV PCR laboratory-based assay if indicated by the in-country regulations) will receive antiretroviral (ARV) treatment as soon as possible according to WHO guidelines. HIV-exposed infants testing HIV negative will receive standard care as per national guidelines. In both arms, ARV treatment and prophylaxis will be provided as per national and WHO guidelines ensuring intervention sustainability.

Across the 6 sites, 45 cumulative enrolment months are allocated to the intervention phase.</interventions>
    <comparator>During the standard care (control) phase, infants born to HIV-infected women and presenting at the health facility will be screened for eligibility. Enrolled infants will have their blood drawn for HIV testing (at approximately six weeks post-delivery) using a dried blood spot specimen evaluated at the centralised laboratory using a PCR test for HIV (standard of care). Up to six dried blood spot circles will be collected for each infant, five to be sent to the laboratory for testing and one to be stored for confirmatory diagnosis if required. Laboratories processing the specimens will either have an External Quality Assurance program in place or one will be established as part of the study. Test result communication and ARV commencement will occur as per the standard of care.

Across the 6 sites, 33 cumulative enrolment months are allocated to the control phase.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Using a cluster-randomised controlled (at health facility level) stepped-wedge design, we will assess the impact of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL early infant diagnosis of HIV to increase uptake of results communication and enable earlier initiation of infant ARV treatment. This study will implement the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL (intervention) in a total of 6 facilities in Myanmar (n=4) and PNG (n=2). 

The intervention will be introduced in a step-wise approach with facilities enrolling HIV-exposed infants before and after the introduction of the intervention. This will enable prospective comparisons of intervention and standard care within (before and after intervention introduction) and between sites (with and without intervention) in an ethical research framework. Computer random allocation will decide the order and timing of intervention introduction. Individual randomisation is not feasible for ethical reasons as some infants visiting the same site would receive an immediate result and care and some would have a deferred result and care. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The study has been powered to detect a significant difference in the proportion of infants receiving an EID test result by 3 months of age. We have acceptable power (80%) to detect a clinically meaningful change in the proportion of HIV-exposed infants receiving a test result by 3 months of age using a random effect semi-parametric survival analysis. Based on an estimated 50% of infants receiving an EID test result by 3 months of age we are powered approximately (80% power, 95% confidence level and intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.05) to detect an increase in 3-month EID test result receipt to 84% (risk ratio = 3.6). Given the mixed modelling approach proposed, and with all other factors being equal, statistical power will be higher if a greater level of between-clinic heterogeneity in receipt of EID testing is observed in the sample. 

A generalised mixed model approach will be used to analyse the effect of the intervention with respect to the likelihood of infants receiving an EID test result at three months of age. Appropriate survival analyses will assess time to event outcomes. In analyses, intervention and study period will be modelled as fixed factors with clinic (study cluster or psu) treated as a random term. The effect of study site (i.e. country) will also be explored. In all analyses statistical significance will be assessed at p &lt;0.05.

To assess test performance of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL, correlation of values compared to gold standard reference tests will be assessed through determination of misclassification, sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive value, and reported following STARD guidelines. The failure rate of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL will be determined as the proportion of performed tests during which no test result could be established either through an indeterminate result or test failure (invalid test).

To assess the operational feasibility and acceptability of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL during provision of infant care services, we will describe perspectives from both clients as well as health workers. Operational feasibility of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL will be assessed in comparison with standard of care. A comprehensive approach will also be used to assess operational characteristics of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL tests for suitability for use in Myanmar and PNG using the WHO ASSURED criteria for HIV assays operation in resource-constrained settings.

Assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL compared with standard of care the following will be calculated:
	i) estimated incremental cost per additional day of known HIV status;
	ii) estimated incremental cost per DALY averted when cohorts are model projected out to age 5 years;
Moreover, the optimal combination of current standard of care and Xpert (Registered Trademark) HIV-1 QUAL will be estimated across different clinical sites to maximize the return on investment and epidemiological impact of testing strategies.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aim of the study is to improve child health in resource-constrained and rural settings in the Asia and Pacific region by increasing uptake and timely initiation of lifesaving antiretroviral interventions for HIV-exposed infants through the use of a novel point-of-care (POC) early infant diagnostic test. The use of this novel POC test will enable caregivers of HIV-exposed infants to receive HIV test results sooner, and consequently result in HIV-infected infants starting on lifesaving treatment faster.</summary>
