  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will consume commerically available food products such as breakfast cereal and complete visual analogue scales rating feelings of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, thirst and levels of energy.  Satiety will be assessed further through access to an ad libitum lunch

Products consumed will be breakfast cereals and ready to drink breakfast drinks and are: Nutrigrain, Special K, Weet-bix, Primo extremo choclate, Up &amp; Go chocolate, Up &amp; Go Vive Banana, muesli, Light &amp; Tasty berry flavour.  Products will be tested with 72 hours between each visit (max 2/week) for up to 4 weeks.  Testing will take place over a morning period of up to 4 hours.  Prior to leaving participants will be given an ad libitum lunch which will be measured covertly for energy intake.  Each participant will test all of the 8 products in the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each particpant will act their own control testing all eight products in the trial. No product will be a control, the trial is to discern what type of product has the greatest satiety effect.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to compare commercially available food products for their effect on satiety using subjective visual analogue scales (VAS) as a means of measurement over the period of a five year research project.  It will also aim to assess some of the psychological aspects of food intake and satiety by using state trait anxiety questionnaires and measures of restrictive eating. All food products will be consumed at the same level of energy based on the recommended serve size, however their nutritional composition will be variable in terms of the amount of protein, carbohydrate (particularly sugar) and fibre. Plus foods may also be consumed in the form of a liquid.  The hypothesis of this study is that satiety may be affected by not only the nutritional content but also by the food form.  Results from this work will then be incorporated into the development of new food concepts that may then be applied to future food development that may aid in total food intake and therefore weight control.</summary>
