  <interventions>
    <interventions>All volunteers were randomly assigned, using a computer generated table of random numbers, to 3 treatment groups of ivabradine: 5, 10, 20mg. After a 10-hour overnight fast, volunteers received a single dose of ivabradine orally at approximately 8 a.m. on the following morning (day 1) with 200mL water. 3 days after single dose, volunteers of all three group received repeated oral doses of ivabradine (same as respective single dose) twice daily at 8 a.m and 8 p.m. for 6 consecutive days.</interventions>
    <comparator>no treatment. The first group received ivabradine 5mg treatment, the second group received ivabradine 10mg treatment and the third group received ivabradine 20mg treatment. All 3 treatment groups would have equal weight in this study.</comparator>

      <timepoint>Blood will be sampled pre-dose, and 0.25h, 0.5h, 0.75h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 48h after dose for single dose and the last repeated dose</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: Adverse events(including visual disturbance (visual flashes, streak of light, sensation of stroboscopic vision), headach,dizziness, bradycardia,Ventricular extrasystoles), clinical laboratory data(i.e., serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), ventilation status, physical exam. Adverse events(AEs) were monitored throughout the study based on spontaneous reports by volunteers, questioning by investigators, physical examinations, ECG results, vital signs and clinical test analysis. And the AE information was recorded throughout the study in terms of intensity (mild, moderate, or severe), duration, outcome, and relationship to the study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physical examinations and routine laboratory profiles (i.e., serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis) were performed before the first single dose, before the 5th repeated dose and 24 after the last repeated dose. Holter (24h dynamic electrocardiogram) monitoring was performed on the screening visit, day1 (single dose) and day 8 (steady state). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), heart rate (HR) were measured before and 2 hours after each administration as well as 6,12, 24 hours after single dose and 24, 48 hours after the last repeated dose. ECGs were performed before each administration as well as 4 hours after the morning dose from day 3 to day 8. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed before the first single dose and 24 hour after the last repeated dose. Volunteers were instructed to come back for a safety evaluation on vital signs and physical examinations 1 week after the last blood sample was collected.</timepoint>
