  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical activity has well-documented health benefits and has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated during pregnancy.  Regular exercise during pregnancy may help regulate maternal nutrient supply to the fetus and have important long-term health consequences for offspring.  This study will examine the effects of exercise during pregnancy on maternal insulin sensitivity and neonatal outcomes.  A cohort of 120 healthy women will be recruited through maternity carers to complete this study.  They will be randomised to either a prescribed moderate exercise programme or no-exercise control group for the remainder of pregnancy.  Maternal insulin sensitivity will be assessed at baseline and at 35 weeks.  Outcomes in offspring will include birth size, body composition, and metabolic markers present in cord blood at birth.  Structural and functional changes to the placenta in response to exercise will also be examined.  The results of this study will determine the potential benefits of exercise during pregnancy.</summary>
