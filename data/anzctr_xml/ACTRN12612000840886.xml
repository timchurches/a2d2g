  <interventions>
    <interventions>During a direct patient encounter, an electronic message to the provider caring for an out-of-control diabetic suggests the patient be placed on insulin.  This message appears on the screen of the Electronic Health Record during the time the provider is charting on the patient.  The message appears once per provider per encounter.  The same message appears to all providers at the same health center.  Messages are changed every month for 4 months without a washout period based on the randomization schedule.  Messages differ by wording (active vs passive voice) and presentation (all black text vs black and red text).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research to date has shown that Clinical Decision Support systems do have some efficacy in changing provider behavior, however the "look and feel" of electronic alerts has not been well studied.  This study presents 1 of 4 messages to providers caring for out-of-control diabetics.  The messages differ in wording (active vs passive voice) and presentation (plain black text vs black and red text).</summary>

      <hrec>(Note:  the IRB felt this was a quality improvement project and did not meet the criteria for human subjects research as defined by 45 CFR 46.102 (d) and (f).)
These alerts triggered in the background (unseen by and unknown to the providers) for a 5 month period (starting February 2012).  These baseline data were used to obtain information for our power analysis and also to be able to do a pre- post intervention analysis in addition to the RCT analysis.  Providers started seeing the alerts in July 2012 (after letter from IRB).</hrec>
