  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) defined as the requirement for dialysis for any reason in the first seven days post-transplant - The primary objective is to demonstrate efficacy and safety of a two dose regimen of eculizumab to prevent DGF in adult recipients of diseased donor kidney transplants who are at increased risk of DGF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>First 7 days post Kidney Transplant</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
