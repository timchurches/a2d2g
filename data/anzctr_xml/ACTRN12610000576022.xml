  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of a novel intervention programme vs traditional supervised exercise programme on improving fall efficacy in the moderately frail population aged 60 and above.
Hypothesis: The Nintendo Wii Active programme as an adjunct in a modified exercise programme is more effective in improving fall efficacy than a traditional supervised exercise programme for the frail population aged 60 and above.</summary>
