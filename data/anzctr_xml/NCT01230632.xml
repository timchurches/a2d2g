  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) - After infusion of glucose bolus(0.3mg/kg, 50% glucose), blood samples are taken at 0,1,3,5,7,10,20,30 and 60 minutes. The value of glucose is recorded respectively (unit:mMol/L).</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>insulin sensitivity - A 2-hour hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (60mU/m2/min) is used to measure insulin sensitivity(Âµmol/min/kg Fat Free Mass). This is calculated by the formula from the amount of dextrose necessary to maintain blood glucose at 5mmol/L.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to compare the effects of high fat overfeeding on metabolic risk factors in
      children born though assisted reproduction technologies (ART) versus children conceived
      naturally (controls). The investigators will utilize state of the ART measures to
      characterize the physiological, endocrine and molecular responses to high fat overfeeding.

      The investigators hypothesize that children conceived following ART will have greater
      responses to high fat dietary challenge and that this will be associated with DNA
      hypermethylation of genes that are involved in lipid metabolism.</summary>
