      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Death or Disease Progression According to IRF Assessment Among Those With Low HER2 mRNA Levels - Tumor assessments were performed according to RECIST version 1.1, using radiographic images submitted to the IRF up to and including the confirmatory tumor assessment 4 to 6 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Disease progression was defined as a =20% and 5-mm increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained during the study, or appearance of new lesion(s). The percentage of participants with death or disease progression was calculated as [number of participants with event divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 48 months from randomization until clinical cutoff of 16-Sept-2014 (at Screening, every 9 weeks for 81 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter and/or up to 42 days after last dose)</timepoint>

PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression or death from any cause. Disease progression was defined as a =20% and 5-mm increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum obtained during the study, or appearance of new lesion(s). Median duration of PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, 3-arm, multicenter, phase III study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with pertuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) with
      pertuzumab-placebo (blinded for pertuzumab), versus the combination of trastuzumab
      (Herceptin) plus taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) in participants with HER2-positive
      progressive or recurrent locally advanced or previously untreated metastatic breast cancer.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (Arms A, B or C). Arm A will be
      open-label, whereas Arms B and C will be blinded.</summary>
