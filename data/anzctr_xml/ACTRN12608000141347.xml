    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women presenting to routine family planning clinics who are eligible to use the combined contraceptive pill and who choose this method over other methods are given information about the study and asked to sign the consent form. An opaque envelope is taken in order (using a computer generated randomisation scheme) by the prescribing clinician which tells the participant about their allocation. The women are then prescribed their preferred contraceptive pill according to the allocated regimen and the clinical record form is completed. The clinician and participant are blinded as to the allocation prior to pill prescription.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether women prescibed a twelve month supply rather than the usual four month supply of the combined oral contraceptive pill at initiation of this contraceptive method are more likley to continue this method when followed-up by phone or e-mail twelve months later. The study will also look at womens' preferences for each initiation regimen through administration of a questionnaire. The hypothesis is that women are more likley to continue the contraceptive pill if they are prescribed the longer initiation regimen and will have a preference for this regimen over the shorter four month regimen.</summary>
