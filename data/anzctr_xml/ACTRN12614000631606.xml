    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 150 is sufficient to detect a minimum effect size of 0.12 (Cohens f2) with 10 predictors at 80% power and a probability level of 0.05.

Sample characteristics, including full cognitive functioning, motor functioning, demographic and data will be explored using descriptive data analysis. Descriptive data analyses will be completed by examining distributions and measures of the middle and spread in continuously scaled variables and by constructing frequency distributions for categorical variables.  

Descriptive data analyses will be used to explore the data, and will be completed by examining distributions and measures of the middle and spread in continuously scaled variables and by constructing frequency distributions for categorical variables.

The primary hypothesis (a relationship exists among how well children with unilateral CP use their two hands together and aspects of their cognition function such as attention, goal setting, information processing and everyday executive abilities) will be assessed in two ways. To assess the association between and among bimanual upper limb motor performance (Assisting Hand Assessment) and measures of cognition, we will produce scatter plots and calculate correlation coefficients. We will examine the association between bimanual upper limb performance and cognition variable using univariable linear regression. Variables where there is a significant association with bimanual upper limb performance (p=0.1) will then be retained to be entered into a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for variables such as sex and age and others that could confound associations between bimanual upper limb performance and cognition.

Our second hypothesis (the relationship among cognition and bimanual hand function is influenced by underlying brain pathology) will be evaluated using logistic regression analysis because the outcome measurement is dichotomous (MRI lesion characteristics  as per protocol). We will examine the association between neuropathology (MRI), bimanual upper limb performance and cognitive variables. Variables where there is a significant association with neuropathology and bimanual upper limb performance (p=0.1) and neuropathology and cognitive variables (p=0.1) will be retained to be entered into a multivariable regression analysis adjusting for variables such as sex and age and other variables that could confound associations between the dependent variable and covariate.

All statistical analyses will be conducted on Stata V12.1 and led by a biostatistician with input from the clinical and research team.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a cross-sectional observational study examining the association between and among cognition, type and severity of brain injury and upper limb bimanual performance in a large sample of children (n=150), aged 6 to 12 years, with unilateral CP. The project will be conducted across 5 Australian sites specializing in the management of children with CP. The aim of this Project is to: (a) describe the association between and among cognition and upper limb bimanual performance in children with unilateral CP; (b) describe the association between and among cognition and upper limb bimanual performance and type and severity of brain injury in children with unilateral CP. </summary>
