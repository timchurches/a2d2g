  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease  that is endemic in developing countries. The incidence of leishmaniasis is more than 400,000 cases  annually and the prevalence of all form of leishmaniasis is more than twelve millions.
Although cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a self- healing disease , the duration of the disease is long and requeries several months and somtimes years before complete recovery , depending on the species of the infecting parasite . After recovery, a disfiguring scar can be left , which may destroy underlying structures like the nose or ear or cause psychological suffering of patients .
The first line drug for treatment of CL., according to WHO recommendation , is the pentavalent comounds such as meglomine antimoniate (Glucantime [ sb]
Other treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis are intralesinal injection of meglomine antimonate, terbinafine , paramonycin ointment ,                                     and physical treatment including cryotherapy (cryosurgery)  and                  therapy .Total clearance or marked improvement by systmic glucantime is  reported in 30%.
     In 1997a pilot study was performed on 27 cutaneous leishmaniasis lesions with terbinafine and 71.5% improvement (28.5% complate recovery and 43%  partial recovery) was reported in the pilat study,  efficacy of oral terbinafine used for cutaneous leishmaniasis was high and worthy .
The present trial was designed to evaluat the efficacy of combination therapy by terbinafine and cryotherapy in the treatment of CL. Compared with systemic glocantime and criyotherapy.</summary>
