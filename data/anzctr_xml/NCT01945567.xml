  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The posterior subthalamic area holds promise as a target region for deep brain stimulation in
      tremor and Parkinson's disease. Using the magnetic resonance-directed implantable guide tube
      surgical technique, subregions of the posterior subthalamic area can be individually
      targetted on a single electrode lead trajectory. The hypothesis is that the caudal zona
      incerta may provide improved control of movement disorder symptoms than the more commonly
      stimulated dorsal zona incerta.</summary>
