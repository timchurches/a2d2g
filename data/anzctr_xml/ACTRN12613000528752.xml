  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the intervention group will attend a follow-up clinic monthly for 1.5 hours for up to six months after discharge from the hospital. Screening instruments will be utilized and  appropriate management and referral provided. Examples of screening instruments are: overall medical review involving all systems assessment, medications, vital signs, assessment of mobility (modified Rivermead Mobility Index), balance assessment (Berg Balance measure) referrals to community for further rehabilitation, discussion with carer as to concerns (Zarit Burden interview), screening for chronic pain syndromes, nutritional review - referral to nutritionists and/or speech pathology if required, screening with UK-PTSS-14 (for post traumatic stress syndrome) and K-10 inventory for depression, referral to general practitioner or psychologists if needed, referral for occupational assessment re return to work or activities of daily living, liaison with general practitioners.</interventions>

    <concealment>The clinical staff will screen daily for patients while in intensive care. If patients appear suitable for the study, on discharge to the ward they will ask the patient as to whether the investigators may approach them to discuss the study. The patient will then be approached and provided with information about the study and asked for informed consent. If consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to one of two groups by the use of computer randomization by an independent perspn unaware of the patients current condition. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size 
Power calculations are based on SF-36 using previously published Minimally Clinically Important Differences (MCIDs) for the SF36 physical domain scores of 7.8 points (sd 15). The sample size, based on a two sample comparison of means was calculated at 78 per group for the SF-36 at 90% power with a two-sided, alpha error level of 0.05. Allowing for an almost 30% loss to follow up (mortality, drop outs) a total of 204 participants will be required


A baseline comparison of demographics, severity of illness acute physiological and chronic health evaluation score (APACHE II), and baseline measures will be done between each group, using a combination of t-tests and Chi-square.
Primary outcome: SF-36 domain scores and the summary score (utility) derived from the SF-36) will be compared between groups using a mixed model effect to allow for missing data. Secondary outcomes: Mortality will be compared between groups using a Cox proportional hazards (time until death) analysis proportional hazards (time until death) analysis. Time to first readmission will be compared between groups by a survival analysis. Health care costs will be compared between groups using a GLM to account for the non normal distribution. Economic (health resource) evaluation will be an incremental cost utility analysis. Direct costs included will be: cost of care provided in hospitals, by GPs, home nursing, complementary [allied] health providers, alternative health providers, opportunity cost of unpaid carers, cost of transportation to program and to other health services, and cost of pharmaceuticals. Indirect costs include loss of productivity due to disease, such as time lost from work or providing informal care to another individual. All costs will be valued using market costs where available and productivity costs will be valued using actual patient wage rates.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>IMPROVING OUTCOME OF SEPSIS

Greater numbers of patients are surviving intensive care but have poor quality of life due to immobility, poor cognition, post traumatic stress disorder, depression and frequent readmissions to hospital.  Patients with a severe infection sepsis are particularly affected.
This study aims to improve the overall outcome of critically ill patients with sepsis, through a follow up outpatient service. The intervention group will be screened by several instruments and appropriate referrals made. 
This trial will investigate whether these interventions can prevent readmission to hospital; improve health related quality of life, decrease mortality, and decrease utilization of health resources thereby decreasing the burden on the Australian health system.
