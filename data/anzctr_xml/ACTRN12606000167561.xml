    <studytitle>A multi-centre randomised trial of standard or higher targets for transfusion during chemo-radiation of cervix cancer.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A phase III feasibility study to evaluate the difference in average weekly haemoglobin concentrations between experimental and control groups and the impact of red cell concentrate transfusion of maintaining haemoglobin levels above 120g/l versus above 100g/l in anaemic patients with carcinoma of the cervix receiving concurrent cisplatin and radiation therapy.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive red cell concentrate transfusion to maintain their haemoglobin at pre-specified levels. Experimental Group From 120g/l Hb to 130g/l Hb.                                                         All patients receive external beam pelvic radiation with concurrent weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 followed by intracavity radiation.                                                                                                       External pelvic radiation +/- intracavity radiation with concomitant weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 delivered intravenously on days 1,8,15,22,29 and once during parametrial boost (if given). Ideally all treatment should be completed within 8 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference in average weekly haemoglobin concentrations between experimental and control groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured after each patient finishes treatment i.e. after 8 weeks, however final analysis of the primary outcome will occur after the required 100th patient has completed treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following will be analysed after accrual of 100 patients to assess the feasibility of the trial: rate of accrual;proportion of eligible women actually randomised and compliance with randomised treatment allocation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This analysis is due to take place two years after recruitment start date (approx May 2008).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
