  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single study with 2 separate phases (as approved by an ethics committee). In the pilot phase of this study, a single cohort of 10 subjects will be dosed with open-label perhexiline oral tablets as follows: Day 1 and 2 - 200 mg every 12 hours, Day 3 and 4 - 200 mg once on each day, Day 5 - 150 to 300 mg (as guided by individual Perhexiline plasma levels) and Day 6 - 400 mg once.
The Thorough QT (TQT) Phase of the study is blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm design with a nested crossover comparison to moxifloxacin.  Up to 100 subjects will participate in this phase, randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio into treatment assignments as listed below:
Day -2 - Placebo Perhexiline (all 3 groups)
Day -1 Placebo Moxifloxacin (Groups 1 and 2a), Moxifloxacin 400 mg (Group 2b)
Days 1 to 6 - Perhexiline (Group 1), Placebo Perhexiline (Groups 2 a and 2b)
Day 7 - Placebo Moxifloxacin (Groups 1 and 2b), Moxifloxacin (Group 2a)
Dosing for Days 1 to 6 is as follows:

Subjects Randomized to Perhexiline:

Days 1 to 2 - 2 x 100 mg Perhexiline in the morning
                  - 2 x 100 mg Perhexiline in the evening
Days 3 to 4 - 2 x 100 mg Perhexiline in the morning
                  - No evening dose
Day 5 - Single dose of Perhexiline of between 150 and 300 mg, guided by subject's plasma Perhexiline level
Day 6 -  4 x 100 mg Perhexiline in the morning
         - No evening dose

Subjects Randomized to Placebo:

Days 1 to 2 - 2 x 100 mg Placebo in the morning
                 - 2 x 100 mg Placebo in the evening
Days 3 to 4 - 2 x 100 mg Placebo in the morning
                  - No evening dose
Day 5 - 3 x 100 mg Placebo and 2 x 25 mg Placebo in the   morning
          - No evening dose
Day 6 - 4 x 100 mg Placebo in the morning
          - No evening dose

On Day 7, all subjects will receive either Moxifloxacin 400 mg or Placebo, orally once. 
Subjects enrolled in both the Pilot Phase and the TQT Phase of the study will remain in the unit for the duration of the dosing period, and protocol compliance will be strictly adhered to.</interventions>
    <comparator>Moxifloxacin will serve as the positive control in this study.
Perhexiline placebo will also be included in the study dosing.
Perhexiline Maleate matching placebos will be supplied in the identical sizes and colours as the active IR tablets.  Placebo Moxifloxacin will also be identical in size and colour to the placebo tablet, both of which will be overencapsulated.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Following the pilot phase of the study, which will evaluate the targeted perhexiline plasma levels on Days 4 and 6, the primary outcome is to evaluate the baseline-adjusted, placebo-corrected effect on QTcF of Perhexiline on Day 4 (targeting therapeutic plasma levels) and on Day 6 (targeting supratherapeutic plasma levels), or in case of a substantial heart rate effect, the correction formula (QTcF, QTcI and QTcS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous 12-lead ECG extraction will occur at the following timepoints: pre-dose, 0.5 hour, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Days 4 and 6.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the ability of the chosen dosing regimen to achieve targeted perhexiline plasma levels on Day 4 and Day 6 (Pilot Phase)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood sampling on Days 4 and 6 will occur pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of perhexiline on heart rate, PR and QRS intervals and T-wave morphology (TQT Phase)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring will occur from approximately 1 hour prior to dosing to approximately 24 hours after dosing on Days -2, -1, 4, 6 and 7.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the relationship between plasma concentration of perhexiline and the effect on the QTcF interval in healthy subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood sampling will occur pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose.  ECG extraction will occur at the same timepoints.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of 400 mg of moxifloxacin on the QTcF interval.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Moxifloxacin (or placebo) will be administered on Day -1 and Day 7.  Continuous ECG recordings and serial blood samples for pharmacokinetics testing will be performed on these days at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of perhexiline in healthy subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For the Pilot Phase, blood sampling for PK assessment will occur at 6 hours after the single dose on Day 3, and on Days 4 and 6 at pre-dose, (single dose)  and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose. For the TQT Phase, blood sampling for PK assessment will occur  pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dose on Day -1, Day1, Day 3 to 7, and on Day 8 (24 hour Day 7 sample).
Safety will be assessed by the following:
-Adverse events will be collected from Baseline (Day -2) until study follow-up (16 days plus or minus 2 days).  
-Physical examinations will be performed at screening, Day -2/-1, Day 4 and Day 7 (Pilot Phase)/Day 8 (TQT Phase).  
-Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, respiration and pulse) will be performed after the time windows for ECG extraction
- In addition to 12-lead ECGs, safety ECGs will occur 4 hours after morning dose of study drug or single dose (where applicable).  This will also be performed on Day 7 for the Pilot Phase, and Day 8 for the TQT Phase.
- Complete blood count, chemistry panel and urinalysis will be performed at screening, baseline, Day 4 and Day 7 (Pilot Phase)/Day 8 (TQT Phase) and follow-up (Day 16 plus or minus 2 days - both study phases).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Perhexiline is the study drug that is being developed by Heart Metabolics, Ltd to potentially treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a primary disease of the myocardium (the muscle of the heart) in which a portion of the myocardium is hypertrophied (thickened) without any obvious cause.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Perhexiline on heart conduction (the electrical activity of the heart) as compared to placebo (a tablet that will be made to look identical to the real drug but has no active ingredient) in healthy adult male and female volunteers.  Moxifloxacin, also known as Avelox Registered Trademark', is a compound designed as an antibiotic that is indicated for the treatment of adults with infections. Moxifloxacin is known to have minor effects on heart conduction. </summary>
