    <interventions>IFC Definition:
Interferential current therapy is the application of alternating medium- frequency current (4,000 Hz) ampli- tude modulated at low frequency (0250 Hz).(Fuentes 2010, Physiotherapy 2010 90-9 1219-1238)

IFC Adavntages:
A claimed advantage of IFC over low-frequency currents is its capacity to diminish the imped- ance offered by the skin.
Another advantage speculated for IFC is its ability to generate an amplitude- modulated frequency (AMF) parameter, which is a low-frequency current generated deep within the treatment area.(Fuentes 2010, Physiotherapy 2010 90-9 1219-1238)

IFC Effects:
Several theoretical physiological mechanisms such as the gate control theory, increased circulation, descending pain suppression, block of nerve conduction, and placebo have been proposed in the literature to support the analgesic effects of IFC.(Fuentes 2010, Physiotherapy 2010 90-9 1219-1238)


Our study is tries to get scientific evidence of the IF Currents effects over Chronic Neck Pain's Patients combined with a program of supervised therapeutic exercises. 

The intervention will be provided by a physiotherapist with more than 10 years experience.
The duration of each session will be aproximately one hour and half.
The number of sessions administried to each participant will be 10.
The aplication of the IF currents will be one on one and the exercises will be provided in group sessions.


IFC Parameters:

Treatment with interferential currents, bipolar method 4000 Hz carrier frequency and 60 Hz AMF with a modulation frequency of 90 Hz, with electrodes 5x10 cm2 placed in opposition to the neck (C5-C6-C7), during 25 minutes.

The intensity (voltage) of the IFC will be adapated to the sensitivity of each patient.
The current intensity during the treatment time must be increased 3 to 5 times, within the limits of patients' perception without exceeding the threshold of excitability and pain. The increased intensity is intended to retard the aparition of accommodative phenomena .

Patients will receive 10 sesions from monday to friday during two weeks.
The Physiotherapist will register the attendance at sessions.

This group will receive also a supervised exercises program before the IFC treatment.

Patients undertake the supervised exercise group treatment early in the morning (8:30h) and receive treatment with interferential currents throughout the morning.

The minimum interval between the completion of the exercises will be one hour (The first patient of this experimental group will end exercises at 9:30 and will start IFC tratment at 10:30) and up to four (The last patient will end exercises at 9:30 and will start IFC tratment at 13:30)

SUPERVISED EXERCISES PARAMETERS:

The supervised exercises will include:
1) Ergonomic advice on reducing repetitive motion and / or maintained positions.
2) Program active physiotherapy for neck and shoulder muscles including:
a. Active stretching exercises
b. Isometric muscle strengthening exercises
c. Reeducation program oculo cervico kinetic
d. Homeworks

.The exercises will be practised in a very slow way. It will not increase significantly the heart rate. Our objective is to induce relaxation and pain relief at the same time that we improve the neck muscles' flexibility and strength

Patients will receive 10 sesions of supervised exercises in groups from monday to friday during two weeks. The duration of the sessions will be one hour
The Physiotherapist will register the attendance at sessions.

In order to encourage the adherence to the home exercises, the information provided by the physiotherapist will be clear, concise and they will ask patient after each session how do they feel after the realization of the exercises the day before and if they have any doubt about them. The physical therapist will also ask patients to write a daily in order to detect questions during the intersessional period and to encourage the daily practice during the next months.

The physical therapist will try to convey the difference between a bearable pain of analytical stretching (which disappears quickly after the execution of exercises) and persistent chronic pain characteristic of neck pain. It will also encourage them to take a pain diary to encourage them to see how the crisis periods will inter spacing for more time thanks to the implementation of the program of home exercises. The aim is to demonstrate or better manage their self care and self-efficacy

They will be asked to complete the same exercises at home at least over 30 to 45 minutes once a day , during the two weeks of treatment and at least during  ten to twelve weeks after.</interventions>

The target population for whom this protocol is made up of all patients diagnosed with chronic neck pain mechanical subacute or irradiation with or without upper limb pain or head of the Health District of La Rinconada, Sevilla.

This study is clinical trial randomized longitudinal, prospective with double-blind groups.

Randomization will be realized by a randomization table. Therefore, the total sample was subdividided in two groups of 21 subjects for the experimental group and 21 subjects in the control group.

The calculation of the sample was obtained using the statistical package GPower 3.1 for Windows. We have considered unknown but equal variances, a large effect Cohen (or clinical effect) (0.8) and a 1: 1 ratio between the size of both groups. We have taken an alpha error and 95% type I and type II error or beta 80%, with two-tailed hypothesis. The resulting sample size of 21 subjects for the experimental group and 21 individuals in the control group.

Therefore the sample of this study will consist of 50 subjects (N = 50) divided into two groups: experimental group (GE) of 25 patients and the control group (GC) of 25 individuals, holding consultations Physiotherapy Center Health of San Jose de la Rinconada, located on the street postmen of San Jose de la Rinconada (La Rinconada, Sevilla). The sample was randomly selected among patients who meet the inclusion criteria. The dropout rate we have considered is about the 15%, so we considered we will need a sample size of 50 subjects that is a higher number than the proposed in the calculation of the sample (42).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic Neck pain is one of the health problems more extended among the general population which requires a multidisciplinary approach, coordinating specialist research teams and optimizing knowledge and technology developments in order to solve it. Neck pain is common, disabling and costly. Electrotherapy is an umbrella term that covers a number of therapies using electric current that aim to reduce pain and improve muscle tension and function. The present study presents a physical therapy procedure involving the use of  Interferential Therapy. The basic principle of Interferential Therapy (IFT) is to utilise the significant physiological effects of low frequency (&lt;250pps) electrical stimulation of nerves without the associated painful and somewhat unpleasant side effects sometimes associated with low frequency stimulation. Interferential Therapy (IFT / IFC) has been widely used in therapy for many years (usage reviewed in Pope et al, 1995 and more recently Shah and Farrow, 2012), Its use is probably disproportionate to both the volume and the quality of the published evidence, though it is strongly supported on an anecdotal evidence level, and several reviews are indicating an overall supportive evidence base, especially for pain based management (e.g. Fuentes et al, 2010). The main focus of this study is to compare the efficacy reducing the pain and the dissability of patients suffering chronic neck pain treated by the combination of IFT and a program of supervised therapeutic exercises versus the use of a program of supervised therapeutic exercises alone.</summary>
