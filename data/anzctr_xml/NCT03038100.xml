  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase III, global, double-blind, 2-arm randomized study designed to compare the
      efficacy and safety of atezolizumab + paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab versus placebo +
      paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab. Study participants will have Stage 3 or 4 ovarian
      cancer (OC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) with macroscopic
      residual disease postoperatively (i.e., after primary tumor reductive surgery) or who will
      undergo neoadjuvant therapy followed by interval surgery.</summary>
