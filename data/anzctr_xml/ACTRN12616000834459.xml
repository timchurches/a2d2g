  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions will be 60mins long, once a week for 12 weeks. 
A physiotherapist with specialist knowledge of PD (&gt;6yrs) will run the class in the pool whilst an AHA will be poolside to supervise and monitor.
The classes will contain 6 participants only at a time due to safety issues and will be onsite. 
At all times the participants are advised to exercise between 3-4 on the BORG scale.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility  assessed via Attrition (review of study records), Adherence (review of attendance log), Adverse events (during or after therapy sessions- logged in paperwork and via VHIMS Peninsula Health incident log). Possible adverse events may include dizziness due to low BP, reaction to chlorine- skin rashes, falls risk during transfers from change rooms to pool and vice versa. We will rely on patient self reporting skin rashes, any dizziness will be addressed via the medical team and falls risk will be minimal as the AHA poolside will walk close to patients during transfers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be recorded during the 12 week intervention period and attrition/ adherence will be collated at the end of the 12 weeks. </timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A total of 36 participants (12 in each group) with a confirmed diagnosis of Parkinsons Disease will be admitted into the program, with no self-reported history of any musculoskeletal, cardiothoracic, other neurological or psychological condition that might potentially affect their therapy. Patients must be medically stable to participate. If there is any doubt to medical stability, the patients GP must sign a medical assessment form deeming the patient suitable for hydrotherapy and land based physiotherapy. 
Patients must not be currently attending the aquatic or land physiotherapy groups at Peninsula Health and must be happy to participate in any treatment group as allocation is randomised.
Patients must have be able to walk unaided +/- gait aid, have an MMSE (mini mental state exam) score of more than 24 to show sufficient cognition for informed consent.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be performed through the RevMan/ SPSS statistical packages. A range of descriptive statistics will be applied to data to describe the participants. Additional parametric and non-parametric statistical methods will be used to explore the differences between groups. 
Sample size calculations via Priori calculations yielded a number of over 100 participants, which was deemed  unachievable. As this study is a feasibility study, it was discussed and agreed that 12 participants per intervention type would be most appropriate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to determine if there are changes in your function (for example balance and falling) after completing different aquatic (pool) or land exercises.  It is also going to increase the understanding of how people feel about aquatic (pool) and land physiotherapy.  
One pool group will complete exercises such as stretching, cardiac and general strengthening exercises whilst the other pool group will practise core exercises such as floating, rolling and other specific exercises. The land based exercise group will complete stretching, balance, strengthening and aerobic exercises. 
Participants will be asked to attend a 1hr class once a week for 12 weeks and will be invited to attend a focus group 3 months after finishing the trial.</summary>
