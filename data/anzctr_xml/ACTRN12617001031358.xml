    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated based on previously attained data using the POMS questionnaire. With a power of 80%, alpha of 0.05 and effect size of 0.8, it was calculated that 25 participants per group were required. Recruitment of 40 participants per group accounts for the observation of potentially smaller effect sizes for some wellbeing measures. An additional 10% (5 participants per group) will be recruited to allow for withdrawal over the duration of the study, therefore requiring 135 participants.
Statistical differences between and within groups for the fortnightly measurements will be determined using ANOVA with post-hoc analysis. Multivariate modelling will also be carried out to take into account time and confounders. Statistical trends over time between and within groups for the smartphone measurements will be analysed using growth curve modelling using the Hierarchical Linear Modelling programme. Statistical significance will be set at P=0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of adding SunGold kiwifruit to the diet on changes in vitality, fatigue, and wellbeing. The study aims to determine whether any improvements in these outcomes can be attributed to the high vitamin C content of the fruit. In a previous pilot study, we observed that intake of two kiwifruit/day for six weeks provided a significant 31% increase in vigour and a significant 38% decrease in fatigue in young men with a higher than average total mood disturbance score as assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Interestingly, intake of half a kiwifruit/day did not have any effect on mood scores, suggesting a dose dependency.
We are now proposing a larger study that includes both men and women, has more extensive measures of vitality, fatigue and wellbeing, and includes a vitamin C and a placebo comparison arm. This randomised controlled trial brings together the expertise of Professor Margreet Vissers, Dr Anitra Carr and Dr Tamlin Conner, New Zealand's leading research experts in vitamin C bioavailability and function (Vissers and Carr) and psychological wellbeing (Conner).
We will recruit participants who have low vitamin C status. Individuals will be randomised to one of three interventions: (1) Two SunGold kiwifruit per day; (2) vitamin C tablet daily (equivalent to the vitamin C content of two kiwifruit); (3) placebo tablet daily. We will monitor vitality/fatigue/wellbeing, using intermittent nightly smartphone surveys and traditional fortnightly assessments. The study will last for 10 weeks (2 week lead-in; 4 week intervention; 4 week washout period). Our hypothesis is that consumption of two SunGold kiwifruit per day will improve vitality, decrease fatigue, and improve wellbeing.</summary>
