  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will receive an intraduodenal infusion of intralipid (Registered trademark) (10% given at a rate of 2.8kcal/min or 2.545ml/min) or control (0.9% saline given at a rate of 2.545ml/min) for a duration of 90 minutes on each study day. On two occasions, they will receive infusions of control (saline) and on the other two occasions they will receive lipid (intralipid), once each during the luteal phase and follicular phases. Srudy visits will be separated by 3-14days. Energy intake will be assessed using a weighed buffet meal, immediately after infusion (t=90 minutes).
The buffet meal consists of:
4 slices of wholemeal bread (sunblest (Registered Trademark))
4 slices of white bread (sunblest (Registered Trademark))
100g of deli leg ham (Woolworths)
100g of chicken roll, shaved (Woolworths)
4 Coon Tasty (Registered Trademark) Cheese slices
100g of tomato 
100g iceberg lettuce 
100g of continental cucumber 
600ml of water
300ml of Daily Juice (Registered Trademark) unsweeted orange juice
375m Farmers Union (Registered Trademark) iced coffee
1 medium red delicious apple
1 medium banana
200g of Yogo (Registered Trademark) chocolate custard
150g of Goulburn Valley (Registered Trademark) fruit salad
200g of Yoplait (Registered Trademark) Strawberry yoghurt
25g of Flora (Registered Trademark) margarine
25g of Masterfoods (Registered Trademark) mayonnaise.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control (saline) treatment will be given on two of the four study sessions. Once during the follicular and once during the luteal phase of menstrual cycle. The control solution will be given at a rate of 2.545ml/min for a total of 90 minutes per study visit. The buffet meal (immediately after infusion) given to volunteers after the control arm is the same as that used for the intralipid treatment condition, decribed above.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each subject after a phone interview is invited to attend the Discipline of Medicine, Univeristy of Adelaide to meet with investigator 1. They will complete questionnaires to assess their dietary restraint, premenstrual symptoms and have their height and weight measured. Once they are determined to be eligble to participate they will be asked to complete a diary noting the timing of their menstrual cycle for no less than 2 months. They are then asked to contact investigator 2, who is the holder of the allocation schedule for the subject randomisation who will randomly allocate subjects to receive the different intervention treatments on set visit dates.</concealment>
    <sequence>This is a repeated measures study design where subjects are randomised to the different treatment conditions using randomised table generated using a program from: www.randomisation.com</sequence>

    <summary>Each subject will be required to attend the Discipline of Medicine, Royal Adelaide Hospital, on four occasions. They will receive in randomised, double-blind order, infusions of either lipid (Intralipid (Resgistered Trademark) or 0.9% saline. On two occasions, they will receive infusions of saline (control) and on the other two occasions they will receive lipid (once each during the luteal and folicular phases). The primary outcome evaluated will be energy intake assessed using measuring food intake at a buffet meal after the intraduodenal infusion.</summary>
