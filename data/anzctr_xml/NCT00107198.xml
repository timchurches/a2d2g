Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - prednisone
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Surgery or combination chemotherapy, with/without radiotherapy - Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 IV over 10-30 minutes and cyclophosphamide 800 mg/mg2 IV over 1 hour on day 1, vincristine sulfate 1.4 mg/m2 IV (2.8 mg maximum) over 1 minute on days 1 and 8, and prednisone 40 mg/m2/day PO or IV two or three times daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve CR after 3 courses of therapy proceed to follow-up. Patients who do not achieve a CR proceed to involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT).
IFRT: Beginning within 3 weeks after completion of combination chemotherapy, patients undergo IFRT once daily, 5 days a week for 2.8 weeks (14 treatments).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial is studying how well surgery and/or combination chemotherapy with or
      without radiation therapy or observation only work in treating young patients with newly
      diagnosed stage I or stage II lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin disease (LPHD). Surgery may be
      an effective treatment for LPHD. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin,
      vincristine, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) with or without radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
