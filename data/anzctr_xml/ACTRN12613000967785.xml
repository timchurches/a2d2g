  <interventions>
    <interventions>The investigational medicinal product (study medication) is F03 and the comparator is F03- matching placebo. F03 will be in the form of capsules in 5 mg strength.  
Dose administered in each cohort will be as follows:
Cohort 1: F03 5mg or placebo once daily
Cohort 2: F03 5mg or placebo twice daily
Duration of administration: 8 weeks.  
Mode of administration: oral capsule
Adherence of study drug administration will be checked at each visit (Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8) through the study diary cards that the participants are required to complete and study medication returns. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study will be stratified by Centre only and a randomisation list will be prepared for each centre.  A randomised block design will be used for each randomisation list.  The randomisation number will be used for the medication kits and the numbering system for the case report form.  An independent statistician will be assigned to prepare the final randomisation list.  
This study is double - blind; therefore the Sponsor personnel, Investigator, site staff and patient will not know which treatment has been assigned.  
If an emergency treatment code break is required then the Sponsors Medical Monitor and the site pharmacist will have access to the treatment assignment for each randomisation number.</concealment>
    <sequence>An independent statistician will be assigned to prepare the final randomisation list.  The randomisation list will be produced by using a randomisation table created by computer software (namely SAS version 9.2).</sequence>
