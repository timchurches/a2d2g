  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants' randomised into the intervention group will meet with an occupational therapist in hospital to begin discharge planning. Session one will be completed in hospital taking approximately 60minutes. The OT will conduct a pre-discharge home visit (approximately five days prior to discharge) and families will be included where possible. The pre-discharge home visit is expected to take between 60-90minutes. At the pre-discharge home visit, the Occupational Therapist will collaboratively review the needs of the participant to safely return home by reviewing home environment and the participant's ability to carry out day to day activities. During the post discharge (which will occur up to a week post discharge, taking around 60-90minutes) home visit the Occupational Therapist will focus on improving participant's ability to manage at home and increasing independence. Two follow up calls will be conducted (at two weeks and four weeks after the post-discharge home visit) used to reinforce strategies, and identify and resolve challenges (these follow up calls are expected to last around 15 minutes).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive an in-hospital consultation, conducted by an occupational therapist, which will facilitate discharge planning. The therapist will discuss the participants home environment and review their ability to carry out activities. All discharge planning will be facilitated from hospital.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Falls and readmissions will be recorded. Participants will record on each day if they fall or not on a monthly self-report falls surveillance calendar. They will then mail the calendar at the end of each month. Readmissions to hospital and length of stay will be collected via data linkage and self report.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) funded clinical trial will assess the effect of occupational therapy discharge planning for older adults on functional independence. The intervention will consist of in-hospital rapport building and discharge planning, a pre-discharge home visit, post discharge home visit and two follow up phone calls all completed by the same occupational therapist. 400 participants will be recruited from three hospital sites. Primary outcomes are functional independence and reintegration to normal living. Secondary outcomes include falls, physical acticity, health related quality of life, readmission rates and length of stay and self effciacy in every tasks. Cost effectiveness analysis of the program will also be undertaken.</summary>
