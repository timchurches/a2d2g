  <interventions>
    <interventions>All intervention participants will separately complete 6 lessons of Internet based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) about the management of symptoms of depression over 10 weeks. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 7 days between lessons and a maximum of 14 days). Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, email contact from the Clinician (Registered Psychologist or Psychiatrist) after completion of the first two lessons, then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and contact with the participant either by phone or email is initiated.

Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.

For all study participants, their diabetes treatment will not change and will continue as usual. For example, they will continue to receive regular monitoring from the appropriate Diabetes service and medication management for their diabetes. </interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU) waitlist control group. These participants remain on the waitlist and receive their usual treatment for diabetes until the immediate treatment group has completed their treatment and post-treatment assessment (11 weeks). At that time (11 weeks) the waitlist control group will be offered the same iCBT program for depression.

For all study participants, their diabetes treatment will not change and will continue as usual ('treatment as usual". For example, as part of usual treatment, participants will continue to receive regular monitoring from the appropriate Diabetes service and medication management for their diabetes. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous results, we anticipate the iCBT group to improve more than the TAU Control group by an ES of 0.8.

Assuming a more conservative ES of .60 for the secondary functional outcome measures we will recruit 50 participants in each group (allowing for at least 20% potential attrition). Sample size is powered to have an 80% chance of detecting differences at p less than or equal to .05.

Analyses will be undertaken using mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) ANOVA with measurement occasion as a within-groups factor and intervention as a between-groups factor. Relationships between observations at different occasions will be modelled with an unstructured covariance
matrix. For each experimental group, planned contrasts will be used to compare changes from baseline to post-intervention and 3- month follow-up and 6-month follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of the current study are to evaluate the efficacy of a validated internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy
(iCBT) program (CRUfAD's Sadness Program) for depression when delivered to individuals who meet criteria for a
major depressive episode comorbid with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.

This study will recruit 100 people with depression and diabetes and randomly allocate them to 1 of 2 conditions: Diabetes treatment as usual (TAU) + iCBT for depression or Diabetes TAU + delayed iCBT for depression (TAU waitlist control).

The primary outcomes will be to determine the impact of online CBT for MDD on depression symptoms and remission rates, as well as on diabetes-specific outcomes.

We will also measure adherence to the course material and satisfaction with the intervention generally.</summary>
