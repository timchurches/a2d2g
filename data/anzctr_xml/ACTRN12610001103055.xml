  <interventions>
    <interventions>The e-couch Anxiety and Worry program is available online at www.ecouch.anu.edu.au. This program is designed to prevent and reduce symptoms of generalised anxiety and includes information and exercises on psychoeducation, cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation and physical activity. Schools randomised to the intervention conditions will receive the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program during one class period (50-60 minutes) a week for 6 weeks. The program will be modulated, so as to deliver one section of the program each week. Classroom teachers and headspace education officers will be provided with a trial implementation guide.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The first aim of the current project is to assess the utility of two methods of implementing an anxiety prevention program in schools. This will assist in identifying the most effective dissemination method to increase the implementation of mental health prevention programs in schools. The two methods that will be evaluated have been named the e-GAD school method and e-GAD health service method. The e-GAD school method will involve the delivery of an Internet-based anxiety prevention program in schools by classroom teachers, while the e-GAD health service method will involve the delivery of the same program in schools by classroom teachers who are aditionally assisted and supported by headspace education officers. 

The second aim of the current project is to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of the implemented Internet-based program (e-couch Anxiety and Worry program) in reducing and preventing symptoms of anxiety in an adolescent school-based population relative to usual classes (wait-list control). The trial will delimit the likely range of the benefit of using the e-couch Anxiety and Worry program as a universal, active school-based prevention program.

Secondary aims of the trial are to evaluate the program's efect on participants' depressive symptoms, mental well-being, anxiety literacy, anxiety stigma,  and help-seeking behaviour, attitudes and intentions.</summary>
