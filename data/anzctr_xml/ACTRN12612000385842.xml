  <interventions>
    <interventions>Remifentanil syringes are loaded onto Braun infusion pumps and infused at 1 mL/kg/hour for 15 mins prior to commencement of the procedure. The neonate will recieve an intravenous infusion 0.1 mcg/kg/min remifentanil until central catheter has been threaded to its final position and secured OR until the central catheter has been threaded to its final position and all procedural activity has paused awaiting confirmation of catheter tip position by imaging (accepting that not all operators secure the line at this time) at which time the infusion will be ceased.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is a placebo of plain 5% Dextrose syringes, which are loaded onto Braun infusion pumps and infused at 1 mL/kg/hour for 15 mins prior to commencement of the procedure and until the central catheter has been threaded to its final position and secured OR until the central catheter has been threaded to its final position and all procedural activity has paused awaiting confirmation of catheter tip position by imaging (accepting that not all operators secure the line at this time) at which time the infusion will be ceased.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to determine the efficacy of remifentanil infusion for alleviating pain in neonates requiring insertion of central venous lines for their medical care, using pain scores (PIPPS) and facial grimacing derived from clinical monitoring data and facial coding data</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (T0), during skin preparation (T1), during needle insertion (T2), and during recovery (T3).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To collect steady-state pharmacokinetic data for analgesic infusions of remifentanil in neonates of varying gestational maturity.</outcome>
