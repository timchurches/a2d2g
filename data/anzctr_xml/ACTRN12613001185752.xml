  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is a dietitian based written resource providing recipes and advice to help include non-allergic nuts into the diet. This is given after consent to the intervention group. The intervention group also recieve reminder text messages at monthly intervals commencing one month after consent, for 6 months (5 text messages).

Children are advised to eat the non-allergic nut, at least once per week, of an amount based on age:
1-6 years: 10g nuts =1/2 Tbs of nut paste
7-12 years: 20g nuts =1/4 cup nuts = 1 Tbs nut paste
13-18 years: 30g nuts = 1/3 cup nuts = 1.5 Tbs nut paste

The efficacy of the intervention will be determined 6 months after randomisation by a one month dietary recall of how many of the previous 4 weeks the weekly target has been met.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will have usual practice of verbal advice to introduce non-allergic nuts at home and a document on how to do this (intervention group will also recieve this).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether the provision of written dietary advice and reminders to parents of children with nut allergy leads to ingestion of non-allergic nuts into the diet when compared to current practice.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the changes in sensitisation to allergic and non-allergic nuts when nuts are ingested.

Children will have repeat skin prick testing at the end of the 6 month period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether there is an increase in accidental exposure to allergic nuts in those who ingest non-allergic nuts.

Phone questionnaire at the end of the 6 month period of any accidental exposures or reactions. Parents also asked to immediately report any adverse reactions to any food.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess changes in quality of life of parents of children with nut allergy who ingest non-allergic nuts.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Children between the ages of 12 months and 18 years with likely or known nut allergy as defined by positive challenge and/or positive skin prick test (&gt;3mm)

Children will be required to have evidence that they are not allergic to at least one or more other nuts by negative skin prick testing, negative challenge or already tolerating the nut in normal dietary intake.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential recruits will be provided with the information sheet and consent form along with the usual written material on introducing non-allergic nuts at home. This will either be handed to them at clinic or Medical Day Unit appointment, or posted to them at home after a previous discussion in person.  

Potential recruits will be contacted via phone after they have had a chance to read the information sheet and will be asked over the phone for verbal consent. If consented, both groups will also be asked to fill out and return the written consent form and a baseline quality of life questionnaire which will be included in the initial material. Baseline patient data will be collected through history over the phone and from the case notes.

Once consented, the patient details will be sent to administrative staff who will randomise the patient to either intervention or control by computer. They will post the intervention group the additional dietitian booklet. The investigators will not be aware of which group each patient is in when collecting follow up data.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be randomised into two groups using a computer based randomisation program. Administrative staff will mail the treatment group a written booklet developed by the Immunology/Allergy Dietician.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children who have nut allergies must avoid that nut in their diet, but this can be difficult to achieve. Young children may be unable to tell different nuts apart due to similarities in appearance. Nuts can also be present in baked goods, dips, muesli bars and other foods, requiring reading of the label. Some children are also allergic to more than one nut adding complexity to this process. Having a child who is allergic to nuts can also cause anxiety around social events such as parties and school camps and can have a significant impact on quality of life of both the parents and child.

Due to the difficult nature of avoiding one type of nut, in the past it has been common for parents to avoid all nuts, either on advice of their doctor, or for their own peace of mind. More recently however, it appears that there may be benefits from having ongoing exposure to non-allergic nuts in our diets. Totally avoiding nuts we are not allergic to may increase the risk of developing an allergy to this nut later on.

Parents of children with nut allergy are now being advised to include non-allergic nuts in their childs diet on an ongoing basis. To ingest the suggested amount of nut as often as required can be difficult. In this study, we will provide to the intervention group, a resource which aims to help parents achieve this. It contains a series of recipes and suggestions for including nuts in every day foods to provide an alternative to eating whole nuts. This group will also receive monthly text messages reminding them to include non-allergic nuts in the diet. We also hope that this will increase knowledge surrounding the intake of nuts, reduce anxiety and help to improve quality of life for these families.
