  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to describe the pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of Pentoxifylline in preterm infants with suspected sepsis or NEC. Pentoxifylline plasma levels will be determined by means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of suspected or confirmed sepsis or NEC while an inpatient from birth. Four small (0.2ml each) blood samples will be taken before, at 6-12hr, 12-24h and &gt;24h after the start of the initial PTX dose. If they are diagnosed with confirmed or probably sepsis or NEC (based on blood culture, abdominal X-ray and CRP equal or greater than 20mg/L) after 48hr they will continue on PTX for 4 additional days at 6hr/day (30mg/kg/day) and one additional blood sample will be taken once during this time. We will also utilise any leftover blood samples taken for routine blood tests once these are complete. This will allow us to opportunistically analyse and integrate into our analysis the small remaining blood samples that would normally be discarded. The use of a population pharmacokinetic model allows for this utilisation of unplanned samples, unlike traditional pharmacokinetic studies. PTX levels will be determined and the optimal population pharmacokinetics model (with the inclusion of significant covariates such as weight and gestational age) obtained from which simulations of alternative dose regimens will be performed. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preterm infants are highly susceptible to bacterial late-onset sepsis (LOS) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), both are major causes of systemic inflammation and contribute to brain injury and long-term disability in premature infants. Treating LOS and NEC are essential for survival, but suppressing systemic inflammation can also help reduce mortality, hospital stay and disability due to brain injury. The current treatments for NEC and LOS are limited to antibiotics, supportive care and surgery in some NEC cases, all of which do not aid in reducing systemic inflammation, therefore there is a need to reduce systemic inflammation. Pentoxifylline is a safe, low-cost, non-steroidal drug with potent immune-modulating activity with the potential of suppressing systemic inflammation induced by LOS or NEC. A recent Cochrane Review of 6 randomised controlled trials (RCT) suggests that PTX, given with antibiotics in neonatal sepsis, reduces mortality and length of hospital stay. 
We will enrol and consent 23 preterm infants (&lt;29 weeks gestational age) and intravenously administer Pentoxifylline, adjunct to standard care, for 48hrs within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms suggestive of sepsis or NEC. After 48 hours treatment will cease if diagnosis is refuted or will continue for 4 days if diagnosis is proven.  To measure the pharmacokinetic profile of Pentoxifylline a series of four small blood samples will be taken prior to starting treatment and during treatment.  The pharmacokinetic profile will allow us to model the optimal infusion frequency and duration, which will be used as a guideline in larger randomised controlled trials that will assess white matter injury and long-term disability.</summary>
