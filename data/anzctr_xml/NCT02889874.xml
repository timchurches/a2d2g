             metachronous).

                  colon; melanoma in situ; and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin at any
                  time prior to randomisation are not excluded from study participation.

               -  Patients who are diagnosed with other non-breast malignancy =5 years prior to
                  randomisation and without evidence of disease recurrence are not excluded from
                  study participation.

         10. Significant comorbidity precluding definitive RT for breast cancer (e.g.
             cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus).

         11. Life expectancy &lt;10 years.

         12. Documented mutation of BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53, or at high genetic risk of breast cancer.

         13. Pregnant or lactating patients.

         14. Inability to be registered to the study =6 weeks after the last surgical procedure for
             breast cancer.

         15. Inability to commence RT (if randomised to receive RT) no later than 12 weeks from the
             last surgical procedure for breast cancer.

         16. Inability to provide written informed consent.
