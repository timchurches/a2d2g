  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Belly Bed is an advanced maternity airbed manufactured by The Belly Bed Pty Ltd designed to provide relief for pregnancy related pain. It is divided into three different compartments (the main bed, abdominal cavity and leg rest) which can be independently inflated by internal electronic air valve pump to accommodate user's need. The recessed abdominal compartment may be adjusted to accommodate different size of the growing abdomen throughout pregnancy.

A open-label, parallel group study design whereby each participant is randomised in 1:1 ratio into Group A and Group B whereby Group A uses TBB while Group B continues to use their own Bed until delivery of the child.

Participants are anticipated to use either TBB or their own Bed until the delivery of the child. Participants will be required to complete Participant Diary every day following Baseline Visit and these diaries will be monitored to ensure participant's adherence to the intervention as per the study protocol.

Participants are required to complete questionnaires on pain and quality of life and physical examination and vital signs will be performed during their routine Follow Up Visits (as part of the study) to assess the health of the participants and be monitored for any abnormalities.

The dimension of fully inflated TBB is 198 centimetres by 117 centimetres by 55 centimetres and it supports up to 220 kilograms of net weight. Instruction Manual will be provided to the participants to instruct them on safe usage of TBB.
