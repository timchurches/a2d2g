    <interventions>Group 1: Stretching &amp; MAM
Group 2: Stretching &amp; IAM
Group 3: Stretching

Group one (standard care): a series of active cervical range of motion stretches held for 30sec, repeated 3 times in six different directions for a total of 5 minutes in addition to one high-velocity, low-amplitude manually applied manipulation (MAM) administered on a single occasion to the cervical spine.

Group two (comparison intervention): stretching routine as described above in addition to one instrument applied manipulation (IAM) administered on a single occasion to the cervical spine. IAM will be delivered using an Activator IV instrument which delivers a measurable force to the desired target (in this instance the lower cervical spine). </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Calculation of sample size was based on the following: detecting a difference of 0.4 units in pressure pain threshold levels, a standard deviation of 0.4, comparison of 2 means, an alpha of 0.05, and a desired power (beta) of 80%. These assumptions generated a sample size of 21 participants per group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to measure the effect of cervical spinal manipulation on people with non-specific neck pain. The research question relates to whether the magnitude of force of a manipulation influences the extent of effect. The project is a single-blinded randomised controlled clinical trial with three equal groups: one control and two intervention. Sixty-three participants, between the ages of 18 and 35 years with a history of non-specific neck pain originating from the lower cervical spine will be randomly allocated to one of three groups. Group 1 (standard care) will receive a single standardized 5-minute neck stretching exercise routine plus a single manually applied manipulation of the cervical spine. Group 2 (comparison intervention) will receive the same stretching program plus a single instrument applied manipulation to the cervical spine. Group 3 (control) will only receive the stretching program. Outcome measures include changes in neck pain, cervical range of motion, hand grip-strength and blood pressure.</summary>
