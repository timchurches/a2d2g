  <interventions>
    <interventions>Needle acupuncture will be given to women randomised to the intervention group. They will receive ten sessions of acupuncture over eight weeks. Treatments will be given twice weekly for the first fortnight then weekly. Needles will be retained for 20-30 minutes and will be stimulated manually every 10 minutes. Needles will be inserted into points on ankles, elbows, wrists and abdomen. To maintain blinding, a base unit comprising a guide tube and base plate (see below - control group) will also be used in the intervention group.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo acupuncture will be administered using the "Park Sham device", which consists of a blunt needle and a base unit comprising a guide tube and base plate, which is attached to the skin with adhesives. This form of acupuncture is also referred to as "non invasive sham". Placebo acupuncture will be given over 10 sessions over 8 weeks. Treatments will be twice weekly for the fist fortnight then weekly. Placebo needles will be placed over points on the ankles, wrists, elbows, and abdomen. Needles will be retained for 20-30 minutes and will be stimulated manually every 10 minutes.</comparator>

    <concealment>Women will be assigned to their treatment group by the chief investigator selecting the next consecutive sealed opaque envelope upon enrolling them into the trial. These envelopes are prepared by a research assistant and are numbered 1-26 (there are 26 participants in this pilot study). The envelopes contain either placebo or true acupuncture needles in their blister pack, which indicate to the chief investigator (who will be providing the acupuncture treatments) which treatment group the woman has been allocated to. Prior to the envelopes being opened, the woman's name and ID Number will be written on the envelope together with the date of randomisation, which will avoid any contamination of the randomisation process.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hot flushes and night sweats are common during menopause, and can be bothersome. Effective treatment of hot flushes carries risks, including cancer and heart disease. This small preliminary study aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial on acupuncture for hot flushes. The hypothesis is that acupuncture is more effective than placebo acupuncture in relieving hot flush severity and frequency, and in improving quality of life. Lessons learned from this pilot study will assist in conducting a larger trial which will investigate whether acupuncture improves the number and severity of hot flushes.</summary>
