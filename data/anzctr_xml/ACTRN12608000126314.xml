  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised, controlled;
People will be randomly allocated into one of two groups.
The first group is flat-ground walking group
People in this group will be trained in the rehabilitation gym, walking around a rectanglar track starting from 30 minutes and gradually increase up to 45 minutes by week 6. The training will go for 8 weeks, 3 times per week. The walking speed of each individual is based on their incremental shuttle walk test result (75% of their peak walking speed). We aim to increase their walking speed according to their exercise tolerance each week.</interventions>
    <comparator>People will be randomly allocated into one of two groups.
The second group is cycling group
People in this group will be trained in the rehabilitation gym with a stationary bike, starting with 30 minutes training and gradually increase up to 45 minutes. The initial intensity is set at 60% of their peak work rate achieved in the incremental cycle test. The training will go for 8 weeks, three times per week. We aim to increase their exercise intensity according to their exercise tolerance each week.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to determine whether the benefit of flat-ground walking training is similar to cycling training in improving exercise capacity and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Hypothesis: On completion of an eight-week training program, subjects with COPD will demonstrate similar improvement in exercise capacity and HRQoL in the flat-ground walking training group and the cycling grop.</summary>
