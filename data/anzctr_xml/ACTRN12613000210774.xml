    <interventions>Prospective, observational study assessing ethnic differences in rates, diagnosis and response to standard treatment for thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis is an overactive thyroid gland with abnormal thyroid function on blood testing.
The rates of referrals for thyrotoxicosis for Maori, Pacific Island peoples and NZ europeans/Pakeha/other Europeans will be compared to that expected based on the demographics of the Waikato Hospital catchment area. The underlying cause of the thyrotoxicosis will be determined for each group and compared. The response to standard treatment (carbimazole) will be assessed after 12 months treatment as to whether there are ethnic differences in response. Similarly response to treatment after radioactive iodine therapy will be assessed 12 months after treatment. Recruitment will occur over a 3 year period with a minimum 12 months follow up for participants.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thyrotoxicosis is a common endocrine disorder. When untreated, it leads to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and premature death. There appear to be ethnic differences in the incidence, severity and presentation of thyrotoxicosis, although there is little published data to confirm this. Maori appear to be disproportionately over-represented in patients referred with thyrotoxicosis and have more severe disease. In addition, for Maori and Pacific peoples a single dose of radioactive iodine is less likely to be curative. The reasons for these apparent differences are unknown. The objective of this research is to confirm whether there are ethnic differences in the presentation and treatment outcome of thyrotoxicosis. We plan a prospective observational study to assess ethnic differences in the presentation, severity and response to treatment of all new patients referred with thyrotoxicosis. Results from this research may identify factors which enable us to individualise therapy for thyrotoxicosis and reduce disparities in outcome.</summary>
