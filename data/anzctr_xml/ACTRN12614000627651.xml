    <statisticalmethods>The primary end-point was IDS scores. Sample size calculation was based on data from  previous work comparing intubating characteristics of the Macintosh, Pentax Airway Scope and Glidescope videolaryngoscopes in predicted difficult intubations. On the basis of prior studies in this population, the expected mean IDS score was at least 4, representing moderately difficult intubating conditions, in patients undergoing tracheal intubation with the Macintosh laryngoscope. A 50% reduction in the mean IDS score eg.IDS score of &lt; 2 in patients intubated with videolaryngoscopes was deemed clinically significant. Given an expected standard deviation (SD) of 2.25 from prior studies, at alpha=0.05 and beta =0.2, 24 patients per group would be required. We therefore recruited 25 patients per group.

Data are reported as mean (SD), medians [range] and incidences (both absolute and percentage). The normal distribution of data was tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. One-way ANOVA analysis was used to assess parametric data including intubation times and haemodynamic parameters. Data for the IDS score, the number of intubation attempts, and the numbers of optimization manoeuvres were analysed using ANOVA or
KruskalWallis ANOVA on ranks as appropriate. When significant differences were encountered, post-hoc pair wise comparison was performed using Bonferronis correction. Non-parametric data were evaluated for differences among the groups using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Other categorical and dichotomous variables such as ASA status, Mallampati, preoperative airway parameters like thyromental and inter-incisor distance, cervical spine mobility, Cormack and Lehane grades, differences in number of intubation attempts, use of optimisation manouvres, use of additional adjuncts and airway complications were analyzed using Chi -square tests. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, IBM Chicago, IL). P &lt;0.05 was considered significant.
