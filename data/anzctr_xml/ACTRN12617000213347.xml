    <statisticalmethods>Being a pilot proof of concept study there are no data that can be utilised to calculate sample size for this study. Investigators feel that relatively small sample size of 50 participants in each arm would be sufficient to demonstrate any serious adverse events that could inform future design of a larger study. This small sample may also be able to detect any large difference in outcomes such as pregnancy rates but the magnitude of effect would need to be quite substantial. 
It is anticipated that Students t test will be used for continuous variables and Chi-square test to asses differences in proportions. Due to small sample size non-parametric equivalents of the above tests will also be used. It is anticipated that a regression analysis will be undertaken in order to control for important variables such as female age, BMI, etc.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Implantation failure is the main factor affecting the success rate of IVF procedures.  Excessive uterine contractions have been described as a potential reason for reduced implantation rates in IVF cycles.  Contractile activity of the uterus could move the implanted embryo towards the Fallopian tubes or cervix/vagina or the embryo might even be expelled out of the uterus. 

Mechanical measures to reduce the uterine contractions at the time of embryo transfer include using a soft catheter without touching the fundus (the top of the uterus) and the use of ultrasound to guide embryo transfer.  Various medications have been investigated to reduce uterine contractions, including cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, B2-adrenoreceptor agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors.  These have yielded variable results with atosiban, an oxytocin/vasopressin receptor antagonist, looking most promising for improving implantation and pregnancy rates.

Calcium channel blockers are non-specific smooth muscle relaxants, used for the treatment of high blood pressure in adults and have an established role in preterm labour due to its uterine relaxing properties. In the uterus, the calcium channel blockers exert their anti-contraction effect by preventing the influx of extracellular calcium ions into the myometrial cell (the middle wall of the uterus) and have been demonstrated in laboratory experiments to have potent relaxant effect on human myometrium (the middle wall of the uterus).  The most widely used and studied calcium channel blocker is nifedipine and there is evidence that this can be safely used in pregnancy.  

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of nifedipine administration in improving implantation and pregnancy rates in IVF/ICSI fresh or frozen embryo transfers.
