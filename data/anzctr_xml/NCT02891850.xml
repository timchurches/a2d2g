    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Adempas (Riociguat, BAY63-2521)
Treatment: drugs - Sildenafil
Treatment: drugs - Tadalafil

Experimental: BAY63-2521 - PDE5i treatment will be stopped and riociguat treatment initiated following a defined washout period with a starting dose of 1 mg riociguat TID followed by an 8 weeks dose adjustment phase according to the approved riociguat dose adjustment scheme.

Active Comparator: Sildenafil or Tadalafil - Patients will continue to receive PDE5i treatment as well as other standard of care treatments at the discretion of the investigator up to Week 24. Patients in the experimental and active comparator treatment arms follow the same visit schedule.


Treatment: drugs: Adempas (Riociguat, BAY63-2521)
Film-coated tablets will be used in this study at a dosage of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg and 2.5 mg. Tablets will be administered orally.The starting dose is 1 mg TID; the intervals between drug intakes should be 6 to 8 hours. The dosage should be increased by 0.5 mg increments in 2 week intervals to 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, and 2.5 mg TID (maximal total daily dose).

Treatment: drugs: Sildenafil
Patients randomized to the control arm will continue to receive stable doses of tadalafil (daily dose 20 to 40 mg) or sildenafil (daily dose at least 60 mg) as well as other supportive treatments at the discretion of the investigator.

Treatment: drugs: Tadalafil
Patients randomized to the control arm will continue to receive stable doses of tadalafil (daily dose 20 to 40 mg) or sildenafil (daily dose at least 60 mg) as well as other supportive treatments at the discretion of the investigator.

             pressure (PCWP) = 15 mmHg as assessed by the most recent right heart catheterization
             (RHC) from medical history prior to screening to confirm the diagnosis. Alternatively,
             PCWP can be replaced by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (= 15 mmHg). PAH of
             the following types:

               -  Idiopathic

               -  Hereditary
