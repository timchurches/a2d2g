  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study device, Graftys(R)HBS or Graftys(R)Quickset, is an injectable self-hardening macroporous synthetic calcium phosphate bone substitute. 
Both of them demonstrate approximately 65-70% total porosity, of which about 8% is macroporosity (pore size from 100 to 300 microns).
Graftys(R)HBS is a low viscosity cement that has a longer setting time and a lower compressive strength but which can be applied through a narrow gauge cannula. Graftys(R)Quickset has a highly viscosity and shorter setting time
This is a prospective, randomised, controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety and clinical utility (i.e., performance, functional radiographic parameters) of Graftys(R)HBS or Graftys(R)Quickset in the treatment of unstable distal radius fractures. All enrolled subjects will be treated by percutaneous reduction, minimally invasive or noninvasive fixation techniques, including casting, external fixation, external fixation with percutaneous pins, percutaneous pins or screws with cast or percutaneous pins with cast. The resulting bone void will be grafted with Graftys(R)HBS (Arm 1), Graftys(R)Quickset (Arm 2) or no bone void filler (Arm 3), when assigned by the randomization schema.
The graft material will be  implanted percutaneously or manually packed into the fracture space, dependent upon the method of fixation, prior to, during, or following reduction and fixation and stabilisation of the fracture. 
The graft material will be constructed to fill comminuted fracture spaces via interdigitation within comminuted cancellous bone, both dorsally, distally and proximally. The degree of fill required may vary from less than 2mm to as much as 2cm depending on the amount of bone involved.
When implanted, the graft material may prevent the collapse of a fracture caused by compressive forces generated by the muscle tendon units crossing the fracture site. The procedure time will vary depending on time taken to achieve an adequate reduction of the fracture.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to maintain position reduction as per X-ray/CT scan analysis.
The hypothesis for this study is that Graftys(R)HBS or Graftys(R)Quickset, when applied to the bone void, will result in accelerated time to fracture healing, as measured functionally, clinically, and/or radiographically.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be evaluated  via X-ray at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. CT scans will be performed at 1 week and 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the patient's physical function (such as Grip strength, Range of Motion and Hand Function) utilising the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH). The DASH measures physical function and symptoms in people with musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be evaluated at  6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients presenting in the trauma clinic with a distal radius fracture will be evaluated and considered for study participation by the participating investigator/delegate. Patients will be selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Enrollment in the study begins at the time written consent is obtained. The Investigator or designee is responsible for verifying that the subject meets all inclusion and has none of the exclusion criteria prior to randomisation of the subject.</concealment>
    <sequence>Within each center, the subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups in a 1:1:1 block randomisation: 	Group I: Graftys(R)HBS; 
			Group II Graftys(R)Quickset;
			Group III: No bone graft material.
Randomization assignments will not be re-used in the event that the subject withdraws from the study prior to treatment, or becomes an intra-operative treatment failure. It is suggested that randomization occur within 48 hours of the scheduled surgery.


There are equal numbers of patients in each group, ie (Minimum of 10 to a maximum of 50 patients per study arm)

A 1:1:1 block randomisation will be used in the study. The assignments are predetermined through a schedule generated using randomly permuted blocks with random block sizes method. Randomisation plan generator available on the randomisation.com website was used (Dallal, 2008)</sequence>
