    <interventions>Dermud Intensive Nourishing Body Lotion Dry Skin TreatmentDead Sea water and sea silt (Dead Sea mud), which is 46% natural magnesium chloride n the crystalline form. It also contains 2.2% Calcium chloride (CaCl 2) , 0.5% potassium chloride (KCl), 0.8% sodium chloride (NaCl), small amounts of bromides and sulfates These ingredients are listed as humectants together with glycerin, bisabolol and panthenol; isohexadecane, Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), isopropyl myristate and Hippophae
rhamnoides oil as emollients; caprylic/capric triglyceride,
stearalkonium hectorite, propylene carbonate, cetyl polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol  10/11 dimethicone and polyglyceryl-4-isostearate as emulsifiers; and Aloe barbadensis leaf juice and sodium lactate as moisturizers. Additionally, the product contains calendula extract, glycerin, butylene glycol, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, allantoin and calamine as anti-irritants. Participants were instructed to apply topically to the skin of the entire body twice daily and following bathing for a period of two weeks.  Patients were randomized to treatment with the active treatment or with one of two placebos, placebo 1 or placebo 2.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo 1 (P1)was identical to the active treatment but without Dead Sea minerals and sea silt. Placebo 2 (P2) was identical to P1 but contained no moisturizing ingredients (Aloe barbadensis leaf juice or sodium lactate).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the present randomized, double placebo-controlled clinical trial was to compare the efficacy of topical application with body lotion enriched with minerals from the Dead Sea (DS) to each of two types of placebo: (1) lotion with no Dead Sea minerals but otherwise identical to DS (Placebo 1) or (2) lotion with no active ingredients (Placebo 2), in reducing symptoms of uremic pruritus (itching, peeling, tightness and dryness) in stable maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients.  Our hypothesis was that DS would be superior to either of the two placebos in reducing these symptoms.</summary>
