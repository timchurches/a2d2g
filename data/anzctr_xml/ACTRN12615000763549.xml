    <interventions>LVsh5/C46 (Cal-1) is an experimental treatment for HIV-1 infection. It is designed to disrupt HIV-1 infection in two ways: First, it removes a protein named CCR5 from your white blood and bone marrow cells. Second, it produces a protein named C46 to block the entry of HIV-1 into cells.

Cal-1 is delivered into your white blood and bone marrow cells using a modified, inactive virus called a lentiviral vector. Once inside your cells, the changes made by Cal-1 to those cells are permanent and may make those cells resistant to HIV-1. This will improve the immune system, as HIV-1 usually kills white blood cells.

There are multiple experimental parts to this study. These include:
1. the laboratory procedures to insert LVsh5/C46 (Cal-1) into bone marrow cells (specifically, CD34+ stem cells and white blood cells (specifically, CD4+ T cells) and then culture these cells to increase the number;
2. the effect of infusing Cal-1-modified cells in humans;
3. using chemotherapy before infusion of Cal-1-modified cells to aid take-up of the stem cells by your bone marrow.

There are three parts to this study:
Part A  your medical history (including history of your HIV-1 infection and treatment) will be reviewed and screening tests performed to confirm that you are eligible to participate;

Part B  The collection of white blood cells (CD4+ T cells) and bone marrow (CD34+) stem cells are collected using a process called leukapheresis. The collection of CD34+ bone marrow cells requires 5 days treatment with drugs (Neupogen (Registered Trademark) and Mozobil (Registered Trademark) that move the cells from your bone marrow into your blood . Your CD4+ T cells and CD34+ bone marrow cells are taken to a specialised laboratory where they are modified with Cal-I. You will be asked to stop taking your antiretroviral drugs for a supervised 4-week period before and during this process. Once these cells are collected you will resume taking your antiretroviral drugs.

Part C  you will receive 1 or 2 doses of chemotherapy as an intravenous infusion of Busulfex (Registered Trademark), followed by infusions of Cal-1-modified cells 2 days later. After the infusion, you will have regular study visits for approximately 1 year to monitor the presence and activity of Cal-1, the effect of the Busulfex chemotherapy as well as your overall health. At 26 weeks after receiving the cells, you will again stop taking your antiretroviral drugs. If your viral load and CD4+ counts remain below safety limits, you may continue off ART and continue to be monitored for up to 1 additional year

There are two different treatment Groups planned, each with three participants. The only planned difference between Groups 1 and 2 is the dose of chemotherapy used. 

There is only a single dose of each Cal-1-modified cell type (the actual doses being dependent on the cell numbers harvested, and subsequent yields from the laboratory procedures for each individual study participant). </interventions>
    <comparator>This study is part of the first stage of testing Cal-1 in humans. It is a requirement that all study participants are receiving standard of care antiretroviral therapy for their HIV infection.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and feasibility of introducing Cal-1 gene-transduced CD4+ lymphocyte and CD34+ bone marrow stem cells following chemotherapy conditioning with intravenous busulfan in HIV-1-infected adults receiving effective ART.

This is a composite outcome, assessing adverse events and correlations with the Cal-1 gene-transduced CD4+ lymphocyte and CD34+ bone marrow stem cell product dose and characteristics. This outcome is assessed by physical examinations and vital signs, complete blood counts, serum biochemistry, lymphocyte phenotyping, HIV-1 plasma viral load, and HIV-1 ART resistance genotype testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48weeks after receipt of the Cal-1-modified cells</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Survival (engraftment, differentiation and contribution) of Cal-1-modified CD4+ lymphocytes and CD34+ bone marrow stem cells over time.

This is a composite outcome of survival, engraftment and contribution over time of the Cal-1-modified cells as measured by specialised tests that measure the presence and expression of Cal-1 in whole blood, specific types of white blood cells, bone marrow and gut tissue</outcome>
      <timepoint>Initially, up to 48 weeks after receipt of the Cal-1-modified cells, with the possibility of extension up to 100 weeks after receipt of the Cal-1-modified cells</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of Cal-1-modified CD4+ lymphocytes and CD34+ bone marrow stem cells on plasma viral load

This is a composite outcome based on measures of HIV plasma viral load and CD4+ lymphocytes during the period off anti-retroviral therapy (ART).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study participants will stop their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) 26 weeks after the Cal-1-modified cell infusions, and will remain off ART up to 48 weeks after receipt of the Cal-1-modified cells, with the possibility of extension up to 100 weeks after receipt of the Cal-1-modified cells. The secondary outcomes are assessed throughout this period at study visits every month +/- 2 weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The gene transfer product Cal-1 aims to protect CD4+ T lymphocytes and blood cells from CD34+ bone marrow stem cells from HIV-1 infection. The protective effect may suppress the HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load and maintain the CD4+ T lymphocyte count in a treated individual, thereby decreasing or delaying (either partially or completely) the need for ART.

The purpose of this study is to help determine whether Cal-1, as well as the method used to deliver Cal-1, is safe in people. Cal-1 is an experimental treatment for HIV-1 infection. This means that Cal-1 is not an approved treatment for HIV-1 in Australia. Cal-1 has already been tested in the laboratory and in animals, this study is part of the first stage of testing Cal-1 in people.

We aim to collect preliminary information on whether Cal-1 can protect the persons immune system from the effects of HIV by reducing HIV-1 viral load and/or preventing further decline in T cell counts.
