  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 dose levels of rimonabant (5 mg
      and 20 mg) for the maintenance of abstinence from smoking.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of rimonabant on craving and weight, the
      clinical and biological safety of 2 doses of rimonabant rimonabant during a 12-month
      treatment period and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the drug.</summary>
