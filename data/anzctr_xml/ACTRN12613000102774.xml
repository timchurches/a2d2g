    <interventions>Comparison of outcomes of 2 surgical techniques in Indigenous children with OM living in remote communities.

Arm 1: bilateral myringotomy with adenoidectomy
Arm 2: bilateral grommet tube insertion and adenoidectomy

Both surgical interventions are performed once only under general anaesthetic according to standard, current surgical protocols and each routinely take less than 30 minutes. Surgery is performed by ENT specialists.  There is nothing novel involved with these procedures.  The study objective is to compare the outcomes of current interventions after 12 months.
The target group is the same as the original study, ie Indigenous children aged 3-10 yrs who have chronic otitis media.
The reason for the change was that North Queensland paediatricians believe that by the time surgery is recommended in Qld, the children have already undergone a supervised period of medical treatment to a degree not seen elsewhere in the country.   However, there was an interest in Qld in addressing the surgical questions raised in this Trial.

The redesigned project has been divided into 2 parts, 
1. Surgery V surgery substudy  280  children across NT / WA and North Qld.
2. Surgery v medical care substudy  200  children in NT &amp; WA only
The total number of children (480) remains the same as originally proposed. 
The total number of children whose data will be analysed to compare the 2 surgeries is therefore 380. 
This comprises 280 from surgical sub-study and 100 from the surgical arm of the medical / surgical sub-study.
The data from both studies will be entered into a common database.

</interventions>
    <comparator> ANZCTR trial number 12611001073998 was submitted as a Medical V surgical comparison of 2 surgical interventions against a medical arm as control (1:1:1).  It will retain the same 3 treatment arms however the allocation ratios have changed.  The original study required 480 children.

The 2 studies will run concurrently over 3 years with the medical sub-study starting later in 2013.

Revised Study: medical V surgery:
200 children in NT &amp; WA (not Qld)
Randomised at time of consent in community to medical or surgical group (1:1)
The 100 Medical arm children will not be sent to hospital but will be reviewed in community for 12 months
The 100 Surgical arm children will be re-randomised to either VTA or MA (1:1) at the time of surgery

Study: Surgery V surgery:
280 children across NT, WA &amp; N Qld
to receive either grommets &amp; adenoidectomy(VTA) or myringotomy &amp; adenoidectomy (MA)
There is no medical arm in this substudy.


The data from this surgical substudy will be analysed together with the surgical data from the concurrent surgical arms in the medical study. This will be a comparison of the outcomes of 2 surgical interventions.   
The surgical data will then compared with the medical V surgical sub-study data using the medical arm as a comparator.
 
The statistician has advised that having children in the following ratios (VTA 190 : MA 190 : Medical 100) is adequate for the power calculations.

- OME/AOM that has been present for greater than or equal to 6 months and failed medical treatment.  The criteria for the diagnosis of glue ear will be the presence of an immobile tympanic membrane on pneumatic otoscopy, supported by an air-bone gap on audiometry and a Type B tympanogram.

- A mild or moderate conductive hearing impairment, defined as a pure-tone average of  greater than or equal to 20 dB when tested in a sound-proofed room, or greater than 30dB when tested in non sound-proofed conditions.  
Approximately 70% of children with OME/AOM are expected to meet this criterion.

    <concealment>Children referred for Ear, Nose and Throat assessment who have failed medical care for their otitis media will be eligible to participate in the study. Recruitment will not be considered until a child is found to be a surgical candidate in an ENT clinic or as advised by an ENT surgeon.  

Randomisation will occur after a decision has been made that surgery is indicated as close to surgery as feasible.   Data must be available showing audiometry testing within the previous 6 months.

Children will be allocated via a central randomisation service (IVRS system) provided by NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre.  The random allocation sequence will be determined by minimisation.  The allocation sequence will be concealed from the investigators and research staff at all times.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation:  .
 Children will be randomly allocated to receive either surgical intervention (1;1).   Allocation will be stratified by hospital site and age (3-5, &gt;5 y.o.).

For an overall significance level of 5% to be maintained, each predefined comparison would be compared at the 2.5% significance level. These comparisons are as above.
1)	The sample size of 190 per arm would have more than 90% power to detect a reduction of 17%, from an average recurrence rate of 27% in the Ventilation tubes and adenoidectomy arm to 10% recurrence in Myringotomy and adenoidectomy. This power is assumes a 20% loss to follow-up. 
The study will provide estimates of the rate of recurrence of OME in each group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Otitis media (OME/AOM) is a major problem amongst Indigenous children living in remote Australian communities. Medical treatment often fails and ENT surgeons are called upon to provide surgical care. 
This multi-centre randomised trial compares the outcomes of two current treatments (Myringotomy/ adenoidectomy V grommet tubes/ adenoidectomy). There are 11 sites proposed across WA, NT &amp; N Qld.

280 Indigenous children aged 3-10 years will be randomized into 2 groups;
(1) adenoidectomy with ventilation tubes (VTA)
(2) adenoidectomy with myringotomy only (MA)
The children will be followed up with monthly phone calls for 12 months following surgery by which time the OM will likely have recurred if were to do so.  At the end of 12 months study staff will visit the children in their community for hearing assessments and nasal swabs.

 The outcome measures will be a reduction in the prevalence of OME/AOM, hearing impairment, aural discharge / perforation, and the also effect of treatment on nasal colonisation with pathogenic bacteria.
