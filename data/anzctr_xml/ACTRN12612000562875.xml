  <interventions>
    <interventions>Topical medical grade honey applied to lesion overnight for 2 weeks. Subjects will apply sufficient honey to form a thin film over the affected area.</interventions>
    <comparator>Aqueous cream applied to lesion overnight for 2 weeks. Subjects will apply sufficient honey to form a thin film over the affected area. 

Honey will not be used by the control group. The aqueous cream used will be Aqueous Cream BP, made up of emulsifying ointment 30% and water. The emulsifying ointment is made up of Cetostearyl alcohol 8.1%, Sodium lauryl Sulphate 0.9%, Liquid paraffin 6%, White soft oaraffin 15%, phenoxyethanol 1% and purified water.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are reasons to believe that medical grade-honey applied directly to skin may be an effective treatment for psoriasis. In this study 15 adults with psoriasis will apply honey to an psoriasis lesion on one arm and aqueous cream to a matched lesion on the other overnight, every night for two weeks.

After two weeks the lesions will be assessed to look at changes in severity. Participants will also be asked about their experience of using honey.

This trial will provide useful information on the practicalities of topical honey as a treatment for psoriasis. It will also give an initial signal as to whether honey may be effective.</summary>
