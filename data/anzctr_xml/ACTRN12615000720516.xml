  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will either take part in the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) rTMS arms of the study. They will not be required to engage in both.

tDCS study arm: 1 mA tDCS. The anodal stimulation will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the right orbit. Stimulation will be delivered for for 15 minutes using a neuroConn GBH/Eldith DC stimulator. 

rTMS study arm: Fifty trains of 10 Hz rTMS delivered at 120% of resting motor threshold. rTMS will be delivered using the MagPro R30 to the left DLPFC. Trains will be 4.5 second in duration with a 20.5 second inter-train interval (2250 pulses over 20.8 minutes). 

Males will take part in one testing session only. Females will take part in two testing sessions: once during an early phase of the menstrual cycle when endogenous estrogen is low, and once more during a later phase when endogenous estrogen level are high.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study is a comparison of cortical excitability between male and female adults, and within the female cohort of high and low estrogen phases of the menstrual cycle. 

Changes in cortical excitability will be compared within the TMS and tDCS arms of the study, but not between the two techniques. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For both arms of the study, the amplitude of pre vs post stimulation cortical evoked potentials measured from the DLPFC. 

Single pulse TMS/EEG will be used to measure cortical evoked potentials. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Cortical evoked potential amplitude 20-minutes following stimulation, relative to pre-stimulation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Non-invasive brain stimulation is emerging as a therapeutic tool for many brain related conditions. There are numerous non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that apply electrical or electromagnetic stimulation to the brain in different ways to alter neural activity. The most researched, and consequently best developed, of these are transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Both TMS and tDCS has been shown to have varying degrees of therapeutic efficacy for major depression. Research efforts are currently focused on identifying factors that modulate individual differences in the way the brain response to TMS which could lead to development of optimised protocols for stimulation delivery.

There is evidence that sex hormones may modulate the effect of TMS and tDCS. However very few studies have investigated this and none have focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the site that both methods are most often applied in a clinical context. The current project is an investigation of the impact of gender, and within female gender of menstrual phases associated with high and low estrogen, on the effect of TMS and tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
