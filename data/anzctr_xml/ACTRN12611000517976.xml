  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lequesne Index - Provides an index of severity for OA of the knee. The Lequesne index is a 10-question interview-style survey given to patients with OA of the knee. It assesses pain or discomfort, maximum distance walked and activities of daily living. The total questionnaire is scored on a 0 to 24 scale, with lower scores indicating less functional impairment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline (T0), week 4 (T4) and week 8 (T8)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) index is used to assess patients with OA of the hip or knee assessing pain, stiffness and physical function. It can be used to monitor the course of the disease or to determine the effectiveness of anti-rheumatic medications. The total questionnaire is scored on a 0 to 96 scale with lower scores indicating a lesser degree of pain, stiffness, or physical dysfunction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>T0, T4, T8 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS):
The GSRS is a validated disease-specific questionnaire designed to evaluate common GI symptoms. The GSRS comprises 15 symptoms and uses a 7-point Likert scale in which 1 represents the most positive option and 7 the most negative. The items are combined into five clinical syndromes: abdominal pain, gastro-oesophageal reflux, indigestion, diarrhoea and constipation. Using a scoring algorithm, a GSRS total score is calculated</outcome>
      <timepoint>T0, T4, T8 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Short Form -12 [SF-12] Health Survey:
The SF-12 Health Survey measures generic health concepts relevant across age, disease and treatment groups. It provides a comprehensive, psychometrically sound and efficient way to measure heath from the patients point of view by scoring standardized responses to standard questions.</outcome>

    <concealment>Subjects are recruited from the Director of Rheumatology's patient data base at the Princess Alexandra (PA) Hospital, Brisbane who then confirms they have osteoathritis (OA) of the knee. Advertisements are also placed in public areas within the PA hospital and patients sources from advertisements are then diagnosed with OA of the knee by the Rheumatologist at the PA hospital.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess whether a high dose, stabilised green-lipped mussel extract is effective in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, assessed by pain, mobility, gastrointestinal function and quality of life measures. We hypothesis that altered gut function (i.e. such as constipation, diarrhoea, reflux, bloating) may affect how successful green-lipped mussel is in improving the knee pain and mobility. Gut function may be altered due to the underlying condition of osteoarthritis, medication intake or altered gut flora.</summary>
