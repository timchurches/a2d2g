    <interventions>Behavioural Activation for Smoking Cessation. The treatment protocol was based on the Brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression Revised Manual (Lejuez, Hopko, Acierno, Daughters &amp; Pagoto, 2011). Ten weekly individual therapy sessions of 1 hour duration, of brief behavioural activation commencing with a functional analysis of smoking behaviour to create individualised treatment plans for participants. The individualised treatment plans will take into account each participants values and goals for treatment for example, one participant may wish to stop smoking during working hours whilst another may wish to quit because they are worried about the impact it will have on their children.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study is an ABA design and each participant serves as their own control. This research is an ABA design as there is a 2 week baseline period (A), a 10 week intervention period (B) after which the intervention is withdrawn (A).
During the A phases participants are required to keep a smoking diary and collect their cigarette butts, whilst in the intervention period participants are required to attend the clinic for their individual behavioural activation therapy sessions.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to answer the following research questions.
1. Will the number of cigarettes smoked decrease during and after the treatment period in comparison to the number of cigarettes smoked during the baseline period?
2. Will there be changes in mood and nicotine dependency measures during and after the treatment period in comparison to the baseline period?
This aim of this research is to test the effectiveness of the brief behavioural activation therapy with a sample who want to quit smoking.</summary>
