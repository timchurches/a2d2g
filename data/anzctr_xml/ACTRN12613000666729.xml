  <interventions>
    <interventions>Name: Methoxyflurance Inhalation Analgesic
Dose: 1 x 3mL bottle of Penthrox (methoxyflurane) ,
vaporised in and then inhaled through a Penthrox Inhaler.
For colonoscopy patients, a nurse will teach and instruct patients to take several inhalations initially before the commencement of the procedure. Depending on the amount of pain experienced during the procedure, they are allowed to take further inhalations as required. Furthermore, if the colonoscopist is able to anticipate discomfort due to a difficult section of the bowel, they will ask the patient to take a few more inhalations to cover for potential discomfort or pain. All inhalations will be from one Penthrox bottle.
For Healthy patients, methroxyflurane is inhaled continuously through one Penthrox Bottle for a duration of 20 min before psychomotor testing</interventions>
    <comparator>All colonoscopy patients will recieve Penthrox. The Healthy volunteers psychomotor function will be evaluated on 2 occasions, after inhalation of Penthrox or placebo, separate by at least 1-week duration. The order of the study will be randomized.  On the occasion where placebo is to be given, 3ml of normal saline will be poured into the green portable inhaler and thus, only air will be inhaled.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences in psychomotor functions between inhaled Penthrox and placebo in healthy as assessed by a battery of psychomotor tests. 
These psychomotor tests have all been previously validates and include tests such as:
The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), which assesses a number of different functions, including visual scanning, mental flexibility, logic reasoning, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, and speed of information processing (Lezak, 1995; Wetherell, 1996; Van Hoof et al., 1998), was a 1-min paper-and-pencil test that required the subject to replace digits with corresponding symbols according to a digit-symbol code listed on the top of the paper (Wechsler, 1958). The dependent measures were total number of symbols drawn and number of symbols drawn correctly. This test is done at 30-min intervals.

 The computerized logical reasoning test (LRT) consisting of true-false statements about the juxtaposition of the two letters A and B (e.g., A is preceded by B--true or false).  The dependent measures were the total number of statements answered and number of statements answered correctly. The 1-min test assessed higher mental processes such as reasoning, logic, and verbal ability (Baddeley, 1968).
The locally developed recall memory test measures short- and long-term memory by presenting a sequential list of 15 words on the computer (Zacny et al. 2011). These 15 words were presented in approximately 30 s. The subject was then given 120 s to write down as many words as he or she could remember. Different word lists were used for all sessions. </outcome>

      <outcome>Differences in psychomotor function between pre and post-colonoscopy with inhaled Penthrox as assessed by a battery of psychomotor tests. The psychomotor tests used are the same as for the healthy control above.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patients on the list to undergo colonoscopies at the Royal Adelaide Hospital will be contacted and asked if they want to volunteer as a patient. Patients are not randomized. Healthy patients will be recruited via flyers placed around the Royal Adelaide Hospital and will be studied on two occasions. Healthy volunteers will be evaluated in a randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over manner.  Each subject will be studied on 2 occasions with either placebo or Penthrox, separated by at least 1-week duration and the order is randomized.  Placebo will be consisted of a 3ml of normal saline, which is poured into the green portable Penthrox as if it is methoxyflurane by a person in pharmacy. As this specifically appointed person in the pharmacy deprtment will be dispensing the liquids into the penthrox inhalers for the researchers, they will assign either the label A or B to the placebo and Penthrox, and give them out as treatment A and B, so that neither the people administering the treatment, those assessing outcomes nor the patients will know if treament A or B is the Penthrox or placebo until after the study on the patients is complete and all outcomes have been assessed, whereupon the identity of the treatments A and B will be revealed by the person who assigned the treatments to their groups. Half of the Healthy volunteers will be assigned to group 1 to have treatment A in their first week, the other half will be assigned to group two to have treatment B in their first week. Allocation is randomized via a computer generated sequence but not concealed as both those assigning people to the groups, administering the treatment and assessing the outcomes are blind to which treatment the patients are getting.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use the computer program Graphpad Prism to generate a random sequence of the numbers to assign the patients to group 1 to receive treatment A first, the rest will be assigned to group 2 to receive treatment B first, then there will be a crossover in the treatments that the groups recieve. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An unanswered issue relates to the use of Penthrox in clinical setting is its impact on psychomotor function and the ability to driving or operating complex tasks, as the lack of adverse psychomotor effects from Penthrox may allow patients to drive, and even return to work on the same day of the colonoscopy.  Given colonoscopy is increasingly performed for screening and surveillance purposes, the ability to return home or work place without carers would carry significant cost benefit and minimize work disruption.  Currently, there are no data on the impact of inhaled Penthrox, or methoxyflurane in general, on the psychomotor function in humans.  The aim of this study is, therefore, to evaluate the effects of inhaled Penthrox on psychomotor functions of healthy volunteers as well as subjects who undergo colonoscopy with Penthrox.
Hypothesis:
Inhaled methoxyflurane has minimal sedative effect and thus, has minimal or no effect of psychomotor function in humans.
