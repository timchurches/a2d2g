  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions are multiple strategies over 3 years within the communities and selected schools to build the community's capacity to promote healthy eating and physical activity. The promotional strategies are implemented by the Obesity Prevention In Community (OPIC) Intervention Officers and National Health Promotion Officers from the Ministry of Health. Promotional materials used are social marketing (e.g. Billboards, radio programmes, Radio and TV spots), community based sports competition, leaflet distribution on importance / composition of healthy breakfast, helping in the set up of vegetable gardens through seedling distribution and implementing the National Canteen Guidelines in school canteens. Aerobics sessions and competitions are also promoted both in schools and village communities.</interventions>
