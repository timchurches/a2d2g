    <statisticalmethods>Main comparative analyses between groups will be performed using intention-to-treat. For continuous outcomes, differences in mean change (baseline minus follow-up) will be compared between groups using linear regression modelling adjusted for baseline values of the outcome. 

Sample size calculations have been based on minimum clinically important differences in pain (numerical rating scale) and physical function (WOMAC). The sample size of 164 people provides 90% power to detect minimum clinically important differences in pain and function between treatment groups and allows for a 20% attrition rate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects many older people and is a major public health problem. Afflicted individuals suffer from knee pain and physical dysfunction that impacts dramatically on quality of life. Osteoarthritis has no cure and often gets worse over time. Non-toxic treatments that reduce symptoms and assist patient self-management over the long-term are needed. Increased joint loading (force across the knee) is central to pain development and increased risk of disease progression in people with knee OA. The type of shoes a person wears can increase or decrease their knee load depending on the shoe design features. This randomised controlled trial will test the efficacy of modified shoes (designed to unload the knee joint) for reducing symptoms and improving physical function in people with knee OA. </summary>
