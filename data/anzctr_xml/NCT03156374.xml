  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proof of concept study is designed to determine the practicality of using home ovulation
      tests to enable optimum timing for transfer of frozen embryos in a natural menstrual cycle in
      comparison to the standard ultrasound and serum monitoring currently conducted by many IVF
      clinics. The study will evaluate the ability of home ovulation tests to accurately time
      Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET) directly compared to standard clinical procedures. In addition,
      women's likability and stress associated with timing a FET cycle using both methods will be
      evaluated by collecting qualitative data using standardised questionnaires.

      The impact of psychological stress on FET outcome such as implantation rates and viability at
      first scan will be considered in order to gather information for the design of a larger
      clinical study and basic financial data will also be collected, in order to pilot a
      cost-effectiveness evaluation of the two FET timing methods.</summary>
