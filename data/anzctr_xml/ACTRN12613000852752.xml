  <interventions>
    <interventions>The index case will be randomised into one of two arms:
1. Intervention arm  the index case will wear a surgical mask at home

2. Control arm  the index case will not receive any intervention.

Participants from group one will be asked to wear a mask whenever they are in the same room as a family member or visitor to the household. They will be informed that they can remove their masks during meal times and while asleep. They will be shown how to wear the mask and informed to wash their hands when donning and removing the mask. 

Participants will be provided with three masks per day  for 7 days (21 masks in total). They will be informed that they can cease wearing a mask once their symptoms resolve. 

Mask use by other family members is not required. 

Participants will be asked to complete a diary card for seven 7  which will record their mask use, their contact with family members etc. 

Exit interviews will be conducted with all participants to examine standard practices around mask use, issues affecting compliance and attitudes towards mask/respirator use. </interventions>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Adults who attend a fever clinic in Beijing China, will be screened by hospital staff to identify if they are eligible for the study. If eligible, a study staff member will approach each patient while they are in attendance at the clinic and invite them to participate about the study. Informed consent will be collected from the patient prior to randomisation. Recruitment will be carried out over a period of 6 weeks.    

Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not feasible to conceal allocation. </concealment>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>None</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome of interest will be the efficacy of patient mask use on preventing infection outcomes in household contacts. 

The attack rates and incidence rate of infection in households will also be an outcome.

An intention to treat analysis will be performed to look at the impact of masks on attack rate and incidence rate. Intention to treat analysis will also be done to determine the efficacy of masks as patient source control in preventing clinical respiratory illness in family members.

Arms will be compared for socio-demographic characteristics, and if any imbalance in randomisation is suggested, unevenly distributed variables will be adjusted for by multivariate logistic regression.

Levels of compliance will be quantified, and correlated to levels of respiratory virus transmission. Attack rates and incidence rates of respiratory virus infections will be quantified. Relative risks will be calculated for masks. 

Assuming the attack rate of clinical respiratory infection (CRI) in the control families is 16-20%, with 5% significance level and 85% power, if we want to see a minimum relative risk of 0.5 (intervention/control), we will need 385 participants in each group which is composed of 118 families and on average, 3 members per family. An estimated 250 patients with ILI will be recruited into the study to allow for possible patient fall out through the study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Face masks and other personal protective equipment are  interventions available to reduce the transmission of influenza and other respiratory infections. Most available studies have focused on mask use by well subjects for prevention of infection. This study will study use of masks by sick patients as source infection control.  This study will determine whether mask use by people with influenza-like-illness (ILI) while at home protects other family members from a range of respiratory infection outcomes.</summary>
