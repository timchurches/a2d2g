  <interventions>
    <interventions>A limbal tissue biopsy will be harvested from patients suffering unilateral or bilateral limbal stem cells deficiency diseases and placed in tissue culture on a therapeutic contact lenses (Lotrafilcon A or B; CIBA Vision) in the presence of autologous serum. The cell loaded contact lens will then be placed over the defected eye to allow cell s to be transfered. The device (contact lenses) will remain on the ocular surface for no longer than 21-days. The ocular surface will be reviewed regularly for corneal epithelial reconstruction particularly over the first 6-months. If after one year, the epithelium is healthy and stable, patients will be reviewed at less regular intervals over the next 2-years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A stable and healthy corneal epithelium. Indicators of a healthy cornea may include healing of a corneal ulcer or inhibition of conjunctivilisation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Ocular health will be monitored twice weekly with the contact lense left over the affected eye, then weekly over the next 4-weeks, monthly over the next 6-months, then 6-monthly over the next two years.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Corneal epithelial integrity and re-surfacing.</outcome>
      <timepoint> Both parameters will be measured twice weekly for the first two weeks, weekly for the next 4-weeks, monthly for the next 6-months, then 6monthly for the following 2-3 years.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have developed a unique transfer technique which utilizes cells cultured on a therapeutic contact lens and propose that this may be a potentially novel treatment strategy for patients suffering severe corneal disease where corneal epithelial wound healing is not properly regulated, possibly as a consequence of stem cell damage, stem cell failure or stem cell depletion. Currently, patients are treated by grafting foreign or autologous stem cells that are cultured in the presence of animal products or by using techniques which involve growing ocular stem cells on amniotic membrane (foreign biological material) then transferring these cells along with the amniotic membrane to the damaged cornea. Our proposed system would be entirely autologous.</summary>
