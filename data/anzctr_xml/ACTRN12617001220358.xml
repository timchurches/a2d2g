  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 6 week emotion regulation (psychotherapy) intervention will be tested referred to as the CAPER program. 

The CAPER program will be individually administered and conducted in-person (face to face) delivery mode. All participants must attend the Centre for Emotional Health Clinic at Macquarie University, Sydney. 

Each session is of 60 minutes duration in total. Sessions 1 to 5 are conducted on consecutive weeks, whilst the final 6th session is conducted 2-weeks after the 5th session. 
The first and final (6th) sessions are parent only-sessions, whilst sessions 2 through to 5 are child-sessions in which the parent/s will also be asked to attend. 

The CAPER program aims to teach parents and their children emotion regulatory skills based on cognitive and behavioural strategies. The program is manualised and will be conducted by registered psychologists. Supervision to the psychologists will be conducted by the Chief Investigator (CI), Assoc.Professor Kangas who is a registered Clinical Psychologist. 

Following parental/child consent, therapy sessions will be taped and a random proportion (30%) will be selected to be reviewed by the CI for treatment fidelity checks (i.e, to ensure therapists are adhering to the manualised content of the CAPER program). 

All participants (child-parent dyads) before commencing the CAPER program will be required to complete the baseline (T1) initial assessment, They will then be asked to complete a daily mood diary for 18 consecutive days before being invited to complete a 2nd (T2) assessment. Following the 2nd (T2) assessment, parent-child dyads will commence the CAPER program. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the current study is to develop and evaluate an emotion regulation (ER) child and parental treatment program for children and adolescents (aged 6 to 14 years) who are experiencing ER difficulties as evidenced by recurring emotional/anger outbursts and impulsive maladaptive behaviours. Specifically, the objective is to conduct a proof-of-concept, pilot ER intervention study for at-risk youth of developing chronic internalising and/or externalising disorders.
Primary Aim: To develop and test the efficacy of an individual, 6-session, ER child and parental program using an A-B design with a one-month follow-up. The manualized intervention will comprise a) parental training specific components (initial/ session 1 and final/booster Session 6) and child/ adolescent with active parental dyadic intervention phase (4 sessions; conducted weeks 2 to 5).
