  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will collect data from all patients admitted to Christchurch Hospital with heart failure over 2.5 years. Information will be collected from each patient about his/her background medical condition, results of routine tests performed during their hospital admission including blood tests, chest x-ray and cardiac scans. In addition 2 extra blood tests will be performed to look at levels of hormones produced by the heart and other parts of the body in response to heart failure. The first test will be performed within 24 hours of hospital admission, and the second just prior to discharge.
We will follow the progress of each participant after discharge to keep a record of sunsequent readmissions or death during the 5 year period following discharge.
We will analyse the hormone tests and other information collected to determine whether these results enable us to predict the severity of heart failure, the response to treatment and the overall outcome/outlook fo people admitted to hospital with heart failure.</summary>
