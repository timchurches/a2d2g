  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical trial of a drug called CMD-193 which is a humanised monoclonal antibody
      linked to a toxin (calicheamicin). The purpose of this study is to determine in patients with
      advanced tumours expressing the Lewis-Y antigen:

        -  How much and how long 111-In-CMD-193 (CMD-193 tagged with a small amount of radioactive
           Indium  also called Indium-111 or 111In) circulates in the blood, where the antibody
           goes in the body, and how much attaches to the tumour.

        -  Whether CMD-193 causes changes in the metabolism (activity) of the tumour.

        -  Whether CMD-193 causes shrinkage of the tumour.</summary>
