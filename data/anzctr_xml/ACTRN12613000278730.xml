  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exacerbations measured by increased symptoms and a significant decrease in lung function and treated by the managing clinicians with escalation of prednisolone dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptoms recorded by standardised questions at every visit including the average daily number of puffs of reliever medication over the past week and how many nights in the past week were they woken by asthma symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lung function and exhaled nitric oxide.  This was measured by spirometry according to American Thoracic Society recommendations for the performance of spirometry. (American Thoracic Society. Standardization of Spirometry, 1994 Update. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1995;152:1107-36.) Exhaled nitric oxide was measured in parts per billion using a Medisoft Hypair device, again according to ATS/ERS  recommendations. (ATS/ERS recommendations for standardized procedures for the online and offline measurement of exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide, 2005. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2005;171:912-30.)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life measured by the Marks Asthma Specific Quality of Life Score (Marks GB, Dunn SM, Woolcock AJ. A scale for the measurement of quality of life in adults with asthma. J Clin Epidemiol 1992;45:461-72.) collected at baseline and end of the 4-month treatment period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Flow cytometric analysis of basophils including basophil activation testing using flow cytometric analysis of CD63-stained peripheral blood basophils stimulated with aspergillus fumigatus antigen and controls; determination of basophil FcER1 expression and surface-bound IgE quantitation using labelled anti IgE and anti-FcER1 antibodies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 month comparison.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were patients at a tertiary hospital asthma and allergy clinic.  Individuals were informed of the study and invited to participate by attending staff.  Once informed consent obtained and enrolled, treatment allocation was performed by the hospital pharmacy who kept the randomisation records and code.  Drug or placebo was made up in pharmacy and dispensed to the trial nurse who was blinded to treatment allocation.  The nure then administered the treatment.  Treating clinicians, lung function and laboratory scientists remained blinded as to the patient's randomisation status.</concealment>
