  <interventions>
    <interventions>The overall aim of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low dose thioguanine 20mg suppositories in an open-label phase I study involving up to 10 patients with severe proctitis, who are unresponsive to the current standard of care treatments. 
Patients will be prescribed one of the below 3 treatments in ascending dose
1.	Twice weekly thioguanine rectal suppository 20mg for 28 days (8 supp)
2.	2nd daily thioguanine rectal suppository 20mg for 28 days (14 supp)
3.	Daily thioguanine rectal suppository 20mg for 28 days (28 supp)
Adherence will be assessed by interview, return of medication and therapeutic drug monitoring</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical : Partial Mayo score comprising composite rectal bleeding, global physician and bowel frequency subscores 	
	The quality of response will be assessed in two ways -
	1. by a fall in partial Mayo score at 2 weeks and sustained at 4 weeks; 
	2. a fall of partial Mayo score greater than or equal 2 points from baseline at V4

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Faecal calprotectin laboratory measurement. 
The response will be assessed objectively by a fall in faecal calprotectin from baseline </outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline (time 0) and at 4 weeks post commencement of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events will be assessed by history, physical examination and appropriate blood tests or other tests if indicated by history of physical examination

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
