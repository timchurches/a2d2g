  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Laryngeal Mask Airway(LMA) is a good alternative for endotracheal tube during anesthesia. Closed system in anesthesia has some advantages like better control of airway temperature and humidification, lower cost and lower polution of operative room, so nowadays clinician like to use this way for maintenance of anesthesia.As good sealing is a concern about LMA, so there are some controversies about the usage of closed system during
 controlled ventilation with LMA. 80 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will randomized to two 40 patient groups. in one group anesthesia will be maintained with low flow anesthesia by LMA and controlled ventilation and in the other group anesthesia will be maintained through endotracheal tube and controlled ventilation.Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters ,end tidal co2 and leak and also postoperative sorethroat, shivering and cough will be assessed for each patient.</summary>
