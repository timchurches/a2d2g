    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following screening, patients will be randomly allocated into one of two groups AB or BA. Group AB will receive the amitriptyline cream for three months followed by a one week washout period then the placebo cream for a further three months.  Group BA will receive the placebo cream for three months followed by a one week washout period and then amitriptyline cream for a further three months.

Patients were allociated a study number at the time of recruitment.  Patients were randomally allocated to group AB or group BA depending their study number and the randomisation schedule.  Randomisation was completed by the pharmacy department so both the doctors and patients are unaware of which group they are in.</concealment>
