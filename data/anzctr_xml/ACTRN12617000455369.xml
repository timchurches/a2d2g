  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study intervention technique consisted of parenteral nutrition (PN) line change management for very low birth weight infants. The PN line changes were undertaken by two experienced neonatal nurses, one having performed a surgical scrub followed by the wearing of a mask and clothing with sterile gown and gloves to prevent any breach of sterility.  A full 'no touch' technique was employed. 
Amino acid/dextrose solutions were changed every 48-72 hours. Solution changes were on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays to fit in the pharmacy requirements. Intralipid/vitamin solution which was dispensed by the pharmacy was changed every 24 hours. Continuous infusions of medications were changed every 24 hours. Clear fluid (e.g. 0.9% sodium chloride) infusions were changed every 72 hours.
PN lines were not used for other infusions, unless the infusion fluids were prepared and changed using the study intervention techniques as above.
PN lines were only used for other medications in an emergency or if no other route could reasonably be used.
3-way taps were only fitted to PN infusion lines if other infusions (e.g. sedation) were administered concurrently. Filters (in-line) - Pall Neo 96 (Pall Life Sciences, Port Washington, NY) used for PN lines. A SmartSite(Smith Medical, St Paul, MN) directly connected to all venous catheters and venous extension tubing and left in situ at line change).
PN line changes only occurred when there was tissue infiltration of fluids.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Parenteral nutrition (PN) line changes were performed by one nurse using a no-touch sterile technique but without mask, surgical scrub, or gown and gloves.
PN lines were used as needed for other compatible infusions such as sedatives.
PN lines were used for boluses of medications including antibiotics.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome was the occurrence of Late Onset Sepsis. Sepsis was diagnosed when there was a culture of blood or cerebrospinal fluid positive for a pathogenic bacterium or yeast together with two of the following: physical signs of infection a raised haematologic sepsis score &gt;3 from the full blood count; a C reactive protein (CRP) &gt;10mg/L or new onset thrombocytopaenia. Probable sepsis was defined as a positive blood culture plus only one of: a raised hematologic sepsis score in the absence of physical signs, new onset thrombocytopaenia or a raised CRP measurement, or physical signs of sepsis and normal laboratory investigations. For the purpose of analysis, episodes of probable sepsis and definite sepsis were combined. .</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>At the Mater Mothers' Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 1998 and 1999 the incidence of Late Onset Sepsis (LOS) was 30%. A tertiary neonatal unit employing a Parenteral Nutrition  management strategy similar to the study technique between 1990 and 2002 reported the incidence of LOS to range between 3.1% and 13.2% for infants &lt;1500g. Based on an incidence of LOS of 30%, a sample size of 250 (125 per group) was calculated to demonstrate a clinically significant reduction in the incidence of LOS from 30% to 15% with Type I and II errors set at 5% and 20% respectively. 
Statistical analyses: Demographic data were compared with categorical data being analyzed using Chi squared analyses or Fishers exact tests. Continuous data were analysed using Students t test if normally distributed and the Mann Whitney U test for non-parametrically distributed data. Subgroup analyses were performed for episodes of LOS in infants &lt;1000g birth weight and for episodes of LOS that commenced whilst receiving PN. Statistical calculations were performed using Stata version 8.0.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether a bundle of line management measures focused on reducing the risk of contamination of Parenteral Nutrition (PN) lines would reduce the incidence of Late Onset Sepsis (LOS) in Very Low Birth Weight babies. 
The hypothesis was that the study intervention; comprised of a strict sterile technique for line changes and minimising the administration of other medications or fluids through PN lines would reduce catheter contamination and by minimising breaches would reduce the incidence of LOS when compared to the standard technique routinely used in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.</summary>
