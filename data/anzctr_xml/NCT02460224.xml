  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination
      with PDR001 to adult patients with solid tumors. The study consists of a dose escalation
      phase (I) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)
      for LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001, and a dose expansion phase (II)
      which will characterize treatment of LAG525 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001
      at the MTD or RP2D.</summary>
