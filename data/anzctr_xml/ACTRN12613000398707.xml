  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single centre, open-label, single application study in a total of 12 healthy participants. 

Eligible participants will receive a single 3 day application of a transdermal patch containing 72 mg of oxycodone in combination with TPM (tocopheryl phosphate mix) with a subsequent 3 day in-house period (this period is used to ensure washout of the oxycodone to a safe level prior to discharge).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of oxycodone delivered transdermally using the oxycodone patch.

Pharmacokinetic profile will be assessed through collection of blood samples at various time points during each 3 day patch application and during the wash out period. A total of 40 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic profile will be assessed through collection of blood samples at various time points. On Day 1 there will be an intensive blood sampling period in which samples will be collected every 1-2hrs and for the duration of the in-house period sample will be collected every 4-8hrs. A total of 40 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oxycodone delivered transdermally from the oxymorphone patch.

Safety and tolerability will be assessed by:
* The frequency of Adverse Events 
* The frequency of skin irritation at site 
* Clinically important changes in Vital signs
* Clinically important changes in laboratory tests and assessments </outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability will be assessed by:
* The frequency of Adverse Events measured throughout study participation
* The frequency of skin irritation at site monitored after patch removal
* Clinically important changes in Vital signs monitored twice daily throughout the in-house period 
* Clinically important changes in laboratory tests and assessments monitored at screening, check-in, Day 4,  discharge and follow up (5-7 days post discharge)</timepoint>
