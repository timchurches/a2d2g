  <interventions>
    <interventions> Diagnostic assessment: Serial bedside lung ultrasounds will be performed on three occasions in the first week of life (day 1, day 3-4, day 7), day 28 and between 35 weeks +0 days to 36 weeks +6 days postmenstrual age. Ultrasounds will be performed in conjunction with clinician performed bedside cardiac or cranial ultrasound assessments as part of routine care or coinciding with PIFCO assessment on day 7 if enrolled (Preterm Infant Functional and Clinical Outcome (PIFCO) Study: 2013091E/W) and the scheduled ANZNN Shift Test.

Lung Ultrasound Protocol
Bedside ultrasound examinations are to be performed with the infant nursed in a supine position on radiant warmer or incubator, with continuous cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring in situ. Measures will be employed to optimise thermal care and patient comfort during the procedure such as pre-warmed jelly and a sterile NeoWrap sheet placed over infant. The duration of any lung ultrasound examination will be limited to a maximum of 5 minutes to avoid patient discomfort and minimise excessive handling.
Philips iE33 ultrasound machine in current use for clinician performed ultrasounds in KEMH NICU, utilising a high resolution 11-3 MHz linear probe with dedicated lung pre-set, focus point at pleural line, depth 2.5 cm, duration of video loops lasting 6 seconds encompassing full respiratory cycles. All will be acquired in a standardised sequence.
The project will include development of an interactive training module and assessment to standardise the way lung ultrasounds are performed. We will also generate a scoring system from the first 50 patients to develop a predictive statistical model for the development of BPD to be applied to a further 50 recruited patients.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1) Preterm infants born less than 28 completed weeks gestation; 2) Admission to the KEMH NICU within 24 hours of birth; 2) Requirement for any modality of respiratory support; 4) Informed parental assent to undertake ultrasounds in NICU in conjunction with scheduled examinations. Given the practical difficulties in obtaining written parental consent within 24 hours of birth in an extremely preterm infant, and mindful approach to limiting parental stress and avoidance of excessive burden of information, ultrasound images will only be included in this study and analysed if parental consent is obtained at the earliest possibility prior to day 3.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Outborn infants birthed in a non-tertiary institution subsequently transferred to KEMH NICU will be excluded from the study given lower rates of complete antenatal steroid coverage and optimal conditions for resuscitation, early stabilisation and documented poorer outcomes.

    <statisticalmethods>Our primary hypothesis is that lung ultrasound will be an accurate predictor of an infant developing BPD as defined by the Shift Test score ranging from &lt;9.5 to &gt;35 kPa. A significant advantage of this study is the use of a physiological measurement of BPD as a continuous variable, rather than a dichotomous outcome at exactly 36 weeks PMA as previously specified. The most important time period of performing lung ultrasound (scored on day 1, day 3-4, day 7, day 28 and week 36) will be identified cross-sectionally using linear regression models. These models will identify the best predictive timing of lung ultrasound on shift test. All models will test the confounding influences of known clinical and demographic risk factors such as birthweight z-score, gestation, gender and respiratory support.
In a secondary analysis, we will compare results of application of the predictive statistical model to recently superseded ANZNN definition of BPD as a dichotomous outcome. Repeated measurements of lung ultrasound scores on infants will be accommodated using mixed linear regression models for the continuous outcome of the Shift Test and Generalised Estimating Equations for a binary outcome.
How lung ultrasound features relate to concurrent respiratory, cardiac and fluid status will be examined by correlation coefficients. The predictive value of lung ultrasound score on day 1 to predict successful extubation from ventilatory support to non-invasive CPAP by 48-72 hours will also be assessed by logistic regression.
Interim analysis is planned after the successful recruitment of the first 50 infants, allowing for a more accurate minimum sample size for the second phase to be determined. The Cohen K coefficient will be used to assess interobserver variability in lung ultrasound scoring by blinded assessors.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lung ultrasound is widely used within adult critical care with international evidence based recommendations for its utility in the assessment of patients with respiratory compromise. Further research is required to validate its clinical application within neonatal intensive care. Lung ultrasound is an attractive bedside clinical tool that is simple, non-invasive, quick to perform and well tolerated by even the most preterm of babies, using ultrasound equipment already in routine use.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a process that starts soon after birth in preterm infants, with scarring and inflammatory changes within the lungs that may be slow to appear on conventional chest x-ray. Lung ultrasound performed in the first week of life may be more sensitive in recognising these changes earlier with the potential to assist in prediction of BPD and better direct therapeutic interventions (Raimondi et al 2014).
A prospective observational cohort study will be undertaken performing lung ultrasound in 100 preterm infants born &lt;28 weeks gestation admitted to KEMH neonatal intensive care unit receiving respiratory support. The study aims to determine if lung ultrasound can predict the development of BPD and respiratory outcomes.
