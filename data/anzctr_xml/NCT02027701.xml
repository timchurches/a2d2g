Experimental: IgPro20 - 20% liquid formulation (200 mg/mL) of human normal immunoglobulin for SC use administered SC weekly: 0.2 g/kg bw (low-dose IgPro20) for up to 48 weeks. Subjects who experience CIDP relapse on 0.2 g/kg IgPro20 will have an increase to 0.4 g/kg IgPro20 immediately and will continue on high-dose until they have completed a total of 48 weeks of IgPro20 treatment.


Other interventions: IgPro20

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an extension study to the pivotal study IgPro20_3003 (NCT01545076). The purpose
      of this extension study is to investigate the long-term treatment of CIDP with IgPro20, with
      regard to safety and efficacy.

      Subjects who have completed subcutaneous (SC) Week 25 or were successfully rescued from a
      CIDP relapse during the SC Treatment Period of pivotal study IgPro20_3003 (NCT01545076) will
      have the option to receive open-label low-dose IgPro20 (0.2 g/kg bodyweight [bw]) weekly for
      up to 48 weeks. Subjects relapsing on low-dose IgPro20 will either return to high-dose
      IgPro20 (0.4 g/kg) immediately or be discontinued, depending on investigator's judgment.
      Subjects returning to high-dose IgPro20 will continue on high-dose until they have completed
      a total of 48 weeks of IgPro20 treatment. If subjects do not successfully recover from CIDP
      relapse within 4 weeks, they will be withdrawn.

      The treatment duration will be up to 48 weeks, followed by a completion visit (week 49).</summary>
