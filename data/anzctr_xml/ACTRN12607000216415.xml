  <interventions>
    <interventions>Double blind phase:

0.58mg of Clostridial collagenase (AA4500) or placebo will be injected directly into the Dupuytren's cord.  30 days after this first injection, if no response is seen or if the first cord responds and the patient has an additional Dupuytren's cord to be treated, a second dose of AA4500 or placebo will be injected directly either into the initially injected Dupuytren's cord or into the second Dupuytren's cord as appropriate.  In the double blind phase a maximum of 3 AA4500/placebo injections will be given, each 30 days apart.

Open label phase:

0.58mg of Clostridial collagenase (AA4500) will be injected directly into the Dupuytren's cord.  30 days after the first open label injection, if no response is seen or if the previously injected cord responds and  the patient has an additional Dupuytren's cord to be treated, a second dose of open label AA4500 will be injected directly either into the initially injected Dupuytren's cord or into the second Dupuytren's cord as appropriate.  In the open label phase a maximum of 5 injections will be given, 30 days apart.

Hence, a subject can receive up to 8 injections (3 in the double blind phase, 5 in the open label phase), but if they only have 1 Dupuytren's cord to treat and respond to the first injection they will not proceed with any further injections and will enter the follow-up phase of the study.

Follow-up phase:
Subjects will be reviewed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the first injection.  At these visits the study objectives will be reviewed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Double blind phase:

Placebo will be injected directly into the Dupuytren's cord.  30 days after this first injection, if no response is seen or if the first cord responds and the patient has an additional Dupuytren's cord to be treated, a second dose of placebo will be injected directly either into the initially injected Dupuytren's cord or into the second Dupuytren's cord as appropriate.  In the double blind phase a maximum of 3 AA4500/placebo injections will be given, each 30 days apart.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Key secondary outcome/s: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of up to 3 injections of AA4500 as compared to placebo in reducing the degree of contracture (flexion deformity) in multiple joints (MP and PIP) of subjects with Dupuytren's contracture.
To evaluate the recurrence rate in joints that were successfully treated during the 12-month study period.
