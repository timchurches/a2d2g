  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three treatment groups in this trial. Current routine management for  patients who present with melancholic depression include prescribing citalopram (SSRI) or referral to undergo cognitive behavioural therapy. This study will compare these two management options with a treatment developed through clinical experience, the Sequencing Drug-based Algorithm.

Sequencing Drug-based Algorithm (SDA): Those receiving the SDA protocol will initially receive the dual action antidepressant drug venlafaxine (i.e. impacting on serotonergic and noradrenergic functioning), initially daily at 75 mg and progressively titrated up to maximum dose of 300 mg over three weeks  subject to side-effects and response. If no response (operationalised as 50% or more improvement in Hamilton score), augmentation by the low dose atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (i.e. 2.5 mg daily) will be initiated in the fourth week, with the latter ceased (at the end of the fifth week) if the subjects depression remits and the dual action antidepressant maintained. If no response or, if a recurrence after ceasing the augmenting drug, the venlafaxine drug will be tapered and ceased over two weeks, and the tricyclic antidepressant drug nortriptyline introduced in the eighth week will be taken daily, and again augmented with an atypical antipsychotic drug if no formal response after two weeks for a maximum of two weeks while the tricyclic will be maintained until the end of the twelfth week. [Nortriptyline is chosen as the tricyclic drug, as it has been the most common tricyclic comparator compared to cognitive behaviour therapy]. Each participant will attend eight, 30 minute consultations over the twelve week treatment intervention period.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two comparator groups that are considered standard care:
Individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT): Participants in this group will receive weekly individual CBT for the first 8 weeks and then two fortnightly sessions for the last 4 weeks from a therapist trained in CBT, with each session lasting a minimum of 45 minutes. CBT will be orthodox, manual-based, focused on problem formulation and staged interventions and conform to best practice. The total number of CBT sessions will be ten sessions conducted over the 12 week period.

SSRI alone: Participants assigned to this arm will receive the SSRI citalopram (progressively titrated from half recommended starting dose to full dose as judged by the treating clinician). Each participant will take citalopram daily for twelve weeks and attend seven, 30 minute consultations with their clinician over twelve weeks.

All participants will complete three questionnaires at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 including: 16 item Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL), QIDS-SR, 5 item Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI). Each participant will also complete daily mood charting either online or pencil and paper.</comparator>

      <timepoint>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and The CORE Assessment of Psychomotor Change will be administered by a blind assessor at baseline, and weeks 4, 8 and 12.  The total HRSD score will be the primary outcome along with the endogenous subscale of the HRSD.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>16 item Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR), 5 item Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) will be completed at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. 16 item Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QOL) and 5 item Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) both measure the extent to which the participant's depression affects their everyday life, and work performance, respectively. Each participant will also complete daily mood charting via the Daily Rating Scale (DRS) questionnaire.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Enrolling a subject: Each potential participant was screened via telephone to ensure they met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The participant was then assessed according to a semi-structured interview to ensure they met criteria for a DSM-IV of melancholic depression. The participant then attended the clinic on a separate day to be assessed by a psychiatrist.

Allocating Treatment: An ‘envelope’ method was used in this study. Prior to the study the sequence of 300 allocations was placed into  300 similarly-ordered numerically-labelled envelopes. When  a participant was admitted into the study the psychiatrist opened the sealed envelope to identify which treatment group the participant would enter. This system was  overseen by a researcher who entered the psychiatrist’s office randomly to ensure the envelopes were being opened in the correct order.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The evidence-based strategies most commonly recommended in treatment guidelines for clinical depression do not distinguish between patients with melancholic depression and those without. This study seeks to demonstrate that a strategy which reflects the different neurobiology of melancholic depression will produce a far better treatment response. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups for 12 weeks of therapy. The first two treatments (an SSRI antidepressant and CBT) are drawn from treatment guidelines, while the third (a Sequencing Drug-based Algorithm [SDA]) has been developed through clinical experience.

The principal hypotheses to be tested, which address the comparable effectiveness implied by a sub-typing as against a generic treatment model, are that for individuals with melancholic depression:
1. Those assigned to SDA will show superior remission and responder rates (outcome) to those receiving the SSRI only or CBT only.
2. Those assigned to SSRI only will have a superior outcome to those in CBT only.
3. Differences between treatment arms will not be accounted for by non-specific therapist-based differences.</summary>
