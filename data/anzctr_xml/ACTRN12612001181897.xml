  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, is a chronic, inflammatory, itchy skin disease that affects 15-30% of children and 2-10% of adults. This condition is highly distressing and affects the quality-of-life of its sufferers and their families. Unfortunately, there is currently no adequate treatment for atopic dermatitis.
Traditional Chinese medicine has had a long history of treating various conditions, including skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis. However, evidence is lacking. In attempt to find a better form of management for atopic dermatitis, we have formulated a new Chinese herbal formula, RCM-106, using Western and Chinese medicine theories. It is anticipated that RCM 106 would be able to reduce the severity of atopic dermatitis and possibly improve the quality-of-life of sufferers. 
The efficacy and safety of RCM-106 will be evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants of the trial have a 50-50 chance of being allocated to receive RCM-106 capsules or the inactive placebo capsules for 8 weeks. The progression of participants atopic dermatitis will then be observed and recorded to see how well RCM-106 works. Positive results from the trial may result in a better form of treatment for atopic dermatitis.</summary>
