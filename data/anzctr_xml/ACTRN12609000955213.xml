  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients commence on sips of water ad libitum day 1 post-operatively. Once the treating surgeon deems the patient appropriate to commence fluids, they will start on Free Fluids ad libitum, (usually for 1-4 days), then Light Diet ad libitum (1-2 days) and then to Full Diet ad libitum (until discharged)
Free Fluids are defined as low fibre foods which are fluid like in nature at room temperature including, all Clear Fluids, milk and soy based drinks and nutrition supplements, strained porridge, pureed soup, ice-cream, plain yoghurt and custard</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients commence on sips of water ad libitum day 1 post-operatively. Once the treating surgeon deems the patient appropriate to commence fluids they then progress to clear fluids ad libitum, usually for 1-4 days. If patients continue to tolerate they progress to Free Fluids ad libitum, (usually for 1-4 days), then Light Diet ad libitum (1-2 days) and then to Full Diet ad libitum (until discharged)

Clear Fluids as transparent, low residue and fat-free fluids. This includes water, tea, coffee, cordial, broth, strained juice and juice-based nutritional supplements</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this trial is find out the best type of fluids for patients after elective large bowel surgery. Nutrition plays an important role in recovering after surgery. At the moment after elective large bowel surgery, patients are fasted for a period before starting on a clear fluids diet. If this is tolerated, they progress to free fluids diet, then light diet, and then full diet. The theory is that there is no difference in outcomes, and therefore it will be safe to commence 'free fluids' as a first diet type post elective large bowel surgery</summary>
