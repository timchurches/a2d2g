  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Microfracture treatment
Treatment: devices - BST-CarGel

Active Comparator: Microfracture treatment - Microfracture surgery of the femoral condyle

Experimental: BST-CarGel plus microfracture treatment - BST-CarGel combined with fresh, autologous whole blood and applied to the lesion on the femoral condyle with a syringe following an arthroscopic microfracture surgery.


Treatment: surgery: Microfracture treatment
Microfracture is performed by penetrating the subchondral bone beneath the cartilage lesion inducing a bleeding response.

Treatment: devices: BST-CarGel
BST-CarGel is combined with fresh, autologous whole blood and applied to the lesion on the femoral condyle with a syringe following microfracture arthroscopic surgery.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in loaded knee pain visual analogue scale (VAS) - Used to demonstrate patient clinical improvement. The VAS is one of the most commonly used measures of pain intensity, where the patient rates their pain on a scale from 0 to 10 (0=no pain; 10=maximum pain possible).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in knee function measured by the TAS questionnaire - The TAS is a validated patient-administered questionnaire for use in multiple knee injuries and consists of a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10 to indicate the ability to perform specific activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in knee function measured by the IKDC questionnaire - The IKDC measures the progress in symptoms, function, and sports activities caused by knee impairment after a treatment has been performed. It can be used with reliability and validity in patients with a range of knee conditions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in knee function measured by the KOOS questionnaire - The KOOS is a measure of a patient's perceived knee pain and function, as well as associated problems with their knee status. It contains 42 items that are all recorded on a five-point Likert Scale by the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Repair tissue quantity and quality - Measured by MOCART II Score complemented by T2 MRI mapping. The MOCART II Score will be completed by two independent, blinded, well-trained radiologist readers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 24 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life - Measured by the EQ-5D-3L health questionnaire. The EQ-5D-3L health questionnaire is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health outcomes and can be applied to an extensive range of health conditions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3,6,9,12 and 24 months post-surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Economic evaluation - Measured by a study-specific Resource Utilization Questionnaire which will be used to determine the costs associated with the use of the BST-CarGel scaffold treatment.</outcome>
