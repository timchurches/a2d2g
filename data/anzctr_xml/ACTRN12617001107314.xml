  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study intends to evaluate the impact of usage of advanced consumer activity trackers (e.g. Fitbit, Goqii, Garmin etc) on physical activity outcomes in participants in the Stepathlon, an international mobile health lifestyle workplace based lifestyle intervention conducted annually.

The Stepathlon program involves recruitment of participants who are grouped into employer-based teams. Participants are provided with a pedometer, and are encouraged to measure the number of steps they take each day, with a goal of achieving 10,000 steps or more each day. The Stepathlon (https://www.stepathlon.com/) is conducted as a competition, with the objective of the event being to maximise step counts achieved by employer-based teams. The program utilises mobile/web-delivered self monitoring of step counts as a support tool.

As part of the event, individual participants have the option of completing a standardized pre- and post-event survey web-based questionnaire. The survey items include step count, weight, days exercised, hours exercised, sitting hours, as well as a series of lifestyle questions. These data have been entered by the Stepathlon organizers into a registry.

The project consists of an external analysis of these registry data. The duration of the Stepathlon program is 100 days. The study will be performed on pre- and post-event survey data.</interventions>
    <comparator>Stepathlon participants who receive conventional pedometers, as part of the program intervention, will be used as an active comparator.  For the purposes of the study, advanced consumer activity trackers will be defined as a named consumer fitness tracker brand identified in contemporary market report (IDC Wearable Tracker Report, March 2017). Pedometer will be defined as those users using the standard non-interactive Stepathlon Budd-E pedometer. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Wearable activity trackers are increasingly being utilised by consumers in daily life. It is unknown if use of these more sophisticated devices leads to improved physical activity outcomes.

The aim of the current study is to evaluate physical activity outcomes in healthy adults undertaking a health and lifestyle  challenge called the Stepathlon, which is a 100-day event undertaken by adult employees in workplaces around the  world.

In the current study, a propensity score weighted analysis approach will be used to compare physical activity outcomes in users of wearable trackers compared to participants in Stepathlon who do not  use one of these trackers, and instead choose to use a pedometer, which is an older technology.</summary>
