Experimental: BIAsp - 

Active Comparator: IGlar + IAsp - 


Treatment: drugs: biphasic insulin aspart 30
Injected s.c./subcutaneously once daily with the largest meal Subjects should continue their pre-trial metformin and sulfonylurea dosages all throughout the trial while other oral antidiabetic drugs will be discontinued.

Treatment: drugs: insulin glargine
Injected s.c./subcutaneously once daily at the same time every day, with the possibility of treatment intensification with insulin aspart (Basal-bolus arm) Subjects should continue their pre-trial metformin and sulfonylurea dosages all throughout the trial while other oral antidiabetic drugs will be discontinued.
