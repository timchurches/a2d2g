    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the safety of tanibirumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
Adverse Events (AEs) are evaluated by considering the frequency and intensity (severity) of AEs and other abnormal findings of clinical tests recorded by patients. Information on AE, such as symptoms, start and stop dates, severity, the relationship to IP, relevant measures, treatment and results are recorded.
Known/possible adverse reactions include: 
Very Common  Greater than 10% incidence; Hemangioma, Rash; Pruritus; Fatigue
Common  1-10% incidence: Alopecia; Acne; Rash; Pyogenic granuloma; Mucosal inflammation  digestive, genital or urinary tract infections; Asthenia; Oedema ; Peripheral Oedema; Constipation; Diarrhoea; Nausea; Vomiting; Anaemia; Neutropenia: Decreased appetite; Headache; Flushing; Hypertension; Arthralgia; Myalgia; Hypersensitivity; Herpes; Infusion related reaction
Safety assessments include adverse event reporting by participants and investigators, physical examinations, vital signs measurement, laboratory tests, ECG, chest x-ray and immunogenicity

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tanibirumab in participants with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 19 or over, and have been diagnosed with recurrent GBM following treatment with temozolomide chemotherapy with radiotherapy.
Study details
Tumour angiogenesis is the process that leads to the formation of blood vessels in a tumour, which in turn support cancer cell survival, local tumour growth, and the development of distant metastasis. The investigational drug tanibirumab (TTAC-0001) interferes with the angiogenesis process, inhibiting the formation of the blood vessels and thereby starving the tumour cells of the nutrients and oxygen required for growth. Participants in this study will be enrolled sequentially to arm 1, 2 or 3 with participants enrolled to arm 2 and 3 only after a safety evaluation of the previous arm. Each patient will only be allocated to one arm depending on the time of enrolment. All participants will receive tanibirumab in 3 or 4 doses, one per week, per cycle, for a total of up to 1 year, disease progression or study withdrawal.

Throughout the study safety will be assessed by monitoring and assessment of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests including testing for immunogenicity (the ability of the study drug to provoke an immune response). Tumour response will be assessed by evaluating MRI scans performed every 8 weeks during treatment and at treatment termination. Blood sampling for drug interaction and distribution within the body will also be collected.
It is hoped that the findings of this trial will develop our understanding of the safety of tanibirumab and of it's efficacy as a potential drug treatment for recurrent glioblastoma.
