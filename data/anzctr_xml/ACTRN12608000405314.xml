    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Over the course of the study, participants will be allocated a series of identifying numbers. A two digit study number, a two digit site number, and a sequential three digit screening number will be allocated on referral to the study. This ID number will be used for all subsequent study documentation for that participant. In addition, a 4 digit randomisation number will be allocated on randomisation of the participant. The full number sequence will be unique to that participant and will not be reassigned.

At all times, from eligibility screening to completion of the study, all study staff are unaware of the treatment allocation. Allocation is concealed from the investigator at the time of the participant inclusion in the trial. The central registry will supply the schedule tables to the dispensing pharmacy for allocation. 

The dispensing pharmacist will allocate sequential codes according to the supplied schedule and identify the active or inactive study medications delivered in a pre-filled blister pack. The blister pack number, dates of preparation and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the pharmacist.

All capsules will be prepared in a central manufacturing pharmacy, where the tablets will be encased in an opaque capsule in order to have all study drugs and the placebo looking identical. Each capsule will then be filled with cornstarch to prevent rattling of contents. Each daily dose for each participant will be sealed into a blister pack within a strip containing a 1 week supply of the study medication.

Each blister pack will be numbered according to the pre-determined allocation code and labeled as;

Study 005/07 megestrol study. megestrol acetate 480mg, dexamethasone 4mg, placebo. Take 3 capsules every morning until finished.

All blister packs for each site will be supplied to the site clinical trial pharmacist according to the randomisation schedule with a log of the blister pack number. On randomisation of a participant, the site pharmacist will obtain the blister pack corresponding to the randomisation number, and record the participant details in a log against the blister pack number. Allocation concealment is via the use of numbered packs containing the prepared capsules. Randomisation is conducted by an independent pharmacist who does not have contact with the study participants.

Treatment allocation will not be disclosed to participant, study staff, treating clinicians or investigators. The code will only be broken in cases of extreme emergency. Such situations only include where knowledge of the code will have consequences for clinical decision making.

On randomisation at each site, the site pharmacist will locate the next lowest numbered blister pack. The pack will have a pharmacy label attached which will state the patient name and details, and the ID number. A log will be maintained of the pack number dispensed to each participant.

The intervention will be delivered as opaque capsules. At each dose, the individually labeled blister pack will be opened and the daily dose will be removed for administration.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation schedules will be developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry). Treatment for each patient will be allocated according to a block randomisation schedule held by the central registry in a 1:1:1 ratio. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation to each code in each site. This is described in more detail within the PaCCSC Randomisation Standard Operating Procedure. The central registry will supply the schedule tables to the dispensing pharmacy for allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the appetite stimulating drugs megestrol and dexamethasone in treating anorexia in the palliative care of people with widespread and advanced cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have widespread and advanced cancer and suffer from loss of appetite. 

Trial details 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive the drug megestrol acetate and the other will receive dexamethasone. Both groups will be monitored for appetite levels and quality of life, along with any weight gain, improved function and side effects. Despite encouraging results from a US study, megestrol is not currently prescribed extensively as an appetite stimulant to Australians with advanced cancer, primarily due to its cost.</summary>
