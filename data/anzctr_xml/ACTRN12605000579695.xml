    <studytitle>Heparin In Total Parenteral Nutrition</studytitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised double blind controlled trial with Heparin added to the total parenteral nutrition at a concentration of 0.5IU/mL. The intervention continues for as long as the infant is receiving total parenteral nutrition or a predetermined end site is reached, such as confirmed central line infection.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Definite or probable baterial line infection while actively on the HILL TOP Trial is the primary outcome.  We are looking at the number of definite or probable bacterial line infections while on the trial per total number of infants enrolled in each arm.  The infant is considered actively "on the trial" from the time they have a long line inserted until either a primary outcome is reached (ie. definite or probable infection) or the long line is removed.  The reason for coming off the trial is recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>While long line remains in situ</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of definite or probable bacterial line infections while on the trial per total long line days in each arm.  The infant is considered actively "on the trial" from the time they have a long line inserted until either a primary outcome is reached (ie. definite or probable infection) or the long line is removed.  The reason for coming off the trial is recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>While long line remains in situ</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Most of the secondary outcomes are also recorded while the infant is actively on the trial.  Each infant can only have a single outcome as the reason for exiting the trial and the primary outcome takes precedence.  These secondary outcomes recorded while actively on the trial are: 
  The number of bacteraemic episodes with organisms not commonly associated with line sepsis per total number of infants in each group.
  The number of definite or probable Candida line infections per total number of infants in each group.
  The number of infants who had the long line removed because of extravasation or occlusion per total number of infants in each group.
  The number of infants who had the long line removed because the line was no longer required per total number of infants in each group.
We are also looking at the number of infants with progression of intraventricular haemorrhage per total number of infants in each group.  The definition being progression from a minor grade IVH to a severe grade IVH comparing ultrasound scans taken before starting the trial to the first scan after exiting the trial.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this trial we are testing the hypothesis that the addition of low dose heparin to total parenteral nutrition reduces the complications associated with long lines in neonates, particularly long line infections.  We are investigating the possible benefits of heparin in improving the delivery of TPN to sick or premature neonates.  In this study half of the babies will have heparin added to their TPN and the other half will have TPN without heparin.  No one, except for the pharmacists, will know which babies are having heparin and which ones are not and this makes the trial double blind.  At the end of the study we will compare the two groups to see if the babies that have had heparin have had less infections or less complications in general.</summary>
