  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Therapy is administered in once-weekly 60-minute telephone calls with a clinical psychologist over 5 weeks.  Cognitive Behavior Therapy includes education about postconcussive syndrome, imaginal reliving of the trauma memories, in vivo exposure that includes gradual exposure to feared situations, and cognitive restructuring of the trauma experience and the postconcussive syndrome symptoms.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 3-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of a maximum of 5 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Education condition involves once-weekly 60-minute telephone calls with a clinical psychologist over 5 weeks.  Therapy includes education about postconcussive syndrome, and nondirective counselling that does not include any Cognitive Behavior Therapy components.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 3-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of a maximum of 5 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate whether providing cognitive behaviour therapy provides better reduction of postconcussive syndrome symptoms than education about postconcussive syndrome in patients following mild traumatic brain injury.  Patients will be randomly allocate patients with postconcussive syndrome to either (a) cognitive behavior therapy, or (b) education, and assessed for postconcussive symptoms following treatment.</summary>
