  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malnutrition (under-nutrition) occurs in approximately 30% of hospitalized adults worldwide
      and results in poor outcomes. However there is no universal method for diagnosing
      malnutrition. A group of experts created a set of 6 characteristics to identify malnutrition.
      The goal of this project is to determine whether these characteristics are the best
      indicators to identify malnutrition or if there are other factors that may better identify
      malnutrition. Because there is no gold standard definition for malnutrition, the
      investigators will compare the characteristics against outcomes such as length of stay,
      hospital readmission and death. Outcomes are also influenced by disease state, therefore,
      information on what brought the patient to the hospital and what happened to them in the
      hospital will be collected that allows the investigators to separate the effect of
      malnutrition from disease. The hypothesis for this study is that the malnutrition clinical
      characteristics and diagnosis criteria, as presented by the experts, are valid and reliable
      principles for the diagnosis of adult under-nutrition.</summary>
