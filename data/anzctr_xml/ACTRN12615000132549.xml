  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an evidence-based cough management algorithm that has been evaluated in children referred to a paediatric respiratory physician with prolonged cough (Chang et al, Pediatrics 2012). Children with cough are reviewed by a paediatrician and enter specific pathways depending on cough type and whether it is a specific or non-specific cough. Relevant investigations are performed (eg haemotology, biochemistry, pertussis serology, chest xray, spirometry) and management is dependent on initial diagnoses. Management may include watchful waiting, trials of inhaled corticosteroids or antibiotics, and brief interventions such as smoking education. Children are reviewed again 2 weeks following the initial review. Ongoing management is dependent on the diagnosis.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control arm will undergo standard care. This predominantly involves advising the parent/guardian to seek the advice of their general practitioner if they are concerned about the cough. At the community level, children will consult a GP up to 5 times before obtaining a referral to a paediatrician. This may take up to 4 months before specialist review occurs.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children presenting to the participating primary health care services with an illness with parent reported cough as a symptom will be identified by a dedicated study research officer through discussion with the clinic staff. The research officer will then approach the child’s parents/guardians to determine willingness to participate in the study. Written informed consent will be obtained following provision and explanation of a plain language statement that explains the study in detail. Pictorial information statements may be used for those with limited literacy skills if required. Written assent will be obtained from children aged equal to or greater than 12 years.

At day-29 (+3), after confirmation of the presence of chronic cough, eligible children will be allocated (1:1) to either active intervention or standard care. Randomisation will be stratified by site (n=3) and cough duration at day 28 (less than 6 weeks and equal to or greater than 6 weeks) with permuted block sizes. Stratifying by cough duration will control for children who had a cough history of greater than 14 days at time of cohort enrolment. 

Randomisation codes will be computer generated by an independent biostatistician and concealed in opaque envelopes. At the time of randomisation, staff will contact the study coordinator with the child’s stratum details and the next consecutive envelope in that stratum will be selected and opened to allocate the child to a study arm according to the allocation code.

    <sequence>The randomised sequence generation will be conducted by an independent biostatistician using Stata (StataCorp, Texas). </sequence>

    <designfeatures>The RCT is nested within 3 prospective cohort studies of acute respiratory illness with cough as a symptom in urban and rural children</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Demographic, clinical, economic, risk factor and microbiological data will be tabulated for the study population overall, by centre and by randomisation group and expressed as proportions and/or means of the selected characteristics by study centre, and presence/absence of chronic cough at day 56 with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Differences between groups will be assessed using t-tests for comparisons of means and chi-square test for comparisons of proportions, conditional on test assumptions for each being satisfied. Non-normally distributed data will be analysed with appropriate non-parametric tests. 

Primary objective
Intention to treat analyses will be employed. Time to cough resolution will be compared between groups using cox proportional hazard methods, adjusting for independent explanatory variables, subject to modelling assumptions being met, particularly proportionality of hazards. 

Economic objectives
Costing of the intervention will be done according to established methods including detailed subanalyses of data that account for epidemiological, social, cultural, risk factor and microbiological variables. Cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be modelled with a focus on the health sector but incorporating broader societal issues using data from the trial as described above and augmented by the evidence from the literature, especially systematic reviews. CEA will involve: identification of resources using the intervention pathway (activities, probabilities and unit costs); measurement of resource use/outcomes; and valuation of costs using unit costs published in the literature. The time horizon will be specified and current practice (standard care) will be the comparator; and future costs and benefits will be discounted to present values. Central to this analysis will be the modelling of uncertainty surrounding data quality and gaps, and extension of time horizon using sensitivity analyses. The key outcomes will be incremental cost-effectiveness, and cost-savings to the health system due to the interventions.

Other objectives: 
Multivariable modelling will be employed to: a) evaluate the microbiological predictors of chronic cough following an ARI as determined at days 14, 28, 42 and 56 post enrolment; b) evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, socio-economic and cultural predictors of chronic cough following an ARI at day 28 post ARI; c) evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, socio-economic and cultural predictors of success or failure of the intervention at day 56; and, d) to compare these predictors between the three study populations. Crude and adjusted relative risks and their 95% CIs will be presented, with differences considered statistically significant at p &lt;0.05.


The 3 cohort studies within which the RCT is nested are anticipated to enrol approximately 700 children based on our current and previous work. On the basis of that work, we expect approximately 30% of children to have persistent cough at day 28. For the primary endpoint of cough resolution at day 56, we anticipate a 54% reduction in the proportion of children (54.3% in early arm compared to 29.5% in delayed-arm) with persistent cough at day 56. Hence, 89 children per group with complete evaluable data at day 56 will provide 90% power (a=0.05), to detect this 54% reduction for our primary aim. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up, we will therefore randomise a minimum of 107 children per group at day 28 across all 3 sites (214 in total randomised within the cohort of approximately 700 children)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ARI in  children is a leading cause of hospitalisation and preventable death and repeat episodes in infancy are associated with an increased risk of chronic lung disease. Cough in children, commonly triggered by a viral ARI is a substantial cause of morbidity and associated health and societal economic costs. Chronic wet cough in children implies increased airway secretions and lower airway infection. This novel proposal aims to determine whether a validated evidence-based cough algorithm initiated at the development of chronic cough, defined as &gt;4 weeks duration, following an ARI improves clinical outcomes in Indigenous children compared to standard care. </summary>
