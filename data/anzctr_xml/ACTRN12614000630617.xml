  <interventions>
    <interventions>Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography: electrocardiographically gated computed tomography of the heart with venous injection of iodinated contrast in order to evaluate the presence/absence of coronary artery disease. Subjects will be randomized to receive this diagnostic test once, as compared to standard of care. Duration of the test is 15-30 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Exercise Treadmill stress electrocardiography according to the Bruce treadmill protocol; briefly, subjects with a second negative 6-hour troponin for myocardial infarction (Troponin I &lt;0.04 mg/dl) underwent standard Bruce treadmill protocol using graded exercise on a standard treadmill with continuous ECG monitoring (Marquette, GE Healthcare). A cardiology registrar/fellow performed continuous ECG and vital sign monitoring during ExECG testing. A cardiologist independently adjudicated the ExECG result using standard criteria for myocardial ischemia. Subjects without ExECG evidence of myocardial ischemia were discharged. Subjects with positive or equivocal ExECG results were managed at the discretion of the treating cardiologist</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute Coronary Syndrome: diagnostic performance. The cause of subjects presenting symptoms is determined by adjudicated diagnosis using all available data including 30 day follow-up. Two board-certified cardiologists audited each patient chart and adjudicated the presence of ACS using case report forms based on Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand Guidelines. Differences were resolved by consensus</outcome>
      <timepoint> At 30 days post randomisation and re-assessed at 5 years where applicable.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost, from a hospital perspective. The costs and length of stay were calculated using time stamps in trial data forms and from hospital systems.  Total patient ED utilization costs for the ED and hospital stay, including 30 days after index admission, were tabulated for each patient. The costing methodology included direct costs associated with patient treatment for all inpatient and outpatient care related to the index admission. This encompassed labor cost (time per patient utilization for nursing and medical time), diagnostic imaging, pathology and pharmaceuticals cost, bed day costs (based on the fractional length of stay of the patient and ward location) and non-labor costs (including consumables). Average cost was then calculated for each trial arm are reported in 2012 $AUD values. Societal or opportunity costs were not included in this evaluation.</outcome>
      <timepoint> At 30 days post randomisation</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) determined by review of participant medical records All enrolled subjects provided consent for nurse follow up by telephone interview at least 30 days after presentation and at 12 months using a structured questionnaire. Data are captured on hospital presentations for chest pain, additional cardiac testing, diagnosis of ACS, and visits to physicians related to the index hospitalization.; 
major adverse cardiovascular events is defined as; acute myocardial infarction; ischaemic stroke; recurrent ACS or requirement for revascularization (PCI or CABG), cardiac death;

    <statisticalmethods>The study sample size was calculated based on a false negative rate of ExECG-based care up to 6% and lower limits of CTCA-based care from ROMICAT 1 trial of 2%. Using a one sided two sample proportions test with a delta of 0.04 and an alpha equal to 0.05,  there was 80% power to detect a difference with an estimated sample size of 592 patients. Variables are expressed as mean +/- 95% confidence interval (CI) or as number and percentages for binary and categorical variables. Analyses for continuous variables were compared using unpaired student t-test for parametric data and Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Binary data were compared by chi-squared testing. ROC area under the curve (AUC) was compared between trial arms using the c-statistic. Odds ratios were tabulated using logistic regression.  All outcome data were considered as intention-to-treat analyses. Statistics were calculated using Microsoft EXCEL (Redmond, WA, USA) or STATA SE software (College Station, PA, USA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chest pain is a common cause for presentations to hospital Emergency Departments (ED). The clinical investigation of undifferentiated chest pain must include the expeditious assessment for acute coronary syndrome.
To date, there have been no large-scale clinical trials comparing coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTCA) based care to exercise treadmill electrocardiography (ExECG)-based care in possible acute coronary syndrome patients
The CT Coronary Angiography Compared to Exercise ECG (CT-COMPARE) study was a prospective randomized trial that compared dual source CTCA with ExECG as part of the standard of care in low-intermediate risk possible ACS patients presenting to the ED.  The primary endpoints were the diagnostic performance measures and the hospital-based costs of CTCA-based care as compared to ECG-based care</summary>
