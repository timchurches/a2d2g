  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mepitel Film is  applied from day one of radiation therapy until the end of the trial (4 weeks after completion of radiation therapy) or until moist desquamation occurs. If moist desquamation occurs then these skin areas will be covered by the standard dressing that is used in each department.
The skin area of interest will be identified from the treatment plans and comprise of a skin area of at least 5 by 10 cm with a uniformly high dose (&gt;30Gy). This area will be divided into two similar halves, one half will be randomized to Mepitel Film and the other to a moisturising control cream.

Mepitel Film will be applied by the researcher (a radiation therapist or radiation oncologist) and replaced only when necessary (when the film curls up too much).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control cream is a common moisturising cream that does not contain sodium lauryl sulphate, for instance Sorbolene or Trolamine.

The control cream will be applied by the patients twice a day from the start of radiation treatment till the end of the trial (4 weeks after completion of radiation therapy) or until moist desquamation occurs. If moist desquamation occurs then these skin areas will be covered by the standard dressing that is used in each department.

    <concealment>Based on the RT plan, an area of high dose (&gt;30Gy) of at least 5 by 10 cm will be selected and divided into 2 equal halves. One half will be randomized to Mepitel Film, the other to control cream.

Randomization of which half will be covered in Mepitel Film and which half in control cream is done centrally based on computer-generated random numbers, provided by a biostatistician at the University of Otago, Wellington. The research radiation therapist/radiation oncologist sends a randomization request to the PI, Dr Herst who will allocate the superior/lateral or the inferior/medial to either film of cream based on the computer-generated numbers.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants will act as their own controls. The treatment plan will be used to identify a skin area of at least 5 by 10 cm that has the highest uniform skin dose. This area will be divided into two equal parts. One part will be randomly assigned to the Mepitel Film arm and the other half will be treated with control cream. Randomization will be based on computer generated random numbers. The trial cannot be blinded because of the obvious differences between film and cream. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on preliminary analysis of our current pilot study, in order to see a difference of 30% in total RISRAS score (or 15% in researcher component of RISRAS) and power the trial to 90% and p value of 0.05 to see a difference of 30% in total RISRAS score (or 15% in researcher component of RISRAS),  we need 72 patients, with attrition of 20% that would be 86 patients. 

The statistical significance between differences in Mepitel Film and control cream RISRAS scores will be determined by non-parametric Wilcoxon signed ranks test, as previous trials have shown that the scores are not all normally distributed. Averages, standard deviations and unpaired two tailed student T tests will be used to determine dose measurements. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>External beam irradiation is a common treatment option for most solid cancers. Although the skin of all patients receives a certain amount of radiation, the skin dose in patients with tumours close to the skin, such as 40-60% of breast and head and neck cancer patients is high enough to cause severe reactions. Severe skin reactions can be very painful and affect patient quality of life as well as increasing the chance of developing infections.

Our previous three skin trials in breast cancer patients in New Zealand showed that soft silicone dressings decreased skin reaction severity  (14). The skin dose received by breast cancer patients was less than 40Gy. However, a small pilot study in NZ head and neck cancer patients receiving a higher skin dose (&gt;45Gy)  suggested that Mepitel Film was less effective.  

The aim of this trial is to determine in a larger cohort how effective Mepitel Film is in preventing and managing acute skin reactions caused by radiation therapy to cancer in the head and neck region. We used the preliminary results from the head and neck pilot study to recruit enough patients to be able to see a statistically significant decrease of 30% in skin reaction severity as measured by RISRAS trial.
