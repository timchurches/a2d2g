  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Number of Time Constant 1 (T1) Gadolinium (Gd)-Enhancing Lesions Per Participant Per Scan - Analysis of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions was done using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Only post-baseline scans were included in the calculation of this endpoint (excluding the Study Day 1 scan which had been conducted before first dosing).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 12 to 36</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of New T1 Gd-enhancing Lesions Per Participant - Analysis of new T1 Gd-enhancing lesions was done using MRI scans.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 12, 24, 36</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Free From Relapses - A relapse was defined as the fulfillment of all the following criteria: a) neurological abnormality, either newly appearing or re-appearing, with abnormality specified by both i) neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event, and ii) neurological abnormality lasting for at least 24 hours; b) absence of fever or known infection (fever with temperature [axillary, orally, or intrauriculary] greater than (&gt;) 37.5 degrees Celsius or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit); and c) objective neurological impairment, correlating with the participant's reported symptoms, defined as either i) increase in at least 1 of the functional systems of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or ii) increase of the total EDSS score. Percentage of participants free from relapses during 36-week treatment period was reported.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 36</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs - An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug up to 12 weeks after the last dose of the study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Number of subjects with TEAEs included subjects with both non serious and serious TEAEs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the first dose of study drug administration up to 12 weeks after the last dose of the study drug</timepoint>
