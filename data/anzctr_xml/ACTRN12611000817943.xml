  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be ventilated with tidal volume 7 ml/kg, inspiratory to expiratory ratio (I:E) of 1:2 in a pressure-controlled mode (PCM)(initial ventilation). After abdominal insufflations of CO2, mechanical ventilation by pressure-controlled mode (PCM) with 5 cmH2O PEEP and I:E of 2:1 will be applied to them during abdominal insufflation of carbon dioxide gas in Trendelenberg position (intervention). The inspiratory pressure will be set to deliver a tidal volume of 7 ml/kg during PCM. After desufflation of abdominal gas, the ventilation will returne to an initial ventilation method of PCM.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In patients undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy, positive end- expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been increasingly used to compensate decreased lung compliance. However, airway pressure is another obstacle to apply sufficient PEEP with adequate tidal volume. Prolongation of inspiration time with low level PEEP could provide additive alveolar recruitment effect avoiding increase in the peak airway pressure. This study intended to compare the gas exchange between conventional and inverse ratio ventilation in robot-assisted prostatectomy patients receiving mechanical ventilation by pressure-controlled mode (PCM).</summary>
