Experimental: Pembrolizumab+1x10^8 TCID50 CVA21 - CVA21 will be administered IV on days: 1, 3, 5, 8 29, 50, 71, 92, 113 134, and 155. 200mg Pembrolizumab will be administered as per normal dosing frequency at Q3W IV, and will continue for up to 24 months.

Experimental: Pembrolizumab+3x10^8 TCID50 CVA21 - CVA21 will be administered IV on days: 1, 3, 5, 8 29, 50, 71, 92, 113 134, and 155. 200mg Pembrolizumab will be administered as per normal dosing frequency at Q3W IV, and will continue for up to 24 months. Should dose limiting toxicities be observed participants may be transferred a lower dosage of CVA21.

Experimental: Pembrolizumab+1x10^9 TCID50 CVA21 - CVA21 will be administered IV on days: 1, 3, 5, 8 29, 50, 71, 92, 113 134, and 155. 200mg Pembrolizumab will be administered as per normal dosing frequency at Q3W IV, and will continue for up to 24 months. Should dose limiting toxicities be observed participants may be transferred a lower dosage of CVA21.


Treatment: drugs: Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab is a selective monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD1 and its ligands PDL1 and PDL2, resulting in infiltration of tumour specific CD8+ T-cells and ultimately leads to tumour rejection.

Other interventions: CVA21
CAVATAK is an oncolytic Coxsackie virus that specifically infects and kills ICAM overexpressing tumour cells

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]. - To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. All adverse events will be collected and assessed with regards to CTCAE V4.0 grading, seriousness, duration and relationship to the study drugs.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ORR from the date of first study treatment as assessed by immune related response criteria (irRC) - The overall response according to the irRC is derived from time-point response assessments based on tumor burden. In the irRC, an immune-related Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all lesions, measured or unmeasured, and no new lesions; an immune-related Partial Response (irPR) is a 50% drop in tumour burden from baseline as defined by the irRC; and immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) is a 25% increase in tumour burden from the lowest level recorded. Everything else is considered immune-related Stable Disease (irSD).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be a Phase Ib open-label trial of CAVATAK (CVA21) in combination with
      Pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. The dose of Pembrolizumab
      will be fixed at 200mg. Three cohorts (dose levels) of intravenously-delivered CVA21 will be
      explored, using a standard 3+3 patient dose escalation design. The starting dose of CVA21
      will be one log below the 1 x 10^9 TCID50 dose found to be safe when CVA21 was given alone in
      an ongoing Phase I study (NCT02043665).</summary>
