          6. Diagnosed with FBSS (i.e.):

               -  Has had persistent pain for 6 months following most recent anatomically correct,

                  appropriate investigation

          7. Back pain is considered intractable and has been adequately treated (failed an
             appropriate trial of at least 3 different classes of back pain treatments
