  <interventions>

Changes in endpoints between the baseline and 24 hour post-RIPC samples will be assessed using two-tailed t-tests. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is the phenomenon where brief periods of ischaemia (reduced oxygen delivery) in one organ can have a protective effect against subsequent ischaemia in other organs. There are two periods of protection provided by RIPC. The first occurs within minutes and lasts between two and four hours, whereas the second presents 24 hours after the conditioning and persists for up to 72 hours. The exact mechanisms through which RIPC exerts these protective periods are unclear; however, there is evidence to support the involvement of both immune and nervous pathways.
This study will investigate the effect of RIPC on the immune response during the late phase of protection, and on the immediate parasympathetic nervous response. This will be achieved by recruiting 15 healthy male volunteers and collecting blood samples and electrocardiogram traces of the electrical activity of the heart before, and 24 hours after, RIPC. The blood samples will be used to measure the effect of RIPC on inflammatory biomarker levels and the function of circulating white blood cells. The ECGs will be used to determine if the RIPC stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.
