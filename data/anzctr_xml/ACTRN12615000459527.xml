    <interventions>Intervention
The intervention aims to increase parental knowledge, skills and confidence in communicating to their child about age appropriate sexuality topics. The Parenting and Family Support Centre (PFSC) at the University of Queensland and Family Planning Queensland (FPQ) have collaborated to develop a brief intervention program to teach parents how to educate their children about sexuality. Contents of the program were guided by the data collected from Morawska and colleagues (in press) study, where parents were asked what they would like to see included in a possible intervention to help them teach their children about sexuality. Some topics include, teaching parents what and how to teach children about sexuality, how children learn about sexuality, to be aware of parent traps, the importance of learning about sexuality, responding positively to sexual behaviours, using correct sexual terminology, answering childrens questions about sexuality (e.g. where do babies come from?), and sexuality conversation starters.

The intervention consists of one, 2-hour group discussion, Positive Parenting for Communicating about Sexuality. The content of the sessions draws on the theoretical principles that form the basis of Triple P, and is designed to be interactive and provide opportunities for discussion. The session is designed as an introduction to the principles of positive parenting in the context of parent-child communication about sexuality. It aims to promote positive parenting practices, assist parents to develop effective communication methods and help create environments conducive to caring relationships between parents and their children. Topics covered include (1) Understanding sexuality (2) Being aware of parent traps (3) Responding positively to sexual behaviours (4) Using correct sexuality terminology (5) Answering childrens questions about sexuality (6) Using positive redirections and conversation starters. The discussion groups will be delivered by trained educators at Family Planning Queensland and the Parenting and Family Support Centre at the University of Queensland.


Protocol adherence
Practitioners deliver Triple P according to a standardised manual and follow treatment delivery protocols, and complete protocol adherence checklists for each session conducted. Practitioners will receive regular clinical supervision. Group sessions will be videotaped and independently coded for protocol adherence, using structured session checklists. The inter-rater reliability (kappa) of this coding will be assessed for 25% of videotaped sessions by a second rater.

    <comparator>Control Condition
Families in the control condition will be assessed on entry to the trial, 6 weeks later, and then again at 3 months. After the 3-month follow-up assessment families will be offered participation in the intervention.</comparator>

    <concealment>A pre-prepared series (by a person independent of the research team) of sealed opaque envelopes each labelled with a participant ID number and containing a Randomisation Notification Letter, will be used to conceal the group allocation from both researchers and participants until after completion of the T1 assessment.  

Immediately after completion of the T1 observation session the researcher will open the envelope, and participants will be notified of their condition, what this means, what to expect, and what we ask of them. The Randomisation Notification Letter will be provided to the participant to retain for their records.

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis was conducted to determine the required sample size. To detect a medium effect size of .50, with alpha set at .05 and power at .80, a minimum sample size of 58 participants per group is needed. Allowing for potential attrition of 15% the proposed sample size will provide sufficient power to conduct the proposed analyses.
A mixed design Analysis of Variance will be used to evaluate treatment outcomes between the treatment and control group and within the 3 timepoints.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, group-based parenting intervention for parents of children ages 3 to 10. The parenting intervention aims to assist parents in enhancing their knowledge about child sexuality, improving their communication of age-appropriate sexuality topics to their children and increasing parental confidence and self-efficacy in this area. It is expected that participating in a group-based parenting intervention has the potential to increase parental knowledge, skills and confidence as well as improve parent-child communication about sexuality. Research has shown that increased parent-child communication, parental involvement and monitoring is associated with later onset of sexual intercourse and reductions in risky sexual behaviours in adolescence.</summary>
