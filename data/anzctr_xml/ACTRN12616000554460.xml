  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The composite primary outcome is to determine the toxicity profiles and discontinuation rates of Cisplatin and 5-Fluoro-uracil adjuvant chemotherapy.
Outcome would be assessed with following tools:
a) 3weekly clinic visit prior to each cycle.
b) Review of clinical symptoms, blood tests and patient preference.
c) Well documented toxicity include: drop in blood counts, nephrotoxicity, neuro-toxicity, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening visit- up to 14days prior to start of treatment.
During treatment- every 3 weeks (prior to each cycle of chemotherapy)
Follow up after completion: every 3months for 3years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To evaluate the efficacy of Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy.
Efficacy is assessed with clinical symptoms, CT scans to assess recurrence of disease based on clinical symptoms.
.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening visit- up to 14 days prior to start of treatment baseline symptoms and health issues will be noted
During treatment- every 3 weeks (prior to each cycle of chemotherapy) patient will be reassessed for any new or increased health issues since baseline
Follow up after completion: every 3months for 3years patient will be assessed for date of resolution of ongoing health issues that arose during the treatment period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To assess the effect of CF adjuvant chemotherapy on quality of life by using the following two questionnaires; QLC-C30  and QLQ-OES18

This is a composite secondary endpoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening visit- up to 14days prior to start of treatment.
During treatment- every 3 weeks (prior to each cycle of chemotherapy)
Follow up after completion: every 3months for 3years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. To assess associations between serum and plasma biomarkers and clinical outcomes (recurrence rate, 1 year disease free survival (DFS) and 3 year overall survival (OS). Composite. The specific biomarkers have not yet been decided. Clinical outcomes will be assessed through patient follow up in clinic and medical record review

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the 1 year DFS in locally advanced oesophageal and OGJ adenocarcinoma.
Evidence of disease recurrence is determined based on clinical symptoms, endoscopy and CT scans when clinically indicated</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year post study enrolment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> 3 year overall survival
- Survival is determined based on clinic follow up at the 3year mark. The tools include telephone calls to assess if still alive, clinic visits and medical records to determine date of death if not alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years post enrolment. patients who remain alive or lost to follow up will be censored at the date of last follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with oesophageal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and undergone curative surgery. 

You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagastric junction. 

 All participants will receive adjuvant cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) chemotherapy intravenously every 3 weeks for 12 weeks (4cycles). 

The intervention will start within 8-10weeks after the neoadjuvant CRT and surgery. Participants will be followed every 3weeks before each chemotherapy treatment for 12 weeks to determine the feasibility and safety of adjuvant CF chemotherapy . After completion of treatment, follow up would be every 3months for 3 years to the 1 year and 3 years disease free survival.
