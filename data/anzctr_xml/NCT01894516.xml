  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>-  280 patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response
           to methotrexate will be evaluated for improvement of disease activity (efficacy) when
           taking GLPG0634 as monotherapy (3 different doses - 50mg, 100mg and 200mg once daily) or
           matching placebo for 24 weeks.

        -  During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for any side effects that
           may occur (safety and tolerability), and the amount of GLPG0634 present in the blood
           (Pharmacokinetics) as well as the effects of GLPG0634 on disease- and mechanism of
           action-related parameters in the blood (Pharmacodynamics) will be determined. Also, the
           effects of different doses of GLPG0634 administration on subjects' disability, fatigue
           and quality of life will be evaluated.</summary>
