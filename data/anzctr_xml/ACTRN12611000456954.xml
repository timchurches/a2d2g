  <interventions>
    <interventions>We conducted a randomized, crossover and longitudinal study in humans who were randomly assigned to receive during a period of one month each type of breakfast: 3 study periods (breakfast with the same composition [200 ml Semi skimmed milk+ 18 g of soluble coffee ( 1 monodose sachette)+8 g of sugar ( 1 monodose sachette)+ 2 toasts of bread white] plus 20 g of butter/margarine/olive oil in breakfast A/B/C respectively. Each study period is  separated by one washout period (45-day). The composition of breakfast in washout period is: 200 ml Semi skimmed milk+ 18 g of soluble coffee ( 1 monodose sachette)+8 g of sugar ( 1 monodose sachette)+ 2 tosts of bread white +50 g of jam of peach + 200 ml of pineapple juice. This was an interventionist, longitudinal, randomized and crossover clinical trial where the participants consume each breakfast daily for a period of one month (30 days). Each participant consume each breakfast daily for a period of one month (30 days).The nutritional composition of breakfast and the other meals of the day was identical for all the volunteers, except the type of fat contributed in the breakfast each month.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of participants with statistically significant change in the levels of total cholesterol in plasma. Total cholesterol was measured according to the colorimetric enzymatic method of cholesterol esterase , in which cholesterol esters are hydrolized to free cholesterol. 

Analytical determinations: All blood extractions were performed in fasting conditions by puncture of the cubital vein. All the extractions (18 ml) were performed in the same conditions and samples were processed by the same staff (clinical biochemists), following the recommendations of the National for Committee Clinical Laboratory Standars and using the reference values of Roche Diagnostics GmbH.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first and last day of each one of the three periods of breakfasts, in fasting conditions: before and after of the month with breakfast A; before and after of the month with breakfast B; before and after of the month with breakfast C.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>biomarkers of cardiovascular risk: BMI, arterial blood pressure and cardiac frecuency. BMI was estimated using the formula from levels of weight and height. Arterial blood pressure and cardiac frecuency were assessed with the automatic sphygmomanometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first and last day of each one of the three periods of breakfasts, in fasting conditions: before and after of the month with breakfast A; before and after of the month with breakfast B; before and after of the month with breakfast C.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of participants with statistically significant change in the levels of LDL cholesterol in plasma.LDL cholesterol concentration was estimated using the Friedewald, Levy and Fredrickson formula from levels of HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglycerides (provided that levels of triglycerides is &lt; 200 mg/dl), as follows: 
LDL cholesterol (Friedewald) = Total Cholesterol (mg/dl) - HDL cholesterol (mg/dl) - [Triglycerides (mg/dl)/5]</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first and last day of each one of the three periods of breakfasts, in fasting conditions: before and after of the month with breakfast A; before and after of the month with breakfast B; before and after of the month with breakfast C.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of participants with statistically significant change in the levels of HDL cholesterol in plasma. For quantifying cholesterol in HDL a homogeneous colorimetric enzymatic test was performed, in which dextran sulphate and magnesium ions selectively precipitate the LDL and VLDL fractions, leaving the HDL fraction in solution. HDL cholesterol is then determined photometrically using an enzymatic cholesterol assay (cholesterol esterase).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first and last day of each one of the three periods of breakfasts, in fasting conditions: before and after of the month with breakfast A; before and after of the month with breakfast B; before and after of the month with breakfast C.</timepoint>

      <outcome>The nutritional valuation of the diet (energy, proteins, lipids,  carbohydrates) using an suitable software (Dietsource v.3).</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the DAY 5, 15 AND 20 OF EACH MONTH of  each period of nutritional intervention (3 x 3 = 9 questionnaires of each participant of the study)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of participants with statistically significant change in the levels of Triglycerides in plasma.Triglycerides were measured in accordance with the colorimetric and enzymatic test of lipoprotein lipase, where glycerol set free is converted to glycerol-3phosphate by the action of glycerolkinase and it is oxidated to form hydrogen peroxide. This reacts with 4-aminoantipyrine producing a violet complex whose intensity of colour is proportional to the concentration of triglycerides in the sample.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first and last day of each one of the three periods of breakfasts, in fasting conditions: before and after of the month with breakfast A; before and after of the month with breakfast B; before and after of the month with breakfast C.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of participants with statistically significant change in the levels of Subfractions of LDL particles in plasma. The Subfractions of LDL particles in plasma were assessed with Gel electrophoresis technique.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first and last day of each one of the three periods of breakfasts, in fasting conditions: before and after of the month with breakfast A; before and after of the month with breakfast B; before and after of the month with breakfast C.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of participants with statistically significant change in the Other analytical parameters differents of lipid profile: glucose, total protein, albumin, urea, creatinine, uric acid, enzymes (AST, ALT), ions (Na, K, Cl). The measurements were assessed with autoanalyzer equip.</outcome>

    <summary>Objective: To evaluate if only the type of fat ingested at breakfast as butter (saturated fat), margarine (polyunsaturated fat) and olive oil (monounsaturated fat) has power to modify the lipid profile and anthropometric variables of postmenopausal women at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Subjects and methods: We conducted a randomized, crossover and longitudinal study in 60 postmenopausal women at risk of CVD who were randomly assigned to receive during a period of one month each type of breakfast: 3 study periods (breakfast with the same composition plus butter/margarine/olive oil) separated by two 45-day washout periods. In fasting conditions, on the first and last day of each study period, weight, arterial blood pressure, heart rate and adiposity were recorded and a blood sample was collected to determine plasma lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDLc, HDLc and triglycerides) and other inflammation parameters</summary>
