  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic pain is common in our aging population. It negatively impacts on both physical and psychological well-being. This study aims to 
a) examine the prevalence of depression and chronic pain among nursing home residents;
b) examine whether depressive symptoms are positively associated with pain intensity;
c) examine whether horticultural therapy reduces pain and depressive symptoms and enhance the psychological well-being of nursing homes residents

It is hypothesized that
a) depression and pain will be positively associated;
b) those with current depressive symptoms will experience more chronic pain than those without depressive symptoms;
c) horticultural therapy will significantly reduce depressive symptoms and pain;
d) the reduction in depression will be positively associated with the reduction in pain.</summary>
