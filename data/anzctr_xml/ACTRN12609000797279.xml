  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients prescribed thickened fluids will be able to consume unlimited amounts of thin water for a period of five days that will be provided to them by nursing staff. All fluids other than wter will be thickened.  There will be no limit to the amount of thin or thickened water. Participants will already have been prescribed thickened fluids by their treating Speech pathologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients prescribed thickened fluids will not be allowed to consume thin water as per the treatment group.  Thickened fluids are any fluids other than water that require to be thickened using a thickening agent of patient choice.  Thickened fluids are consumed as per normal unthickened fluids,. therefore, when the patient is thirsty and wants a drink other than water, thickened fluids will be provided over a period of five days.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of thin water in patients who have been prescribed thickened fluids. The hypothesis is that there will be no ill effects and that quality of life will be improved as aresult of the provision of thin water to patients with dysphagia who have been prescribed thickened fluids.</summary>
