  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Kava (240mg of kavalactones per day)
Other interventions - Placebo

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Inert tablets matched for colour, size and consistency to active arm treatment. Both treatment arm tablets will match in appearance, and neither participants nor the trial clinicians will know what they are taking.

Experimental: Kava - standardised 240mg kavalactones - Standardised 240mg kavalactones per day - fixed dose regime of two tablets of kava twice per day


Other interventions: Kava (240mg of kavalactones per day)
Kava 60 milligrams per tablet = 240mg of kavalactones per day

Other interventions: Placebo
Inert tablets containing vegetable fibre matched for colour, size and consistency to active arm treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) - change in score - Reduction of participant's anxiety will be assessed on the HAMA from baseline to week 16 across time used a mixed methods model.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter polymorphisms moderating response to study intervention - Will assess whether response to Kava will be moderated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter polymorphisms. Specifically, whether rs2601126-T allele or rs2697153-A allele carriers have greater reduction of anxiety</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 weeks</timepoint>
