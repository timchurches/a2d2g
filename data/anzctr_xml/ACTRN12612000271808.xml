  <interventions>
    <interventions>The included Hashimotos thyroiditis patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive oral capsules of levothyroxine sodium (n=39) (arm 1), selenomethionine (n=39) (arm 2), levothyroxine sodium + selenomethionine (n=40) (arm 3), or of placebo (n=37) (arm 4) for six months. Levothyroxine was administered at the daily dose of 0.5 microg/kg for patients with TSH levels below 1.0 mIU/mL, 0.75 microg/kg for individuals with TSH levels between 1.0 and 2.0 mIU/mL, and 1 microg/kg for patients with a TSH above 2.0 mIU/mL. In turn, the dose of selenomethionine (200 microg daily) was independent of plasma TSH levels.
This study was in part a sub-study of another trial (ACTRN12611000238976), which assessed the effect of levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, on monocyte and lymphocyte cytokine release. The randomization procedure as well as treatment regimen in this study were the same as in ACTRN12611000238976 trial. Nineteen patients in arm 1, 20 patients in arm 2, 18 patients in arm 3, 16 patients in arm 4 and 18 healthy women simultaneously participated in in ACTRN12611000238976 trial, while the remaining ones only in this study. Because participation in both studies required collection of more blood sample volume, the participants were included in both studies only if they agreed on it. If not, they were included only in one of the two studies (using central randomization by computer).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of levothyroxine and selenomethionine, administered alone or in combination, on hemostatic risk factors in Hashimotos thyroiditis patients with normal thyroid function tests. The study involved a group of 155 euthyroid women with recently diagnosed and previously untreated Hashimotos thyroiditis allocated into one of the following treatment options: levothyroxine, selenomethionine, levothyroxine and selenomethionine, or placebo. Levothyroxine was administered at the daily dose of 0.5 microg/kg for patients with TSH levels below 1.0 mIU/mL, 0.75 microg/kg for individuals with TSH levels between 1.0 and 2.0 mIU/mL, and 1 microg/kg for patients with a TSH above 2.0 mIU/mL. In turn, the dose of selenomethionine (200 microg daily) was independent of plasma TSH levels. Taking history, clinical examination and venous blood sampling for evaluating safety laboratory parameters were performed every 2 weeks. Compliance was assessed by pill counts during each visit and will be considered satisfactory when the number of tablets taken by a patient is ranged from 90% to 110% Laboratory assays were be performed three times: before treatment and after three and six months of levothyroxine and/or selenomethionine. We measured the international normalized ratio, the partial thromboplastin time, plasma levels/activities of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor , factor VII, factor X and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.</summary>
