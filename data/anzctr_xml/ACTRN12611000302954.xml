    <studytitle>Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion Treatment Trial</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A 12 month, phase 3, single-centre, randomised trial to compare the the safety and efficacy of a 125mg/0.05ml Bevacizumab intravitreal injection to macular grid laser therapy in the treatment of macular edema following  Branch Vein Retinal Occlusion (BRVO) .</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody to vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) designed for IV administration and approved for treatment of colorectal cancer.
It has recently emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy for retinal diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration, and, in retrospective short-term studies, has also proven to be effective in central retinal and branch retinal vein occlusion.  None of the clinical and experimental studies published so far have found any drug-related toxic effects on any retinal structures.
Patients will receive a minimum of 3 doses of Bevacizumab 1.25 mg via intravitreal injection to the eye at monthly intervals, then as required for up to 12 months.The procedure on each occasion will take 5 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The other group will receive macular grid laser.
Type of Laser is Alcon Ophthalas 532 with 100 micrometre spot size, 80-150MW power,0.1 second duration. The duration of the treatment is less than 5 minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome measure - Best Corrected Visual Accuity log MAR
BCVA will be measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) method.  BCVA will be measured in both eyes at the baseline visit and at each follow up visit</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then monthly for 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1 Central retinal thickness
This will be measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT is a laser-based, non-invasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution images of the retina.  OCT will be performed in both eyes at baseline and at every follow up visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then monthly for 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2 Neovascular complication
Fundus photography: will be performed in both eyes when a Fluorescein Angiography is required. 
Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA): FFA will be conducted in both eyes to provide angiographic evidence of leakage involving the perifoveal capillary network at baseline and evidence of change over time. Analysis of Fluorescein leakage, capillary non-perfusion and cystoid changes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then monthly for 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3 Drug related adverse effects
Measured by history taking and observation of medical staff
There is a theoretical increased risk of strokes with anti-VEGF, however the actual risk of stroke with anti-VEGF is unknown</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then monthly for 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4 Complications related to intravitreal injection
Measured by history taking and observation of medical staff
Endophthalmitis (infection of the eye): symptoms include burning sensation, eye pain, increased blurring of vision, light sensitivity and redness. Studies have shown that the chance of getting an infection is 0.1 per cent and this is why antibiotics are given prior and following treatment. 
Elevated Eye Pressure: this is usually temporary and due to an increase of fluid entering the eye. 
Retinal Detachment, Bleeding and Cataract Formation: these are unusual complications occurring in less than 1 per cent of patients in trial studies.
Other side effects not related the eye include high blood pressure, nose and throat infection and headache.</outcome>

    <concealment>Branch retinal vein occlusion with associated macular oedema of any aetiology will be recruited for the study.
At the baseline visit a medical history, anterior and posterior segment examination, best corrected visual acuity by log MAR charts, central retinal thickness by OCT and fundus fluorescein angiography will be performed.
Patients will be followed up for 3 months at 4 weekly intervals recording BCVA and CRT by OCT.

Patients who have BCVA &lt; 20/40 and CRT &gt; 250 micro m in the central subfield or &gt;300microns in the inner subfields at three months, will be recruited for the trial. Patients will be randomised at three months to either the macular laser group or the Bevacizumab injection group.

The group assigned for the macular grid laser treatment as per Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS) criteria. BRVO involving foveal centre with perfused macula, recent onset 3- 18 months, no diabetic retinopathy, BCVA &lt;20/40).

The second group will be assigned for three injections of intravitreal Bevacizumab 1.25 mg 4 weekly intervals.
At 6 months further need of laser or Bevacizumab will be decided by the investigators on set criteria.(CRT worsening &gt;50micro m, CRT &gt;250 micro m or inner subfield &gt;300 micro m, visual acuity drop &gt; 5 letters log MAR)  Patients will be followed up at 4 weekly intervals for a total of 12 months.
 Patients will be assigned randomly in sequential order using opaque numbered envelopes.</concealment>
