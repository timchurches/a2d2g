             partner could become pregnant from the time of the first administration of study
             medication until 130 (90+40) days following administration of the investigational
             medicinal product. One of the following acceptable methods of contraception must be
             utilized:

               -  Surgical sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) and a
                  barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].

               -  The subject's female partner uses oral contraceptives (combination
                  estrogen/progesterone pills), injectable progesterone or subdermal implants and a
                  barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/vault caps].
