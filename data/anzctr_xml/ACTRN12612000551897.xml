  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves directing patient care according to the results of the patients QuantiFERON-CMV blood test.  At 5 months post lung transplant patients will be randomised to receive (1) standard of care - cessation of antiviral prophylaxis at 5 months post-transplant, or (2) QuantiFERON-CMV directed care - where patients prophylaxis will be individualised according to their blood results, with their first QFN-CMV assay being taken at their 5 month visit. If the QFN-CMV assay is positive, the  patients will cease antiviral prophylaxis, if the QFN-CMV assay is negative, the patients will receive a further 3 months antiviral prophylaxis (valganciclovir 450mg  tablet orally  twice daily). The QFN-CMV assay will be repeated at 8 months post-transplant, if positive, cease antiviral prophylaxis, if negative continue a further 3 months antiviral prophylaxis (valganciclovir 450mg tablet orally twice daily).  The QFN-CMV assay will be repeated for a final time at 11 months post transplant, and regardless of results, the patient will cease antiviral prophylaxis.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effectiveness of QuantiFERON-CMV directed antiviral prophylaxis on the incidence of CMV reactivation within the lung allograft in patients at-risk of CMV reactivation. CMV reactivation within the lung allograft will be assessed as the presence of CMV in the BAL, deifined as greater than or equal to 600 copies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 18 months of transplant</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the need for intravenous ganciclovir in both arms of the study. The need for intravenous ganciclovir will be assessed by the presciption for, the incidence of use and the duration of treatment in all study participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 18 months of transplant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the incidence of ganciclovir resistance in all study patients. The incidence of ganciclovir resistance will be based on the clinical evaulation by the treating physician and documented in the source documents.  The incidence of patients with ganciclovir resistence documented will be collected in all participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 18 months of tranpslant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the presence of CMV-specific immunity.  QFN-CMV assay will be tested on all study patients at 5, 8 &amp; 11 months post transplant.  The QFN-CMV assay will identify the presence of CMV-specific immunity in all study participants will enable this outcome to be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 5, 8 and 11 months post tranpslant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the incidence of acute cellular rejection.  Acute cellular rejection will be defined by as a Lung Biopsy Grade greater than or equal to  A1 (as defined by ISHLT).  Lung biospy and assessment for acute cellular rejection occur routinely in the first 18 months of tranpslant, and the incidence of this will be collected in all patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 18 months of tranpslant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess frequency of side effects from antiviral therapy.  Some of the known side effects to valganciclovir include diarrhoea, nausea, fevers, headaches, fatigue, hypertension, infection, neutropaenia, anaemia, decreased fertility, tremor, and there may be other less common or unreproted possible side effects.  All participants will have their source notes reviewed for the above side effects, and these will be recorded in the adverse event log of the case report forms for evaulation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 18 months of transplant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate survival.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 18 months of tranpslant</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the incidence of BOS.  BOS is a physiological assessment of lung function as measured by spirometry, as defined by ISHLT. BOS is present if there is 20% drop in lung fuction compared to the best lung function achieved following lung transoplantation, in the absence of other reversible causes.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After lung transplantation, all patients receive medications, called immunosuppressives. These drugs suppress the immune system and prevent the body from rejecting the transplanted lung(s), but this also makes them susceptible to infections.  CMV is a virus known to cause infection after transplantation and affects over 40% of patients and may influence the on-going success of their new lung(s). To reduce the damage that CMV can cause in newly transplanted lungs, all patients undergoing lung transplantation take medications, called anti-virals (Valganciclovir), for approximately the first five months following the transplant operation. Valganciclovir is approved in Australia for use to reduce CMV infection after lung transplantation.  However, CMV infection can occur after the anti-viral drugs are stopped. The purpose of this project is to see whether a blood test (QuantiFERON-CMV assay) that assesses whether you can mount an immune response against CMV, can predict which patients are at risk of ongoing CMV infection, and therefore would benefit from taking the anti-viral medication (Valganciclovir) for a longer period.</summary>
