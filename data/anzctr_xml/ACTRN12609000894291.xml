  <interventions>
    <interventions>No defined treatment. The needs of 30 breast cancer follow-up patients will be assessed at the beginning of the study by a team of medical and allied health professionals (MDT, multidisciplinary team). The cancer care coordinator will forward the patient-management recommendations of the team to the patients' general practitioner (GP). The GP will subsequently consult the patient and decide whether to adopt the recommendations received: referring the patient to the nominated allied health professionals within the community. To facilitate communication amongst health professionals, the patient's GP and the nominated allied health professionals will have free access to a web-based information sharing platform. The treatments provided will depend on the needs of the patients as assessed at the beginning of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>This feasibility study will explore the impact of the Cancer Care Coordinator/MDT on the quality of life, anxiety and depression, and psychological distress of 30 breast cancer follow-up patients. The study also aims to observe the uptake of the recommendations of the MDT model and its acceptability to patients, general practitioners and allied health professionals. The SF 36, Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale questionnaire (HADS), distress thermometer and the care assessment needs questionnaire will be used at the beginning of the study to assess the needs of the participants. The SF36, HADS, distress thermometer and the patient global improvement (PGI) questionnaire will again be used at the end of the study (three months after the participant had seen their GP) to determine if the assessed needs have been fulfilled.</comparator>

    <concealment>A breast care nurse of Sir Charles Gaidner Hospital has been chosen to act as a cancer care coordinator for the purpose of this study. As part of scheduling follow-up appointments (as per the hospital's protocol), the nurse will inform those who satisfy the inclusion criteria about the study. The patients will only then be mailed the information sheet if they express an interest in reading more about the study. The prospective participants will also be requested to make an appointment with the designated breast care nurse if they consent to participating in the study. Those who do not satisfy the inclusion criteria or who express no interest in the study will have their usual appointment with a breast care nurse of Sir Charles Gaidner Hospital.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early detection of cancer and advances in cancer treatment has allowed most people with cancer to survive at least 5 years from diagnosis. The wide range of needs associated with cancer survivorship is often overlooked. Follow-up care has been adopted to aid the detection of recurrence, promote behavioural changes and facilitate psychosocial adjustments. 

Follow-up care when performed by cancer specialists is not cost-effective and puts undue load on the cancer clinics. Most recurrences occur between appointments with a specialist and are detected by general practitioners (GPs). Currently, services offered by allied health professionals (AHP) are uncoordinated; patients thus face the likelihood of duplication of treatments, increased financial burden or incomplete care. 

We propose a feasibility study for cancer follow-up within a primary care setting based on the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) model.</summary>
