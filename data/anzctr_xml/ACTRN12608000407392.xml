  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study intervention involves the implementation of National-level guidelines for the provision of nutritional support in critical illness. 27 hospitals participated in this trial: 14 hospitals were randomised to the intervention group (guidelines implementation) and 13 were randomised to the control (standard care) group. The 14 intervention group hospitals received education on the content of the feeding guidelines and the 13 control hospitals received no education. Education was provided via a formal practice change strategy composed of Educational Outreach (one session, 45-60mins), Academic Detailing (as much as required), Posters, Active Reminders, Audit and Feedback and traditional in-servicing (as many sessions as required, 30-60mins per session).</interventions>
    <comparator>In the Control / Standard Care arm of the trial, hospitals received no educational intervention and continued to practice nutritional support as determined by current local standards.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nutritional support is accepted as a standard of care for critically ill patients although there is little agreement as to how it is best provided. Use of evidence-based guidelines has been shown to improve the effectiveness of care. The purpose of this project is to develop, promote and evaluate evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for nutritional support in the ICU in twenty-six hospitals throughout Australia and New Zealand. One half of the hospitals will be randomised to receive educational sessions based on the content of the guidelines using previously proven and accepted educational strategies. A cluster randomised trial will then evaluate the impact of these educational sessions on acceptance of the guideline and on patient outcomes.</summary>
