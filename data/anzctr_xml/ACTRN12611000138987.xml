    <studytitle>The effect of taping on pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In persons with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis, is McConnell patella taping more effective than a placebo in decreasing pain and improving knee kinematics during a step descent task?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly drawn into the taping intervention group and the vitamin E cream placebo group. McConnell taping will be applied to the subjects knee using three strips of common sports tape, with three corresponding hypoallergenic strips of tape underlying. The patella will be pulled medially, tilted medially and rotated medially. The tape will be applied once to only one knee and for a duration of no more than 10mins in which the participant will step down from a single step for 5 repititions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo - The vitamin E cream placebo group will have a small amount of cream briefly rubbed into their knee in the area corresponding to where the McConnell taping is applied in the intervention group. The cream will be applied to one knee only and will be briefly rubbed into the skin once immediately before repeating 5 step down repititions off a single step.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Difference in knee pain between the patients no taping before intervention pain scores, with the pain scores after the tape/vitamin E cream interventions measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS-10cm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Initial pain at baseline, then tested immediately after each step descent task. A total of five repititions with no tape for each participant, then five more repititions for either tape or cream per participant. Patients can rest for as long as needed between these repititions, but ideally if the patient is able then only 30seconds between repititions.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome: knee velocity, and knee range of motion of stance limb during the step descent task measured via 3D motion analysis system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Concurrent with performing the task.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of applying sports tape to the patella in OA knees and measure whether there is a decrease in pain, and or a change in the kinematics at the knee during a step descent task. The hypothesis is that taping the patella will improve a persons functional control of their knee, thereby decreasing the pain experienced during the task.</summary>
