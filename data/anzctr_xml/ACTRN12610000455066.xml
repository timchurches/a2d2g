  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) adapted specifically for people with Parkinson's Disease experiencing anxiety and depression. Topics covered in therapy include relaxation techniques, cognitive modification (eg, automatic thoughts, recognising unhelpful thinking styles), behavioural modification and active coping. The treatment will be run in a group format of 6-8 participants and facilitated by two therapists. Treatment comprises 8 weekly sessions, each of 2-hour duration.</interventions>
    <comparator>A delayed treatment/wait-list control will be used. Participants randomised to the wait-list condition will be advised on a 8-week period of symptom monitoring prior to treatment, following which they will receive the same treatment as participants allocated to the treatment condition. The 8-weeks of no treatment will serve as the control.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from a number of sources (eg, advertising, referrals from from health professionals etc) and assessed for suitability to participate in the study. Eligible participants will be randomised to either the CBT or Wait-list condition. A randomisation list will be computer generated by a person external to the study. The list will not be made available to the immediate research team during the recruitment and assessment process to limit any potential selection bias.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>All participants will ultimately receive the same intervention throughout the study. However, those randomly allocated to the wait-list condition will receive treatment after a period of 8-weeks of no treatment.</designfeatures>
