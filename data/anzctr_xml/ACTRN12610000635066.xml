  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the antioxidant precursor, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as a treatment for children with autism.  Recent evidence has shown children with autism to have imbalances in their antioxidant defences.  The primary antioxidant in the brain, glutathione, has been shown to be decreased in these children.  This study aims to increase the amount of available glutathione by administering NAC.  The trial will be conducted in a total of 80 children, 40 of which will take the NAC treatment and the remaining 40 will take a matched placebo.  The study will run over six months after which there will be a 12 and 18 month post-baseline follow up to determine the childrens symptoms following the trial.  Standard rating scales will be used to assess the children at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and subsequently 12 and 18 months.  Children will remain on any treatment regime they are currently taking part in.  Treatment options are limited at present for children with autism and it is hoped that this trial will be efficacious and provide more options for these children.</summary>
