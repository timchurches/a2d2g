  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) for SR-average patients - All power calculations are based on the assumption of proportional hazards, and using the log rank test (alpha = 0.05) with four planned analyses of the data for interim monitoring purposes. The 95% confidence interval for EFS for standard risk-high will also be computed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related quality of life - Standardized scores will be computed for child function using the gender and age-adjusted scores available from normative data from a healthy population of about 10,000 children. The various domains of family functioning will be assessed using well-validated instruments and analyzed as a dichotomous variable (impaired vs. non-impaired family functioning). Multiple regression analysis will be used to test the effect of family functioning (adjusted for therapy given, age at diagnosis, gender, socioeconomic status and other factors) on child function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 24 months after completion of all therapy</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of minimal residual disease (MRD) with EFS - Cox regression will be utilized to examine the correlation between MRD levels and outcome (EFS).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of minimal residual disease (MRD) and overall survival - Cox regression will be utilized to examine the correlation between MRD levels and outcome (Overall Survival).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens and
      comparing how well they work in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
