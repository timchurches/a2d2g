  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Manipulation is a common treatment for non-specific neck pain. Neck manipulation, unlike gentler forms of manual therapy such as mobilisation, is associated with a small risk of serious neurovascular injury and can result in stroke or death. There is long standing and vigorous debate both within and between the professions that practice neck manipulation and the wider scientific community as to whether neck manipulation potentially does more harm than good. Both manipulation and mobilisation, when used in combination with exercise are more effective than placebo or other treatments for subacute and chronic neck pain. It is not known however, if manipulation leads to more rapid or more complete recovery than safer manual therapy techniques for neck pain of recent onset. This randomised controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of manipulation and mobilisation for an episode of recent onset neck pain.</summary>
