  <interventions>
    <interventions>Normobaric hypoxia (15% oxygen concentration).

Four weeks total, three (3) times a week, 60 min per session, at 65% maximal heart rate.

Sessions will be completed on a cycling ergometer, in a room that has the capacity to have its oxygen concentration altered. 

The washout period will last one week.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to examine the effect of normobaric hypoxia exposure and exercise on changes in body mass and body composition. 

It is hypothesised that there will be no additional effect of exercising in normobaric hypoxia on the rate of change in body composition induced by regular exercise.</summary>
