    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>GENETIC OUTCOME - The primary objective is to recognize genetic variants associated with persistent CLBP patients compared to patients without chronic/persistent pain. Through a Genetic Wide Association Study (GWAS) investigators will correlate genetic variants associated with persistent CLBP in a wide, international population of European ancestry.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>GLYCOMIC AND ACTIVOMIC OUTCOME - Recognize Glycomic and Activomic data associated with persistent CLBP patients compared to patients without chronic/persistent pain. The sample size will better defined after the first interim analysis of first 400 patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>STRATIFICATION OF OUR POPULATION - All "omic" data will be compared stratifying our population according to:
Pathophysiology: discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, facet joint pain, sacroiliac joint pain, low back pain with radicular pain (not predominant radicular pain) and widespread pain.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common medical problems encountered in daily life; it
      is related to disability and work absence and accounts for high economical costs in Western
      societies.

      Low-back pain is a diverse group of mixed pain syndromes (neuropathic and nociceptive) with
      different molecular pathologies at different structural levels displaying similar clinical
      manifestations. Currently, there are limited biomarkers (mostly imaging) or clinical findings
      that can be used objectively to help the physician in precise anatomic diagnosis leading to
      the safest and most cost-effective treatment for the patient (reduction of direct and
      indirect costs and improvement of treatment efficacy).

      The main aim of this trial is to identify all "omics biomarkers" associated with
      susceptibility to chronic/persistent LBP and its different pathophysiology.</summary>
