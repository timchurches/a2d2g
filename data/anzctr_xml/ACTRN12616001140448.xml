  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 1
12 participants will each chew or rinse five times for one minute each time with a one week washout period between each test.  For each test product used,  the pH of dental plaque will be measured over the next 40 minutes to measure the effect of the test product on the acidity produced in the plaque.   They will chew one MGO400+ Manuka Honey tablet (food supplement) with 2.16g honey and 3.93g xylitol; one xylitol  tablet with 4g xylitol, 2.5g of Manuka honey, and two rinses with 20ml of 10% sucrose solution - the standard for determining dental plaque pH.    The honey and xylitol test interventions will be compared with the sucrose interventions to determine if they result in the same, more or less acidity in dental plaque.

Part 2
15 participants will chew  MGO400+ Manuka Honey tablets (food supplement) with 2.16g honey and 3.93g xylitol three times daily for 28 days and 15 participants will chew xylitol tablets with 4g xylitol  three times daily for 28 days.  The oral health status of each group including the dental plaque pH, the growth of dental plaque, the health of the gingival tissues and the saliva will be recorded at time 0, 14 days, 28 days and then at 56 days to look for any residual effects when compared with baseline and the end of the intervention. At 14 and 28 days, participants will be asked to return unused tablets to allow determination of how reliably the tablets were chewed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Part 1
The comparison tests are sucrose solution, honey and xylitol.

Part 2
The control group is an active control chewing xylitol tablets (4.0g xylitol). This is within the usual xylitol range in tablets and chewing gum on the market.  Xylitol has a known benefit in improving oral health.  Xylitol is also included in the MGO400+ Manuka Honey tablets ( 3.93g xylitol).  The xylitol group will allow an assessment of any improvement or decrease of effect on oral health from the MGO400+ Manuka Honey tablets. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 1
The acidity of dental plaque will be determined by measuring the changes in the pH of dental plaque over 40 minutes following chewing or rinsing with the test products: MGO400+ Manuka Honey tablet (food supplement) with 2.16g honey and 3.93g xylitol;  xylitol  tablet with 4g xylitol, 2.5g of Manuka honey, and two rinses with 20ml of 10% sucrose solution on five different occasions with a one week wash out between measurements.  This will be  done on samples of dental plaque removed from the teeth in the normal way with a dental instrument.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Part 1
The dental plaque pH will be measured at time 0, then 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 minutes following chewing or rinsing with each test product. 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2
Oral health will be assessed by examining the mouth and recording the health of teeth, soft tissues and the gingival (gum) tissues at the beginning of the study - Day 1,, 14 days, 28 days and 56 days.  At each time point, the acidity of dental plaque will be determined by measuring the changes in the pH of dental plaque over 40 minutes following  rinsing with 20 ml of a 10% sucrose solution.   This will be done on samples of dental plaque removed from the teeth in the normal way with a dental instrument.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Part 2
Oral health assessments will take place on Days 1,  14, 28 and 56 days with the intervention starting following the assessment on Day 1.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2
Gingival (gum) health will be assessed by measuring the dental plaque build up and health of the gums.  This is done by noting how much of the teeth surfaces are covered by dental plaque and by grading the colour of the gingival tissues which reflects any inflammation that may be present.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1, 14, 28 and 56.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2
Salivary health will be assessed by measuring salivary buffering capacity, pH  and salivary flow rates.  This involves having the participant spit saliva into a measuring cup for two minutes to work out the flow rate.  The pH is measured using a pH electrode and the buffering capacity is measured by adding acid to the saliva and measuring how much acid can be neutralised.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1, 14, 28 and 56.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Soft tissue health will be measured by recording any visible changes that occur in the tissues during the intervention and 28 days after ceasing the intervention.  This will be done as part of the dental examination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1, 14, 28 and 56.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in the dental plaque biofilm will be assessed by analysing changes in the bacteria in the biofilm.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We have consulted a consulting biostatistician (Andrew Gray) who is available to provide guidance on statistical issues throughout the project. 

For the Part 1 sample size, he recommend the following:.  Ive used a higher correlation coefficient than wed talked about (0.7 rather than 0.5) on reflection and this means that the cross-over design is more powerful than the equivalent parallel study.
 The number of participants in the first study was determined in part by how many it would be feasible to recruit and follow-up.  With n=6, this would provide 80% power for detecting differences between any two groups of 0.35 for pH (using a SD of 0.5 estimated from the literature) or 2.8 for AUC(5.7) (using a SD of 4 estimated from the literature) using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level and assuming r=0.7 or higher for the repeated measures.  Both are around 0.7 SD and so could be described as large effects.
 The number of participants in the first study was determined in part by how many it would be feasible to recruit and follow-up.  With n=9, this would provide 80% power for detecting differences between any two groups of 0.27 for pH (using a SD of 0.5 estimated from the literature) or 2.2 for AUC(5.7) (using a SD of 4 estimated from the literature) using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level and assuming r=0.7 or higher for the repeated measures.  Both are around 0.5 SD and so could be described as medium effects.
 The number of participants in the first study was determined in part by how many it would be feasible to recruit and follow-up.  With n=12, this would provide 80% power for detecting differences between any two groups of 0.23 for pH (using a SD of 0.5 estimated from the literature) or 1.9 for AUC(5.7) (using a SD of 4 estimated from the literature) using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level and assuming r=0.7 or higher for the repeated measures.  Both are around 0.5 SD and so could be described as medium effects.
 
A multiple of 3 for Part 1 would be useful in allowing you to balance the first order carry-over effects (this couldnt be done exactly with 10 participants).  Id suggest 12 if you think thats feasible but n=9 would also allow detecting medium effect sizes so either could be justified.
 
For Part 2 sample size, the  following was provided: 
 With n=10/group, and allowing for 10% loss to follow-up within each group, this would provide 80% power for detecting differences between any two groups at any time point of 1.20 for pH (using a SD of 0.5 estimated from the literature) or 9.6 for AUC(5.7) (using a SD of 4 estimated from the literature) using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level. 
 With n=15/group, and allowing for 10% loss to follow-up within each group, this would provide 80% power for detecting differences between any two groups at any time point of 0.90 for pH (using a SD of 0.5 estimated from the literature) or 7.2 for AUC(5.7) (using a SD of 4 estimated from the literature) using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level. 
 With n=20/group, and allowing for 10% loss to follow-up within each group, this would provide 80% power for detecting differences between any two groups at any time point of 0.71 for pH (using a SD of 0.5 estimated from the literature) or 5.7 for AUC(5.7) (using a SD of 4 estimated from the literature) using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level. 

For Part 2, the two versus three groups options depend entirely on the research question(s) of interest.  In general terms, a better answer to a more precise question (so with two groups) is usually a good thing so I think the two groups of 15 would be sensible if the total number is limited to 30. 

For statistical methods,  He has recommended:
·         You are going to allocate participants in Study 1 to one of three orders that are balanced for first order carry over and period effects (ABC BCA and CAB)
·         For Part 1, while linear mixed models could be used, a simpler approach of performing multiple paired t-tests for each of the three combinations of treatment will be performed.  As this is an exploratory study to identify any risk of harm, no adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed.
·         For Part 2, as missing data would make repeated measures ANOVAs inappropriate, separate ANOVAs will be used for each time point to compare the intervention groups.
·         All results will be presented along with 95% confidence intervals to help interpret the studys findings in terms of clinical significance as well as statistical significance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A chewable tablet MGO (Trademark) 400+ Manuka Honey with Cyclopower (MMHC) is a low GI (Glycaemic Index), sustained-release delivery of a naturally boosted high grade New Zealand Manuka honey. It is currently marketed as a tooth-friendly dietary supplement, containing methylglyoxal (MGO), xylitol and Cyclopower.  While previous research has shown positive effects of Manuka honey on oral health, it is not clear what effects this tablet might have on oral health including mucosal tissues, saliva, periodontal tissues and teeth.

Therefore the aims of this study are:
1.	To determine if MGO (Trademark) 400+ Manuka Honey with Cyclopower (MMHC) chewable tablets are safe for teeth, soft tissues and gingiva tissues when consumed three times daily for 28 days. 
2.	To investigate the effect of MGO (Trademark) 400+ Manuka Honey with Cyclopower (MMHC) chewable tablets on dental plaque, periodontal (gum) health, salivary health and bacteria in dental plaque. 
3.	To compare the effects of  MGO (Trademark) 400+ Manuka Honey with Cyclopower  chewable tablets with xylitol tablets used three times daily.

The outcomes of the study will allow appropriate recommendations with respect to the effect on oral health to be made about this food supplement being used by individuals who may suffer from dry mouth or who wish to use these MGO (Trademark) 400+ Manuka Honey with Cyclopower  chewable tablets as a food supplement.  </summary>
