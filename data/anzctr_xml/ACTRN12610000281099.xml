      <outcome>Safety of zoledronate 
Comparing rate of adverse events in the 6 months following zoledronate infusion with that in the 6 months prior to the infusion.

Due to the higher doses and potency, intravenous bisphosphonates have a greater potential for side effects than oral agents, including nephrotoxicity, osteonecrosis of the jaw, hypocalcemia, and post infusion pyrexia and flu-like symptoms.  

The most common adverse event associated with intravenous bisphosphonate use is flu like symptoms (including pyrexia and myalgia), but this is usually short lived, self limiting, mild in intensity, and normally occurs only after the first dose.  These acute phase symptoms can be minimized by the administration of ibuprofen or prednisolone, and, if symptoms are very severe, with prednisolone.

Hypocalcemia after intravenous bisphosphonate administration occurs secondary to increased rates of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.  This is well recognised and management protocols are available to treat this complication with calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

We will ask about adverse events at 6 monthly reviews.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children and teenagers with chronic neurological disease are at risk of having thin bones (osteoporosis).  Throughout your life, new bone cells grow and old bone cells break down to make room for the new, stronger bone.  Osteoporosis is characterised by the old bone breaking down faster than the new bone can replace it, resulting in the bones losing minerals (such as calcium).  This makes bones weaker and more likely to break even after a minor injury.  All the bones in your body are weaker if you have osteoporosis but not everyone who has osteoporosis gets a broken bone.  Bone pain and fracture are common complications of osteoporosis.  
Bisphosphonates are  a class of drug that slows down the thinning of bone, and are the standard treatment for osteoporosis in adults.  Bisphophonates come in oral and intravenous forms.  Gastrointestinal problems and compliance issues associated with oral bisphosphonates can be avoided by the use of intravenous bisphosphonates.  Pamidronate, an intravenous bisphosphonate, is given every 6-8 weeks and has been shown to be effective in children.   Zoledronate, a new potent intravenous bisphosphonate, is given yearly.  Since intravenous bisphosphonates have to be given during a 3 day stay in hospital, zoledronate requires far fewer hospital admissions than does pamidronate.</summary>
