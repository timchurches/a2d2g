  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge of analgesia used. A questionnaire was formulated by the principal researcher. This included 9 questions; knowledge and understanding questions. The parents were asked to fill in the questionnaire at day 10 post operative.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 10 post operative questionnaire</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain assessment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain scale used at day 3, 5, 7
