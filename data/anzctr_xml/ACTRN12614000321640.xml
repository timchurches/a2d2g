  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention under study involves Light (25g) and Heavy (225g) forces applied to a randomly allocated right or left upper first premolar with the direction of force alternating every 4 weeks over a 12 week period. Forces will be applied in one direction for 4weeks, the alternate direction for another 4 weeks and in the original direction for 4 weeks.  These forces will be applied to the teeth via orthodontic brackets bonded to the maxillary first molars and first premolars, and 0.0017 x 0.025 Titanium Molybdenum Alloy (TMA) archwires in heavy force groups and 0.016 TMA wire springs in light force groups to produce 225 and 25 grams of tipping forces respectively on the upper first premolars throughout the 4 week period.

Following enrolment, patients will be randomly allocated to one of four groups with the following parameters: 

Group LHJ: Light and Heavy Jiggling Movement Group (Transverse): A randomly allocated left/right first premolar will undergo light jiggling movements, while the contralateral premolar will undergo heavy jiggling movements in the transverse plane.

Group PCLJ: Positive Control light (Unidirectional) and Light Jiggling Movement Group (Transverse): A randomly allocated left/right first premolar will undergo light unidirectional movements while the contralateral premolar will undergo light jiggling movements in the transverse plane.

Group PCHJ: Positive Control Heavy (Unidirectional) and Heavy Jiggling Movement Group (Transverse): The randomly allocated left/right first premolar will have heavy unidirectional movements while the contralateral premolar will have heavy jiggling movements applied.

Group HBIJ: Heavy Transverse and Vertical Jiggling Movement Group: The randomly allocated left/right first premolar will have heavy transverse jiggling movements while the contralateral premolar will have heavy vertical movements applied.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment involves unidirectional light (25g) or heavy (225) orthodontic force applied in the horizontal plane for 12 weeks, with review and reactivation of forces as required at 4 weekly intervals.

Patients allocated to the PCLJ and PCJH groups will act as their own control when analysing the effect of light and heavy jiggling movements respectively.

Patients allocated to LHJ and HBIJ groups will act as their own control when comparing the effects of light and heavy jiggling movements, and heavy transverse and heavy vertical movements respectively.

    <concealment>Patients were enrolled and allocated to into the following four groups using a "Random Allocation Software" that produced a randomised list of group allocations across the 40 patients: 

- Group LHJ (Light and Heavy Jiggling Movement Group)
- Group PCLJ (Positive Control Light and Light Jiggling Movement Group)
- Goup PCHJ (Positive Control Heavy and Heavy Jiggling Movement Group)
- Group HBIJ (Heavy Bucco-palatal and Vertical Jiggling Movement Group)

Within each group, coin tossing was used to determine which premolar (right or left) would be the control side and which tooth would be the intervention side (according to the title of the group).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To investigate and compare the presence, location and dimension of root resorption craters on human premolar teeth induced by jiggling movement with light and heavy forces for 12 weeks through Micro-CT scans.

It is hypothesized that there is no statistically significant difference in the volume of the root resorption craters following twelve weeks application of jiggling and unidirectional forces on premolars in the same patient.</summary>
