  <interventions>
    <interventions>[68Ga]Gallium-labelled Prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (radio-isotope) will be injected into the blood stream via intravenous access (18-22 Gauge cannula). The dose is 150MBq(5 micrograms).  The radio-isotope is used commonly for prostate cancer staging and its safety profile is well documented.  The radiation dose is similar to other nuclear medicine studies such as bone scan which are commonly used.  After 90 minutes, the participants will be placed in the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and the scan will begin (scanning takes ~30 minutes). A low dose single phase non-contrast wholebody computed tomography (CT) scan will be performed during the PET scan as this helps to interpret the PET scan.  This scan will be undertaken once in the study. The images will be interpreted by a radiologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>As patients would have had multi-phase contrast CT scan as a standard of care/usual care, only a single phase non-contrast CT scan will be performed at the time of PET scan.  The multi-phase contrast CT performed previously will be used as a comparator to the PET scan.  PET scan is to be performed within 6 weeks of multi-phase CT scan to ensure that there is no bias towards effectiveness of PET scan.  In some patients, e.g. those who progress to surgical excision of tumour, specimen may be available for comparison with CT and PET scans.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the applicability of 68 Ga PSMA PET in detecting metastatic lesions in patients with renal cell carcinoma.

      <timepoint>Within 6weeks of diagnosis and imaging.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess whether 68 Ga PSMA PET imaging alters treatment decision:
1) If patients are diagnosed with widespread metastatic disease based on the PET imaging, the patient may be treated with chemotherpy/targeted therapy.  The outcome will be assessed using hospital records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 6 weeks of diagnosis and imaging.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess whether 68 Ga PSMA PET imaging alters treatment decision:
2) If patients are diagnosed with oligometastatic disease (&lt;3 lesions) based on the PET imaging, the patient may be referred for the treatment of oligometastatic disease.  The outcome will be assessed using hospital records.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is more sensitive in detecting small metastatic disease in renal cell cancer than conventional computed tomography (CT) scans. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you have been diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in the past 6 weeks. Study details: All participants will undergo a 68Ga-labelled PSMA PET scan in addition to the standard pf care staging CT scans offered. A standard imaging to diagnose renal cell carcinoma is using multi-phase contrast CT scan which participants would have had for the diagnosis.  The imaging is then compared to PET scan, which involves receiving a radio-isotope via a drip.  This scan is commonly used in prostate cancer staging.  You will be required to have an injection, wait 90 minutes, then lie down on a table inside the PET machine for 30 minutes.  Scans will be assessed for small metastatic disease and patient records will be assessed to determine if the use of PET scan has changed patient management.  It is hoped that the findings of this pilot trial will help to establish whether PSMA PET may be more useful in identifying micrometastases than the CT staging scans alone which are currently being offered. 

In total, all participants of the trial would have had 1 multiphase CT scan to be eligible for referral, and 1 non-contrast single phase CT scan will be performed with 1 PET scan.</summary>
