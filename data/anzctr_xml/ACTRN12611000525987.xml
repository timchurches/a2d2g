  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study of a bariatric weight loss program investigating the biology of the adipose hormone adiponectin. The intervention will be standard care at a public New Zealand teaching hospital, which will comprise a very low energy diet (VLED) followed by bariatric surgery. Participants will follow the VLED, in the form of Optifast meal replacement, for 4-6 weeks prior to surgery, and then will undergo Roux en Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. During surgery tissue biopsy samples will be collected from the abdomen and thigh (adipose, muscle) in addition to the liver . At 6 month follow-up repeat subcutaneous biopsies will be collected from the abdomen and thigh. Blood samples will be collected at pre-VLED, surgery and follow-up, and body composition analyses will be performed at these time points to assess body fat distribution.

Optifast is a mixture of shakes, soups and bars. Usually taken 3 times a day, if this is poorly tolerated or if a longer period is required then only 2 times a day, with a third meal of steamed veges.

Surgery methods
Roux en Y: laparoscopic, 30ml pouch, hand sewn gastrojejeunostomy, 100cm roux limb, hand sewn small bowel anastomosis, 3-4 hours

Sleeve: laparoscopic, narrow gastric sleeve over 32-36 french bougie, 2-3 hours

Body composition measurements:
1.	Total body protein (Neutron Activation Analysis)
2.	Total body fat (Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)
3.	Total body potassium (TBK)
4.	Total body water (Tracer Dilution)
5.	Total body water (Bioelectrical Impedance) 
6.	Skinfolds
7.	Grip strength
This is all monitored by health care professionals.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adiponectin Gene Expression.
Briefly, the methods involve the routine use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the genetic analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the tissue and plasma adiponectin protein work.  Many of the following methods are derived from Dr Aimin Xu et al, Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, L8-43, 21 Sassoon Road, Hong Kong, China.            
Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolation and complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) preparation Adiponectin and Receptors
Specimens of all tissue (4 samples of subcutaneous and deep upper body adipose, visceral and thigh, 2 of abdominal wall and thigh muscle and liver) at .3-2 g size will be collected in RNA-Later Applied Biosystems (ABI) (Foster City, CA, USA) and stored at -80C. The tissue will be cut into pieces, and separated, RNALater removed and appropriate washing for batch analysis. Total RNA for the adiponectin gene will be extracted from adipocytes using Trizol reagents and transcribed into cDNA with a Superscript first-strand cDNA synthesis system. The relative gene abundance will be quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the assay-on-demand TaqMan primers and probes  or ABI Prism (Genetic analyzer) by using PCR Master Mix Reagent, both  from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) with the pre-made assay kits. The reactions will be performed in an ABI 7000 sequence detection system.  Relative quantification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNAs for gene expression will be performed by real-time PCR using a similar system to the above. A reference gene such as hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl-transferase, or cyclophilin mRNA will be used as it is has been the reference for subcutaneous and visceral adipose, and liver in studies. As with many labs undertaking new work, we have Ethics approval to take some extra visceral adipose tissue to work out our own lab reference genes, and construct and standardize adiponectin and AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 gene reference curves from this reference pool. We also have permission to add to and use our cDNA library of adiponectin and receptor data</outcome>

iTRAQ is a method were peptides from 8 different samples can be labeled with isobaric tags (each tag has a slightly different mass).   
 
They are run through an Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify what proteins the peptides came from (Protine ID) 
 
The tags give you a reference to what sample they came from and a relative concentration of that protein in relation among samples.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adiponectin, an adipose hormone which exits in various forms (oligomers) in the blood, may be a important link between obesity and it's associated disease states.  It is negatively correlated with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia, and may have a cardioprotective role.   This study will investigate the effect of bariatric surgery for weight loss on adiponectin gene expression, secretion, receptor number and type, and circulation in a group of obese women from whom adipose tissue, muscle and liver biopsy samples will be collected for analysis pre and post surgery.</summary>
