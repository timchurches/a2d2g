  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants involved in study will be randomly assigned to either a ketamine group or a control group before undergoing cardiac or major vascular surgery. Ketamine is proposed as a neuroprotective drug from delirium and depression postoperatively as they are a common in the elderly population undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgery. Ketamine/saline will be administered intravenously as a single dose (0.5mg/kg) fifteen minutes following anaesthetic induction. No further alterations or additions to anaesthetic or surgical technique are required.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who are randomised to the control group will be given a saline dose intravenously. Anaesthetic treatment will be at the discression of the treating anaesthetist that is appropriate to the type of surgery. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure the incidence of delirium using the 3 minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) in the perioperative period after cardiac and major vascular surgery in patients with baseline cognitive impairment receiving ketamine compared to placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Neuropsychological testing at baseline (prior to surgery), Day 7 and 3 months postoperatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure the incidence of depression in patients with baseline cognitive impairment given ketamine compared to placebo, postoperatively and at 3 months following cardiac and major vascular surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Neuropsychological assessment at baseline, day 7 and 3 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure circulatory mediators of inflammation sequentially in patients given ketamine compared to placebo and identify any associations with delirium, depression and early postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Blood samples will be analysed using an ELISA for a series of interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-a, C-reactive protein and interferon (alpha, beta and gamma). This is a composite outcome. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Neuropsychological testing at baseline and day 7 and 3 months postoperatively. Blood samples will be taken prior to induction, at 30 minutes post surgical incision and at 6, 24 and 48 hours post surgery.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients presenting at cardiac or vascular preadmission clinic at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne and are eligible will be approached for the research. Once consented patients will be randomised by computer generated random-permuted block sequence to receive either intravenous ketamine 0.5mg/kg or intravenous placebo (saline); the anaesthetist will be blinded to the allocation and all other aspects of clinical management of the patient will be the standard of care. All postoperative assessments will be conducted by researchers blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>An external person to the study will set up the computer generated random-permuted block sequence for randomisation. Half of the patients recruited will recieve ketamine and the other half are to recieve the placebo. Assignment for each patient will be in a sealed envelope and only made known to the treating anaesthetist. Research staff will be blind for the entirety of the process.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to invesitgate the neuroprotective effects of ketamine in elderly patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgery. Delirium and depression are common effects of cardiac and major vascular surgery. Ketamine is believed to have a protective effect against delirium and depression. Participants will undergo neuropsychological testing prior to surgery and again at day 7 and 3 months postoperatively. Deliriuma and depression will be measured during patient hospital stay. Additionally, inflammatory bloods will be taken to assess the role inflammation plays in the role of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.</summary>
