  <interventions>
    <interventions>Jiangtang Xiaozhi at a dosage of 3 capsules 3 times per day for 16 weeks.  Jiangtang Xiaozhi comprises six herbs and two excipients:  Ligustrum lucidum, Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.), Coptis chinensis, Litchi chinensis, Ecklonia kurome Curcuma longa, Lactose, Magnesium stearate</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsules at a dosage of 3 capsules 3 times per day for 16 weeks.  Placebo comprises lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, dextrin,  fresh carrot juice and Denatonium Benzoate</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycaemic control: fasting blood glucose measured by analysis of blood samples collected by venipuncture</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) measured by analysis of blood samples collected by venipuncture.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-prandial plasma glucose measured by analysis of blood samples collected by venipuncture following an overnight fast of at least 10-12 hours and 3 days of carbohydrate loading. A standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 16 weeks, 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum insulin measured by analysis of blood samples collected by venipuncture. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Insulin sensitivitiy (HOMA%S) are calculated using the Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) (Levy, Matthews, &amp; Hermans, 1998).   The HOMA calculations in this research were derived from the HOMAV2.2 computer package which estimates steady state beta cell function (HOMA%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA%S), as percentages of a normal reference population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HDL cholesterol measured by analysis of blood samples collected by venipuncture.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>C-reactive protein measured by analysis of blood samples collected by venipuncture.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight measured after removal of shoes and when wearing light clothing only, using A&amp;D Digital Scales (Model UC-321) and recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by weight (measured to within 0.1kg) divided by height (measured to within 0.5cm) squared</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist-hip ratio (WHR) was obtained by dividing the mean waist girth by the mean hip-girth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure was measured in a seated position after the participant had rested for at least 5 minutes.  Two readings on the left arm were taken 1 minute apart.  To obtain the final measure of blood pressure, the mean of the two readings was calculated and recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks and at follow-up at 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health related quality of life (SF-36). The instrument selected to assess HRQoL was the 36-item short-form health survey Version 2 (SF-36v2).</outcome>

    <concealment>Placebo and intervention were identical in appearance, taste and smell.  A trial coordinator (external to the trial) supplied labelled packets of the intervention as required.  The data anaylsis was conducted with the interventions known simply as 'A' and 'B'.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random sequence in a simple block was computer-generated by the Trial Coordinator (who was external to the trial).  The medication was sealed in sequentially numbered identical packets according to the allocation sequence.  Each individual was assigned a unique three-digit participant identifier number that matched the labelled packets.  This number was used in all electronic and paper based data collection items.</sequence>
