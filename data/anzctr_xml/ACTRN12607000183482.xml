  <interventions>
    <interventions>Families will be divided into three groups for the study. Group one and two are the intrevention groups and group three is the control group.
Group 1: adults in the family will receive surgical masks for use while in the same room as the sick child.
Group 2: adults in the family will wear P2 masks while in the same room as the sick child.
The P2 masks , is a facial mask which protects against airborne micro-organisms. </interventions>
    <comparator>Group 3: will not receive masks.
Groups one and two willl wear the masks daily for one week or until a contact develops a influenza like illness.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a prospective, 3-armed cluster-randomised trial to determine the effect of the use of two different kinds of face masks on the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses. The starting point will be patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), whose households will then become the focus of the study. Index cases with ILI will be identified using the emergency department of the Children's Hospital at Westmead and their families will be approached to give their consent. In two arms of the study, adult contacts in the household will be provided with one of two types of face mask (surgical masks or P2 masks) to be worn when in the same room as the index case. Families in the third arm of the study will receive only education about infection control. Several measures will be used to measure compliance, including observation by family members within the household, self report through the use of diary cards, and interviews with a random selection of participants. There will be two main outcomes:  ILI and laboratory diagnosis of influenza or other respiratory viruses (as determined from nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples), and impact on influenza transmission within the household.</summary>
