    <summary>The primary objective of this investigation is to compare the precision of long leg alignment
      achieved by the two types of procedure. The secondary objectives of this investigation are
      to:

      Compare the accuracy of long leg alignment achieved by the two types of procedure.

      Compare the number of optimal implantations achieved by the two types of procedure.

      Compare the clinical performance of the knee replacement in subjects who have undergone one
      of the two types of procedure.

      Compare the functional outcome achieved by subjects who have undergone one of the two types
      of procedure.

      Compare the interface radiographic appearance 5 years post-operatively between the two types
      of procedure.

      Compare the accuracy and precision of long leg alignment achieved by the two types of
      procedure 5 years post-operatively, i.e., at final follow-up and also the change in accuracy
