  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malignant bowel obstruction (MBO) occurs when the bowel (gut) becomes blocked due to cancer. When the bowel is blocked, symptoms such as pain, nausea and vomiting occur. Doctors will try to relieve the blockage with surgery and control the cancer with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, wherever possible.  If these treatments cannot be used, medicines can be given to decrease symptoms so that people feel better. In some cases the bowel may become partially unblocked and start working again. 
In people where the cause of the bowel blockage is not cancer, a drug called gastrografin has been shown to help unblock the bowel faster. Gastrografin is therefore now commonly given to these people. At the moment we do not know whether gastrografin will help unblock the bowel when the cause is cancer. The reason for carrying out this trial is therefore to help us try and find out whether the addition of gastrografin to the other medicines that we use to control symptoms, will help get the bowel working, when the cause of the blockage is cancer.</summary>
