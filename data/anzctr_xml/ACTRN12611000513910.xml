  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: Untreated subjects - subjects who are not eligible or chose not to receive anti-hepatitis C treatment will be followed for up to 2 years.
Group 2: Treated subjects - subjects who are eligible for anti-hepatitis C treatment and chose to receive treatment will receive response-guided treatment.  The duration of treatment will depend on the subject's virological response, ranging from 8 to 48 weeks.  The type of treatment received will depend on the estimated duration of hepatitis C infection and HIV disease status.  Subjects will receive pegylated interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin.
Early acute sub-group: Subjects who have been infected within the last 12 weeks of screening will be eligible to participate in the early acute sub-study and have 4 extra visits for collection of research blood samples between screening and baseline visits.
The mode of administration of pegylated interferon alfa-2a is subcutaneous injection 180mcg weekly.  The mode of administration of ribavirin is oral tablet, 800mg to 1200mg daily depending on the genotype of the subject (and the body weight of the subject if genotype 1).</interventions>
    <comparator>The rate of sustained virological response (SVR) of study subjects using response-guided therapy in this study will be compared to the SVR rates in historical controls in the ATAHC I (Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C) with ANZCTR registration number: ACTRN 12605000435684</comparator>

      <outcome>To characterise the natural history, and outcomes following treatment, of recent HCV infection by HIV status</outcome>
      <timepoint>Proportion of treated subjects with HCV RNA &lt;=15IU/ml at week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 of therapy; proportion of treated subjects with HCV RNA &lt;=15IU/ml at therapy completion, at week 12 after therapy completion (SVR12) and at last study follow-up; proportion of treated subjects with SVR24 by treatment duration</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the incidence and predictors of reinfection following spontaneous and treatment induced clearance of recent HCV. 
The incidence of HCV reinfection during and following HCV treatment will be determined among all participants with treatment-induced HCV RNA suppression and &gt;= 4 weeks on-treatment follow-up.  Virologic suppression will be defined by one positive HCV RNA tests followed by &gt;= one negative qualitative HCV RNA test(s) &lt;=15 IU/ml.
Confirmed HCV reinfection will be defined as recurrent viraemia with a different viral sequence as initial infection as confirmed by viral sequencing.  Possible HCV reinfection will be defined as recurrent viraemia in which either the initial or reinfection timepoint could not be sequenced.
Factors associated with HCV reinfection will be assessed through comparison of baseline demographic (age, gender), clinical (HIV status) and behavioural (IDU vs
MSM acquired, IDU frequency, drug type) factors as well as longitudinal clinical (peak ALT) and behavioural (IDU frequency, needle sharing) factors among cases and non-cases.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening and longitudinal time-points (the screening blood sample will be sequenced, and the blood samples collected at subsequent time-points will be sequenced if the subject becomes HCV RNA positive again after achieving viral suppression).</timepoint>

      <outcome>To define the incidence and prevalence of HCV superinfection in individuals with recent HCV infection infection at baseline and during the first 12 weeks of therapy</outcome>
      <timepoint>All subjects' screening HCV RNA samples will be tested for mixed HCV infection; those subjects who are still HCV RNA detectable at week 4 and week 12 will have HCV RNA samples re-sequenced</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ATAHC II is a prospective longitudinal study of natural history and treatment outcomes following response-guided treatment of recent HCV infection.  
The main aim of the study is to identify the optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with recently acquired HCV infection.  Eligible subjects will be offered HCV treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2a with or without ribavirin, depending on their HIV status and their duration of infection.  The duration of treatment will be guided by the subjects virological response to treatment and will range from 8 weeks to 48 weeks.  
Subjects who are not eligible for HCV treatment or chose not to receive HCV treatment will be followed at regular intervals for 2 years</summary>
