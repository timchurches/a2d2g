    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patients presenting with hemispheric acute ischaemic stroke 2. Patient, family member or legally responsible person depending on local ethics requirements has given informed consent 3. Patients age is &gt;=18 years 4. Treatment onset can commence within 4.5  9 hours after stroke onset according to registered product information, or between 3  9 hours according to locally accepted guidelines  5. Patients who wake with stroke may be included if neurological and other exclusion criteria are satisfied. These wake up strokes are defined as having no symptoms at sleep onset, but stroke symptoms on waking. The time of stroke onset is to be taken as the mid-point between sleep onset (or last known to be normal) and time of waking. The maximum time window for randomisation is then 9 hours from the mid-point as described. 6. NIHSS score of &gt;=4 - 26 with clinical signs of hemispheric infarction. 7. Penumbral imaging** Using a Tmax&gt;6 second delay, a perfusion (PWI) volume to diffusion (DWI) volume ratio of &gt; 1.2, a DWI lesion &lt;=70ml and PWI-DWI difference of &gt;10ml ** Patients may be consented before or after penumbral screening depending upon local practice. The entire cohort of patients consented onto the study will be followed up with clinical assessments and biomarker studies regardless of eligibility for randomisation to treatment based on penumbral mismatch criteria. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) identified by computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 2.

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Screening Evaluation: Baseline physical examination will be performed on potentially eligible patients. Whole brain non-contrast CT will be performed to assess for ICH. Neurological impairment and functional scores (NIHSS, mRS) will be assessed by a neurologist or trained health care professional. Bloods for standard care diagnostic evaluations will be collected and analysed. Patients will be assessed for trial eligibility according to the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be obtained from patients or their authorised representative according to the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved patient information and informed consent procedure and documentation. Consented patients will then be referred for trial-specific penumbral imaging procedures. Randomisation: The randomisation system for investigational product will be based on computer generated randomisation lists, with stratification for time from onset of stroke to randomisation (3-6 hrs, 6-9hrs or Wake up stroke). Blinding/Unblinding: All those involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to treatment allocation. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DMC) will have access to data that is grouped, but not unblinded in terms of treatment allocation. Code break envelopes will be provided with blinded vials of investigational product, and held at the Central Drug Distribution centre. In the case of reported Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), or if treatment identification is necessary for emergency patient management, cases may be unblinded by contacting the local Clinical Trials Pharmacist. Details (date, time, reason) should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Product Labelling: Vials of investigational product will be labelled with storage conditions (store below 25 degrees Celsius, protect from light) and expiry date by the supplier, Boehringer Ingelheim. Details on the labels will include: Protocol name and identification number, name, address and contact number of the sponsor, the subject randomisation number, and the words ‘for clinical trial use only’. Labelling of the investigational product will comply with Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) code of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for medicinal products, Annex 13, section 17 in Australia, or applicable national and/or local requirements for international sites. Handling and Storage of Study Drugs: Investigational product will be stored centrally at, and distributed to study sites from, the Central Drug Distribution Centre. Vials will be identical in appearance and blinded as to their contents, and be provided with randomisation codes and code break envelopes. Appropriate arrangements will be made for the distribution of the investigational product to the study sites. Vials will be distributed according to the process outlined in the Study Pharmacy Manual. Vials will be stored at ambient temperature until use. The investigator or his/her designee must maintain an adequate record regarding the receipt, distribution, and return of all investigational product. Accountability documentation will also reside with the Central Drug Distribution Centre and be retained in the Trial Master File at NSRI. The investigator must agree to use the investigational product only in accordance with the protocol. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation: Patients eligible for treatment based on penumbral mismatch criteria will be randomised to receive either tPA or placebo according to a centralised procedure coordinated via the on-line electronic case report form (eCRF), and linked to the central Drug Distribution Centre. Randomisation codes and further permuted block randomisation sequences will be generated by a computer software program. Patients will be stratified according to time from stroke onset (three strata: greater than 3 hours to 6 hours, greater than 6 hours to 9 hours, Wake up stroke). </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Hypothesis: Patients selected with significant penumbral mismatch 4.5-9 hours post onset ischemic stroke given intravenous tPA will have improved clinical outcomes compared to those who have been given placebo. Secondary Hypotheses: 1. An increased risk of post-stroke depression will be predicted by biological markers related to stress and 5-HTTLPR genotype. 2. Increased risk of post-stroke depression will be predicted by an increase in proinflammatory biomarkers (i.e. cytokines and C-reactive protein) and APOE genotype, particularly in those who do not receive thrombolysis. 3. Diet and lifestyle factors, involving i) increase in lipid concentrations and decrease in vitamin B12 concentrations; ii) low activity levels; and iii) reduced participation in daily activities; will be associated with the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, recurrent stroke and functional outcome. </summary>
