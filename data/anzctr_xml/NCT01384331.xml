  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most Implanon users experience a reduction in the frequency and volume of menstrual bleeding,
      but a substantial minority experience unpredictable and frequent and/or prolonged episodes of
      bleeding. This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised study with an additional
      randomised non-blinded arm. Two hundred women between the ages of 18-45 years, who are
      Implanon users with prolonged or frequent breakthrough bleeding (WHO definition) will be
      recruited and randomised into 4 equal-sized treatment groups of 50 women assigned to Marvelon
      7 days or 21 days, NuvaRing 21 days or placebo. Recruited subjects will maintain a daily
      menstrual diary chart for a minimum of 90 days prior to randomisation, and will be enrolled
      into the treatment phase provided that they have met one of the World Health Organization
      criteria for prolonged or frequent bleeding Following the initial 90 day record, eligible
      women will begin designated treatment on day 1 of the next episode of bleeding or spotting.
      Analysis of the subsequent menstrual pattern will begin from day 1 of that bleeding/spotting
      episode and will continue through 90 days.</summary>
