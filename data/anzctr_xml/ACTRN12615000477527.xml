  <interventions>
    <interventions>This non-interventional, observational study will be conducted in a cross-sectional format. The study population will consist of adult patients diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease, who are attending a routine clinical visit or are inpatients at the participating clinical sites in the country of interest. In order to avoid selection bias, patients will be asked for interest and enrolled in the study consecutively in each study site. Each patient will have one assessment (study visit) only, at which all data will be collected. Data collected during the study visit consists of data from patients medical records including patient demographics, PD related data, PD treatment (past and present) and co-morbidites. The following assessment scales will be used by the researcher: (1) Unified ParkinsonÂ´s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II-IV for evaluation of activities of daily living, motor functions, complications of therapy (dyskinesia), (2) UPDRS part V, Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging for PD symptoms, progress and relative level of disability and (3) Non-Motor Symptom Assessment Scale for Parkinsons Disease (NMSS) for evaluation of non-motor symptoms. The researcher will also assess whether the patient fulfils some predefined advanced PD criteria. One patient questionnaire, Parkinsons disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-8) will be administered to collect information on patient quality of life. Estimated time for the whole visit is approximately one hour.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multi-country, observational study will primarily determine the proportion of PD patients treated at Movement Disorder Centers (MDC), who are identified as advanced PD patients.
This study will also compare the proportion of PD patients identified as advanced based on routine clinical practice (physicians judgement) to the proportion of advanced patients identified based on a set of consensus criteria generated by Delphi method. The main purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of the proportion and patient characteristics of advanced PD patients in Movement Disorder Centers in different regions and to evaluate any regional differences.
