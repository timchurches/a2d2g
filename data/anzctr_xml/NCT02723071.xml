Experimental: Cohort A: Ocrelizumab 200 mg/m^2 - Participants will receive a total of 8 infusions of ocrelizumab 200 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) given at intervals of 3 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Cohort B: Ocrelizumab 375 mg/m^2 - Participants will receive a total of 8 infusions of ocrelizumab 375 mg/m^2 given at intervals of 3 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Cohort C: Ocrelizumab 375/750 mg/m^2 - Participants will receive first infusion of ocrelizumab 375 mg/m^2 followed by 7 infusions of 750 mg/m^2 given at intervals of 3 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.


Treatment: drugs: Ocrelizumab
Participants will receive a total of 8 intravenous (IV) infusions of ocrelizumab given at intervals of 3 weeks, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
