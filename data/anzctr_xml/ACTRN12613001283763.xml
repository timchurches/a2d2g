    <interventions>Exploring the relationship between cough reflex testing (CRT) and silent aspiration in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
All participants will receive a cough reflex test post recruitment to the study.
A 2ml placebo dose of 0.9% sodium chloride without citric acid will first be administered through a face mask and nebuliser for 15 seconds, to normalise the patient to the face mask method. Should the patient cough in response to the placebo, it will be repeated twice more. Should coughing persist, the participant will be excluded from the study as either task comprehension difficulties or hypersensitivity of the cough reflex will have been demonstrated. 
2ml of citric acid diluted in 0.9% saline solution to provide a 0.4mol/L concentration will be administered for up to three trials of 15 seconds each, and the participant responses to the citric acid will be subjectively rated as either absent, weak or strong. Trials will discontinue when two consistent responses are achieved. A 30 second interval will occur between trials to avoid tachyphylaxis. For the purpose of the study, a response qualifies as a cough when a two forced expulsive manoeuvres against a closed glottis are heard within one respiratory cycle as recommended by the ERS Guidelines (2007).
The cough reflex test will be repeated with all participants once deemed medically stable and/or cleared for hospital discharge.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Within an hour, all participants will then receive a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES), which involves passing a videoscope into the nasal cavity until a view of the laryngopharynx is achieved. Other equipment used will include a light source and processor, 21 inch monitor, microphone and DVD recorder for audio-visual recording. Some discomfort may be experienced during FEES; lubricating jelly will be applied to the flexible tip of the videoscope and participants will be closely managed by a skilled endoscopist.  Evaluation of the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx and assessment of swallowing will be recorded on a FEES Assessment Form. FEES is performed at bedside, typically taking no longer than fifteen minutes.
As with cough reflex testing, FEES will be repeated for each participant at bedside, once deemed medically stable and/or cleared for hospital discharge. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cough response to citric acid.
All participants will receive a cough reflex test (CRT) and will be instructed to try not to cough in order to elicit a reflexive cough, when the cough can no longer be suppressed.  
Informed by ERS guidelines (2007) and previous research by Miles et al. (2013), the CRT will be administered using a PulmoMate Compressor/Nebuliser (model 4650; DeVilbiss Healthcare LLC, Pennsylvania, US) with a fixed continuous flow output of 8 litres per minute. A face mask method will be used to deliver citric acid in a single-dose from a nebuliser chamber (Hudson Micro MIST Registered Trademark Nebuliser Ref 1880), through 2.1m of soft rubbing tubing (Hudson RCI, Registered Trademark oxygen supply tubing Ref 1115) to face mask (Hudson Adult elongated see-Thru, Registered Trademark Aerosol Mask Ref 1083). 
2ml of citric acid diluted in 0.9% saline solution to provide a 0.4mol/L concentrationwill be administered for up to three trials of 15 seconds each, and the participant responses to the citric acid will be subjectively rated by an SLT as either absent, weak or strong. Trials will discontinue when two consistent responses are achieved. A 30 second interval will occur between trials to avoid tachyphylaxis. For the purpose of the study, a response qualifies as a cough when a two forced expulsive manoeuvres against a closed glottis are heard within one respiratory cycle as recommended by the ERS Guidelines (2007). </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food and drink coloured with standard food dye for optimal visualisation during endoscopy will be administered and a rating scale known as the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS; Rosenbek et al., 1996) will be used by the endoscopist and supporting clinician, to record the passage of the food bolus through the pharynx and rate participant response to any airway invasion. The highest PAS score will be documented, as well as subjective assessment of trace aspiration. Different independent researchers will perform the CRT and FEES and will be blinded to the result of the alternate test.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death after cancer, heart disease and stroke, and is the second major cause of health loss in older adults. Reported prevalence of swallowing disorders in COPD varies from 17% to 85% and a poor self-awareness of swallowing difficulties has been demonstrated (Clayton 2007). One implication of poor swallowing in COPD is the entry of food/fluid into the wind pipe (aspiration) which can trigger a protective cough but can also occur silently with no obvious signs (silent aspiration). Aspiration can cause aspiration pneumonia, which could be contributing to a worsening or exacerbation of COPD. 
30 consecutive patients admitted to North Shore Hospital (NSH, Waitemata District Health Board; WDHB) with exacerbation of COPD as primary diagnosis will be approached for screening by a speech &amp; language therapist (SLT) using a cough reflex test (CRT). This test involves administering citric acid via nebuliser with the aim of triggering a cough which will be subjectively categorised by the researcher as strong, weak or absent. Absent cough suggests reduced throat sensitivity. 
The CRT will be followed by a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), which involves passing a videoscope through the nasal cavity to directly observe the passage of food and fluid through the throat. A standardised rating scale will be used to rate the swallow as normal or abnormal (aspiration) and whether a cough response to protect the airway is triggered or not (silent aspiration). 
The study will seek to explore whether there is an association between absent cough on CRT and silent aspiration on FEES, investigating the value of the CRT as a screening tool in COPD. 
The participants medical charts will be monitored until medically stable. The CRT and FEES will then be repeated prior to discharge, to investigate whether any differences exist in the cough response and/or swallow function when in stable condition.
