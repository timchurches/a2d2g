  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1  Tailored exercise training:

Patients allocated to this group will receive 16 individual, face-to-face sessions, each lasting for 60 min, twice per week, over an 8-week period. The intervention will be delivered by an experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapists. 

The intervention consists of sustained mobilization followed by exercises focusing on restoring normal movement pattern and the dynamic stability of the scapulothoracic and glenohumeral joints. The intervention will involve manual therapy techniques focusing on restoring cervical or thoracic spinal movement, and shoulder and scapular movement to reduce pain, and motor control and progressive resistance training of impaired muscles. 

Manual therapy techniques and motor control and progressive resistance training will be tailored based on physical impairments presented by the patient, and identified through a thorough physical examination. Progression of dynamic exercises (i.e. concentric-eccentric contractions) will be performed by increasing the number of sets from two to three. 

Participants will perform a total of 8 strengthening exercises (with two sets of ten repetitions each) and may receive up to two manual therapy techniques per session of treatment.

Participants will be asked to perform two types of home-based exercise, with 2-3 sets of 10 repetitions each. The exercises will be tailored to participants' physical impairments.

Participants will be asked to perform home-based exercises during the days that they do not attend the physiotherapy session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2  Standardized exercise training: 

Patients allocated to this group will receive 16 individual, face-to-face sessions, each lasting for 60 min, twice per week, over an 8-week period. The intervention will be delivered by an experienced musculoskeletal physiotherapists. 

The intervention focuses on restoring muscle strength and flexibility and has been shown to be more effective than no intervention or control for reducing pain and disability. Participants will perform a total of 8 strengthening exercises (with two sets of ten repetitions each) and two stretching exercises per session of treatment. Progression of progressive resistance training for all scapular and shoulder muscles and stretching dynamic exercises (i.e. concentric-eccentric contractions) will be performed by increasing the number of sets from two to three. In this group, participants will not receive any form of manual therapy technique.

The key difference between Groups 1 and 2 is that participants in Group 2 will receive a standardized strengthening and flexibility programme that is not tailored to individual physical impairments. Participants in Group 2 will complete the same strengthening programme (with minor variations regarding load progression).

Participants will be asked to perform two types of home-based exercise, with 2-3 sets of 10 repetitions each. The exercises will be the same for all participants, and not based on specific physical impairments.

Participants will be asked to perform home-based exercises during the days that they do not attend the physiotherapy session.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Patients from 18 years to 65 years old, with mechanical shoulder pain will be recruited to participate in the study. Participants will be screened as per the British Elbow and Shoulder Society (BESS) guidelines. Participants will be included if they present one positive finding on the following tests: (1) Painful arc movement during shoulder flexion or abduction; or (2) pain on resisted lateral rotation or abduction or Jobes test.

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analyses will be performed using R software. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse: (1) recruitment rates; (2) adherence to the rehabilitation programme; (3) proportion of participants enrolled from the total number screened; (4) drop-out rates; (5) adverse reactions. 

To obtain estimates of intervention effects, we will compare changes in pain and shoulder-related disability scores between the two intervention groups (i.e. tailored and standardized rehabilitation) a repeated mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used. Group intervention (tailored and standardized rehabilitation) will be considered as between-subject factor, and time-point (baseline, 4th, 8th week and 12th week) will be considered as within-subject factor. Baseline measurements will be considered as covariates. We will conduct an independent mixed-model ANOVA for each outcome measure (i.e. pain levels and shoulder-related disability). Alpha will be set at 0.05, and power at 80% for all statistical analysis. Since this is a feasibility study, we will not adjust alpha for multiple comparisons. This will decrease the chance of Type II error, increasing the chance of identifying potentially important differences between groups. This statistical approach is considered appropriate for feasibility or exploratory studies.

The Bayesian method will be used to interpret findings from the feasibility trial, and determine whether or not it is worthwhile conducting the full trial. It is recommended that other confidence interval (CI) ranges should be used (e.g. 85% or 75%CI in addition to the mean difference and the respective 95%CI) when assessing differences between groups from feasibility trials.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two-arm, assessor-blinded, patient-blinded, randomized controlled feasibility trial. Twenty-four patients with shoulder subacromial pain will be recruited randomly allocated into the standardized or tailored rehabilitation group. Both groups will receive a total of 16 sessions over 8 weeks. Follow-up will occur at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after baseline. 

In this feasibility trial we aim to assess: (1) patients recruitment rate; how any percent of patients agree to participate, patients adherence to the rehabilitation program, and drop-out rates; (2) to obtain the estimates of adverse reactions to treatment; (3) to measure the estimates of intervention effects in order to inform the sample size of the fully-powered RCT.</summary>
