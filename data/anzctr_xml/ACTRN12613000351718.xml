  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manual acupuncture is provided by manual stimulation of the needle. Initial DeQi manually is obtained then manual stimulation at least once during the treatment session.
Electro acupuncture is using an ITOH ES-160 electro acupuncture machine. Initial DeQi is obtained manually then a 2/100Hz stimulation frequency is used. 

Arm 1: Manual acupuncture treatment delivered for 20-30 minutes once per week starting the week after menses and then once in the first two days of the menstrual period for three menstrual cycles 
Arm 2: Manual acupuncture treatment delivered for 20-30 minutes three times in the week prior to menses and then once in the first two days of the menstrual period for three menstrual cycles 
Arm 3: Electro acupuncture treatment delivered for 20-30 minutes once per week starting the week after menses and then once in the first two days of the menstrual period for three menstrual cycles 
Arm 4:  Electro acupuncture treatment delivered for 20-30 minutes  three times in the week prior to menses and then once in the first two days of the menstrual period for three menstrual cycles .

All treatments are determined based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis. A manualised protocol is used which allows selection from a number of suitable acupuncture points based on the TCM diagnosis.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain.  Each subject will keep a menstrual diary provided by the researcher. This will note the day of menses, average and maximum pain per day on an 11 point NRS with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Dysmenorrhea (PD) is the most common gynaecological complaint in menstruating women with over 75% of women suffering at some stage during their reproductive years. Common symptoms of PD are cramping lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache and lower back pain. Women who suffer from regular PD are more likely to have work or school absence as well as lower quality of life and increased risk of psychological and chronic pain related disorders. Pragmatic trials of acupuncture have shown a reduction in pain and an improvement in quality of life in women with PD. However to date there has been scant evidence for how changing the 'dosage' of acupuncture would affect the outcome in women with PD. 

The primary aim of this project is to examine the affect of changing frequency and type of stimulation on the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea. 

To achieve this a 4 group randomised controlled trial will be used. Women will be given individualised acupuncture treatments based on their group allocation; high frequency manual acupuncture, low frequency manual acupuncture, high frequency electro acupuncture and low frequency electro acupuncture. Treatment will be given for three menstrual cycles and the primary outcome is a reduction in peak menstrual pain. Participants in the trial will be invited to participate in an interview to share their experiences.</summary>
