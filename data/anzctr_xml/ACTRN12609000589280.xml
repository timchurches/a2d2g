    <concealment>Eligible patients will be recruited and registered onto the study at the radiotherapy (RT) planning stage. Informed and written consent will be obtained at the simulator after a staff member (data collection designate) has explained the study. Those patients randomised to the intervention arm will subsequently be contacted by telephone and asked to bring along a CD or tape of music that they would wish to listen to during their first RT session</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation to treatment will be balanced by gender, using the minimization technique. Allocation concealment occured through the the staff member, who recruited participants, contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was located in the statistics department</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is the first to investigate whether self selected music, played during the initial radiotherapy session, alters patients anxiety states. It uses a randomized, single centre, unblinded design with the outcome measure being the change in state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) state anxiety score from baseline to post radiotherapy. The study sample size has adequate power to detect a clinically meaningful difference in anxiety between the two treatment arms should treatment be effective. Qualitative data collected after participants' radiotherapy treatments will also elucidate subjective experiences amongst participants receiving radiotherapy with music or standard care radiotherapy.</summary>
