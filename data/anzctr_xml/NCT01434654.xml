  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non Neuro-HAART (low CNS penetrance) - Participants will be assessed based on their current Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART). A scoring system is utilised to determine if their current treatment has high Central Nervous System (CNS) penetrance or low CNS penetrance. This will determine which study cohort they are allocated to. No treatment adjustments or changes will be made, they will remain on their usual HAART regimen.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Neurocognitive Functioning - Change in overall neurocognitive performance, defined as a global neurocognitive z-score, after a 12-month period of observation, between HIV positive patients taking antiretroviral regimens categorized as being either of high or low CNS penetration. To derive this score, 1) raw scores obtained from a 5-domain brief neurocognitive battery were converted to age-corrected z-scores (M=0, Standard Deviation=1) and 2) the set of individual subtest z-scores were averaged to generate a single composite (global) z-score for each subject. Lower (negative) scores therefore indicate greater levels of cognitive impairment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change from baseline Neuropsychological testing at 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in MRS Cerebral Metabolite Ratios in Basal Ganglia - Change in major cerebral metabolites in the basal ganglia, as measured by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), after a 12 month period of observation. Spectra were acquired on a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with short echo time (TE). jMRUI/AMARES algorithm was used to process spectra. Metabolite ratios were calculated for the following metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mIo), in relation to internal water (H20) as standard.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in MRS Cerebral Metabolite Ratios in Frontal White Matter - Change in major cerebral metabolites in the frontal white matter, as measured by 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), between baseline and 12-months. Spectra were acquired on a Phillips Achieva 3T MRI scanner using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence with short TE. jMRUI/AMARES algorithm was used to process spectra. Metabolite ratios were calculated for the following metabolites: N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), myo-inositol (mIo), glutamate/glutamine complex (Glx), in relation to internal H20 as standard.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are at risk of brain related
      complications despite the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Such
      complications are termed HIV neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and comprise a spectrum from
      asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to
      severe HIV dementia (HAD).

      Prior to HAART approximately 30% of patients with advanced HIV disease had cognitive
      impairment; with HAART the incidence of HAND has decreased but its prevalence increased. The
      reasons for the ongoing development of cognitive impairment in HAART treated patients are not
      clear. They might relate to virus induced brain injury prior to starting HAART, the onset of
      a separate neurological process, toxicity related to HAART, or ongoing viral infection in the
      brain.

      It is clear that the ability of different antiretroviral drugs to penetrate the brain varies
      but what is not established is whether these differences between drugs lead to different
      neurological outcomes. The investigators propose to study HIV infected patients stable on
      HAART for 12 months; subdividing the groups according to the brain penetrance of their drug
      combination. Patients would undergo neuropsychological assessment and MRI brain scan at the
      start of the study and after 12 months.

      Differences in neuropsychological tests and MRI would be sought between treatment groups to
      establish whether HAART with better CNS penetration is associated with better outcome and
      fewer MRI changes.</summary>
