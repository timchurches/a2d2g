  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TAXUS ATLAS is a global, multi-center, single-arm, non-inferiority trial comparing results
      from patients treated with the TAXUS Liberté stent to an historical TAXUS Express control.
      The control group is a case-matched, blended population of TAXUS Express patients from the
      TAXUS IV and TAXUS V de novo clinical trials. The objective of the study is to evaluate
      clinical outcomes of TAXUS Liberté-SR stent in de novo lesions and to assess the
      non-inferiority of TAXUS Liberté versus TAXUS Express. The TAXUS Liberté-SR stent is
      hypothesized to have comparable safety and efficacy to the TAXUS Express stent.</summary>
