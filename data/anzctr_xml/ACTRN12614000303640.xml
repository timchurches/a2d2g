  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive 6 visits (approximately 1 hour each) of evidenced-based physiotherapy consisting of manual therapy and exercise delivered approximately weekly over 6 weeks. Manual therapy will consist of passive physiological and passive accessory mobilisation/manipulation at the discretion of the treating therapist. Exercise will consist of active range of motion, specific muscle training exercises for deep neck flexors and extensors, postural correction and graded muscle strengthening exercises for neck and upper limbs to the appropriate level for the patient.  The intervention group will also receive task-specific training, consisting of repetitive practice of specific functional tasks with kinematic correction from the treating therapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients with neck pain will receive 1 x 1 hour session per week for 6 weeks of physiotherapy consisting of manual therapy and exercise. The intervention group will also receive task-specific training as part of their treatment.
Healthy controls do not receive any intervention.</comparator>

    <concealment>Lead CI  (Snodgrass) will screen participants, enrol them into the study and remain blinded to group. Statistician (McElduff) will generate the randomisation sequence as described below, which will be given to the treating physiotherapist.</concealment>
    <sequence>Neck pain participants will be assigned through concealed allocation and independent randomisation using a random numbers generator to one of two groups: physiotherapy with task-specific training or physiotherapy alone. The Clinical Research Design, IT and Statistical Support (CReDITSS) unit within the Hunter Medical Research Institute will oversee randomisation. Participants will be randomly allocated to the two groups using a randomised block design stratified by age and gender. Group allocation will be created dynamically with block sizes varying randomly from 4 to 6 and the randomisation schedule will be delivered via secure web-based interface to ensure allocation is concealed.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study. Estimates of sample size were based on previous studies comparing cortical changes in patients with low back pain to healthy controls (e.g., Siddall et al. 2006, Anesth Analg 102: 1164-1168), and in studies evaluating cortical changes following intervention in low back pain (e.g., Seminowicz et al. 2011, J Neuroscience 31:7540-7550). Twenty patients with chronic neck pain will be recruited and randomised to the intervention and control groups (10 in each group). Ten age and gender healthy controls will be recruited for comparisons at baseline.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the research is to investigate brain and movement-related biomarkers associated with chronic neck pain, and determine if these can be used to increase the effectiveness of manual therapy and exercise treatment for neck pain. Patients with insidious-onset non-specific neck pain will be compared with healthy age and gender matched control participants at baseline to determine brain and movement-related biomarkers associated with neck pain. Neck pain participants will be randomised to receive 6 sessions of physiotherapy (manual therapy + exercise) with task-specific training or physiotherapy alone. Assessments will occur a baseline, post-treatment (7 weeks form baseline) and 6 months (26 weeks form baseline). Outcome measures are pain (VAS), kinematic biomarkers measured with 3-D motion analysis, cortical biomarkers measured with magnetic resonance imaging (structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy), and clinical measures including spinal stiffness, muscle performance on the deep neck flexor test, pressure pain threshold, cervical range of motion, Neck Disability Index, SF-12, Pain Impact questionnaire, and General Health Questionnaire-28. This pilot study will (1) determine potential cortical and kinematic biomarkers that can be used to develop targeted interventions for neck pain, and (2) determine if physiotherapy (with or without task-specific training) has effects on cortical and kinematic biomarkers and reduces pain. </summary>
