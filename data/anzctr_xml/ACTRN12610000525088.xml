    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential study participants or parent(s)/guardian(s) will be required to provide written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening procedures being performed. Approximately 60 participants will be randomised to the study. Twenty participants will be randomised to each age cohort. The three age cohorts are:
1. Cohort 1 (adult males aged 18-50 years);
2. Cohort 2 (children aged 3-8 years);
3. Cohort 3 (infants aged 6-8 weeks).
Within each age cohort, participants will be randomised to one of two treatment groups, RV3-BB Rotavirus Vaccine (at a dose of 8.3 x 106 FFU/ml) or Placebo in a ratio of 1:1. Allocation concealment was done by RCH pharmacy with over labeling of the study vaccine. RCH Pharmacy received the randomization code from Trident Clinical research. 
The study will proceed in three stages to ensure the safety of the participants. Commencing with Cohort 1, the 20 participants will be recruited and undergo study procedures. A safety review of the data for all 20 participants up to and including Day 28 will be conducted by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Assuming an acceptable safety profile is achieved at this time, the study will proceed to recruit the next age cohort. The procedure for the safety review between Cohorts 2 &amp; 3  will proceed as described for progression from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2.
The total study period for each participant will be 4-5 weeks, depending on the duration of the Screening Period. During the Treatment Period, Study Vaccine (RV3-BB Rotavirus Vaccine or Placebo) will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 0). A follow-up visit will be performed at Day 7 (Visit 3) and an Exit Evaluation will be performed at Day 28 (Visit 4).</concealment>
    <sequence>Within each age cohort, participants will be prospectively randomised to one of the two treatment groups (RV3-BB Rotavirus Vaccine or Placebo) in a 1:1 ratio, according to a randomisation schedule generated by the Trident Clinical Research Pty. Ltd. Sequence generation will be done by using a randomisation table created by a computer software (i.e., computerised sequence generation).A separate randomisation schedule will be generated for each age cohort, and will include additional blocks to accommodate replacement of participants in the event of incomplete vaccine administration.

The randomisation code will be kept on file by the Trident Clinical Reserch Pty. Ltd., a copy will be provided to and kept on file at the RCH Pharmacy and randomisation envelopes will be stored in the Study Files at MCRI/RCH in case of an emergency. The Study Monitor will not hold a copy of the randomisation code. 

At the time of Screening, each participant will, in chronological order, be allocated a unique participant Screening Number.

At the time of randomisation, the participant will be assigned a unique Randomisation Number. Both the Screening and Randomisation Numbers will be used to identify the participant throughout the study period and on all study-related documentation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of one oral dose of a human rotavirus vaccine, RV3-BB, in three successive age groups starting with adult men aged 18-50 years, progressing to children aged 3-8 years and then infants 6-8 weeks. Assessing rotavirus immunity, via serologic markers and faecal extracts, is a secondary objective.</summary>
