    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Avelumab

Other: Open-label - Avelumab - Single-arm open label study


Treatment: drugs: Avelumab
All participants will receive the following treatment:
Induction phase Avelumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 1hour intravenous (IV) infusion once every 2 weeks for 2 cycles Plus Rituximab at a dose of 375mg/m2 as an IV infusion over at least 1 hour once every 2 weeks for 2 treatments
Then:
RCHOP - All participants will receive RCHOP chemotherapy treatment for 6 cycles. Each cycle will last for 21 days. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine are given on the first day of each cycle by intravenous infusion. Prednisone is given orally from Day 1 until Day 5 of each cycle.
Then:
Maintenance phase - All participants will receive Avelumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg as a 1hour intravenous (IV) infusion once every 2 weeks for 6 cycles.
