    <interventions>Single arm prospective observationaI imaging biomarker study. 

Patients will have standard treatment, consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. There will be no change to the patient's treatment by participating in this study. Patients participating in this study will have multi-parametric MRI and PET/CT at the following 3 time-points: 
1. Prior to chemoradiotherapy
2. During the third week of chemoradiotherapy
3. Post chemoradiotherapy, within 1 week prior to surgery. 

A multi-parametric MRI incorporates standard morphological as well as diffusion weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced sequences.

The total follow-up duration will be 2 years from date of surgery.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of multi-parametric MRI (diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)) at 3 Tesla with surgical histopathology tumour regression grade (TRG). 

Histopathological assessment will be performed on surgical specimens. TRG assessment will be performed as per the modified classification of Ryan et al set out in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition as follows: 

TRG 0 (complete response) - no viable cancer cells
TRG 1 (moderate response) - single cells or small groups of cancer cells 
TRG 2 (minimal response) - residual cancer outgrown by fibrosis
TRG 3 (poor response) - minimal or no tumour kill; extensive residual cancer. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline pre-chemoradiotherapy, week 3 of chemoradiotherapy, and post-chemoradiotherapy (within 1 week prior to surgery) </timepoint>

      <outcome>Correlation of MRI and PET biomarkers with 2 year disease free survival. 

MRI and PET biomarkers are exploratory. Disease free survival will be assessed by 3 monthly clinical follow-up until total 2 years following date of surgery. Follow-up investigations, including CT scans and endoscopy will be performed as per clinician's discretion (as per standard care). </outcome>

    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to assess whether MRI (including MRI with contrast) and PET can predict response to treatment in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. 

'Who is it for?'
You may be eligible to join this study if you have been diagnosed with rectal cancer and are undergoing treatment consisting of chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. 

'Study details' 
Participants will have standard treatment, consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. There will be no change to treatment by participating in this study. Patients participating in this study will have multi-parametric MRI (diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)) and PET/CT at the following 3 time-points: 1. Prior to chemoradiotherapy 2. During the third week of chemoradiotherapy and 3. Post chemoradiotherapy, within 1 week prior to surgery. 

Patients will be followed up for 2 years. Correlations between MRI and PET biomarkers with tumour response and survival outcomes will determine whether multi-parametric MRI and PET can predict treatment response.
