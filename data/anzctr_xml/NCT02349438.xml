    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Higher Order Root Mean Square (HO RMS) - Near Target in Downgaze With Natural Blinking - Wavefront metric measured by COAS wavefront sensor while subject fixates a near digital device in a down-gaze position with natural blinking. The average HO RMS was reported for each lens. Lower values indicate better outcome.</outcome>

      <outcome>Higher Order Root Mean Square (HO RMS) - Near Target in Downgaze With Controlled Blink - Wavefront metric measured by COAS wavefront sensor while subject fixates a near digital device in a down-gaze position with controlled blinking.
