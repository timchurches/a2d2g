  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1 - Training programme: The training programme is a 30 to 40 minute interactive health communication presentation using various modalities such as observation, hands-on, demonstration and activities. The training is around key components of hearing protection, hearing science and best practice. In its basic form, it includes a 'booster' two months after training: this involves texting one key training message a day for 5 days. The evaluation timeline begins with one measure prior to training, then at one week, two months, and four months after intervention. In addition, we will briefly interview the employers and foreman/supervisor after four months to ask them if they have observed any behaviour change towards hearing protection in their workers.
Arm 2 - Training programme without 2-month booster: The evaluation timeline begins with one measure prior to training, then at one week, two months, and four months after intervention. In addition, we will briefly interview the employers and foreman/supervisor after four months to ask them if they have observed any behaviour change towards hearing protection in their workers.
Arm 3 - Training programme with booster + Class 5 active earmuffs: Active listening devices are electronic earmuffs powered by 2 AA batteries that allow for face to face communication without the need to remove earmuffs. Intervention 3 adds these to the basic training which includes booster. The evaluation timeline begins with one measure prior to training, then at one week, two months, and four months after intervention. In addition, we will briefly interview the employers and foreman/supervisor after four months to ask them if they have observed any behaviour change towards hearing protection in their workers.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the influence of 3 variants of training programmes on hearing protection use in manufacturing workers. The three variants of the training programme intervention are multi-level approaches to health promotion. We hypothesise that these multi-level interventions will improve knowledge, attitude and behaviour scales and increase supports to barrier ratio to hearing protection use. This will result in the overall improvement in hearing protection behaviour of workers.</summary>
