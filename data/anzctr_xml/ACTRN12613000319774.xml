    <interventions>60 pain-free subjects (18-65), voluntarily by poster / Curtin radio adverts
Separate study for menthol and capsaicin (30 subjects in each)

Menthol gel protocol:
Repeated measures design:
1.Microneedle pretreatment or dummy procedure will be applied to test area on forearm of the volunteer. Microneedle pretreatment involves pressing the microneedle array firmly onto the skin for a 10 second period. Microneedles have recently become commercially available, for example with the 3M MicrochannelTM Skin System (3M, St Paul, MN). This comprises an array of pyramidal-shaped needles approximately 700 micrometer in height with tip-to-tip needle spacing of approximately 500 micrometer that penetrate 100-150 micrometer into the epidermis. The microneedle pretreatment or dummy procedure will be applied to the skin with each volunteer receiving both treatment and dummy procedure over the two test days. Drug gel treatment will be the same on each test day. Dummy microneedles look the same as the microneedle array but the points of the needles have been blunted so that they do not penetrate the skin.
2.TiVi measurement of skin colour (erythema) will be recorded prior to and immediately after microneedle pretreatment
3.Two grams of 15% menthol in a hydroalcoholic gel will then be applied and occluded by a Tegaderm dressing for a total period of 15 minutes.
4.The gel will be wiped off the skin with a damp cloth and the area dried gently
5.TiVi measurements will be resumed for 15 min following removal of the gel.
The approximate duration of each session is 30 mins, washout period is 7 days.

The protocol above will be repeated for 2g of 0.025% capsaicin in a hydroalcoholic gel.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator treatment will involve a dummy microneedle application followed by either menthol gel or capsaicin gel. The dummy microneedles look identical to the microneedle array but the points of the needles have been blunted so that they do not penetrate the skin.

This will be pressed onto the skin with equal force to the real micro needles and for the same duration. The applicator will look similar.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>faster onset time of effect of the drug treatment due to the micro needle pretreatment of the skin</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to maximum effect measured by visual analogue scale and TiVi units of erythema. Visual analogue scale measurements will be recorded every minute and TiVi unit measurements are taken every 20 seconds over the 15 minute period the gel is on the skin. In addition TiVi measurements will be continued for 15 minutes after gel removal (30 minutes in total). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased effect of drug treatment due to microneedle pretreatment of the skin.
Visual analogue scale measurements will be recorded every minute and TiVi unit measurements are taken every 20 seconds over the 15 minute period the gel is on the skin. In addition TiVi measurements will be continued for 30 minutes after gel removal. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum effect measured by visual analogue scale and TiVi units of erythema.
Visual analogue scale measurements will be recorded every minute and TiVi unit measurements are taken every 20 seconds over the 15 minute period the gel is on the skin. In addition TiVi measurements will be continued for 15 minutes after gel removal. </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased blood flow in the area of application will be assessed by the TiVi system which uses a camera and image analysis of the redness on the skin surface. </outcome>
      <timepoint>TiVi unit measurements are taken every 20 seconds over the 15 minute period the gel is on the skin. In addition TiVi measurements will be continued for 15 minutes after gel removal. </timepoint>

      <outcome>Sensation is assessed by Visual Analogue scale by the volunteers during the drug treatment. Visual Analogue scale measures will be taken every minute during gel application.</outcome>

The previous topical menthol study suggested that the anti-acne drug Roaccutane may amplify response to menthol so is now also an exclusion criteria. Subjects forearm skin will be checked for redness or signs of reaction between applications and subjects allowed to withdraw from further test sessions if a significant skin irritation lasts longer than 2 hours (visual or sensory effect). Note that the gels will be applied under occlusion therefore risk of inhalation of menthol or capsaicin is reduced.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is investigating the sensations that people feel when different menthol or capsaicin gel is placed on their skin over a 15-minute time frame and whether the onset of these sensations occurs more quickly when the skin is pretreated with microneedles (tiny needles that push a very short distance into the skin). We hypothesise that the microneedles will increase permeation of the applied drugs across the skin giving faster and more intense sensations.</summary>
