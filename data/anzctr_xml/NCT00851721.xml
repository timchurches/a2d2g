      <outcome>Reduction in Annualized Bleeding Episode Rate (ABR) Among Participants Receiving Prophylactic Treatment as Compared to Those Treated On-demand - Participants were Randomized to Receive 1 of the 2 Following Treatment Regimens:
On-Demand: FEIBA NF dose &amp; dosing interval as prescribed by treating physician
Prophylaxis: 85 ± 15 U/kg of FEIBA NF every other day during 12-month prophylactic period
Annualized rate of bleeding episodes was calculated as:

      <outcome>Differences in Mean Transformed Annualized Bleeding Rate Between On-Demand and Prophylaxis Treatment Regimens by Bleeding Etiology, and Bleeding Type - Annualized bleed rates were transformed using the square root of the number of bleeding episodes observed (X bleeds/year), X' = v(X + 0.5). This transformation was performed to stabilize the variance and align the sample distribution with the assumption of normality inherent in using the t-test.
The difference in mean transformed ABRs was used to perform statistical tests and generate p-values at a significance level of 5%

      <outcome>Assessment of Objective Clinical Symptoms- Visual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain in Adolescents and Adults (=12 Years Old) - Pain caused by a bleeding episode in adolescents and adults (=12 years old) was measured at pre-infusion (pre-inf) and at 6 ± 0.5 hours (h) and 24 ± 1 h post-infusion (post-inf) (after the last infusion given to treat a bleeding episode) on the VAS pain scale in millimeters from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst possible pain). For analysis purposes, if short acting analgesics (duration of activity approximately 6 ± 0.5 h) were used, pain was assigned the highest possible score (100). Pain assessment occurred after each infusion related to single bleeding episodes. In case participants required an additional infusion within 24h, pain was assessed 6 ± 0.5 h and 24 ±1 h following the subsequent infusion.
Change in VAS scores at 6 ± 0.5 h and 24 ±1 h post-infusion were also compared relative to pre-infusion VAS scores (ie, (pre-infusion VAS score) - (post-infusion VAS score)).</outcome>

      <outcome>Hemophilia-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults (Haem-A-QoL) = 16 Years Old - The Haem-A-QoL instrument has been developed and used in Hemophilia A patients.

      <outcome>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) - General Pain Assessment Using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in Adults and Adolescents =12 Years Old - General pain was assessed using a VAS pain scale at screening, 6 months, and at termination. Unlike the VAS pain assessment for pain of bleeding episodes (Outcome above), this general pain assessment did not take use of analgesics into account. For the pain scale, a higher number indicates worse pain.
The visual analog scale ranges from 0 to 100 where the endpoints are labeled 'Worst imaginable health state' (=0) and 'Best imaginable health state' (=100). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.
Change in VAS scores at 6 months and study termination were also compared relative to Baseline/Screening scores (ie, (Baseline/Screening VAS score) - (VAS score at 6 months and study termination).</outcome>
