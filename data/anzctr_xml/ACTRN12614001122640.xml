  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single ascending dose study of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Capromorelin.
Three single ascending oral doses (20, 50 and 100 mg) at least one week apart administered to each of two groups (spinal cord injured and able-bodied).
Participants only progressed to a higher dose after successfully tolerating the prior dose at the lower level.

    <statisticalmethods>No power calculations were conducted. A target of n=10 per group was chosen as a reasonable number to start a preliminary study. Rationale being that it was expected to be achievable with the limited nature of the SCI population from which to draw participants and it was sufficient to provide simple comparative statistics. The number of participants per group was deliberately limited with consideration also given to the impact of the intensive blood sampling required for pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses were performed.
As were parametric statistical analyses for group comparison by analysis of variance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Capromorelin (CP424391) is a ghrelin receptor agonist which shows evidence of promoting defecation and may be of use in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients to promote bowel movements. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following single oral doses of 20, 50 and 100 mg of Capromorelin in SCI and in able-bodied participants.</summary>

    <publication>Aspects of this trial have been be presented as a poster/abstract at: Spinal Cord Injury Symposium, Medical Research Week Austin Health and ANZSCos scientific meetings in 2014.
Aspects of this trial have been submitted (on 24 July 2014) for publication in 'Spinal Cord' (Nature Publishing Group).

    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>This trial is now complete. The drug was found to be safe and well tolerated in both able-bodied and spinal cord injured participants. Additional trials on this and second generation compounds are now planned.</publicnotes>
