  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study has been designed to test how effectively and rapidly a number of new nicotine replacement treatments - nicotine oral pouch, mouthspray and lozenge - relieve the discomfort that people experience when they stop smoking (called withdrawal symptoms) compared to a currently available nicotine replacement product (nicotine gum) and a dummy (placebo) product (with no nicotine in it). These new products may deliver nicotine to the body faster than existing products, and it is thought that faster delivery of nicotine  may help reduce the discomfort that goes along with stopping smoking. The study will also ask about the level of satisfaction people experience after using the different products.</summary>
