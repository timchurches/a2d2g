  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thirty eligible elderly individuals who are new clients of Meals on Wheels (SA) and who agree to pay for the MOW service, will be randomly allocated to receive either:
Arm 1 - standard meal (Standard), or 
Arm 2 - high protein high energy (HEHP) meal.

The meals will all consist of a soup, main hot dish (i.e. meat/fish and vegetables, or casserole), and dessert which will be delivered at lunchtime.

The prescribed  'Standard' meal will provide 30 % of the target population's daily estimated requirements for energy and 50 % for protein. In addition, it will provide at least 30 % of all other nutrients. The prescribed macronutrient composition will be 2.5 MJ energy, 32 g of protein, 23 g fat 65 g carbohydrate.

The prescribed  'HEHP' meal will provide 65 % of the target population's daily estimated requirements for energy and 100 % for protein (daily estimated protein requirements are based on the current reccomendation of ~0.8-1 g per kg of body weight). The prescribed macronutrient composition will be 5 MJ energy, 65 g of protein, 65 g fat 99 g carbohydrate.

Each subject will be asked to consume their allocate meal type five days per week for 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3 (Control) - Fifteen eligible elderly individuals who have recently (i.e. within last 3 months) been referred to MOW but who declined to receive the MOW service will be offered a 'standard-care' management plan (i.e.  one-on-one nutritional education from a qualified dietitian for 60 min on a monthly basis for the duration of the study) to  assist them in meeting their estimated daily energy and protein requirements inorder to improve their nutritional status.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subject enrollment will be done over 2 phases:
1) Elderly persons who are newly referred to 'Meals On Wheels' (MOW) will be assessed by the MOW staff. If eligible to participate in the study, they will be invited to sign a Consent  form stating their desire to participate in the research.  Upon receipt, the MOW staff will notify the university research staff of interested subjects and contact details will be forwarded.  

2) The University research team will then send the interested person a 'Particpant information' package that describes the study in detail.  Within 1-2 weeks, a member of the research team will contact the person by telephone to make sure they have understood the Participant Information Sheet and consent to joining the study. Upon consenting to participate, subects will be given an unique study specific number and they will be randomly assigned to either Arm 1, or 2.  

Allocation of subjects to 'Arm 1' or 'Arm 2' will be done by a collaborator not involved in subject recruitment, or data collection and analysis. Sealed opaque envelopes will be used to conceal the treatment.  When the investigator repsonsible for screening, deems a subject as 'eligible' they will call the investigator responsible for 'allocatiion' to be told whether the subject is randomised to Arm 1 or 2.
The codes for Arm 1 and 2 will be released only after all data from the last recruited study has been entered.

Allocation of subjects to Arm 3 (the control group) cannot be randomised because that group will consist of elderly persons who meet the inclusion criteria and who wish to particpate in the study asssessments but do not want to be recipients of the  'MOW' service (i.e. Arm 3 is the CONTROL group who get 'standard-care' which is intensive nutiritional education of what they need to eat to improve their nutiritonal status).</concealment>
    <sequence>Free software “Research Randomiser” (Urbaniak, 2011), will be used to generate treatment allocation to individuals. The staff delivering meals and those performing the assessments will be blinded to the randomisation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 40 % of elderly persons in South Australia are 'at risk' or are malnourished, and health service providers such as 'Meals On Wheels' offer elderly persons in the community a service which delivers nutritional meals to to assist them to live at home in their community for as long as possible.  The broad aim of this pilot study is to compare the average amount of nutrients that elderly persons get from their 'Meals on Wheels' three course lunchtime meal to the amount of nutrients health professionals estimate you need for good health.  Specifically, we would like to find out:
1) whether or not you are able to eat all of the food that is delivered each day 
2) what things influence how much of the meal you eat 
3) what helps or hinders you from eating the full meal
and,
4) whether meals fortified with enough energy and protein to meet two-thirds of the an elderly persons estimated daily energy requirements and 100
% of their protein requirements are better than the current 'standard' MOW meal that aim to provide one-third of their energy and 50% of their protein needs, and if both meal types are indeed better than receiving no meal.</summary>
