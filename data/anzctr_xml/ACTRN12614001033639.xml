  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: patient controlled epidural analgesia
Mode of administration: Initial dose 10 ml; after 15 minutes from initial dose start of the background infusion 10 ml/h, bolus dose 2 ml, lockout interval 15 min.  
If necessary additional 5 ml bolus, by anesthesiologist.
The same combination of drugs (one of the possible arms) is used in all steps of analgesia for the same patient.
Duration: until baby delivery
Drugs: opioid (fentanyl 2mcg/ml) and local anesthetic (bupivacaine or levobupivacaine)
Possible concentrations of local anesthetic: 0.0625% (0.625 mg/ml), 0.1% (1 mg/ml), 0.125% (1.25 mg/ml)
Intervention arms are six: 
Arm 1 - bupivacaine 0.0625% (0.625 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml. 
Arm 2 - levobupivacaine 0.0625% (0.625 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml
Arm 3 - bupivacaine 0.1% (1 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml
Arm 4 - levobupivacaine 0.1% (1 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml
Arm 5 - bupivacaine 0.125% (1.25 mg/ml)+ fentanyl 2mcg/ml
Arm 6 - levobupivacaine 0.125% (1.25 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml
Initial dose is infused directly through epidural catheter; then the patient controlled epidural analgesia device is connected and all drugs are infused using it.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are no control group that receives no analgesia at all. The control groups are:
Arm 1 - bupivacaine 0.0625% (0.625 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml. 
Arm 3 - bupivacaine 0.1% (1 mg/ml)+fentanyl 2mcg/ml
Arm 5 - bupivacaine 0.125% (1.25 mg/ml)+ fentanyl 2mcg/ml</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power analysis revealed that we need to study 84 patients per group to detect a 25 % difference between total consumption of local anesthetic, with an a-error of 0.05 and beta-error of 0.8. As there are 6 groups we need to enroll 504 patients. 
 To compare quantitative variables with normal distribution  the one-way or two-way or repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) would be used as appropriate.
The normality of the distribution would be checked with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To compare the quantitative non Gaussian and categorical variables we would use Kruskal-Wallis test. 
Chi -square test would be used to test correlations between qualitative data. A post-hoc test would be applied using the Bonferroni method for adjusting for multiple comparisons.
Data would be presented as mean +/- standard deviation, % of group total or median with interquartile range, as appropriate.
p&lt;0.05 would be considered as statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of the study is to find the optimal, in terms of efficacy and safety, concentration of local anesthetic for Patient-controlled epidural labour pain analgesia. Our hypothesis is that the optimal concentration of local anesthetics for labour pain analgesia should be 0.1%, because we think that the concentration of 0.125% may cause a bigger motor block and lower patient satisfaction, and the pain reducing effect of concentration of 0.0625 % wold not always be satisfactory.
In order to assess the optimal concentration of local anesthetic we use the same drug concentration for initial epidural bolus and later for Patient-controlled epidural analgesia. The strict inclusion and exclusion criteria are chosen in order to purify the contingent. We also include only primiparas because the course of labour and the pattern of pain is different for primiparas and for multiparas.</summary>
