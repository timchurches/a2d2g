  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects in the intervention group will perform the multimodality balance training. This training incorporates multisensorial training and specific lower limb muscle strength training into a single balance training regime. Intensity of exercises will be modified according to the level of tolerance of subjects. The protocol for the multimodality balance training as follow:

A: Multisensorial training regime in multimodality balance training. 
	
Movements:

1)	Stand independently with feet close together. Frequency: Twice per week; Time: 20 secs; Intensity: Time increased 10 secs every week; Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed/soft surface.

2)	Alternately lift left and right leg during standing on firm surface. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed/soft surface.

3)	Touch an object on the floor while standing with feet apart. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed/soft surface with feet close together.

4)	Sidewalks forward, right and left alternately on firm surface. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed/soft surface.

6)	Walk ahead and make a sharp turn towards right/left. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed/soft surface.

7)	Walk ahead crossing over obstacles. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed on a soft surface and to increase the height and number of obstacles.

8)	Tandem walking. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed.

9)	Sit to stand and walk 10 meter forward. Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 10 reps (Increased by 10 reps every 6 week); Sets: 3-4; Progression: To be performed with eyes closed.


B: Specific lower limb training regime in multimodality balance training (with 3 minutes rest intervals between sets).

Movements:

1)	Ankle dorsiflexion. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 Repetition Maximum (RM). Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

2)	Ankle plantarflexion. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 RM. Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

3)	Knee extension. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 RM. Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

4)	Knee flexion. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 RM. Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

5)	Hip extension. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 RM. Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

6)	Hip flexion. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 RM. Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

7)	Hip abduction. Frequency: Twice per week; Repetitions/intensity: 8-10/ 70% of 1 RM. Sets: 3-4; Progression: 1RM to be reassessed biweekly.

In the intervention group, subjects will perform both multisensorial training and specific lower limb muscle strength training in a single 60 minutes training session, twice per week for 24 weeks. However, subjects may pause at any time during the training session if feeling tired, dizzy or shortness of breath.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in control group will perform the conventional balance training such as:

1) Step forward, backward, and sideways on the exercise step.

2) Step over blocks of various heights.

3) Stand up from a chair, walk four steps forward, perform a bilateral stool touch and walk backwards to the chair.

4) Stand up from a chair, walk four steps forward, turn to the right, step over the exercise step, turn to the right again and walk forward to the chair (repeat the exercise circuit in the opposite direction).

5) From a sitting position on a 65-cm Swiss ball, perform a range of motion and balance exercises (forward and backward roll of the arms; bend the trunk forward and side to side).

6) Perform a double-legged stance for 10 s.

7) Perform a tandem stance for 10 s.

8) Rise from a chair without the use of the arms. 

9) Walk forward and backward with a tandem walking pattern (toes of one foot touches the heel of the foot in front).

10) Perform a single legged stance for 10 s.

In the control group, subjects will engage in conventional balance training twice per week for 24 weeks. Each training session will be approximately 60 minutes in duration. However, subjects may pause at any time during the training session if feeling tired, dizzy or shortness of breath.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be conducted to determine the effects of a multimodality balance training for stroke survivors in order to improve the physical and psychological function when compared with conventional balance training. Forty-eight chronic stroke survivors who fulfil the inclusion criteria will be recruited from Physiotherapy Department of Hospital Sungai Buloh and Physiotherapy Department of Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Teknologi MARA. Subjects who consented would be randomized into a control or intervention group. Data collection will be done at baseline level, week 12 and week 24 by a blinded assessor. The primary outcome measure would include balance performances. Secondary outcome measure would be lower limb physical performance, lower limb muscle strength, mobility and dynamic balance, level of depression, activities of daily living and quality of life. It is hypothesized that a multimodality balance training may significantly improve the scores of these outcome measures. Thus, the result of this study will have a direct implication in term of cost effectiveness for stroke survivors and health care providers.</summary>
