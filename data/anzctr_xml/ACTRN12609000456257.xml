  <interventions>
    <interventions>(1) Cognitive Behavioural Threapy (CBT)only: 3 weeks of baseline (no intervention), followed by approximately 9 weekly sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and then a 9-week follow-up period, (2) Motivational Interviewing (MI) + Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): Up to 3 weekly sessions of motivational interviewing (MI) plus approximately 9  weekly sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy, followed by 9 weeks of follow-up period; and (3) treatment as usual. All treatment sessions will be held on a weekly basis wherever possible, and each session will be about 45-60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual - standard care/non-directive counselling: A form of counselling in which the therapist uses non-strategic reflective listening, i.e., the client is invited to talk about any subject they wish, not necessarily issues related to anxiety, depression or any aspect of their mental health. The direction of content is intentionally left for the client to 
determine. In other words, the therapist takes on a more passive role. The control group may receive weekly or fortnightly non-directive counselling sessions as part of their standard care (up to 12 weeks). Each session may be up to 60 minutes long. 
In other words, there is a waiting period of 12 weeks before the control group receive  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.</comparator>

    <sequence>Participants will be randomised on completion of the initial assessment. A stratified block randomisation procedure will be used to ensure that the three treatment groups are as similar as possible in terms of gender and treating psychologist. The randomisation will be computer generated. A researcher not connected with the intervention or assessment will undertake the randomisation sequence. To assist in portability of the randomisation schedule, a series of cards will be made with the randomised group, sealed in envelopes and marked in order including stratification.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are prone to experiencing psychological distress, especially anxiety and depression.  Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a promising treatment for anxiety disorders in people with TBI of the mild-moderate spectrum.  However, the effectiveness of CBT to treat anxiety disorders in those with moderate-severe TBI is still not well-understood, and this subgroup tends to have longer-lasting cognitive problems such as poor memory and problem solving.  Furthermore, there has been very limited research investigating ways of enhancing treatment response in those with moderate-severe TBI.  This presents significant challenges to treatment providers, as effective management of anxiety disorders inevitably involves a person to confront some entrenched patterns of fears and worries.  

The proposed study aims to examine the efficacy of an evidence-based CBT programme as a treatment of anxiety disorders for individuals with moderate-severe TBI.  The study will also examine the effects of a brief preparatory intervention on treatment engagement and response rate.  In addition, factors which influence participants treatment response and experience with therapy will be explored.  A number of questionnaires, designed to measure levels of anxiety, psychosocial and community reintegration, self-awareness, and beliefs about ones ability to control anxiety will be given to participants.  Participants level of cognitive functioning will also be assessed in order to examine the impact of cognitive problems on their potential to benefit from CBT.  The project is designed such that a control component is embedded in the form of treatment-as-usual wait list protocols.  This enables all participants to have access to the intervention while also ensuring high quality empirical evidence.  

Effective interventions are urgently required in order to prevent prolonged psychological distress and to improve the quality of life for individuals who have had sustained TBI.  This project is expected to contribute to our understanding of ways of assisting individuals to manage anxiety, hence improving their psychosocial functioning.</summary>
