  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who need temporary access for haemodialysis have a permcath inserted. When connecting the blood lines to the permcath for haemodialysis treatment 2 different methods can be used:
1.	Open procedure: 
2.	Needleless connector procedure:
This is a quality assurance project evaluating two methods of needleless connections for haemodialysis.
Each procedure will be used for one month, then cross-over to the other method (A washout period is not possible as a patient needs constant treatment so connection by one or other method will always be required). 
1. Open procedure: set up of a sterile field to connect the blood lines to the permcath.
2. Needleless procedure: use a a device called a BD Q-Syte to connect the blood lines to the permcath.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a cross -over study: patients will be randomised to either open procedure or needleless connector procedure and after one month cross over to the other procedure. Until recently the open procedure was more commonly used, however the hospital New Technology/Procedure Committee has now approved the use of BD Q-Syte so it is anticipated this will now become more common.</comparator>
