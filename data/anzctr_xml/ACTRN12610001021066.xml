  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Synbiotics + branched chain amino acids (BCAAs)
2. BCAAs + Placebo for Synbiotics
3. Placebo for BCAAs + Placebo for Synbiotics

1. Synbiotic 2000 Forte is packaged in 10g single dose sachets which contain: Natural and digestible fibres: * 2.5g oat bran; * 2.5g pectin; * 2.5g resistant starch; * 2.5g inulin. Probiotic bacteria: * Lactobacillus paracasei ssp paracasei 10 x 10¹¹; * Lactobacillus plantarum 10 x 10¹¹; * Leuconostoc mesenteroides 10 x 10¹¹; * Pediococcus pentosaceus10 x 10¹¹ (Medipharm). Dose is 1 sachet/day mixed with juice, jam or honey according to patient's tolerance. Duration of supplementation is 56 days. 
2. Branched Chain Amino Acid preparation - Hepatamine (Nutricia) which is a mixture of branched chain amino acids + sugars. Dose is 1 sachet at night mixed with 200ml lemonade, fruit juice. Duration of supplementation is 56 days."</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Placebo for Synbiotics is 10g crystalline starch packaged similarly to Synbiotic Forte

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of supplementation with Synbiotics and/or branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) on levels of hepatic encephalopathy
This is assessed using the Trail Making Tests A and B and the Inhibitory Control Test.
In addition, biochemical markers for liver function and inflammatory processes as well as changes in quality of life and nutritional responses to interventions will also be collated (CTP, MELD, TNF, IL-6, MAC, TSF, MAMC, food intakes, hospitalisations, depression and anxiety scores and LDSFQOL</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of Synbiotics and/or BCAAs on rates of infection - subacute bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in particular - this will be assessed by recording hospitalisations secondary to episodes of SBP Diagnosis of SBP will be made at culture and cell count analysis of ascitic fluid obtained routinely or in the presence of symptoms, and in the absence of surgically treatable intra-abdominal source of infection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of Synbiotics and/or BCAAs on proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6

5mls whole blood will be spun down and approx 2ml serum will be labelled and stored at -80 degrees celsius 

Aliquots of serum will be assayed for serum TNF and IL-6 using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a 96 well plate format according to instructions</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of Synbiotics and/or BCAAs onquality of life outcomes measured by liver disease short form quality of life (SFLDQOL) questionnaire and depression and anxiety score (DASS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of supplementation with Synbiotics and/or BCAAs on frequency of hospitalisation
Patients are reviewed prior to entry into the study and at 1 month after entry and at 2 months on completion of the study. The number of hospitalisations each month, the cause (s)of admission(s) and duration of admission (s) are documented at each time point</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of supplementation with Synbiotics and/or BCAAs on the severity of the patient's chronic liver disease using the Childs Pugh Score (CTP) and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of supplementation with Synbiotics and/or BCAAs on body composition and hand grip strength
Body composition is assessed by anthropometry - measurements of midarm circumference and triceps skinfold and calculated midarm muscle circumference 
Handgrip strength is measured using a dynamometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effects of supplementation with Synbiotics and/or BCAAs on appetite and oral intake
Appetite is a subjective assessment by the patient using a visual analogue scale
Oral intake is assessed using a 3 day food history recorded by the patient at each time point</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints at baseline, one month and 2 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
