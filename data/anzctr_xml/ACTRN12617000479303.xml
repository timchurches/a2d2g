  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective observational study with historical controls. It will be focusing on neonatal outcomes (e.g. serum bilirubin, duration of phototherapy, etc) after phototherapy has been commenced according to the guidelines introduced. 

In the new guideline, phototherapy threshold is as follows: initiated at 60umol/L at 0 hours. Thresholds increases in a straight line until it reaches the value at the 72 hour plateau from the UK NICE guidelines. The new guidelines were introduced as part of standard care delivered at the site. This project is a quality improvement trial. 

The prospective group will be observed from 17/03/17 to 17/09/17. The follow-up period for each participant will be until discharge. 

As the exposure is the new guidelines that have been established within the NICU, it will be delivered by the NICU staff. The decision to start phototherapy, duration and type is determined, as per standard practice, by the attending physician and their team. </interventions>
    <comparator>Historical control who were treated with the previous guidelines for phototherapy. The previous guidelines used were the UK NICE Guidelines [URL: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg98/.../treatment-threshold-graphs-544300525]. UK NICE phototherapy threshold line begins at 40umol/L at 0 hours until reaching plateau at 72 hours. The plateau varies by gestational age. 

The data will be collected from Royal Hospital for Women Powerchart and medical record files. This will include all neonates that match the criteria admitted from 01/01/16 to 31/12/16.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a time specific quality improvement project done as part of independent learning project and the anticipated number of infants during the 6 months of the study would be approximately 60. The historical controls will be all the patients matching the criteria from 2016. 

Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS (IBM Corp. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 24.0.0.0. Released 2017. Armonk, NY). Categorical outcome data will be presented as percentages with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Continuous data will be tested for homogeneity of variance using Levenes test. Non-parametric variables will be compared using either Mann-Whitney U-test.. Parametric variables will be compared using student t test. All p values will be two-sided and the significance level is set at &lt;0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine whether higher threshold for commencing phototherapy will worsen the rate of rise in bilirubin in the first 72 hours of life in newborns born &lt;32 weeks gestational age.
We hypothesise that the higher threshold for phototherapy will result in similar trends in bilirubin levels, duration of phototherapy and number of infants reaching bilirubin levels &lt;25umol/L below exchange threshold in both groups. </summary>
