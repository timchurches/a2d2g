    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 16 has 80% power, alpha 5%, to detect a difference of 0.75 standard deviations, and a sample size of 32 of about 0.5 standard deviations, for continuous variables. A sample size of 16 (in each group) gives good precision for estimation of variance.
Our experience is that periostin and Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) have highly skew distributions and are likely to need analysis on the logarithm transformed scale. The main analysis will be by paired t-tests. For variables needing a logarithm transformation this is interpreted as the ratio of means when back transformed. A linear mixed model will be used to compare the difference between the paired measurements by normal and asthma groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) gene expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states, including asthma. As yet an incomplete picture is currently available on the role and effects of periostin level in the blood, however it has shown promise as a biomarker for asthma severity and a marker of inflammation levels, being easy to measure through a simple blood test. This study of the sample time variation of periostin in patients with stable asthma compared with patients without asthma would provide further information on the production of periostin and whether sampling time affects the level of periostin measured in the blood, and if there is a difference between the general population and asthmatics in this regard.
This study is part of a programme of research being undertaken by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, aimed at furthering knowledge of periostin, in order to discover its clinical usefulness.
