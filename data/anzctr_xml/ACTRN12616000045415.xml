  <interventions>
    <interventions>Continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVHF) using a new predilution haemofiltration solution containing 15mmol/L of trisodium citrate as the anticoagulant.

CVVHF is conducted routinely in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) when patients with critical illness require kidney support. The treatment regime lasts, on average, about five days though there is considerable variation in length of treatment. The patients are usually simultaneously undergoing some type of ventilatory support.

Blood samples are routinely taken on at least a daily basis whilst the patients are receiving CVVHF. 

The occurrence of adverse events is monitored and if noted, dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will use the standard 18mmol/L trisodium citrate haemofiltration solution as predilution during continuous veno-venous haemofiltration.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The difference in standard base excess between the two groups being studied.

    <statisticalmethods>A previous retrospective audit had identified a rise in SBE to approximately 7.0meq/L (SD 3.5meq/L) by day 5 in patients receiving CVVHF using C18 anticoagulation compared to a mean rise to 3.5meq/L (SD 3.5meq/L) in patients receiving CVVHF using non-citrate anticoagulation (heparin). Assuming a power of 0.80, a level of significance of 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate in a two-sided experiment, gave a total of 2x25 (50) patients required to detect a difference in SBE between the groups of 3.5meq/L.

Continuous parametric data were compared using the Student t-test and reported as mean and standard deviation (SD). Non-parametric data were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and reported as median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical and proportionate data were compared using a chi-square test for proportions. Where required, normality was checked using a Shapiro-Wilk test.
 
A longitudinal and correlated regression analysis was performed where time based repeated measures were encountered.

Time to event data were modelled using Cox regression whilst factors specifically influencing mortality were modelled using logistic regression. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to examine the association between the citrate concentration in haemofiltration fluid and the resulting Standard Base Excess (SBE) after several days of CVVHF. 

We expect to confirm that performing CVVHF using a relatively high citrate concentration HF (18.0mmol/l) results in an elevation of SBE. We expect to show that using a lower citrate concentration HF (15.0mmol/l) results in much less elevation of SBE.

We also expect to show that use of the lower citrate concentration HF results in an acceptable filter life.
