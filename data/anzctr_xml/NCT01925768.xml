    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Apremilast 30 mg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Apremilast 30 mg - 30 mg Apremilast tablets administered twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks during the double-blind placebo-controlled phase; followed by 30 mg Apremilast BID for 28 weeks of active treatment phase (up to the 52 week visit); original treatment assignments remain blinded until all participants have completed their 52 week visit or have discontinued. After the Wk 52 visit, all participants in the extension phase will continue to receive treatment with apremilast 30 mg BID until the end of the study (ie, up to Week 104 visit) or until early discontinuation from the trial.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Oral placebo BID during the placebo controlled phase weeks 0 to 24; placebo treated participants whose improvement is &lt;10% in both swollen and tender joint counts at Week 16 are eligible for early escape (based on the measure of clinical benefit from their current treatment as evidenced by improvement (or lack of improvement) in 1) the physician (evaluator's) global assessment (EGA), 2) patients pain (pain NRS), 3) the patient global assessments (PGA), and 4) the health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI); Placebo-treated patients who early escape are transitioned to apremilast 30 mg PO BID during the active treatment phase up to their Week 52 visit; all those who complete the 52-week treatment phase will enter an open-label extension phase for an additional 52 weeks or until early discontinuation from the trial.


Treatment: drugs: Apremilast 30 mg
30mg of Apremilast will be orally administered twice daily for 104 weeks

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Identically appearing Placebo tablets will be orally administered twice daily for up to 24 weeks

Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A higher score indicates worse physical functioning, and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
