  <interventions>
    <interventions>Tualang honey supplementation 20 g daily orally for 12 weeks.
Honey is in liquid form packed in a sachet (20 g per sachet).
Honey must be taken alone before meal in the morning. 
Participants are required to return the empty sachet to ensure or monitor compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Phase 1: Healthy non smoker (without honey).
To compare all the baseline parameters (oxidative stress status, inflammation, lipid profiles) between non-smokers and smokers.
Phase 2: Smoker with no treatment (without honey)
To assess the parameters (oxidative stress status, inflammation, lipid profiles) in smoker without honey and smoker with honey after 12 weeks of the study. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation for each group was calculated using Power and Sample Size Calculation Software version 3.0.10. for all parameters with a power of 80% and statistical significance of 0.05. Considering the nonresponse rate of 20%, 36 subjects were recruited for each arm of the study. However, the final number of subjects for each arm was 32 for each arm after excluding the dropped out subjects.
The data were analysed using SPSS version PASW20.
Phase 1: Data were analysed using Independent t-test to compare the difference of baseline or pre-intervention parameters between non-smokers and smokers.
Phase 2: The baseline and changes of parameters after 12 week intervention period in each smoker group (smokers without honey and smokers with honey groups) were analysed by paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for normal and non-normal distributed data, respectively. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Elevated oxidative stress, inflammation and alteration in lipid profiles in smokers have been proposed as among the major factors that contribute to the development of smoking-related cardiovascular disease. However, the possible beneficial effect of Tualang honey that has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antilipid properties among smokers has yet been reported. The aims of this study, therefore, to determine the effects of Tualang Honey supplementation on oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers and lipid profiles in chronic smokers.</summary>
