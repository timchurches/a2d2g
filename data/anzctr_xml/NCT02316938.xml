  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Everolimus and reduced CNI
Treatment: drugs - Calcineurin Inhibitor and MPA

Experimental: Everolimus - Treatment not given as part of this substudy, it is given as part of the core CRAD001A2433 study.

Active Comparator: MPA and standard CNI - Treatment not given as part of this substudy, it is given as part of the core CRAD001A2433 study.


Treatment: drugs: Everolimus and reduced CNI
MTORi inhibitor, given as part of the core CRAD001A2433 study.

Treatment: drugs: Calcineurin Inhibitor and MPA
Will either be cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Used as standard of care in this patient population, but at a lower dose in the everolimus arm and at a standard dose in the comparator arm. Treatment given as part of the core CRAD001A2433 stud.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Structural kidney damage - Kidney allograft biopsies will be taken at baseline, months 2, 12 and 24 to assess the structural kidney damage using the BANFF 2013 criteria.
Development of structral allograft damage (Banff classification) over 24 months will be compared between treatment groups using modelling techniques that take into account the repeated measures, nature of the data and all available data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to month 24.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of de novo Donor specific antibodies formation - Serum blood samples analysed to assess presence and evolution of anti HLA donor specific antibodies.
The number and percentage of patients with anti HLA and donor specific antibodies at each study visit will be presented using a generalised linear mixed model framework as well as a Kaplan-Meier curve to portray the change over time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to month 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Impaired glucose tolerance and new onset diabetes - Subjects' diabetes status is collected at baseline as part of medical history. At month 2, serum blood test taken pre glucose drink and 2 hours post glucose drink. Subjets classified based on the level of glucose as: No diabetes (fasting plasma glucose &lt;6.1mmol/L or 2 hour OGTT &lt;7.8mmol/L) Prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9mmol/L or 2hr OGTT 7.8-11mmol/L) Diabetes (fasting plasma glucose &gt;/= 7.0mmol/L or 2hr OGTT &gt;/= 11.1mmol/L) Shift tables will present the change in diabetes status between baseline and month 2. The odds of becoming diabetic by month 2 (new onset diabetes) will be compared using a generalised linear model, in particular logisitc regression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation between HbA1c and oral glucose tolerance test - Serum blood samples are taken pre and post glucose drink at month 2. Results are produced for plasma glucose levels and HbA1c in mmol/L. Correlation between the results will be investigated using a generalised linear model.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Development of biochemical markers of viral infections - Blood samples are analysed at baseline months 2, 12 and 24. The following viral loads are measured in copies per ml: CMV (Cytomegalo virus) via PCR BK viremia via RT-PCR EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) via PCR Descriptive staistics will be presented for the viral load of each of the biochemical markers at each timepoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline - month 24</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CRAD001AAU13 is a substudy of CRAD001A2433. The core study CRAD001A2433 is a 2-year,
      randomized, multicenter, open-label, 2-arm study evaluating graft function with everolimus
      and reduced CNI versus MPA and standard CNI in adult de novo renal transplant recipients.
      Patients in this study may use cyclosporine or tacrolimus as the CNI.</summary>
