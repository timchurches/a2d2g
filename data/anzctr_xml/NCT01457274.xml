  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Sedation depth

Experimental: "light" sedation - In this study the depth of sedation will be guided by the Bispectral Index monitor (BIS monitor). A BIS value of 70-80 will be targeted in the "light" sedation arm.

Active Comparator: "deep" sedation - In this study the "deep" sedation arm will have a BIS value of less than 60 targeted.


Other interventions: Sedation depth
The intervention is the depth of sedation targeted in this study.
Patients enrolled in this study will be sedated with the same medications (fentanyl bolus and propofol target controlled infusion), and at the same starting doses, in each study arm. However, the depth of sedation targeted will differ between the arms, and this depth will be guided by the BIS monitor.
It is expected that those patients randomised to "deep" sedation will require a higher dose of sedative medication to achieve their target BIS value (&lt;60) than those in the "light" sedation group (BIS 70-80).

      <outcome>Recall of procedure - Upon rousing patients will be asked if they remember anything between the commencement of sedation and when they awoke from sedation</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications - The treating anaesthetist will record if any of the following complications occur during the sedation for colonoscopy.
Hypoxia
Airway obstruction
Hypotension
Bradycardia
Agitation</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Speed and quality of recovery - Time from starting sedation until opening eyes in the post anaesthesia care unit, and time until readiness for hospital discharge will be recorded.
Cognitive function at hospital discharge, compared to pre-procedure function, will be assessed by the CogState(TM) test battery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day. Day of procedure only. Measured before discharge from hospital</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction - Proceduralist and anaesthetist satisfaction with the sedation will be recorded at the end of the procedure.
Patient satisfaction with their anaesthesia care will be assessed at the time they are ready for hospital discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 day. Day of procedure only. Measured before discharge from hospital</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dreaming - Upon rousing in the post anaesthesia care unit patients will be asked the modified Brice questionnaire ("What is the last thing you remember before you went to sleep?", "What is the first thing you remember when you woke up?", "Did you remember anything in between?", and "Did you have any dreams?").
Dreaming will be assessed by the response to quesion 4.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this trial, patients undergoing elective colonoscopy under sedation will be randomised to
      BIS-guided sedation targeting either "light" (bispectral index [BIS] 70-80) or "deep"
      (BIS&lt;60) sedation. Sedation will be achieved with a standardised regimen of target-controlled
      infusion of propofol and fentanyl bolus. The primary end point will be the incidence of
      procedure recall in each group - this will be assessed at the conclusion of the procedure.
      The procedural conditions, cardio-respiratory complications and recovery including cognitive
      function will be assessed during and immediately after the procedure. The incidence of
      dreaming and patient satisfaction with anaesthesia care will be recorded immediately after
      the procedure. The study will be complete when the patient leaves the hospital on the day of
      the procedure.</summary>
