  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ADVICE is a randomised, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The purpose of
      the ADVICE study is to compare the safety and efficacy of vorapaxar in reducing d-dimer
      expression and markers of cellular immune activation over a period of 12 weeks among people
      with HIV infection who are successfully treated with combination antiretroviral therapy
      containing an HIV integrase inhibitor. A secondary objective of the study will be to
      demonstrate that following cessation of vorapaxar in patients with well controlled HIV
      replication there will be an increase in the levels of d-dimer over a 6 week period. 60
      participants from 4 clinical sites in Australia and the USA will be recruited and followed
      for a minimum of 18 weeks.</summary>
