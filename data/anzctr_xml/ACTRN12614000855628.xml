  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a phase one clinical trial.
Each participant will attend 3 sessions per week for 3 weeks during the baseline and treatment phase. Follow up sessions will be conducted once a week for 3 weeks following the end of the treatment phase. This is a total of 21 sessions. 

Mode of administration:
1) Baseline phase: 3 x 50 minute individual sessions per week for 3 weeks. All sessions will be administered by speech pathology students supervised by a qualified speech pathologist. 

2) Treatment phase: 2 x 50 minute individual sessions per week, plus 1 x 50 minute group session per week for 3 weeks (total of 9 sessions). All sessions will be administered by speech pathology students supervised by a qualified speech pathologist. 

3) Follow up phase: 1 x 50 minute individual sessions per week for 3 weeks. All sessions will be administered by speech pathology students supervised by a qualified speech pathologist. 

Treatment method:
Treatment for articulation (target sounds selection) will be dependent on participants assessment results and the intervention approach will be based on Principles of Motor Learning (Maas, Robin, Hula et al, 2008). Prosody training will focus on lexical stress. The treatment program will use Perfect Pronunciation (Kimble-Fry, 2012) as a guide for articulation and prosody production. Treatment will be in 2 phases: pre-practice and practice phase. Goal criterion is 90% accuracy. Participants will be provided with target words practice at word and sentence level. Data of target words production will be recorded. Once the participant is able to achieve 90% accuracy in the pre-practice phase, she/he will continue to the practice phase.

3) Interrater reliability checks will be conducted each week of treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Speech pathology students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who are at-risk of failure or have failed clinical placements are often identified with communication difficulties. This is an exploratory study that aims to investigate the effectiveness of an intensive pronunciation program on overall speech intelligibility and acceptability of students communication skills. It involves comprehensive assessments and an intensive 3-week intervention program focussing on speech sound articulation and prosody. This phase I pilot study will use a single-case experimental design. Treatment outcomes will be measured.</summary>
