Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints also.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Subjects will be grouped together (n=8) in each dose cohort for safety and pharmacokinetic analyses. Analysis of relationships between dose, plasma selenium concentration and changes in pharmacodynamic markers in the different groups will be conducted using repeated measures analysis of variance methods or linear mixed modelling methods. Fishers exact test will be used to compare frequency of adverse events.

    <summary>
Selenium is a trace mineral commonly taken by people hoping to prevent or treat cancer. However certain types of selenium could be harmful, especially at the high doses that show promise in reducing side effects of radiotherapy or chemotherapy without reducing their effectiveness. It is important to know which form of selenium can be most safely used at higher doses and have the best effect. In this clinical research study we will compare the effects of three different types of selenium in people with cancer or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, looking at their safety and beneficial effects on the cancer.</summary>
