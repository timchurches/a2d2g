  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Subject must provide written informed consent prior to the conduct of any
             study-related procedures.

             history of opioid use disorder currently being treated with SL BPN.

               -  Voluntarily seeking treatment for opioid use disorder (not currently on BPN
                  treatment for at least last 60 days but seeking BPN treatment), or;

          2. Current diagnosis of chronic pain requiring opioids for treatment.

          3. Current DSM-V diagnosis for moderate to severe substance use disorder (including

             as based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) ("Yes" responses to

             P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) such as some azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide
             antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin), or protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir,
             indinavir, and saquinavir).

             X the upper limit of normal, or creatinine = 1.5 X upper limit of normal on the
             Screening laboratory assessments, or other clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities, which in the opinion of the Investigator may prevent the subject from
             safely participating in study.

         12. Participants with a history of risk factors of Torsades de Pointes (e.g., heart
             failure, hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) or an ECG demonstrating a
             Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) &gt;450 msec in males and QTcF &gt; 470 in females

         13. Significant symptoms, medical conditions, or other circumstances which, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, would preclude compliance with the protocol, adequate cooperation
             in the study or obtaining informed consent, or may prevent the subject from safely
             participating in study. This includes, but is not limited to, subjects with attention
             deficit hyperactivity disorder receiving central stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate or
             other central stimulants), as well as subjects with severe respiratory insufficiency,
             respiratory depression, airway obstruction, gastrointestinal motility disorders,

             proposed trial or other studies under the direction of the Investigator or trial site,
             or is a family member of an employee or of the Investigator.</exclusivecriteria>
