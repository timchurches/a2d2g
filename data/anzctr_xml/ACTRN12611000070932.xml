  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intravenous unfractionated heparin 10 units per kilogram per hour started &lt;12hours after central venous catheter insertion and continued while the catheter is in place.

Route of insertion (femoral or internal jugular) is at the physician's discretion.</interventions>

    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Prevention</interventioncode>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any thrombus, diagnosed by ultrasound (including echocardiography), in the vein into which the central venous catheter has been inserted.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ultrasounds will be done between 24-72 hours of enrolment, weekly thereafter, and within 4 days of catheter removal. These latter may be the same: eg if a catheter is removed on day 6, the second, and final, ultrsound could be done between days 6-9. The final ultrasound is at day 28 if no clot has been found and the catheter is still in place.
Additional ultrasounds may be done at the treating team's discretion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinically-apparent thrombosis at any time during the time the catheter is present.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be examined daily by a blinded doctor.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Catheter-related bloodstream infection</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any time the catheter is in place and 48 hours after its removal</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>CVCs inserted surgically e.g. Brouviac or Hickman CVCs or subcutaneous ports.
Percutaneously central catheters (PICC) inserted via a peripheral vein.
Subclavian CVCs
Patients with a known thrombophilia, coagulopathy (APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time)&gt;50 s for &gt;30 days old, &gt;55 s for =30 days old ) or receiving anticoagulant medication, other than low dose heparin. For intravenous heparin, low dose means = 3 U/kg/hour, used to maintain CVC patency.
Patients with a platelet count of &lt;50 000 x 109 /L
Patients who have known central vein thrombosis in the affected vein.
Patients who have already participated in the study. The unit of randomisation is patient, not catheter.
Patients with a known allergy to heparin, or with a past history of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We plan to test the hypothesis that, in children with central lines admitted to intensive care, intravenous (through a drip) heparin at a low dose prevents clots developing around the central line, compared to saline, an inactive placebo. Clots will be sought using ultrasound.</summary>
