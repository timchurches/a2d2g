  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims: Determine how, in people with neck pain, segmental spinal mobility changes following manual therapy.
Background: Little is known about the specific mechanisms underlying neck pain, the subsequent limitation of movement, or the mechanisms of manual therapy interventions. There has been an international focus on improving the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of spinal pain and on the pathophysiological effects of treatment to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost and disability associated with spinal pain. One way of accessing this problem is to investigate what aspects of the person's condition changes when they improve following an intervention. Recently, methods involving computed tomography (CT) and fluoroscopy have become available that will allow such investigations to occur. 
Experimental procedure: Participants will be required to:
(i) Undergo a standard physiotherapy assessment which includes taking a patient history and conducting a physical examination to ensure the patient is suitable for manual therapy treatment and that they have a limitation of
rotation of at least 10 degrees. (ii) Attend Allamanda Private Hospital or a local radiology facility for assessment  and treatment. Here one CT of the cervical spine and fluoroscopic examination will be performed.
(iii) Following the CT and fluoroscopy, pain and range of rotation will be measured. One therapist will perform a palpation assessment. One segment considered to be contributing to the patients symptoms will be marked by taping a 0.8mm diameter sphere that will be visible on the
fluoroscopic images. A second therapist will apply a manual therapy treatment for up to 4 mins to the segment selected. The treatment will be repeated until there is an increase of greater than 10 degrees in rotation or up to a
maximum of 8 mins, whichever comes first. A second fluoroscopic examination will then be conducted.</summary>
