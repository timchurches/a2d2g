  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is listening to music of the participant's choice for 30 minutes prior to surgery, using headphones and CD player.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group receives routine care. That is, during thier wait for day surgery they either sit in chairs or lie on beds and are able to read and/or watch the television in one of the waiting areas.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Day surgery patients who listen to music during their preoperative wait will have statistically significantly lower levels of anxiety than patients who do not listen to music (placebo and usual care control group).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants in the study had levels of anxiety measure pre and post the 30 minute treatment arms. In the intervention group, listened to their choice of music for 30 minutes, the placebo group wore the headphones but received no music for 30 minutes and the control group received routine care only 30 minutes prior to surgery. Anxiety measured for all groups to compare anxietry levels using the State-Strait Anxiety Inventory- Form Y-1, State portion. anxiety .</timepoint>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomization were blocked to ensure equal numbers of participants assigned to intervention, placebo or control groups by gender.  Males and females were randomized separately to ensure equal number in each group. A biostatistician and a research assistant not associated to data collection conducted the randomization procedures and prepared sequentially numbered sealed envelopes containing the randomized assignment of consenting patients.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random order generation using a computer generated program.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The control group will allow the nurse (assessor) collecting outcome data to be blinded to group allocation, thus limiting the potential for detection bias. Because control group wore earphones with no music, those giving care were also blinded to treatment.</designfeatures>
