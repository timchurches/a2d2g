  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be invited to participate in a web-based intervention for cannabis use.  The treatment will consist of a 6-module website teaching cognitive behavioural therapy, which involves learning ways of coping with desires to use cannabis, how to recognise and avoid high-risk situations for cannabis use, and how to plan alternative ways of coping with situations in which the participant usually uses cannabis. The study runs for six weeks, with a three-month follow-up.  We recommend that the participant completes one module per week, although he or she is free to complete the modules at a faster pace.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment consists of six modules of web-based education relating to cannabis use. The information in the modules is intended as a placebo, and is unlikely to spur users to quit, e.g., cannabis in the workplace, cannabis and driving.  The modules do not contain anything aimed at building the readers skills or changing his or her attitude toward using cannabis. We recommend that the participant completes one module per week, although he or she is free to complete the modules at a faster pace.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in frequency and quantity of cannabis used following the intervention. This will be assessed by self-report, using a 30-day Timeline Followback, where the participant fills out the number of joints/cones consumed during the previous 30 days on a calendar.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post intevention: 6 weeks; Follow-up: 3 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in symptoms of cannabis dependence.  This will be assessed using two self-report questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post intevention: 6 weeks; Follow-up: 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in symptoms of cannabis abuse. The participant will complete a self-report questionnaire addressing problematic cannabis use, e.g., cannabis use leading to dangerous situations, getting in trouble with the law as a result of using cannabis.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a new web-based treatment for cannabis use.  The research hypothesis predicts that, relative to a placebo control group, individuals who receive the intervention will report greater reductions in their cannabis use, and in symptoms of cannabis abuse and dependence.</summary>
