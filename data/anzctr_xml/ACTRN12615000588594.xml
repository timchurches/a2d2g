  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study proposes to determine the factors surrounding peripheral intravenous cannula (PIVC) insertion to identify best practices to promote first-time insertion success, and reduce repeat PIVC insertion for patients admitted to the hospital wards. 
A prospective observational study of clinicians performing PIVC insertion in a patient population presenting to ED, with follow-up of any subsequent admissions to hospital wards. Observations include the insertion of PIVC in ED. Patients who are admitted  with the observed ED PIVC will be followed up and observed daily until the ED PIVC is removed. All observations and questions we propose are underpinned by scientific literature and have undergone face and content validity indexing. </interventions>

All patients &gt;18 years will be approached. We will attempt to observe all patient types and as such a waiver of consent has been granted. However, patients with the capacity to understand what the researchers are doing will be verbally informed as to what we intend to observe. Family members present with patients who do not have the capacity to understand will also be informed. If either the patient or family members advocating on behalf of a patient decline to have a PIVC procedure observed, they will not be coerced into taking part.  </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Our pilot study resulted in a successful first attempt rate of
approximately 86%. Using the guidelines suggested in Peduzzi et al [1], with a sample size of 1000, we would have sufficient numbers to allow us to adequately investigate using multivariate logistic regression approximately 10 variables. 
Univariate and multivariate/able logistic regression will be used to determine those variables that are predictors of first time insertion success. Univariate analysis will be conducted initially and factors that are significant at the 0.1 level entered into a multiple regression model. A significance level of 5% will be used to determine statistically significant predictors. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be provided for a final model. Diagnostic measures will be calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves constructed, with the area under the curve (AUROC) calculated to quantify the overall prognostic discrimination for first-time insertion success. Analyses for secondary aims will include Cox proportional hazards models and will include; Time zero (T0):IV insertion, Time of event (T1): PIVC failure, Time censored (T2): PIVC removal or transfer to other hospital. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will identify the survival time of ED inserted PIVC.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripheral intravenous cannula (PIVC) insertion is the one of the most common clinical interventions performed in the Emergency Department (ED) worldwide. Improving the first time insertion success rate and dwell time of PIVCs inserted in EDs can prevent repeat needle insertions. A number of factors have been identified as predictors of insertion failure and premature device failure. However, none have focused on the patient's journey with PIVC from ED to hospital admission. 
Purpose:  This study proposes to determine the predictors of first time PIVC insertion success in ED and risk factors for  PIVC failure for ED patients admitted to the hospital wards. 
Methods: A prospective observational cohort study of PIVC insertions in a patient population presenting to ED, with follow-up of subsequent admissions to hospital wards. Data in relation to clinician and patient risk factors will be collected from medical records and observations, as well as device information. Multivariable regression analyses will be sued to identify factors associated with insertions success and PIVC failure 
Results: The projected sample size n=1000 PIVC insertions will provide sufficient power to determine the association between risk factors and first-time insertion success and premature device failure. 
Conclusion: This study will provide new evidence to improve insertion success rates in ED and identify strategies to reduce premature device failure for patients admitted to hospital wards with PIVC.
