  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Percutaneous Single Port Access Paragastric Implant Placement Procedure is a novel approach to the treatment of morbid obesity.  The saline-filled Paragastric Implant is placed in a minimally invasive fashion into the abdominal cavity in the space adjacent the stomach, thereby reducing the ability of the stomach to expand and reducing oral intake.  The Paragastric Implant volume can be adjusted by the addition or removal of sterile saline through a subcutaneous port.

This trial is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center study designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Vibrynt Paragastric Implant System in the treatment of morbid obesity.  The primary end point of this study will be the six-month efficacy rate, as measured by the average percent excess weight loss for patients treated with the Vibrynt Paragastric Implant System.  Patients will be followed for three years for long term safety and efficacy evaluations.</summary>
