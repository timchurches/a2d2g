  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-part study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally administered ALS-002158 in healthy volunteers
      (HV) and subjects with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 infection.

      Part 1 will assess single ascending dosing pharmacokinetics and safety in HV. Part 2 will
      assess food effects on pharmacokinetics in HV.

      Part 3 will assess multiple ascending dosing pharmacokinetics and safety in subjects with CHC
      genotype 1 infection.</summary>
