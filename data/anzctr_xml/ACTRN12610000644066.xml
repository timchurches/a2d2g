  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) - frequency of 80 Hz, pulse duration of 100 microseconds and intensity adjusted by the participant as strong and tolerable, producing a tingling sensation. This intervention happens once every participant in the TENS group, for a continuous period of 40 minutes during breastfeeding.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of TENS in relieving pain of uterine contraction during breastfeeding immediately after delivery. According to the literature, TENS can reduce the cramping pain during breastfeeding. In this way, will be assessed a group that will use the TENS and a control group for comparison of results.</summary>
