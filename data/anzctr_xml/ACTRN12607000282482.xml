  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects with signs and symptoms compatible with acute influenza infection will be evaluated for participation.  Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive one of three treatments:
Treatment Group 1:  Peramivir (BCX-1812) 200 mg, administered intravenously, once daily (q 24 hrs) for  5 days (5 doses)

Treatment Group 2:  Peramivir BCX-1812) 400 mg, administered intravenously, once daily (q 24 hrs) for  5 days (5 doses)

Treatment Group 3:  Oseltamivir 75 mg, ( oral suspension) administered per-oral, twice daily for 5 days (10 doses)</interventions>

Positive rapid antigen test (RAT) for influenza A and/or influenza B (using an approved test kit) at the screening/enrollment evaluation9. Females of childbearing potential must report one of the following: Be surgically sterile or clinically post-menopausal Have been sexually abstinent 4 weeks prior to date of screening evaluation and be willing to remain abstinent through 4 weeks after study-drug administration for all perimenopausal women or women of child-bearing potential Use oral contraceptives or other form of hormonal birth control including hormonal vaginal rings or transdermal patches and have been using these for 3 months prior through 4 weeks after study-drug administration for all perimenopausal women or women of child-bearing potential Use an intra-uterine device (IUD), or adequate barrier contraception (or double-barrier method such as condom or diaphragm with spermicidal gel or foam) as birth control 4 weeks prior to date of screening evaluation through 4 weeks after study drug administration for all perimenopausal women or women of child-bearing potential</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The pharmacist who will be randomising each enrolled patient will be at the investigational site in all centres. Once the Principal Investigator has confirm the inclusion &amp; Exclusion criteria for each patient the Pharmacist will be notified to contact Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to centrally randomised each patient via phone computer.</concealment>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This study is double masked and double dummy, therefore the Physician that confirms the inclusion/exclusion criteria does not know the patient's treatment. All site staff, such as all Investigators and study coordinators and patients will be blinded to individual treatment. The Pharmacist is the only site member to know of the treatment. The treatment will be passed onto the study coordinator after it has been made up and blinded, therefore the administrator will not know of the treatment type. Once the study have been completed the data will be reviewed but statisticians and analysts who will be unblinded to individual patient treatments.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective intra-venously administered Peramivir will be at reducing the symptoms assoicated with complicated Influenza. The success of the medication will be assessed through discussing outcomes with each patient and reviewing the blood samples provided.
The Sponsor's of this study hypothesize that Peramivir intra-venously administered for 5 days will be effective at reducing the duration of influenza symptoms from about 100 hours to 80 hours from illness onset.</summary>
