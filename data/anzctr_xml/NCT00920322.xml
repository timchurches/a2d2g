  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will report on the outcomes of rTMS administered 3 times per week, compared with
      the standard protocol of 5 times per week. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      frequency condition and depressive symptomatology will be measured weekly using a range of
      clinician and self-rated questionnaires. Participants will remain in the study for at least 4
      weeks, with the option of continuing for a further 2 weeks as judged by the study
      psychiatrist. It is hypothesised that rTMS administered three times per week will be equally
      as effective as rTMS administered five times per week in reducing depressive symptomatology.</summary>
