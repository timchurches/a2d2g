  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo sensory testing to determine whether or not they are sensitive to the taste of the free fatty acid, oleic acid, in a milk-based drink.  They will be asked to taste and rate solutions with and without oleic acid, those who correctly identify the solution containing oleic acid on three occasions will be classed as tasters, those who do not taste it, or rate it incorrectly more than once will be classified as non-tasters.  Following categorization into either the taster, or non-taster, group, each participant will be studied on four occasions, separated by at least 7 days, to evaluate the effects of:
(i)oral exposure to a non-fat milk-based beverage with 1.8 mM oleic acid (C18:1) (10 ml samples at 3 minute intervals for 20 minutes)combined with a 90 minute intraduodenal infusion of C18:1 (participants will be intubated with an nasoduodenal catheter through which the infusion will be administered at a rate of 2 ml/min, 0.76 kcal/min) 
(ii)oral exposure to a non-fat milk-based beverage  without C18:1 combined with intraduodenal infusion of C18:1 
(iii)oral exposure to a non-fat milk-based beverage with 1.8 mM C18:1 combined with intraduodenal infusion of control (0.9 % saline)
(iv)oral exposure to a non-fat milk-based beverage without C18:1 combined with intraduodenal infusion of control (0.9 % saline)</interventions>
    <comparator>oral exposure to a non-fat milk-based beverage without C18:1 combined with intraduodenal infusion of control (0.9 % saline).

Taster and non-taster groups will be studied to determine whether fat taste sensitivity is required for the  effects of oleic acid on gut function and energy intake.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>During the 90 minute intraduodenal infusion antropyloduodenal motility will be assessed via changes in the pressures within specific portion of the gastrointestinal tract (antrum, pylorus and duodenum) which will be captured by sensors on the catheter connected to a computer-based system, running commercially available hardware (Oakdale Flexisoft)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous measurement from t = -15 - 90 minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>15 ml blood samples will be collected.  Blood samples will be analysed for blood glucose, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), insulin, pancreatic polypeptide ((PP), a marker of neuronal activation), peptide PYY (PYY), oleoylethanolamine (OEA) and ghrelin, as well as serum triglyceride concentrations.  Radioimmunoassays and mass spectroscopy will be utilised.</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake will be assessed using a buffet-style meal. Participants will be presented with a meal in excess of what they would normally be expected to consume and invited to eat until comfortably full.  Foods will be weighed before and after consumption.</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = 90 - 120 minutes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite perceptions will be assessed using validated visual analogue scale questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>t = -15, 0, 15, 20, 45, 60 75, and 90 minutes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatty acid taste sensitivity. Subjects will taste and evaluate 10 ml aliquots of a non-fat milk based beverage, with and without 1.8 mM oleic acid (C18:1).  1.8 mM was chosen as in a previous study approximately 50 % of subjects could detect C18:1 at, or below, this concentration. The test involves choosing an odd sample from a group of three samples based on taste (subjects wear nose-clips to ensure detection of differences is not due to smell). Each subject will receive a tray containing 3 sets of 3 * 10 ml samples randomly sorted and labelled with 3-digit blinding codes.  Subjects will be instructed to move back and forward through the samples from one set and to identify the ?odd? sample.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening visit</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Habitual energy and fat intakes will be assessed using a food frequence questionnaire.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Equal numbers of healthy male and female subjects, 15 of normal body weight for their height (body mass index (BMI): 19 - 25 kg/m2), and 15 obese (BMI 30  35 kg/m2), aged 18-55 years. Subjects will need to be unrestrained eaters, non-smokers, and for female subjects will be required to be taking an appropriate hormonal contraceptive.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>(1)significant gastrointestinal symptoms; disease or surgery
(2)current use of prescribed or non-prescribed medications (including vitamins and herbal supplements) which may affect energy metabolism, GI function, body weight or appetite (e.g. domperidone and cisapride, anticholinergic drugs (e.g. atropine), metoclopramide, erythromycin, hyoscine, orlistat, green tea extracts, Astragalus, St John's Wort etc.)
(3)diabetes mellitus 
(4)epilepsy
(5)cardiovascular or respiratory disease
(6)any other significant illness as assessed by the investigator
(7)allergy to local anaesthetic
(8)intake of &gt; 20 g alcohol on a daily basis 
(9)smokers (cigarettes, cigars, marijuana)
(10)in female subjects, pregnancy or lactation. A pregnancy test will be performed in all female subjects, using a urine sample, prior to commencement of the study and subsequently prior to each study day
(11)restrained eaters, as determined by a score of &gt;12 on the eating restraint questionnaire component of the eating questionnaire (35).  However, while the degree of eating restraint will be assessed and recorded in the obese subjects, this will not be used as an exclusion criteria, as the majority of obese subjects are likely to have some degree of eating restraint.
(12)donation of blood in the 12 weeks prior to enrolment in the study.  Subjects will also be instructed to abstain from donating blood for 12 weeks after study completion
(13)low iron levels 
(14)consumption of a vegetarian diet</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To evaluate the hypotheses:
(i) that both oral and small intestinal exposure to oleic acid (C18:1) will modulate antropyloroduodenal pressures, gut peptide, OEA and serum triglyceride responses, and suppress energy intake
(ii) that combined oral and small intestinal exposure to oleic acid will interact to enhance the stimulation of antropyloroduodenal pressures, gut peptide, OEA and serum triglyceride responses, and suppression of energy intake, when compared with either oral or small intestinal infusion alone, and 
(iii) that these effects will occur in tasters, but not non-tasters, of oleic acid.</summary>
