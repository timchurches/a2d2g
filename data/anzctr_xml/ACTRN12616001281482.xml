  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants participated in RMM sessions of 1h per session, under the Rhythm Wellness Programme by OneHeartBeat, held once a week for a total of 10 sessions over 11 weeks where a break was scheduled in the 4th week to factor in a public holiday within the intervention period of one of the groups. All RMM sessions were facilitated by 3 experienced instructors. The instruments used include the conga, cowbell, Djembe, Ashiko Tan-tans, Dunun, Shakers, and Wood Blocks in all sessions.
Each session was carried out in a circle, with the participant seated comfortably and the drum or percussion instrument within reach in front of them. During each session, the instructors facilitated free play, and encouraged the participants to express themselves and interact with each other through the active playing of the instruments.

In Phase one of the study, participants in group A will attend the 10 RMM sessions while participants in group B serve as the control. In Phase two of the study, participants in group B will attend the 10 RMM sessions while participants in group A serve as the control. There was no washout period.
