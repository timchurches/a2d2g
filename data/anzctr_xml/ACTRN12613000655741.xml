  <interventions>
    <interventions>The radiopharmaceutical product (medical device) is a needle with wax plug, containing a radioactive seed. 

I-125 seeds are entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for a different purpose (prostate brachytherapy).  Low activity seeds are packaged on-site into a sterile needle kit to be used for ROLLIS, under the Therapeutic Goods Administration Clinical Trials Notification scheme.

Participants will give informed consent and be randomised to HWL or ROLLIS.
For ROLLIS participants, a low-dose sterilised radioactive I-125 seed is placed within the patients cancer under local anaesthesia with imaging guidance. The approximate duration of the seed insertion procedure is 5 minutes. Localisation by seed may be up to 4 days prior to surgery.  The standard 2-view mammogram will be obtained to confirm satisfactory positioning of the seed(s).  The seed remains in situ until surgery. If the position of a seed is not ideal, a hook-wire will be inserted to guide the surgical excision.  (A second seed may cause confusion rather than aid guidance, since the signal from each seed may not be distinct).
In theatre, the surgeon then uses an intraoperative gamma probe to guide removal of the impalpable cancer containing the seed by breast conserving surgery (BCS) within 4 days.
</interventions>
    <comparator>When an abnormal area in the breast needs to be removed after a needle biopsy (and the surgeon cannot feel it), the current standard method of marking the area for surgical removal is for a radiologist to insert a hook-wire using ultrasound or stereotactic guidance on the day of surgery. This standard intervention is called hook-wire guided localisation (HWL). The approximate duration of HWL is 5 minutes and BCS occurs same day 6 +/- 3 hours. A mammogram is performed to check that hookwire is in a satisfactory position adjacent to the lesion. Occasionally if the position of this hook-wire is not optimal, a second hook-wire may need to be inserted. 

Participants will give informed consent and be randomised to HWL or ROLLIS.
For HWL, participants will receive localisation with a standard hook-wire localisation on the morning of surgery followed by BCS on the same day.

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the Breast Centres at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital (SCGH) and Royal Perth Hospital (RPH), major WA tertiary referral centres for breast cancer treatment. Prior to giving informed consent, eligible women will be given the opportunity to discuss the participant information and consent form with both family and general practitioner. For non-English speaking participants, the services of an official interpreter will be used. 
After obtaining informed consent from participants, the following procedure will be used for enrolling a subject and allocating the treatment.
Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is “off-site” or at central administration site. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>The block randomisation will be done using a database based on the ‘Ralloc’ package within strata. The randomisation will use three randomised block sizes and simple randomisation within blocks to ensure a ratio of experimental (ROLLIS localisation): control (HWL) participants close to unity within strata.  The randomisation will use a 2x2x3 design so there are six strata (from two stratification variables). The size and order of the blocks will be randomised.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>To detect an absolute 10% improvement in the primary outcome (reduction in incidence of subsequent oncological surgery from 30% to 20%) with a significance level of 5% (two-tailed) and 90% power, a sample size of 293 participants per group will be necessary. To allow for an attrition rate of 10% in each study arm, a total sample of 650 women will be recruited. This estimate of 10% attrition is based on our clinical experience in the RPS and 8.5% attrition observed in the largest published trial (333 participants) of the ROLLIS technique

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is comparing the use of low dose radioactive seeds to standard treatment for surgical removal guidance in breast cancer patients.  
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study, if you are a female aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with breast cancer that is non-palpable (i.e. the surgeon cannot feel it), and thus require a procedure known as localisation. 
Trial details: When an abnormal area in the breast needs to be removed after a needle biopsy (and the surgeon cannot feel it), the abnormal area is localised. We are comparing two different localisation techniques in this study. Participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to one of two techniques. Participants in one group will undergo a procedure known as ROLLILS (radioguided occult lesion localisation and removal of impalpable breast cancers). This involves inserting a low-dose sterilised radioactive iodine seed into the patient's cancer under local anaesthesia with imaging guiding. The patient will then undergo breast conserving surgery within 4 days, during which the surgeon uses the seed to guide removal of the impalpable cancer. Participants in the other group will undergo the standard treatment, known as hook-wire guided localisation (HWL). This is when a hook-wire is placed in the breast on the day of breast conserving surgery by a radiologist. Participants are followed for up to 5 years post-surgery in order to evaluate clinical and cosmetic outcomes, disease recurrence and patient satisfaction. A cost benefit analysis will also be undertaken.
