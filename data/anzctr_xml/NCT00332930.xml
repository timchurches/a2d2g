  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  HIV-1 infected individuals eligible and still fulfilling the criteria for the
             VIR-NCHR-01 protocol (ITV study)

          -  Received all 3 immunisations

          -  Remained in follow-up for at least 52 weeks

          -  Continued to take combination antiretroviral therapy with no evidence of treatment
             failure at the time entering the roll-over phase

          -  Written informed consent obtained

        Criteria for Withdrawal of Study Participants

          -  Incidental or progression of disease which, in the opinion of the principal
             investigator, should preclude further study participation

          -  If the study participant required cytotoxic or immunosuppressive chemo- or radiation
             therapy

          -  If the study participant required any medications that when combined with the study
             vaccination, would in the opinion of the principal investigator, jeopardise the
             validity of the individuals continued participation

          -  Administration of prohibited alternative therapy

          -  Study participant non-compliance

          -  All study participants are required to adhere to the protocol evaluation schedule.
             Failure to adhere with this schedule without having first provided justification may
             result in the participant being withdrawn from the study

          -  At the request of the study participant or principal investigator without prejudice to
             future health care

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, if it is not in the patients best interests to
             continue the study

          -  At the request of the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research
             (NCHECR) with reasonable cause

          -  At the advice of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)</inclusivecriteria>
