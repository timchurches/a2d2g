  <interventions>
    <interventions>The research is a pilot randomised trial which aims to determine the effectiveness of intensive self-care retraining in sub-acute stroke rehabilitation. 

Self-care retraining will be conducted  5 times per week for 2 weeks by an Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Allied Health Assistant with inpatients in a rehabilitation unit who have suffered a stroke and are having difficulty with showering and dressing,

Intervention will be personalised to provide remediation of difficulties identified within assessment. Level of intensity will be as prescribed for all in each group.  The intervention will be delivered individually face to face. Each session will take as long as each individual requires based on their particular difficulties. On average a self-care retraining session takes between 40-60 minutes to be depicted in its entirety. 

Adherence will be monitored by recording of session completion logs. Where a session is unable to be conducted this will be recorded along with the primary reason for the session non-completion.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of intensive showering and dressing retraining delivered for 2 weeks in an inpatient rehabilitation unit. 
Stroke survivors regularly require assistance with completing self-care tasks at their admission to rehab.  This need for assistance often continues following discharge and is associated with poor consumer and carer outcomes. Increased intensity of retraining in rehabilitation continues to show improved outcomes for stroke survivors, therefore we want to test the theory that increasing the intensity of self-care rehabilitation will provide improved outcomes. 
Each participant will have their level of independence in completing the activities of showering and dressing assessed.  They will then receive self-care retraining delivered by an occupational therapist (OT) or an allied health assistant (AHA) either 5 days per week for two weeks (trial intervention), or up to twice per week only for 2 weeks which is currently usual care in the rehabilitation units (control intervention).  Re-assessment of their ability to independently complete these tasks will then be completed.  The level of improvement will be analysed to determine if there is any increased benefit for those undertaking the trial intervention.   The research will also establish whether it is possible, practical and safe to deliver this therapy in inpatient rehabilitation, and if patients like or can manage this level of intensity
