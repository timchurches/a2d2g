  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of this case report was to evaluate the effects of a physical therapy intervention in a diabetic neuropathy elderly, through the development of a treatment.The treatment was composed by metabolic exercises, stretching and muscle strengthening, balance training, gait training, classic massage and feet self-care orientation. There were 24  sessions of treatment, (40 minutes each session),  twice a week, during 3 months. A trained physiotherapist administered de sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>There wasn´t a control group. A sensorial, motor, functional assessment and the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ-Brasil) were implemented in three phases: pre-intervention, after 12 sessions and after de physical therapy treatment (24 sessions). The results were based in the same participant on different stages.</comparator>
