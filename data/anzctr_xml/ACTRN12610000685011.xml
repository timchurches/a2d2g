  <interventions>
    <interventions>Students will attend one 1-hour tutorial on the principles of communicating evidence to patients, watch a role-play that models effective communication of evidence, and participate in a faciliated group discussion about the observed role-play.

As per students in the control group, intervention group students will also receive the usual teaching methods for this course and be directed to read a relevant chapter in the course textbook.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of providing health professional students with the opportunity to observe and discuss a modelled role-play that demonstrates how to communicate evidence to patients and faciliate shared decision making. It is hypothesised that the intervention will be effective at improving students' ability to incorporate evidence into their communication and facilitate shared decision making with patients, and improve their confidence and attitude towards doing so.</summary>
