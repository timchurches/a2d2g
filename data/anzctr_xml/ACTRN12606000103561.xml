    <concealment>Once a participant meets the selection criteria the studyâ€™s independent statistician (randomisation officer) will be contacted and will reveal whether the computer-generated random treatment allocation is to, CBT alone or CBT + tablets (fluoxetine or placebo). Medication allocation will be concealed through the randomisation officer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation will be random using a computer generated blocking procedure to ensure comparable numbers in each treatment group. The sequence is generated in blocks, containing allocations to each of the three treatment groups, randomly arranged. This blocking procedure is done using Microsoft Excel software.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to determine if combined cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication (fluoxetine) treatment of school refusing children (11-16.5 years) improves their response to treatment and longer term outcome, compared to CBT only group. In order to determine that this predicted improvement in outcome is due to the active effects of medication rather than expectancy effects associated with taking a pill, a third group comprising CBT + placebo treatment will be included.</summary>
