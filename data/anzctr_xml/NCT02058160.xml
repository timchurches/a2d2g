    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Insulin glargine/lixisenatide (HOE901/AVE0010)
Treatment: drugs - Insulin glargine (HOE901)
Treatment: drugs - Metformin (Background Drug)

Experimental: Insulin Glargine/Lixisenatide Fixed Ratio Combination (FRC) - FRC once daily (QD) for 30 weeks. Dose individually adjusted.

Active Comparator: Insulin glargine - Insulin glargine 100 U/mL QD for 30 weeks. Dose individually adjusted.


Treatment: drugs: Insulin glargine/lixisenatide (HOE901/AVE0010)
Insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC was self-administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection within 1 hour before breakfast using one of 2 SoloStarÂ® pen-injectors: Pen A (ratio of 2 Units (U) of insulin glargine U 100:1 mcg of lixisenatide) or Pen B (ratio of 3 U of insulin glargine U 100:1 mcg of lixisenatide). After run-in, the FRC was initiated at a dose of either 20 U/10 mcg with Pen A or 30 U/10 mcg with Pen B, depending on participant's dose of Insulin glargine on the day prior to randomization.
Dose was adjusted weekly to reach and maintain fasting self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) of 80 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L). Pen A was used for administration of doses up to 40 U/20 mcg and Pen B for administration of doses from 30 U/10 mcg up to 60 U/20 mcg.

Treatment: drugs: Insulin glargine (HOE901)
Insulin glargine was self-administered QD by SC injection at approximately the same time every day.
After screening, eligible participants entered 6 week run-in phase during which they were switched (if necessary) to insulin glargine and dose was stabilized. The first dose after randomization was same as the one administered on the day prior to randomization and then dose was adjusted weekly to reach and maintain fasting SMPG of 80 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L to 5.6 mmol/L).

Treatment: drugs: Metformin (Background Drug)
Pharmaceutical form: Tablet; Route of administration: Oral administration

      <outcome>Mean Change in 7-point Self-monitored Plasma Glucose (SMPG) Profile From Baseline to Week 30 - Participants recorded a 7-point plasma glucose profile measured before and 2-hours after each meal and at bedtime, two times in a week before baseline, before visit Week 12 and before visit Week 30 and the average value across the profiles performed in the week before a visit for the 7 time points was calculated. Change in average 7 point SMPG was calculated by subtracting baseline value from Week 30 value. The analysis included all scheduled measurements obtained during the study.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia - Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Plasma glucose measurements might not had been available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal was considered sufficient evidence that the event had been induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia included all episodes in which neurological impairment was severe enough to prevent self-treatment, and which were thus thought to place participants at risk for injury to themselves or others.</outcome>

    <summary>Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination
      (FRC) to insulin glargine in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from baseline to Week 30.

      Secondary Objective:

      To compare the overall efficacy and safety of insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC to insulin
      glargine (with or without metformin) over a 30 week treatment period in participants with
      type 2 diabetes.</summary>
