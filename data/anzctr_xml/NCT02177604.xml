  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has shown that indulging in 50% more calories than required for as little
      as 3 days can significantly impact markers of metabolic health in lean and overweight
      individuals. Here, the investigators will determine if 3 brief sessions of high-intensity
      interval training can mitigate the adverse consequences of 7 days high-fat overfeeding in
      sedentary, overweight males.</summary>
