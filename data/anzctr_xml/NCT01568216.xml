  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of AMG 747 on negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia in patients who are stable on current antipsychotic treatment. After a run-in
      period on their current antipsychotic treatment, patients will be randomized to one of the
      four treatment arms as add-on therapy for a treatment duration of up to 3 months.</summary>
