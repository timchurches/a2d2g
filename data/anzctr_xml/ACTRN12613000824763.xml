  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessing the groups in which empirical broader spectrum therapy than that recommended by the statewide guideline may be appropriate, by describing the incidence of drug-resistant disease in our community. Data was collected on all episodes of pediatric pneumonia admitted to the Townsville Hospital between Jan 2009-Jun 2013. This cohort received a variety of antibiotics due to the previous lack of any protocol, and some were commenced by local specialists on broader treatment earlier in the course, while others received what has now become the suggestions in the statewide policy. The control group will be those who were successfully treated in accordance with, what is now, the statewide policy, to compare to those who received alternative options for either clinical reasons or practitioner choice.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group are those patients who received treatment with the standard statewide protocol in institutions or other clinical areas in the hospital, and were successfully treated for simple pneumonia. Data was collected on all episodes of pediatric pneumonia admitted to the Townsville Hospital between Jan 2009-Jun 2013.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be conducted as a retrospective audit at the Townsville Hospital and will utilise existing hospital records and databases to answer a number of important clinical questions including: 
1.	What are the identified aetiologies for pneumonia in children in Townsville?
2.	In what proportion of cases does the treatment of pneumonia conform to the published guidelines? Where it is not, is a reason for this identified?
3.	Are the empirical antibiotics used in the Townsville Hospital for treatment of pneumonia in children appropriate? In what percentage of cases are organisms not sensitive to initial treatment identified (or change of antibiotics required when the patient does not respond)?
4.	Are there clinical, demographic, geographic or other features which would indicate that empirical antibiotic treatments recommended in the guidelines are inappropriate in our setting?
