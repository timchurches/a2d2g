  <interventions>
    <interventions>For treatment group 1 underwent 20 sessions over 30 minutes twice a week of exercises for stretching the calf to ankle mobility and to strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the feet. The patients were instructed to perform the same exercises at home once a day. For treatment group 2 was insoles adapted to each type of foot which were used by patients during four months. However, prior to making these insoles patients were evaluated using the criteria of the Ministry of Health. To fabricate the insole was used ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) material, performing before a mold of the foot of each patient, and then added the metatarsal supports, or support for the plantar arch or heel according to the individual needs of each patient. The insoles were sanded until there is no protrusion that could injure the patient and were completely homogeneous. The volunteer was told to use the insole in the shoe favorite, removing the existing insole in it, using it for as long as possible during the day. For treatment group 3 were used 20 sessions of exercises as the group 1 and insoles adapted as the group 2 which were used by the volunteers during 4 months</interventions>
    <comparator>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of traditional treatment is the use of exercises associated with the insole, with another group that used only insole and finally a third group that performed only exercises</comparator>
