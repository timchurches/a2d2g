  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive an individually tailored lifestyle modification plan through the care of an experienced physiotherapist and trainned health coach over a six-month period. The intervention will involve one single face-to-face health coaching session and fortnightly telephone counseling sessions during 6 months. The face-to-face session will occuor approximately 8 days after the recruitment. The session will take place at the participant's home and should take no longer than 1 hour. After this face-to-face session, the only contact that the Health Coach will have with the participant will be by phone, every two weeks. The phone calls should take no longer than 30 minutes.
The focus of the lifestyle modification will be on a gradual patient-centred increase in physical activity where patients are encouraged to devise goals fortnightly to suit and advance their lifestyle. This intervention will be supported by the use of mobile-health which will include a specifically designed mobile WebApp and physical activity monitoring device (FitBit). 
The mobile WebApp will be built and customized specifically for the purposes of this project using available technology and concept currently implemented by Spare Intelligence Engine Registered Trademark. The main purpose of the application is to allow participants to record symptoms, monitor their activity and contact their health coach. Participants will be able to access the application at any time and receive feedback on their physical activity goals. Feedback messages constructed by the health coach are personalized and matched to participants needs by tailoring them to their response. 
The activity monitoring device will be provided to the participant by the health coach who will also demonstrate its use. Each participant will receive a brief orientation covering this instruments proper functions. Telephone support will be offered to participants who have difficulties with the device setup. The Fitbit is a physical activity tracker designed to help individuals to become more active and sleep better. This device logs a range of data about each participants activity, providing feedback on the number of steps taken in each 24-hour period as well as the distance walked; calories burned and sleep duration and quality. The feedback on the present day is available on the device itself and the steps taken per day, week, and month will be also summarized graphically on the devices website (www.fitbit.com) or a Smartphone, which will also be demonstrated to the participant. The participants on the intervention group will be advised to use the Fitbit 24 hours per day continuously throughout 6 month intervention period.
Adherence to the program will be assessed with the records of people who ceased involvement with the intervention prior to its completion and the reason for this, data from the Fitbit device kept by participants. Participants will also be asked to identify reasons for intervention adoption and adherence. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was defined in order to detect a 2-point difference between groups on the pain intensity outcome measured by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale, assuming a standard deviation of 1.9 points. Power was defined as 80% for an alpha of 5% and attrition (drop-outs) of 35%. The effect of treatment will be separately analysed for each outcome using linear mixed models with time as a repeated factor, group as a fixed factor and subjects as a random factor. The coefficient of the group x time interactions will provide estimates of the effects of interventions over time. All analyses will be performed by intention to treat and blinded to treatment group. Potential covariates that will be investigated are baseline pain and disability levels, number of previous treatments, symptom length, co-morbidities, age, and socioeconomic status.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well recognized that low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health problem. The total cost of chronic LBP in Australia is estimated at $9.17 billion yearly.  Expenditures are expected to grow with the increasing obesity crisis and ageing population.
Although randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating the efficacy of conservative interventions for chronic LBP have found improvements in pain and disability associated with interventions, but patients exhibit a rapid decline in clinical outcomes after treatment discharge. These patients are likely to have recurrences of LBP and therefore seek additional care and costly, invasive procedures such as spinal surgery. 
Our previous research has shown that patients with chronic LBP who engage in moderate to high levels of recreational physical activity have better prognosis of pain, disability, and quality of life than those who fail to maintain adequate levels of activity. However, adherence to such lifestyle modifications is crucial and difficult to achieve. Interventions to increase physical activity based on communication technologies are becoming popular because they facilitate patients access and adherence to health interventions. The use of patient-centred approaches, where patients have the opportunity to share healthcare decisions, are becoming popular in LBP and have been found to be more effective than general non-specific approaches to help patients to engage in physical activity. Surprisingly, no studies have investigated the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention, particularly with the support of mobile-health (m-health) tools on long-term outcomes in patients with chronic LBP.  
We propose a RCT to investigate the effectiveness of an m-health patient-centered physical activity intervention for patients with chronic LBP after discharge from hospital. Patients in the experimental group will receive feedback from affordable and unobtrusive activity monitors to allow them to maintain leisure activity levels through lifestyle modification and use an m-health tool to monitor and motivate their progress. We hypothesise that the use of m-health monitoring and patient-centred lifestyle modification will reduce symptom recurrence, unnecessary spinal surgery and care seeking. We will evaluate this approach in patients receiving treatment in an outpatient physiotherapy department of Liverpool Hospital in the South-western health district of Sydney.
