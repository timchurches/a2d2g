  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the PRELUDE study is to describe the use of lanreotide Autogel速 (LAN ATG)
      combined with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) in the treatment of progressive
      neuroendocrine tumours located in the lung or in the digestive system as there is currently
      limited data on these treatments used together for these types of neuroendocrine tumours.</summary>
