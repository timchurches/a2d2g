  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cycles of usual care period (~4 weeks) followed by intervention period (~4 weeks) will be conducted on 3-5 medical units including general medicine, cardiology and respiratory medicine.Depending on when the patient is recruited, patient will be assigned to usual care (period 1) or intervention (period 2). 

Screen all patients aged over 65 years admitted to medical service at Royal North Shore Hospital. Obtain informed consent from participant or person responsible.  Obtain baseline data for all participants on sociodemographics, reason for admission, medications, comorbidities, falls, probable one year survival and cognition. Administer a frailty questionnaire (Reported Edmonton Frail Scale). 

Intervention: After consent is obtained, study pharmacist obtains best possible medication history and documents on standard hospital medication history form (medication management plan; MMP). 
Study pharmacist will also generate a medication optimisation plan as documented on the MMP. Ideally, this should be completed within 48 hours of the patient's admission but may be delayed. A copy of this plan is to be provided in the medical notes.  
If the patient is taking a medication that contributes to the drug burden index (DBI), that is, taking a medication with sedative and/or anticholinergic effects, the DBI will be calculated online using a DBI calculator, which has been shown to be a reliable and validated computerised clinical decision support system to report DBI of older patients taking multiple medications. 

The plan is discussed with the patient/carer, General Practitioner (GP) and the patient's treating team (registrar +/- consultant). The patient's team will decide whether to make any changes to medicines, at their own discretion, They can decide to agree or disagree with the recommendations outlined in the plan by the pharmacist.

The intervention will run over a period of approximately 4 weeks, 

The study pharmacist will also record the time taken by staff involved to review medicines (pharmacist, admitting team, consults, case conferences etc).  Where possible, the study pharmacist will prompt the patient's usual team pharmacist to document any changes made to medicines and reasons for changes that are not already documented through routine care.  Where possible and clinically appropriate, the study pharmacist will call the patient's GP to explain changes made on discharge.  

The patient will be followed up at 1 and 6 months from their discharge date by phone call to patient/carer and/or GP and/or facility manager and medical records. The patient may choose to receive an email or postal mail containing the follow-up questions. Questions will be on their medicines, falls, readmission, institutionalisation and mortality (which can be confirmed with Births, Deaths and Marriages when necessary).

    <designfeatures>Each medical unit will be studied for 2 consecutive periods of ~4 weeks.

    <statisticalmethods>To assess the primary outcome, change in the prevalence of stopping a medication between admission and discharge will be compared between the usual care (control) and 4MS (intervention) groups. Prevalence of other validated indicators of quality use of medicines in older adults (that include drug class, dose and interactions) will also be compared.  This will use the chi-square analysis.  

Secondary prescribing outcomes will be compared between discharge and 1 and 6 months post discharge similarly using chi square for proportions and t tests for continuous variables. Clinical outcomes will be compared between the usual care and 4MS groups in the same way. 

Feasibility: Economic evaluation (cost analysis) will be performed by the executive unit

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Australia has an ageing population with an associated increase in people living with multiple chronic diseases. There has been a major increase in polypharmacy (multiple medicines use) in Australia over the past decade and the prevalence continues to rise, especially in older adults. Polypharmacy can lead to medication errors, adverse drug reactions, falls, confusion, frailty, loss of independence, hospitalisation and mortality. 

Evidence is emerging that supervised withdrawal of harmful or unnecessary medicines (deprescribing) is safe and may improve quality of life in older people. Over 90% of older adults surveyed in a range of settings, including Royal North Shore Hospital inpatients stated they would like to stop one of their medicines if their doctor said it was possible. 

An acute hospital stay represents a missed opportunity to review a patients medicines and reduce polypharmacy. In the Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH) inpatient aged care service, the prevalence of hyperpolypharmacy increases from 45.8% on admission to 60.4% on discharge. Involvement of clinical pharmacists has been shown to improve care of hospitalised patients. 

The main barriers to optimising medicines during admission are a focus on the acute presenting problem; inadequate information on the patients comorbidities and medications prior to admission; difficulties reaching consensus between the patient, multiple specialists and general practitioner; inadequate time with short length of stay; and lack of expertise by junior medical officers, who do most of the prescribing. 

Failure to address polypharmacy in hospital results in longer lengths of stay due to adverse drug events, and a higher likelihood of readmission. We propose testing a new service at RNSH to improve Quality Use of Medicines by older patients across the continuum of care. Quality Use of Medicines, which is a pillar of Australias National Medicines Policy, is best achieved through partnership between consumers, clinicians, academics and policy makers. Such partnership is central to the Multidisciplinary Multiple Medicines Management Service (4MS) that will be tested in this proposal.
