  <interventions>
    <interventions>70 elderly patients (62 men), from two Brazilian hospitals (Brasilia), classified as depressed (D) and not depressed (ND), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, where divided randomly into four groups. Group D1 and ND1 used for sedation 10 mg of S- Ketamine, plus 1 mg of midazolam and groups D2 and ND2 only 1mg of Midazolam, in intravenous bolus, until 3-4 grade in Ramsay Scale was reached. 
Primary efficacy measure was quantitatively estimated by the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, one day before and one day after surgery.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To access improvement of mental depression after treatment with S-ketamine, by using  the 21 items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>-the day before the surgery (after randomization)
-On the second day of the postoperative period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate side effects of S-ketamine: nausea and vomits, allucinations, postoperative pain, cardiovascular effects, respiratory depression, sedation and amnesia. 
To mesure them:a intraoperative non invasive blood pressure monitoring and ECG (cardiovascular effects), SpO2 (respiratory depression), Ramsay Scale (sedation), Visual analogic scale (pain) and by questioning the patient (nausea and vomits, psychedelic effects, amnesia)</outcome>
      <timepoint>-the day before the surgery (after randomization)
-On the second day of the postoperative period</timepoint>

    <concealment>All patients scheduled for surgery with epidural or spinal anaesthesia were separated into depressed (D) and not depressed (ND) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria. Then they were randomized into D1 (depressed with S-ketamine + midazolam), D2 (depressed with midazolam), ND1 (not depressed with S-ketamine + midazolam), ND2 (not depressed with midazolam). 
We used for randomization sets of 10 sealed, opaque carbonate envelopes, at the time.</concealment>
    <sequence>Permuted block randomisation: for randomization sealed, opaque envelopes were used. In the inside we could find the numbers 1 or 2 and the therapy was prepared accordingly. After that, the name of the patient was written in the envelope, the protocol used was included inside and the envelope was sealed again. It was not open until final results were evaluated. 
All depressed patients that met the inclusion criteria were randomized in D1 and D2 groups.
In a sequence of 4 patients not depressed, one of them was elected and then randomized in ND1 and ND2 groups (the other 3 were excluded)</sequence>

    <summary>OBJECTIVES: to determine whether S-ketamine, used as an intra-operative sedative, can alleviate depression, in the elderly, in the immediate postoperative period. To evaluate also if low doses of S-ketamine have no adverse side effects that can restrict its clinical use.</summary>
