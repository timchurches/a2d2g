  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sizing is performed before induction of anesthesia.It takes approximately 5 minutes.
The SLIPA size is chosen by matching the width across the thyroid cartilage with that of the bridge of the SLIPA.
Dimension is sized between left and right cornu of thyroid cartilage by palpation and matching the dimension at level the widest diameter of SLIPA bridge.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sizing is performed before induction of anesthesia. It takes approximately 5 minutes.
SLIPA size is selected by measuring the patient's height, and followed the SLIPA manufacturer's criteria.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>measure the OLP(Oropharyngeal leakage pressure) by auscultation. OLP is the minimum airway pressure at which gas audibly leak around it using a fresh gas flow of
5 liter/min with the adjustable pressure-limiting (APL)
valve completely closed. 
If &lt;15mmHg, repositoning the patient's head and neck.
If OLP shows &lt;15mmHg after repositioning, it regards as fail.</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after insertion device</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Respiratory mechanics
Peak Inspiratory pressure, Inspiratory tidal Volume, Expiratory tidal volume will be measured using spirometry module (S/5TM Compact anaesthesia monitor; Datex-Ohmeda, Tewksbury, MA, USA). All manipulations of the patients will be halted during the measurement, and respiratory mechanics variables will be measured in triplicate and averaged for each measurement, such that each measured data will be used as a single observation and contribute only once to each overall data set.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 5 minutes after induction of anesthesia</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>severity of sore throat
30 min after arrival in the recovery room, patients will be asked by the independent investigator to score throat pain on an eleven-point visual analogue scale(0-10)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SLIPA is an widespread supraglottic airway. But, the size selection criteria provided from manufacturer is inaccurate and the height is overlapped. Therefore we performed a study to find the factors influencing selection of the optimal size of Streamlined liner of Pharyngeal Airway(SLIPA) in normal adults, especially the width of thyroid.</summary>
