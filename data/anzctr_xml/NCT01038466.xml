  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the CHAT study ("An open-label, randomized Phase II study of Herceptin
      (trastuzumab), Taxotere® (docetaxel) and Xeloda (capecitabine) in combination, versus
      Herceptin (trastuzumab) plus Taxotere® (docetaxel), in patients with advanced and/or
      metastatic breast cancers that overexpress HER2") was to test the combination of Trastuzumab
      and Docetaxel with or without capecitabine as first-line therapy for HER2 positive locally
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Overall Response Rate was the primary endpoint of the CHAT study. This study failed to meet
      its primary objective of showing a difference between the treatment groups, with equivalent
      high response rates for the Trastuzumab plus Docetaxel and Trastuzumab, Docetaxel plus
      capecitabine arms.

      Secondary endpoints in the CHAT study were Progression-Free-Survival, Time-to-Progression,
      Overall Survival, duration of response and safety profile. Whilst analysis of the existing
      data is consistent with improvement with the triplet therapy, interpretation is compromised
      by the relatively short median follow-up of 24 months. In hindsight the statistical design
      was flawed by selection of a sub optimal primary endpoint and consequently data was collected
      and analysed early in relation to time-dependent endpoints. Beyond CHAT will permit capture
      of mature data for time-related endpoints. Time-to-Progression and Overall Survival are the
      co-primary endpoints for the Beyond CHAT protocol. The impact of treatment following the
      first progression, on survival, will be explored.

      Time-to-Progression will be defined from the time interval between the date of randomisation
      and the occurrence of progressive disease under therapy according to RECIST criteria.

      Overall Survival will be defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of death</summary>
