  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery will be invited pre-operatively to participate in this study.  Participants will have pressure measurements carried out with both Optiflow trademark and  facemask non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
Following surgery, whilst the participant is sedated and ventilated in the Intensive Care Unit, a 10F catheter will be inserted into the nasopharynx via the nose. 
Once the patient has been woken and extubated a baseline airway pressure measurement will be performed while the patient breathes spontaneously on their routine oxygen therapy device e.g. standard nasal cannulae or facemask. 
Pressure measurements will be carried out following a random sequence  for both the Optiflow trademark system and NIV delivered via a facemask. Participants will have 3 measurements performed on the Optiflow interface at 30, 40 and 50 litres per minute and 3 measurements performed on NIV at 4,6 and 8 cmH2O via a facemask. 



For each group, pressure measurement for each flow/pressure will be recorded over one minute of breathing using precision pressure transducer (PPT). This procedure is expected to take around 30 mins. The catheter will be removed at the end of this period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean nasopharyngeal airway pressure as determined by measurements taken over one minute of breathing. Specially designed software will be used to carry out the measurements and calculate the mean.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six measurements in total will be undertaken - one at each flow level for Optiflow and one at each pressure level for facemask CPAP. Each measurement is continuous over one minute. Mean airway pressure is calculated by averaging the peak and trough pressures over the entire minute of breathing.</timepoint>
