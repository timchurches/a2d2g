  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Failure to immobilise the neck during tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine injuries (CSI) can result in a devastating neurologic outcome. One method to immobilise the neck during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is manual in-line neck stabilisation (MILNS). With MILNS, however, it is often more difficult to visualise the larynx using conventional laryngoscopy. Consequently, the application of MILNS may result in failure to secure the airway, which may result in substantial morbidity or even mortality. These issues highlight the need to develop alternative approaches to securing the airway in patients with CSI.

The purpose of the proposed study is to compare the performance of the Airway Scope and GlideScope laryngoscopes for tracheal intubation in patients with cervical spine immobilisation using MILNS. The
GlideScope laryngoscope, is a modification of the standard Macintosh blade, with a high-resolution camera and with a light source for illumination embedded within the blade. Endotracheal intubation is performed based on an image on a screen. Its use is well described in the airway management of patients with immobilised cervical spines. The Airway Scope, in contrast, is a novel intubation device. It is a video laryngoscope with a reusable handle and desposible blade. A number of design features that suggest its utility in the setting of cervical spine immobilisation. A limited amount of research to date has generally supported this proposition.

We intend to conducting a randomised, single-blind, controlled clinical trial. All patients will receive a standardised general anaesthetic with routine non-invasive monitoring. The neck will be immobilised using MILNS applied by an experienced assistant. Participants will be randomly assigned to tracheal intubation with either the Airway Scope or the GlideScope. All intubations will be performed by one anaesthetist experienced in the use of both laryngoscopes. The primary outcome measures will be intubation time and the Intubation Difficulty Scale score. Any complications or difficulties will be recorded.</summary>
