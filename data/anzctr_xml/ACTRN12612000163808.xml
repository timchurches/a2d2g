  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 24-week clinically supervised standardised weight management programme combined with additional weekly 24-week follow up standardised telephone counselling.

Both groups will be provided with a standardised clinically supervised weight management programme over a 24 week period. The programme will consist of:
a)	1 Doctor Consultation (Individual)
b)	1 Doctor Consultation follow up (Group of 10)
c)	2 Dietitian Consultations (Individual)
d)	2 Dietitian Educational Talks on Nutrition (Group of 15)
e)	1 Supermarket Tour for Healthier Food Choices conducted by the Dietitian (Group of 15)
f)	2 Physiotherapy Fitness Assessments (Baseline and Final)
g)	4 Supervised Exercise Sessions at LIFE Centre by Physiotherapists
h)	A 1-year Home Walking programme. Participants will have to clock and record a weekly average of 70,000 steps throughout the programme and maintain this intensity for a further 24 weeks after the programme is completed.

Each of the above sessions will last approximately an hour. 

The telephone counselling will be administered to the experimental group at the end of the programme.

It consists of a standardised script-based interaction for 15-30mins once per week with questions pertaining to 3 domains: Physical Activity, Nutrition: Calorie Intake, and Mental Health: Subjective recording of their feelings followed by reminders to continue the exercise programme on their own and words of encouragement,</interventions>

    <concealment>Prospective participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion crteria will be referred from Health Promotion Board, Singapore to the clinically supervised weight loss programme.

All prospective participants, with their demographic information detailed, will undergo a baseline assessment of the primary and secondary outcome measures. The  outcome measures will be retaken following the completion of the 24-week standardised weight management programme. Subsequently, only prospective participants who have either maintained or have lost weight from their baseline initial assessment will be block-randomised to either the control or treatment group. The randomization sequence will be concealed with opaque envelopes. Study participants will be randomly assigned a specifc allocation number.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of telephone counselling in conjunction with a weight management programme on weight loss and compliance. We hypothesize that weekly telephone counselling in addition to a standard weight management programme will result in a greater percentage of weight loss and increase in compliance.</summary>
