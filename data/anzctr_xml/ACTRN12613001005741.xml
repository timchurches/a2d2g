  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the implementation intention group will complete an computer based implementation intention task that involves the generation of If-Then plans to overcome barriers to breakfast consumption (e.g. If I wake up late on a weekday, then I will eat a tub of yoghurt for breakfast while waiting for the bus!). 

Participants will be asked to complete the planning task at the conclusion of the online survey. The task instructions are as follows: We want you to plan to eat breakfast every day during the next week, paying particular attention to the situations in which you will implement these plans. You could choose to focus on planning what breakfast foods to buy, how you will prepare them or something more specific. For example, you may find it useful to state: If I wake up late on a weekday, then I will eat a tub of yoghurt for breakfast while waiting for the bus! Please write your plans in the space provided, following the format in the example (if??then ).

Follow-up data collection will occur one week after the baseline survey.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The role of temporal self-regulation theory variables and implementation intentions in breakfast consumption will be investigated in a sample of healthy individuals from the community. Participants who join the study will be randomised to one of two groups (1) implementation intention group (2) no implementation intention group. All tasks will be completed online. 

All participants will complete a baseline assessment that measures perceptions of the environment as supportive or unsupportive (CAS), intention to consume breakfast, planning ability (Tower of London), response inhibition (Stroop), habit strength (Self-Report Habit Index), frequency of breakfast consumption in the past week, and relevant demographic variables (e.g. age and gender). 

Participants in the implementation intention group will also complete an implementation intention task that involves the generation of If-Then plans to overcome barriers to breakfast consumption (e.g. If I wake up late on a weekday, then I will eat a tub of yoghurt for breakfast while waiting for the bus!).

At one week post-baseline all participants will be emailed an invitation to complete the follow-up assessment. This assessment will reassesses perceptions of the environment as supportive or unsupportive (CAS), intention to consume breakfast, planning ability (Tower of London), response inhibition (Stroop), habit strength (Self-Report Habit Index), and frequency of breakfast consumption in the past week.</summary>
