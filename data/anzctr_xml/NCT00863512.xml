  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, cisplatin, docetaxel,
      gemcitabine, and pemetrexed disodium, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sometimes after
      surgery, the tumor may not need more treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation
      may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective than
      observation in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage I non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying four chemotherapy regimens to see how
      well they work compared with observation in treating patients with early stage non-small cell
      lung cancer.</summary>
