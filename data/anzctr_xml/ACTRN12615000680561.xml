The Intervention is repair of the hip capsule at the end of an arthroscopic hip surgery.  This consists of 2-4 heavy (number 2) surgical sutures passed with a special instrument (Arthrocare Speed stitch).  The procedure adds about 5-10 minutes to a 60-90 minute operation.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is arthroscopic hip surgery performed without closure of the capsule. This has been the standard of care for the past 10 years internationally.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Description of Population to be Enrolled
a) The study will enroll approximately 60 individuals, 30 in each treatment
group, who have elected to undergo a hip arthroscopy due to labral or
cartilage pathologies as a result of Femoroacetabular Impingement.
b) Screening Procedures: Individuals will be recruited from current patients who are
being evaluated to undergo arthroscopic surgery for FAI as well as new patients.
Patients will be seen in Dr. Mei-Dan’s and Dr Brick's clinic and evaluated for involvement in the study</concealment>
    <sequence>Stage 2: Randomization
i) Randomization will be performed by the surgeons/investigators
before the surgical procedure is about to conclude. Due to the
necessity of intra-operative evaluation of the hip cartilage for
evidence of OA, (which could exclude a patient from participation in
the study), randomization cannot be performed prior to this point.
ii) Sixty sealed envelopes, 30 of which are labeled “Treatment” or “Control”, will
be prepared prior to the initiation of the study, and will be placed in a closed
box in the operating room. After the technical aspects of the surgical
procedure have been completed, all pathologies were addressed, and before
skin closure, the nurse will open a sealed envelope and notify the surgeon if
capsular repair is to be performed. Patients will be (and stay) blinded to the treatment given</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hip arthroscopy is a surgical technique used to address intra-articular cartilage and labral pathologies. Hip joint stability is determined by static (osseous, labral, and capsuloligamentous) and dynamic (neuromuscular and adhesional forces) factors. Understanding of the hip capsuloligamentous complex and its importance to hip stability, post operative function level, and pain continues to grow. Capsulotomy is commonly used in hip arthroscopy to allow visualization and instrument navigation however the optimal technique, amount of resection, and indications for capsular repair remain unknown. As the arthroscopic treatment of FAI has rapidly developed over the past 10 years, leaving the capsule open has been the common standard. Lately, capsular repair is increasingly considered, as concerns are raised regarding long term effects of extensive capsulotomies and occasional reports of devastating post operative side effects, such as post arthroscopy dislocation or subtle instability resulting in rapid osteoarthritis, are being published.  It should be noted that these complications have only been seen in patients with a shallow hip socket or hyperlaxity, both of which are exclusion criteria for this study.

Our hypothesis is that capsular repair, after cam FAI surgery, requiring moderate capsulotomy, would result in better patient outcomes, in the short, mid ad long term, both clinically and radiographically.
