  <interventions>
    <interventions>Paro is a robotic fluffy seal designed to act like an animal. Paro was designed to be used in a similar way to live animals during animal therapy  in elder care facilities. The intervention group has two 1  hour group sessions run by a caregiver with Paro each week for 12 weeks where each resident has the chance to interact with Paro and discuss the robot with others in the group. Caregivers have also been trained to use Paro with those in the group outside of activity sessions if a resident is upset</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group will have other activities provided by the residential care facility during the Paro intervention. Other activites that may be implemented are outings for residents and quizes and discussions in other parts of the rest home. As Paro will not be avaliable for use with the control group if a resident is upset standard care will be provided. Standard care means that staff members will try and calm residents by talking to them in a one on one situation and trying to find out the cause of the problem</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To evaluate the benefits of the companion robot Paro for use at an residential care facility. By randomly assigning residents to a control group or an intervention group where participant use Paro over 12 weeks the benefits of the robot on well being can be assessed over this period. It is expected that the robot will improve quality of life, reduce depression and loneliness over this time in comparison to residents who have no contact with the robot</summary>
