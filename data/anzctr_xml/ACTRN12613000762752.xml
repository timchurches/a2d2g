    <statisticalmethods>There are currently over 10,000 Australians on dialysis in the ANZDATA registry, and approximately 2,500 new patients  commence dialysis each year. Therefore over the 6-7 years since introduction of non calcium-based binders, we will be able to follow approximately 15,000 patients to death, transplantation or to the end of the study period.

Statistical analyses will include calculation of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates before and after the introduction of the non calcium-based phosphate binders and mortality rates will be examined within age and sex categories to examine changes in mortality within dialysis patient sub-groups.  Changes in the usage of non calcium-based phosphate binders will be examined overall and within dialysis patient sub-groups.  A series of survival analyses will then be conducted to examine whether there is a survival advantage conferred by the use of the newer drugs and these will include Cox models, controlling for covariates (such as presence of concomitant illness such as diabetes, age, dialysis vintage, hours and adequacy, use of other drugs that may influence mortality and centre effects), all of which may affect patient survival.   The analysis will be conducted using Excel and SPSS software packages.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a national, retrospective cohort study, which aims to determine if the introduction of non calcium-based phosphate binders sevelamer hydrochloride and lanthanum carbonate, since their PBS listing in 2007/2008, has been associated with a change in all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality.

We hypothesize that for patients on dialysis, most of whom require the use of phosphate binding medication, the progressive displacement of traditional calcium-based phosphate binders by the non calcium-based drugs sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) and lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenal) will have reduced cardiovascular and/or all-cause mortality after adjustment for covariates. </summary>
