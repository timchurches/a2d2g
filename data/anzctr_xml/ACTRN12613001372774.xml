  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clinical titration of NIPPV settings using daytime monitoring techniques (such as pulse oximetry, clinical assessment and daytime arterial blood gases where required).  These will be performed by an experienced respiratory physiotherapist under the supervision of a respiratory/sleep physician.  Clinical titration will occur during daylight hours (over typically 2-4hrs) on a single occasion.   After an acclimatisation period (2 weeks), those in the intervention group will undergo a single night in-lab attended polysomnography titration of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).  These will be performed and supervised by a sleep scientist and settings will be adjusted to optimise pulse oximetry, reduce hypoventilation and improve synchrony between the patient and the device.  Optimised settings will subsequently be determined by a sleep physician experienced in the use of NIPPV and interpretation of polysomnography studies.  Participants will continue to use NIPPV every night as prescribed before returning after 6 weeks for a PSG and repeat measures.</interventions>
    <comparator>Clinical titration of NIPPV settings using daytime monitoring techniques (such as pulse oximetry, clinical assessment and daytime arterial blood gases where required).  These will be performed by an experienced respiratory physiotherapist under the supervision of a respiratory/sleep physician.  Clinical titration will occur during daylight hours (over typically 2-4hrs) on a single occasion.  After an acclimatisation period (2 weeks), those in the control group will undergo a single night in-lab attended polysomnography (PSG) but without titration of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (ie a 'sham' PSG titration).  Those in the control arm will retain their original settings after the sham PSG.  Participants will continue to use NIPPV every night as prescribed before returning after 6 weeks for a PSG and repeat measures.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 32 (16 per group) would have 80% power (alpha = 0.05) to detect a 50% reduction in asynchrony index and a 70% in oxygen-desaturation index based on previous studies.  We intend to recruit 36 participants to our pilot study which will allow a 10% drop-out rate.  We intend to extend the study to recruit 110 participants to allow subgroup analyses. We plan to perform two-way ANOVA and multiple regression analysis.  A priori subgroups have been identified and include our diagnostic groups (ALS/MND, OHS, Other), those with severe bulbar symptoms, and those with early (prior to PSG) poor adherence.</statisticalmethods>
