Participants will continue to apply TCS cream (triamcenolone acetonide 0.1% or hydrocortisone 2.5% cream) twice daily to active skin lesions throughout the 12-week treatment period.

Experimental: Lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W + TCS Cream - Participants will receive lebrikizumab 125 mg SC every 4 weeks (Q4W) for a total of 3 doses. Participants will continue to apply TCS cream (triamcenolone acetonide 0.1% or hydrocortisone 2.5% cream) twice daily to active skin lesions throughout the 12-week treatment period.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo Q4W + TCS Cream - Participants will receive placebo Q4W for a total of 3 doses. Participants will continue to apply TCS cream (triamcenolone acetonide 0.1% or hydrocortisone 2.5% cream) twice daily to active skin lesions throughout the 12-week treatment period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of lebrikizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in adult participants with persistent
      moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) who are inadequately controlled by topical
      corticosteroids (TCS). The study includes a screening visit, a 2-week run-in period, a
      12-week blinded treatment period, and an 8-week safety follow-up period. Following screening
      visit, eligible participants will enter in run-in period (Days - 14 to - 1) during which a
      protocol-specified topical therapy regimen will be initiated. At the end of the run-in
      period, participants who have: 1) demonstrated compliance with the protocol-specified TCS
      regimen, and 2) who continue to fulfill the eligibility criteria will be randomized.</summary>
