  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pertuzumab

Experimental: Pertuzumab 1050 mg - Participants will not receive a loading dose, but will receive pertuzumab 1050 milligrams (mg) via intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Experimental: Pertuzumab 420 mg - Participants will receive a loading dose of 840 mg via IV infusion at the first infusion of pertuzumab, followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.


Treatment: drugs: Pertuzumab
Participants will receive one of two IV treatment regimens with pertuzumab: either 420 mg every 3 weeks, with an initial 840-mg loading dose, or 1050 mg every 3 weeks with no loading dose administered.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) - Objective tumor response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. The percentage of participants achieving a best overall response of CR or PR was calculated as [number of participants meeting the above criteria divided by the number analyzed] multiplied by 100.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 1 year (at Baseline; every 6 weeks for the first 8 cycles, then every 12 weeks until progression or death; and up to 4 weeks after initial response)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Response Among Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed CR or PR - Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST. Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response. Time to response was defined as the time from treatment start to first documented response (ie, CR or PR). Participants with stable disease (SD) were censored from the last tumor assessment, and those with progressive disease (PD) or death were assigned an artificial censoring time of 1000 days. Time to response was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and expressed in weeks.</outcome>

      <outcome>Duration of Response Among Participants Achieving a Best Overall Response of Confirmed CR or PR - Objective tumor response was assessed using RECIST. Confirmed CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, and confirmed PR was defined as at least at 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions. Response was to be confirmed at follow-up assessment completed within 4 weeks of the first documented response.

      <outcome>Apparent Half-Life (t1/2) of Pertuzumab - Serum samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment using a receptor-binding, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pertuzumab concentrations at each collection point were used to determine the apparent t1/2 by non-compartmental analysis, defined as the time elapsed for pertuzumab concentrations to decrease by 50%. The derived value was averaged among all participants and expressed in days.</outcome>

      <outcome>Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of Pertuzumab - Serum samples were obtained for PK assessment using a receptor-binding ELISA. Pertuzumab concentrations at each collection point were used to determine AUC to the last measurable observation (AUClast) and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUCinf) by non-compartmental analysis. The derived values were averaged among all participants and expressed in days by micrograms per milliliter (days*mcg/mL).</outcome>

Theoretically, LVEF may range from 0 to 100%. The number of participants experiencing a drop in LVEF greater than or equal to (=) 10 or 15 percentage points to a final LVEF of less than (&lt;) 50% is reported here.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab (rhuMAb 2C4) in participants
      with metastatic breast cancer which has progressed during or after standard chemotherapy and
      which is not amenable to curative therapy. Those who are maintaining a response to therapy or
      who have stable disease at the end of the formal study period will continue treatment until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 120 participants will be
      enrolled.</summary>
