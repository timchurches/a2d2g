  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Intervention treatment will be SR paracetamol 665 mg tabs (encapsulated) to be taken orally with water.

The patient will be randomly assigned to one drug. The patient will then be administerd the drug 3 to 4 times daily in a 3 day period. The drug will then be switched. The patient will then be administered the second drug 3 to 4 times daily for a 3 day period. The 6 day period is called a cycle. The cycle will be repeated 3 times.

A washout period will be registered on the first day of each 3 day period. On these day, pain scores will not be included in the final analysis.</interventions>
    <comparator>A matching placebo. The Placebo will be taken orally with water.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is an average pain score measured by a Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). This 11-point numerical scale encompasses an assessment of average pain, worst pain, pain right now and pain relief as well as the impact on daily functioning. The BPI has demonstrated reliability and validity across cultures and languages. A clinically significant response is a BPI average score reduction of 2 points from baseline score</outcome>
      <timepoint>The BPI will be measured 24 hours preceding the trial. The BPI will also be measured daily. The mean average pain scores of paracetamol cycles will be compared with the mean average pain scores in placebo cycles.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of breakthrough doses in a single day while patient is on trial. A breakthrough dose is defined as an unregular opiod dose required by the patient due to uncontrolled pain while on trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The breakthrough dose will be recorded by the patient daily in the patient diary. The number of regular opoid doses for the patient will be determined by there physicain before trial conmencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Patient Global Impression of Changes is a patient rated 7 point scale provides information about the patient perception of their change in pain, specifically their improvement since the commencement of the study. This
will allow the investigators to compare the pain rating using the Numerical Rating Scheme (NRS) with patient perception of improvement. The results of this scale over the study period will assist to determine the clinical significance of any improvement seen.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Patient Global Impression of Change will be measured at the end of each 6 day cycle. Consequently, measurements will be taken on day 6,12 and 18 of the trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A suitable candidate for the trial will be detected by physicians or research nurses in the palliative care wards and services in selected Queensland Hospitals. The patient will be given fully informed consent. Once consent is obtained, the patient will be screened to determine if the patient meets the selection/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the selective criteria, the patient will be given a script to be filled by the hospital pharmacy. The intervention and placebo will be packaged in identical bottles. The bottles will be defined by a set of numbers on the lid and bottle. The pharmacy will have a record of the bottle number and medication in that bottle. The order of intervetion is randomly determined within the pharmacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>The hospital pharmacy will use a randomly computer generated code to determine the randomisation of the intervention.</sequence>

    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This is a single patient trial. In a Single Patient trial, the patient typically undergoes 3 pairs of treatment periods. As paracetamol has a short half life, the clinical effect is rapidly evident. Therefore, an appropriate duration of each treatment period is 3 days (thus each treatment pair is 6 days), making a total of 18 days for patients who complete the full trial. (Patients who fail to complete the full trial will contribute completed cycles to the final analysis). In order to account for medication or placebo wash out, no measure of efficacy is taken on the first day of each 3-day period. The order of drugs in each cycle will be determined by random allocation, blinded to both clinician and patient. Patients complete a daily diary recording symptom scores using validated measures for dry mouth and related symptoms, the presence of any side effects, which treatment they prefer, and their estimate of which drug they believe they are taking at the time. At the end of the trial, the order of medications within each of the three cycles is unmasked, and compared with the patients observations. Repeated results in the same direction favouring the treatment can be reported in terms of a probability that the result is true. The clinical importance of the result is described by comparing the result to a predetermined clinically important change.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of paracetamol in relieving pain suffered by patients with advanced cancer taking regular opioids. It is hypothesised that 
1.	Paracetamol prescribed in addition to regular opioids will not improve analgesia compared to opioids alone in patients with pain from advanced cancer, and;
2.	combining n-of-1 trials from multiple subjects provides a feasible variation on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in palliative care (PC) to produce population evidence of high quality.</summary>
