  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In cesarean section operations for determination of anesthesia method besides the patients and the doctors preference, fetal condition is also important. Oxidative and antioxidative defense systems of body are in a balance normally. Situations in which an imbalance in favor of oxidative damage occurs are associated with serious disorders in newborn. Spinal anesthesia is the most widely used regional anesthesia method for cesarean section, leading to both increased sensitivity of newborn to oxidative stress and also increased maternal free oxygen radicals, and is the method which leads to uteroplacental hypoperfusion by causing hypotension and bradycardia and to increased ephedrine need. During epidural anesthesia complications like hypotension are less encountered and are less serious 
 The aim of our study is the comparison of the effect of spinal anesthesia on newborn fetal oxidative stress during elective cesarean section of parturients with normal pregnancy versus the effect of epidural anesthesia. For this aim Total Antioxidative Status (TAS), Total Oxidative Status (TOS), nitric oxide (NO) level obtained from blood sample taken from umbilical artery after clamping umbilical cord, arterial blood gas will be analysed.and 1st and 5th minute APGAR scores of the newborn will be assessed by a newborn pediatrician blind to the anesthesia type.</summary>
