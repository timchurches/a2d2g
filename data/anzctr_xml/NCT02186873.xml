    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Golimumab

Experimental: Treatment Group 1: Placebo then Golimumab - Participants will receive intravenous infusions of placebo at Weeks 0, 4 and 12. At Week 16, all participants receiving placebo will begin receiving intravenous infusions of golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) at Weeks 16, 20 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52.

Experimental: Treatment Group 2: Golimumab then Placebo - Participants will receive intravenous infusions of golimumab 2 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 4 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 16, participants will receive a placebo infusion to maintain the blind.


Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Participants will receive matching placebo.

Treatment: drugs: Golimumab
Participants will receive 2mg/kg of intravenous infusions of golimumab .

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving a 20 Percent Improvement in Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS 20) at Week 16 - A 20 percent (%) improvement in response according to the criteria of ASAS International Working Group is defined as; Improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20% from baseline and absolute improvement from baseline of at least 1 on a 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) scale in at least 3 of the following 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well, 10=very poor), Total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain, 10=most severe pain), Function (self-assessment represented as a mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life, Inflammation (0 to 10 cm; 0=none, 10=very severe); and absence of deterioration (worsening of &gt;=20% and at least 1 on a 0 to 10 cm scale) from baseline in the potential remaining domain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving a 40 Percent Improvement in Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS 40) at Week 16 - An ASAS 40 response is defined as &gt;=40% improvement in 3 of 4 domains: Patient's global assessment of disease activity (0 to 10 cm; 0=very well, 10=very poor), Total back pain (0 to 10 cm; 0=no pain, 10=most severe pain), Function (self-assessment represented as a mean (0 to 10 cm; 0=easy to 10=impossible) of 10 questions, 8 of which relate to the participant's functional anatomy and 2 of which relate to a participant's ability to cope with everyday life, Inflammation (0 to 10 cm; 0=none, 10=very severe) with an absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 cm scale, and no deterioration in the remaining domain.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least 50 Percent Improvement From Baseline in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at Week 16 - The BASDAI is a self-assessment tool to determine disease activity using a VAS of 0-10 cm (0=none and 10=very severe) participant's answered 6 questions measuring fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, enthesitis, and morning stiffness. The final BASDAI score calculates the individual assessments for a final score range of 0 to 10 cm; 0=best and 10=worst.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intravenously (administration of a
      fluid into the vein) administered golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) in participants
      with active ankylosing spondylitis (chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that
      involves the sacroiliac joints, and often the axial skeleton, entheses, and peripheral
      joints).</summary>
