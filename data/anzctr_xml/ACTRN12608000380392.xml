  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the active attention retraining task, the participants attention will be directed towards neutral stimuli and away from pain stimuli (affective, disability, threat and sensory pain words). The task will be administered via a computer program, and participants are required to press one of two keys in order to measure their reaction time towards the pain stimuli and neutral stimuli.  The attention retraining task takes approximately 25-30 minutes to complete, which includes time for breaks of one minute intervals between trials.  The attention retraining task will be administered to each participant on one occasion only, before their session with their physiotherapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the placebo attention retraining condition, the participants attention will be directed equally to both pain stimuli and neutral stimuli, and as such is thought to have no impact upon the participants outcomes. The placebo attention retraining task is also 25-30 minutes in duration. The placebo attention retraining task will be administered to each participant on one occasion only, before their session with their physiotherapist.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Development of chronic pain and related disability and distress. This outcome will be assessed by using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995), the Tampa Kinesiophobia Questionnaire (Tampa; Vlaeyen et al., 1995), the catastrophizing sub-scale of the Pain Responses Self-Statement Scale (PRSS-Cat; Flor et al., 1993), as well as the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ; Roland &amp; Morris, 1983). They will also be asked to rate their highest pain level and their average pain level during the past three or six month period on a visual analogue scale. Finally, a telephone interview will also be conducted at each of these time points in order to determine the nature of the participant's pain, whether they are taking any pain medications or have seen a health care provider for their pain, and their current work status. The results obtained at three, six and 12 months will be compared to initial measures, and in particular the outcome measure sof participants who received the active attention re-training will be compared to those who received the placebo attention retraining, in order to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. That is, does exposure to the active attention retraining task prevent the develop of chronic low back pain?</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be followed up at three, six and 12 months after their initial assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attentional bias using the dot probe computer task</outcome>
      <timepoint>The impact of the attention retraining tasks upon attentional bias is measured at the initial assessment point. Attention bias is measured, then the attention retraining task delivered, and then attention bias is re-measured.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research aims to test the leading theory of chronic pain, and to develop and test interventions aimed to reduce chronic pain. We will measure attentional biases to pain-related stimuli, such as hypervigilance (selectively paying more attention) and difficulty disengaging, in a group of adults with acute low back pain. We will then compare the effect of an active and placebo attention retraining task on these attentional biases, and the subsequent effects on the development of chronic low back pain and associated disability and distress.</summary>
