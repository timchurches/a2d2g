  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls belong to large geriatric problems and it is estimated that every 3rd person over the age of 65 years, and every 2nd person over the age of 80 years is falling. The consequences of the fall are often very complex. Its effects can be seen in several aspects and in the medical one falls are direct causes of fractures, what leads also to more serious problems.

The purpose of this study is impact assessment of a 6-month rehabilitation program on possibility to stand up after falling, risk of falling and in addition functional health improvement of University of the Third Age students.

The study hypothesis are: the possibility to stand up after falling is more effective in a study group who took part in 6-month rehabilitation program and risk of falling is much lower.
