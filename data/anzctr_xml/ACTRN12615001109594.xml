  <interventions>
    <interventions>To evaluate the effect of Star Wars music (SW) compared to endoscopist-selected
popular music (PM) on quality outcomes in colonoscopy
Patients would be randomised  using a coin toss by the endoscopist prior to colonoscopy to determine which music would be played; heads for Star Wars music (SW), tails for
endoscopist- selected popular music (PM), which includes music of all genres but  that are part of the endoscopist's list  with the exception of epic movie soundtracks. These would be stored on the same personal computer used in the endoscopy room with each endoscopist having his own popular music selection. 

The music would be played through a personal computer in the endoscopy suite at a volume of between approximately 40 and 70 decibels and would be started  just prior to commencement of the colonoscopy,after patient were sedated, and stopped upon finishing the procedure. 

Patients Would be blinded to the music type being used.

There are Five endoscopists participating in the study, one consultant with more than ten years experience and four specialist registrars with one to two years experience.
All colonoscopies were performed under anaesthetist administered monitored sedation with intravenous propofol.
An independent member of the endoscopy team keeps timing of procedures
and endoscopists are blinded to the timing of the procedure. Timing of the procedure is commenced at time of entering the anus and continued until the scope is 
withdrawn from the colon.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group includs patients in whom the coin toss results in tails. The music that would be played is endoscopist-selected popular music (PM),which includes music of all genres but  that are part of the endoscopist's list  with the exception of epic movie soundtracks
As above the music would be played through a personal computer in the endoscopy suite at a volume of between approximately 40 and 70 decibels and would be started  just prior to commencement of the colonoscopy,after patient were sedated, and stopped upon finishing the procedure. 

These would be stored on the same personal computer used in the endoscopy room.

Everything else would be measured and carried out the same way as in the intervention group.

Patients Would blinded to the music type being used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of music in the operating theatre has been longstanding with reports of its potential therapeutic effects dating back to the 1940s. Music therapy prior to and during an operation have been shown to reduce anaesthetic requirement, patient anxiety, and improve overall satisfaction. There is also evidence that proceduralist-selected music improves surgical skill acquisition.
In gastrointestinal endoscopy, music has shown benefits for patients, however, there is
no data on the effects of music on improving the performance of endoscopists and whether a specific style of music would lead to optimal performance. This is particularly relevant in an era where high volumes of endoscopic procedures are performed in an often stressful clinical environment and procedural outcomes, such as adenoma detection rate (ADR) in colonoscopy, are reported as validated benchmarks of quality endoscopy.
The appropriate style of music to use and avoid in the operating theatre has been previously proposed, but there was an absence of music from epic movies on this list.
Thesoundtracks from these movies often contain uplifting musical tracks associated with glory,success, and large scale victory
We hypothesise that music from the epic movie Star Wars would be superior to endoscopist-selected popular music when measuring quality outcomes in colonoscopy.

    <publicnotes>Given we are avid fans of the Star Wars movies (Lucasfilms,
San Francisco, USA) and with the imminent release of the latest instalment, Star Wars: The
Force Awakens, we felt it would be important and timely to evaluate the effect of music
from the Star Wars soundtrack in colonoscopy.
It follows, individuals from the baby boomer generation, many of whom were fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, are approaching the appropriate age to undergo bowel cancer screening. It is therefore essential that strategies to enhance quality outcomes in colonoscopy are evaluated.
We did such a study where we radomized patients undergoing colonoscopies to either star wars music being played or music from other genre that the endoscopist had on their playlist , other than epic movie soundracks.Our aim was to get the data and present our results prior to the release of the new star wars movie " The force awakens". 
We initially began collecting data assuming that the study would not require ethics approval given that the use of music in the endoscopy suite is common practice and a  safe  intervention.  After discussion with our ethics department, it was determined that it would be best practice to obtain an ethics evaluation and approval for the study, but given that the data collected was standard measures of the quality of endoscopy that the unit would routinely record, the data collected was not void of inclusion in our study.</publicnotes>
