  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stubbing of the finger-tip is a common injury in sports such as basketball, volleyball, cricket and football. This can result in a Mallet finger deformity, where the end joint of a finger cannot be actively straightened out. In most mallet finger cases seen at The Alfred, the skin remains intact, and the impairment results from a tear of the extensor tendon or an avulsion (a small fracture where the tendon attaches to the bone). Treatment commonly involves immobilising the end joint of the finger in a splint for six or more weeks so patient compliance is a major factor in the quality of the outcome achieved. 

This study aims to compare two different types of splintage (the commonly used thermoplastic thimble splint and the aluminium-foam Mexican hat splint which is in use in Britain) with a control splint (thermoplastic prefabricated stack splint with tape). Outcome measures will include patient compliance with the splint, degree of extensor lag, active movement of the joint, and any complications.</summary>
