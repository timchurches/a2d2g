  <interventions>
    <interventions>Carbon dioxide (a medicinal gas) was drawn  from a CO2 tank and delivery system to  a receptacle and then passed intermitently through the endoscope during the colonoscopy at the control of the endoscopist pressing a button on the hand piece of the endoscope. The intention of gas is to insufflate the colon during colonoscopy. </interventions>
    <comparator>` standard treatment` was insufflation of room air drawn from a receptacle (called the air/water bottle), to the endoscope and passed intermitently through the endoscope at the control of the endoscopist pressing a button on the hand piece of the endoscope.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine that carbon dioxide (CO2) , instead of air insufflated during colonoscopy reduces pain experienced by patients post colonoscopy.
the Hypothesis: Those receiving carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation during colonscopy will experience less post colonoscopy pain than those receiving air insufflation.</summary>
