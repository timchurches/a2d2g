  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with severe sepsis/septic shock, admitted to the ICU, will be studied during 24 hrs. Blood will be sampled repeatedly (at arrival to ICU, at 1, 2, 4, 8-12 and 24 hrs after the first sample) for assessment of albumin, markers of endothelial injury and markers of inflammation. Samples will also be taken from any patient excretions and from intravenously infused blood products. Baseline plasma volume will be calculated by anthropometry. The sum of all blood samples will not exceed 20 ml.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>cumulative albumin shift, i.e. loss of albumin from the blood not explained by bleeding or other external losses. By repeated measurements of blood hemoglobin and plasma albumin, combined with meticulous assessment of gained and lost albumin and hemoglobin, it is possible to compare losses of albumin with losses of hemoglobin. In a previous study in surgical patients, albumin was lost to a higher amount, i.e. the cumulative albumin shift, presumably to the extracellular space. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Normality of data will be assessed by Sharpio-Wilks test of normality and parametric or non-parametric analysis applied accordingly. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by t-test or Wilcoxon, as appropriate. Likewise correlations will be reported as Pearsons correlation coefficient r or Spearman's rank correlation rs.
Demographic preoperative data such as age, height, weight, BMI, gender, routine lab, history of weight loss, diagnoses, and current medications will be presented as numbers, averages and standard deviation, or as median range as applicable.
In a previous study in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge the cumulative loss of albumin at the end of surgery was 24 +/- 17 g that was not explained by bleeding. The situation in septic ICU patients has not previously been described by mass balance of albumin to our knowledge. The Transcapillary escape rate of albumin is elevated, but if this is accompanied by a decreased return of lymph to the blood is not known. Because large body weight gain and an increased capillary leakage have been demonstrated by other techniques, it seems likely that albumin is accumulated outside the blood. If, by the present routine, the same amount is lost during the first 24 hrs as during major surgery, i.e. 24 +/- 17 g albumin,  this corresponds to a effect size of 1.4 (difference divided by standard deviation). Then only n=8 patients are necessary to reach a statistical power of 90%. Because ICU patients are likely to have a larger variation, we aim at 10 evaluable patients. Furthermore, in the absence of a true baseline, it is important to take the first blood sample at the earliest possible instant. 
Under "recruitment" (step 7) we specify the total number of patients to 20. Death, transfer to other hospitals or extreme outliers are possible, and we aim at 10 fully evaluable patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Septic shock is a leading cause of hospital mortality. Manifest circulatory instability characterizes septic shock, and intravenous infusion of fluids is a cornerstone in the treatment, to maintain blood pressure and blood flow to vital organs. However, the fluid will to some part leak into the interstitial space causing edema, and the size of this weight gain is correlated to mortality and morbidity. 
Plasma albumin (P-alb) is a negative phase reactant. The effect of albumin is reported to be no more harmful than that of normal saline, but the volume sparing effect of albumin is small in ICU patients. An increased rate of leakage of albumin from the vascular system in septic patients has been demonstrated, but the return of proteins and fluid by the lymphatic system is impossible to measure directly. However, the combined effect of leakage and return can be assessed by albumin mass balance. Thus, the relationship between the negative phase reactant plasma albumin and the amount of albumin accumulating outside the blood vessels can be estimated and increase our knowledge of our present fluid treatment effects.  
We have previously demonstrated albumin leakage from the blood stream in major abdominal surgery by albumin mass balance describing the relationship between albumin within and outside the vascular system perioperatively. We want to apply the same technique to septic ICU patients.
In this observational study we investigate patients with severe sepsis/septic shock. We will collect blood samples during the first 24 hrs in ICU and quantify cumulative albumin shift, i.e. the amount of albumin accumulating supposedly in the extracellular space. We will also characterize markers of endothelial injury (components of the glycocalyx), markers of inflammations (interleukins) and indices of volume status (fluid balance, weight gain, rate of infusions). Finally all these indices will be correlated to albumin kinetic parameters to generate hypothesis for future studies.
The overall aim of our research program is to define the role of albumin in modern fluid therapy. This study is an important step to understand the effects of our present fluid strategy on the vasculature, and to generate new hypotheses on the mechanisms. Future studies will depend on these results.
