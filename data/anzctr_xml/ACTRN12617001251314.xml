  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study duration for each subject involved in the study will be up to 202 days. This includes the following:
	Screening period (28 days)
	Oral risperidone (2 mg/day)  tolerability assessment (3 days);
	Oral risperidone (1 mg/day)  PK assessment (11 days);
	Washout (not less than 1 day, not more than 30 days);
	DLP-114 implant treatment (123 days);
	Follow-up (7 Days).

The study durg DLP-114 is a Risperidone Para-aminobenzoate Implant that is a combination drug-device product designed to continuously elute the equivalent of a daily 1 mg oral dose of risperidone following subcutaneous implantation. 

The DLP-114 device will be implanted in the medial aspect of the upper arm halfway between the elbow and the shoulder, in line with the crease between the biceps and triceps muscles, using a sterile disposable implanter tool and local anesthesia in a minimally invasive procedure identical to that of other approved drug device products.
The device will remain implanted for 123 days. 
Upon completion of the implant treatment period, the device will be removed by a qualified medical officer.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This study will assess the safety of DLP-114. 
Safety will be determined by evaluating physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters, and adverse events. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for hematology, serum chemistry (fasted) to be collected at screening and prior to each oral risperidone dose during the oral risperidone treatment phase. Samples for this test during the implant treatment period will be collected at outpatient visits at Day 4, Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, Day 35, Day 42, Day 49, Day 56, Day 63, Day 70, Day 77, Day 84, Day 91, Day 98, Day 105, Day 112 and Day 126, Coagulation will only be performed at screening. Lipid panel (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, non-HDL and triglycerides) will only be performed at screening, Day -15 (pre-dose), Day -1, Days 35, 63, 91 and 123. If lipid profile is clinically significant on Day 123, it will also be conducted on Day 130.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This study will also assess the tolerability of DLP-114. 
Local tolerance at the implantation site will be examined and scored for severity of visible signs of irritation/inflammation. 
Implantation site inspection will be by visual examination at each assessment visit. Healing of the incision will be monitored. Dermal reactions will be scored on a skin irritation scale. Skin Irritation Scoring System recommended for transdermal dosage forms that describes the amount of erythema, edema, and other features indicative of irritation.

Skin Irritation Scoring System:
Dermal Response:
0 = no evidence of irritation
1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible
2 = definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal popular response
3 = erythema and papules
4 = definite edema
5 = erythema, edema, and papules
6 = vesicular eruption
7 = strong reaction spreading beyond test site
Other Effects:
A = slight glazed appearance
B = marked glazing
C = glazing with peeling and cracking
F = glazing with fissures
G = film of dried serous exudate covering all or part of the patch* site
H = small petechial erosions and/or scabs</outcome>

The percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent Adverse Events will be summarized for each treatment. Laboratory data will be summarized by the type of laboratory test. Normal reference ranges and markedly abnormal results will be used in the summary of laboratory data. Raw data and change from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. A listing of subjects with any laboratory results outside the reference ranges that are deemed clinically significant will be provided.

Pharmacokinetic Data:
Listing of individual subject plasma concentrations, actual blood sampling times, and PK parameters and graphs of concentration vs. time will be prepared by study treatment. Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized by and compared between study treatments using descriptive statistics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a first-in-man clinical study of DLP-114, a Risperidone Para-aminobenzoate Implant product. The study is an open-label, single sequence design aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of DLP-114 and evaluating its utility in achieving a PK profile that is comparable to the marketed oral form of risperidone.

Healthy volunteers will be enrolled implanted with DLP-114 in groups of up to 3 volunteers per group. The first group of 3 healthy volunteers to receive the DLP-114 implant will be a sentinel group. The safety and tolerability of the DLP-114 implant will be assessed in the sentinel group for at least 28 days prior to any other volunteers being dosed implanted with DLP-114 in the study. Only if the safety and tolerability data, obtained from the sentinel group, are considered acceptable by the investigator and the sponsor, will the remainder of healthy volunteers commence implant treatment in the study.

Treatment of each subject will be conducted in five sequential periods:
1.	Oral risperidone (2 mg/day)  tolerability assessment;
2.	Oral risperidone (1 mg/day)  PK assessment;
3.	Washout;
4.	DLP-114 implant treatment;
5.	Follow-up.
