    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Number of Responders According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response Criteria at Week 12 Involving the Comparison of Adalimumab 80 mg Monthly Dose Versus Placebo and Adalimumab 40 mg Every Other Week (Eow) - Comparison of adalimumab 80 mg monthly dose versus placebo and adalimumab 40 mg eow in the number of responders with ACR criteria improvement consisting of 20%, (ACR20) reduction in tender or swollen joint counts (TJC or SJC, respectively) and 20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 criteria: [1] physician's global assessment of disease activity (PGA), [2] subject's assessment of disease activity, [3] subject's assessment of pain, [4] subject's assessment of physical disability via a health assessment questionnaire disability index(HAQ-DI), and [5] C-reactive protein (CRP) at each visit</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Within Group Mean Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12 (Observed) - The HAQ-DI is a self-reported subject measure of physical function calculated as the mean of 8 category scores: Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. Each category score is calculated as the maximum of the scores for the questions within the category. The HAQ-DI is expressed on a scale of 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do) representing an average score across the category. Scores for at least 6 categories are needed to compute the HAQ score. Changes to lower scores indicate improvement in physical function.</outcome>
