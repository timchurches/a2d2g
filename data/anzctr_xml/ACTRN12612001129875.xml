  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1): the virtual reality group. Participants in the Wii group played publicly available software packages, such as Wii Sport Resort. Games were preselected according to each participants motor level, and the movement patterns used in the games were compatible with their conventional occupational therapy. The equipment used in the Wii group consisted of standard gadgets, including the Nintendo Wii console, four Wii controllers, four motion-plus controllers, a home projector and a screen. The virtual reality treatment is supervised by an experienced occupational therapist.
Treatment duration: three weeks (three sessions per week, one hour per session)</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2) the conventional group: standard occupational therapy ; 
Group 3) the placebo board game group: mahjong, cards, and checkers;  
Group 4) the no treatment control group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was a randomized, single blind and placebo-controlled trial with four parallel groups receiving three-week treatments. Participants were assigned to one of four groups: 1) VR via Wii gaming; 2) conventional occupational therapy; 3) a placebo board game; 4) no treatment. The training effects were evaluated immediately after and four weeks after treatment. Electromyography activity and motivation inventory were the main and secondary outcome measurements. The hypothesis of the current study is that off-the-shelf virtual reality treatment imrpoves muscle activation perofrmance and treatment motivation.</summary>
