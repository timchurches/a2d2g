    <interventions>Laparoscopic pelvic organ prolapse suspension by prolene mesh slinging of the vagina, rectum and bladder together with 9 volt direct current electrical stimulation of S3 nerve using one month interstim sacral neurostimulator in patients with fecal incontinence due to perineal descent. Procedure duration approximately 120 minutes.the interstim sacral neurostimulator is only inserted at surgery in those patients with symptoms of fecal incontinence. and the device remains in situ, i.e. in the body for one month. Sacral nerve stimulation is done only if there are symptoms of fecal incontinence (wexner score less than 16). the stimulation is continuous for one month by 8 Hertz start immediately after surgery. patients without symptoms of fecal incontinence, will have Laparoscopic pelvic organ prolapse suspension only.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the normal individual the anorectal angle is a factor in maintaining faecal continence. If intra-abdominal pressure is transmitted to the anterior rectal wall, for example during coughing or sneezing, mucosa will be forced onto the upper part of the anal canal to form a flap-valve.
In patients with the descending perineum syndrome, the anorectal angle is disrupted because it lies at a lower level than normal . Although Hardcastle and Parks defined the descending perineum syndrome in terms of the position of the anorectal angle as demonstrated by radiographic techniques, the syndrome can be recognized by the observation that the perineum 'balloons' below the bony outlet of the pelvis during a straining effort.
Perineal descent occurs in many patients with primary (idiopathic) faecal incontinence. Histological and electrophysiological investigations of the pelvic floor and external anal sphincter muscles have indicated that incontinence can result from damage to the nerve supply of these muscles, and it is possible that these nerves are stretched during perineal descent on straining.  In patients with perineal descent, the perineum descended abnormally during straining by approximately 2cm and we estimate that this could represent a stretch of the pudendal nerves of 20 per cent over the normal length. Since irreversible damage occurs when nerves are stretched by as little as 12 per cent, it is possible that perineal descent may lead to nerve damage, and so to denervation of the pelvic floor musculature. Although the pudendal nerves are the major source of innervation of the external anal sphincter. they do not innervate the puborectalis muscle which is supplied by direct branches from S3 and S4 that lie above the pelvic floor. In patients with perineal descent both the pudendal and the direct branches of the sacral plexus could be involved in a traction injury.
Alternatively, the sacral nerve damage could occur as a primary event. Loss of muscle tone in the pelvic floor muscles might then lead to pelvic floor descent as a secondary process. 
Patients with perineal descent frequently present with coexistent anorectal conditions such as mucosal or haemorrhoidal prolapse. Any procedures that might lead to further damage to the anal sphincter musculature, such as manual dilatation of the anus or sphincterotomy, should be avoided in these patients since they may increase the risk of incontinence developing later.
Pelvic organ prolapsed suspension can solve the anatomical problem of prolapsed pelvic organs, however no data if it can solve the problem of descending perineum syndrome, we need also a solution for the pelvic floor and anal sphincter denervation that might accompany the descending perineum syndrome
Patients and Methods:
30 patients with descending perineal syndrome will be treated by laparoscopic POPS with or without sacral nerve stimulation (SNS)
All patients will have laparoscopic POPS
Patients with anal incontinence will have additional  SNS
Laparoscopic pelvic organ prolapse suspension by prolene mesh slinging of the vagina, rectum and bladder together with 9 volt direct current electrical stimulation of S3 nerve using one month interstim sacral neurostimulator in patients with fecal incontinence due to perineal descent. Procedure duration approximately 120 minute
Purpose of the study is to assess the effect of pelvic organ prolapse suspension with or without sacral nerve stimulation on the symptoms of obstructed defecation and/or fecal incontinence in perineal descent syndrome. Study hypothesis: pelvic organ suspension can correct symptoms of obstructed defecation and sacral nerve stimulation can correct fecal incontinence in female patients with perineal descent syndrome</summary>
