  <interventions>
    <interventions>The specific exercise involves a low load craniocervical flexion motion (i.e. similar to a chin nod) in lying twice per day and a correction of posture for 10 seconds twice per hour during waking hours. For progression the number of repetitions and the target load for the craniocervical flexion task will be incremented as performance improves. The accuracy of exercise will be monitored by a physiotherapist every week. The exercise will be continued for 3 months. Adherence to the exercises will be assessed based on self-reported overall compliance rate.     </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: The neck muscles support and protect the neck and normally are activated as soon as arm muscles are activated when we move our arms. However, the onset of the neck muscles including the deep and superficial neck flexor muscles in comparison to the onset of deltoid muscles (relative latency) is delayed in people with neck pain relative to pain-free individuals. In a previous study it was shown that the relative latency of the onset of the deep neck flexors was improved by a specific low load neck exercise, which was practised for six weeks. However, the relative latency of the onset of deep neck flexors remained delayed in comparison to asymptomatic subjects. This was interpreted to indicate a persistent deficit in timing of activation of these muscles. We therefore question whether the onset of the neck muscles can be further improved to match that of pain-free individuals if the exercise is continued for a longer time. This information is very important for ideal prescription of exercises for people with neck pain and could be relevant for prevention of further episodes of neck pain. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the onset of activation of the neck flexor muscles can be further improved, than has been shown previously, by extension of the period of training with the specific low load neck exercise.
Subjects: Nine individuals with idiopathic neck pain has been included.
Measures: Myoelectric activity of the deep and superficial neck flexor muscles have been recorded using surface electromyography (EMG). The onset of activity of the neck muscles in a quick arm movement task has been assessed as the primary outcome measure. 
Procedures: EMG measures have been assessed at baseline before starting 3-month exercise training and then every 4 weeks up to 4 months. Participants have been taught a low load home exercise that is designed to gently and precisely activate the deep neck flexor muscles. The exercise training involves a low intensity upper cervical flexion motion (i.e. similar to a chin nod) in lying twice a day and correcting posture twice per hour. For progression of the exercise the number of repetitions and the target load has been  increased as the patients were able. The accuracy of the home exercise has been  checked every week by a specialist physiotherapist. </summary>
