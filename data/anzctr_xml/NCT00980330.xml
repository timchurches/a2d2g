    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of different
      regimens of TMC435 with standard treatment compared to standard treatment alone in
      participants with chronic, genotype 1, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who has failed
      previous treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-INF-alfa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV).</summary>
