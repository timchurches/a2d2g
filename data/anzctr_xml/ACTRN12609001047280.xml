  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single Event Multilevel Surgery is the orthopaedic surgical program of simultaneous correction of musculoskeletal contractures and deformities in the lower limbs of children with cerebral palsy. This involves multiple surgical procedures to lengthen muscles and correct bony deformity. This is individualized to each participant based on physical findings and the results of instrumented gait analysis. It is expected that there will be an improvment in the participant's walking ability and motor function. Following initial assessment participants will be randomised to one of two groups. The first group will proceed to surgery straight away, the second group (control) will receive their suregry in 12 months time. This intervention is a once off procedure. Surgery is followed by a period of restricted mobilty, then fan intensive rehabilitation program with physiotherapy 3 times per week for a 3 month period. Following surgery the participants will be assessed at 3 months intervals, for 12 months. They will then have one further follow up at 24 months post the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>The group in which surgery is delayed by 12 months (control group) will undertake a progressive resistance strength training(PRST) program This is used in the control group to match the intensive rehabilitation received by the treatment group following surgery. These participants will undertake a 3 times per week PRST program with their physiotherapist for 12 weeks with each session lasting up to an hour. This is carried out between 3-6 months period in the trial. The expected outcome in the control group is no change in gait or function over the 12month study period. The control group participants will be assessed at 3 monthly intervals, for 12 months. The control group will then proceed to surgery.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Single event Multilevel surgery, usually called SEMLS is a program that involves more than one operation on bones and or muscles carried out at the same time. The surgery is to correct problems that stop you being able to stand up straight and walk properly. The benefit of having the operations all at one time is that you only need to come into hospital once and be put to sleep once. No one has ever proved that the surgery is successful or measured exactly what differences the surgery makes. this is the aim of this study.
To do this we are dividing the children who are going to have surgery into two groups. The timing of the surgery is not that important so one group will have surgery now and the other in a year's time. We will monitor both groups over this year allowing us to compare progress in both groups.</summary>
