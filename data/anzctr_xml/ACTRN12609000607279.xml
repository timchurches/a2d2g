    <interventions>Educational booklet and multifaceted intervention to encourage reading of the booklet.
The booklet, Sports Bra Fitness was designed to educate female athletes on the components of a well-fitted, well-designed and supportive bra appropriate to their athletic pursuits. It was intended primarily to guide the reader in selecting and fitting the next bra they purchased 
The booklet was given to each of the experimental group participants after the baseline measurement. It contained targeted key messages and photos of high-profile academy athletes and coaches to act as role models. Focus group were used its it development.  All testing was performed by the same assessor, a sports physiotherapist during either physical training or competition, where reminders were given to read the booklet. Testing at baseline, 1-month and 4-months involved the completion of a  custom-designed 50-question self-administered survey sought information on different bra designs, bras component parts, bra sizing, as well as questions related to correct and incorrect bra fit and bra wearing habits.  Responses included multiple choice options, true/false and short answer questions.  An "I do not know?" response was offered for every question and face validity tests were conducted through focus groups.  Testing at baseline and 4-months also involved a physical bra fit and level of breast support test by the one assessor.  This was performed in a chnage room taking approximately 5 minutes.
The Bra Fit Assessment test evaluated the fit of six bra components: the front band, posterior band, side band, cups, straps and underwire.  If one or more of these six components were rated a fail grade in fit, and the straps or the band could not be adjusted by the assessor to achieve correct fit, an overall fail grade was awarded.  

The Level of Breast Support test was ranked a pass or fail grade, taking into consideration the design and lifespan of the bra relative to the participant's breast size and level of physical activity.  The participants were also asked to rate their exercise-induced breast discomfort when wearing this bra during their sport, using a visual analogue scale (VAS, 1-10 cm). 

Reminders were also given during a phone call to confirm attendance at the final testing session. The relationship formed with the physiotherapist throughout the duration of the trial assisted to remove the possible barrier of embarrassment when discussing the potentially sensitive issue of breast support and bra fit.</interventions>

    <sequence>Seven regional academies of sport were contacted by phone requesting the  involvement of their female hockey and netball squads in the study. Four responded postitively, 2 declined and 1 was excluded as they had just received bra fit education from a bra manufacturer.
The 4 academies were then randomised into a control or experimental group by a simple randomisation using a randomization table created by a computer software.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to investigate whether an educational intervention could improve the bra knowledge and bra-wearing behaviour of active adolescent females.  It was hypothesised that, compared to a control group who did not receive an intervention, the experimental group would significantly improve their: (i) knowledge of bra fit and bra design, and (ii) ability to select a supportive, correctly fitted bra appropriate to their level of sport and breast size.</summary>
