  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Cardiva
      VASCADE Vascular Closure System (VCS) in sealing femoral arterial access sites. Hypothesis:
      The Cardiva VASCADE VCS provides times to hemostasis (TTH) and time to ambulation (TTA)
      results that are less than manual compression by a clinically meaningful and statistically
      significant margin. The rate of major access site-related complications with the Cardiva
      VASCADE VCS is non-inferior to the major complication rates of manual compression for
      sealing femoral arterial access sites.</summary>
