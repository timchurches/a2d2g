  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Provide written informed consent signed by the subject or legal guardian prior to
             entering the study or undergoing any study procedures (If the written informed consent
             is provided by the legal guardian because the subject is unable to do so, a written or
             verbal assent from the subject must also be obtained.).

          2. Be considered reliable and willing to be available for the study period and able to
             record seizures and report AEs them self or have a caregiver who can record seizures
             and report AEs for them;

          3. Male or female and greater than or equal to 12 years of age (within the course of the
             study), or greater than or equal to 18 years of age (depending on location) at the
             time of signing the informed consent.

          4. Females should be either of non-childbearing potential (defined as having undergone
             surgical sterilization, or postmenopausal [age 50 and amenorrheic for 12 months]) or
             of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative
             serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (ÃŸ-hCG) at Visit 1 and a negative urine
             pregnancy test prior to randomization at Visit 2. Female subjects of childbearing
             potential must agree to be abstinent or to use at least 1 medically acceptable methods
             of contraception (eg, a double-barrier method [eg, condom + spermicide, condom +
             diaphragm with spermicide], IUD, or have a vasectomised partner) starting at Visit 1
             and throughout the entire study period and for 2 months after the last dose of study
             drug. Those women using hormonal contraceptives must also be using an additional
             approved method of contraception (as described previously) starting at Visit 1 and
             continuing throughout the entire study period and for 2 months after the last dose of
             study drug. (It is not required for male subjects to use contraceptive measures based
             on preclinical toxicology data.);

          5. Have a diagnosis of epilepsy with partial seizures with or without secondarily
             generalized seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy's
             Classification of Epileptic Seizures (1981). Diagnosis should have been established by
             clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is consistent with
             localization-related epilepsy; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided that
             the subject meets the other diagnosis criterion (ie, clinical history);

          6. Have had a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within the
             last 10 years that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy;

          7. Have uncontrolled partial seizures despite having been treated with at least 2
             different anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) within approximately the last 2 years;

          8. During the 6-week Pre-randomization Phase subjects must have had &gt;/= 5 partial
             seizures per 6-week (with &gt;/=2 partial seizures per each of 3-week period) and with no
             25-day seizure-free period in the 6-week period, as documented via a valid seizure
             diary. Only simple partial seizures with motor signs, complex partial seizures, and
             complex partial seizures with secondary generalization are counted toward this
             inclusion;

          9. Are currently being treated with stable doses of 1, 2 or a maximum of 3 approved AEDs.
             Only 1 inducer AED (defined as; carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or primidone
             only) out of the maximum of 3 AEDs is allowed;

         10. Are on a stable dose of the same concomitant AED(s) for 1 month (or no less than 21
             days) prior to Visit 1; in the case where a new AED regime has been initiated for a
             subject, the dose must be stable for 2 months (or no less than 49 days) prior to Visit
             1;

         11. If on a stable dose (other than intermittent rescue use) of benzodiazepines for
             epilepsy (or for anxiety or sleep disorders) the prescribed dose must be stable for 1
             month (or no less than 21 days) prior to Visit 1. (Note: the use of intermittent
             rescue benzodiazepines is defined in the exclusion criterion #22 below.) When used in
             these cases (epilepsy, anxiety or sleep disorders), benzodiazepines will be counted as
             1 AED; therefore, only 1 or a maximum of 2 additional approved AEDs will be allowed;

         12. A vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) is allowed but it must have been implanted &gt;/= 5 months
             prior to Visit 1. Stimulator parameters can not be changed for 1 month (or no less
             than 21 days) prior to Visit 1 or thereafter during the study.</inclusivecriteria>

             affect the subject's safety or the study conduct;

         11. Scheduled and/or confirmed to have epilepsy surgery within 6 months after Visit 1;
             however those who have previously documented "failed" epilepsy surgery will be
             allowed;

         12. Evidence of significant active hepatic disease. Stable elevations of liver enzymes,
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) due to

             CNS diseases and progressive tumors;

         17. History of drug or alcohol dependency or abuse within approximately the last 2 years;

         18. Have had multiple drug allergies or a severe drug reaction to an AED(s), including
             dermatological (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), hematological, or organ toxicity
             reactions;

         19. If felbamate is used as a concomitant AED, subjects must be on felbamate for at least
             2 years, with a stable dose for 2 months (or no less than 49 days) prior to Visit 1.

             visual perimetry test;

         21. Concomitant use of barbiturates (except for seizure control indication) within 1 month
             (or no less than 21 days) prior to Visit 1;
