    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir

Experimental: Hepatitis C treatment - All prisoners (in participating correctional centres) with hepatitis c, as identified during the hepatitis C surveillance phase of the study will be offered treatment for hepatitis C. The treatment course is sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400/100mg for 12 weeks (1 tablet once daily).


Treatment: drugs: Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
The treatment phase will commence in year 2. This is 12 weeks of the pangenotypic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400/100mg, coformulated into one tablet daily.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess how feasible it is to treat and prevent the
      transmission of Hepatitis C in the prison setting to achieve substantial reductions in the
      incidence and prevalence of Hepatitis C.

      It is hypothesised that a rapid scale-up of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) treatment with
      interferon-free Direct Acting Anti-virals (DAAs) in prison inmates will achieve a &gt;50%
      reduction in the incidence of HCV infection over a two year period in the prison setting.</summary>
