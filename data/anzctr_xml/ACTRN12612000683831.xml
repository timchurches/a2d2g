  <interventions>
    <interventions>this trial aim to study the effect of topical Mitomycin C application on esophageal stricture site after dilating it endoscopically, aiming to decrease incidence of reccurrence and refibrosis.
Mitomycin C dose is prepared to use a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml then piece of gauze soaked with this solution is applied on stricture site for 5 minutes.
standard protocol is to do dilatation session every 2 weeks for 3 months then session every month for next 3 months
each session of dilatation take about 10 minutes
in the first session, dilation is done and assessment of stricture length is done 
in the second dilation session, dilatation followed by Mitomycin/placebo application is done "application take 5 minutes"
in the following sessions, dilatation only is done</interventions>
    <comparator>placebo (prepared by the pharmacist to have the same physical characteristics without the active ingredient and both mitomycin and placebo were applied by the same technique and for the same time"</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
