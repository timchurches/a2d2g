  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention participants will receive 7 online modules, by email, on study enrolment. The modules, based on established principles of successful vocational rehabilitation, include 1 introductory module and 6 learning modules (see below). Each module has hyperlinks to activity worksheets and online resources. The modules are self-paced although should take no more than 20 minutes, each, to complete. In addition, participants will receive proactive, standardised email prompts once weekly over the 4 week intervention period from a trained moderator (Clinical Psychologist, &gt; 5 years experience). The moderator support will follow established principles of Motivational Interviewing: the aim being to help individuals identify their employment goal (and any ambivalence in the employment process) and learn self-motivational techniques to sustain employment.  Participants will be asked how many, and which, modules they have completed at the second (4 week) assessment.

    <statisticalmethods>The current study requires enrolment of approximately 70 participants (i.e. 35 intervention, 35 control) with the expectation of retaining a minimum sample size of 50 (or 25 per group) post-intervention. This minimum N would detect a large standardized mean difference between the intervention and control groups (Cohens d effect size = 0.5) for each of the primary outcomes (with a statistical power of .8 and alpha at .05 for a two-sided independent samples t test).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research indicates a low employment rate among adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis (MS) despite many feeling capable of engaging in paid employment.
Resuming employment provides an opportunity to interact with others and has been shown to contribute to general wellbeing and life satisfaction. Though specialist vocational rehabilitation services exist, barriers to accessing these services have been
identified. These barriers include (but are not limited to): delays in the timeliness of vocational interventions, transportation and/or financial difficulties, and social stigma.
In this context, time-efficient, cost-effective and accessible methods of vocational service delivery present clinical appeal. This includes the use of information and communication technologies (i.e. Internet) to supplement face-to-face rehabilitation.

Specific aims of this study will be to:
1. Develop and evaluate an online vocational resource for working-age adults with SCI or MS
2. Identify facilitators of, and barriers to, online learning

We expect to demonstrate that access to online services will facilitate and promote vocational behaviours and, potentially, contribute to positive mental health outcomes.
