  <interventions>
    <interventions>Numbers 1-4 are different treatment stages of this trial. The trial is a two arm controlled randomised trial with two subsequent randomisations.
1. 3 by 21 day cycles of: Bortezomib (1.3mg/m^2 i.v days 1,4,8,11), cyclophosphamide (500mg/m^2 i.v days 1,8), dexamethasone (40mg orally days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12) then cyclophosphamide mobilisation and collection of stem cells (non randomised)
2. Starting 4-6 weeks after stem cell mobilisation, 4 by 42 day cycles of VMP (Bortezomib (1.3mg/m^2 i.v days 1,4,8,11, 22,25,29,32), Melphalan (9mg/m^2 orally days1-4), Prednisolone 60mg/m^2 orally days 1-4) 
3. Beginning 8 weeks after the last dose of VMP (or High Dose Melphalan from corresponding arm below) consolidation therapy of VRD consisting of 2 by 28 day cycles of Bortezomib (1.3mg/m^2 i.v days 1,4,8,11), Lenalidomide (25mg orally on days 1-21), Dexamethasone (20mg orally on days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11,12). Lenalidomide maintenenace will start immdeiately after the completion of this phase of treatment.
4. Lenalidomide maintenance (non-randomised) 10mg daily orally days 1-28 until relapse or progression</interventions>
    <comparator>Numbers in this section describe the 2nd arm of treatment corresponding to the treatment phases described above. There are two subsequent randomisations both consisting of two arms.
2. High dose Melphalan (HDM; 100mg/m^2 intravenously day-3,-2 prior to transplant) beginning 4-6 weeks after stem cell collection and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) according to local protocol. 
3. no consolidation. Lenalidomide maintenance (described above) will start 8 weeks after the completion of the end of the last dose of HDM.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the use of high dose chemotherapy and ASCT (a procedure where the patient's own cells are collected, high dose therapy eliminates patient's cancer cells and patient's collected cells are reinfused), multiple myeloma remains incurable. This study aims to: 
1.compare induction therapy employing either a chemotherapy regimen employing Bortezomib, melphalan and prednisolone or high dose therapy and ASCT
2. compare consolidation therapy employing either a chemotherapy regimen of  bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone or no treatment
3. investigate maintenance therapy employing lenalidomide
The study plans to treat 1500 patients worldwide. 

Trial details

In this study you will receive the drug bortezomib delivered intravenously (i.v) on days 1,4,8 and 11, the drug cyclophosphamide delivered i.v on days 1 and 8, and dexamethasone delivered orally on days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11 and 12 of a 21 day treatment cycle 

you will then be allocated to receive either option in 1. and either option in 2. below
1. either 4 cycles of the drug bortezomib delivered intravenously (i.v) on days 1,4,8, 11, 22, 25, 29 and 32, the drug melphalan delivered orally on days 1 -4 and prednisolone delivered orally on days 1-4 of a 6 week cycle;or high dose melphalan i.v 3 and 2 days before reinfusion of patient's own stem cells
2. either  2 cycles of consolidation treatment consisting of the drug bortezomib delivered intravenously (i.v) on days 1,4,8 and 11, the drug lenalidomide delivered orally on days 1-21, and dexamethasone delivered orally on days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11 and 12 of a 28 day treatment cycle or no consolidation treatment

All patients will then receive repeating 28 day cycles of daily oral lenalidomide therapy as long as the therapy continues to fight the myeloma.

Your response to the treatment will be assessed at routine clinical visits using the usual clinical investigations that would monitor the status of your disease.

Who is it for?

This study is open to male or female patients aged 18-65 with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The full details of this study's inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the relevant sections within this record.</summary>
