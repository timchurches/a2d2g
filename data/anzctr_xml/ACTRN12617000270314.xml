  <interventions>
    <interventions>One of the most common side effects of antidepressants are largely believed to cause weight gain in their users.  This study aims to examine if consuming normal kitchen spices and herbs "4 herb mixture" affects body weight or depression in people who are on antidepressants. 


The herb mixture includes: : A mixture of red chili powder, black pepper, ginger, and turmeric

- the dose administered: three times every day.
- the duration of administration: 90 days 
Capsules contained 150 mg of each of the four selected herbs and spices to a total of 600 mg herb and spice per capsule and 1800 mg per day




The strategy used to monitor adherence to the intervention is capsule return and a food diary that should be filled out on a daily basis and brought to the research team on the appointments times.</interventions>
    <comparator>Tow Control groups:
1- The first one would be over-weight but non-depressed subjects who take the herb mixture capsule.

Herb Mixture:

-Total of 90 herb capsules over the period of 90 days.

2- The second one would be depressed subjects taking anti-depressants with placebo that has saline and no herb mixture capsule for this group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proposed study aims to investigate the association between a mixture of herb and how it could affect both body weight and depression in people who are on prescribed antidepressants. The mixture of herbs include red chili powder, black pepper, ginger, and turmeric . With the aid of DEXA scanning  and SCID a  test to evaluate depression this study will aim to examine if consuming the herbs mixture affects body weight or depression. It became a fact that people who are on prescribed antidepressants tend to gain weight. There are some studies in the past that attempted to create a remedy for the problem. None of them have proposed that herbs can be used together with antidepressants to reduce weight gain.

Flyers and posters will be distributed to announce and recruit volunteers between 18 and 54 years old. Pages on on Facebook can be created to announce the trial. Clinical Trials Connect Database will be used as well to recruit with an in-built screening system. Women who are pregnant, people who are highly dependent on medical care, have a cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability will not be included in this study. However, our main target is people who are on antidepressants and suffering from depression. The duration of the study will be three months. During this time, the participants will be asked to use a mixture of four herb. The four herbs are  Black pepper, Red chilli powder, Ginger, and Turmeric. 
The ability of these herbs to help with weight problems will be examined by using three groups of people. The first is the control group, which comprises of overweight but non-depressed subjects who take only the herb mixture. The second group comprises the depressed subjects who take only antidepressants with placebo. The third group "the main group" comprises of subjects who take the antidepressants together with the herb. Changes in body (weight/body-fat) and depression will be assessed using three main tests that will be repeated monthly; DEXA scanning to see changes in body fat, the Scale to test body weight, SCID to test depression, and Blood samples to see if there is an improvement in the blood inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein CRP).</summary>
