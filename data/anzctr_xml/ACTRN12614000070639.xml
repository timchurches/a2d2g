    <statisticalmethods>For the primary(non-inferiority) outcome, analyses will use both intention to treat and per-protocol approaches.
For the secondary(superiority) outcome, the primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach.

For sample size considerations, we used published literature employing the 4th generation Roche hsTnT assay (Elecsys). Baseline levels of hsTnT were obtained from a NZ study of HD patients using the same assay. Published literature has robustly established that important and detectable myocardial micro-injury is associated with a 2 to 4 fold increase in the pre-dialysis [hsTnT] of HD patients. To assess non-inferiority of the dialysate sodium arms we computed the two sided 95% confidence interval of the difference between them. Using this method, low dialysate sodium concentration is not inferior to standard dialysate sodium concentration at a 2.5% level if the upper boundary is bleow the pre-specified margin of non-inferiority. Modelling a doubling of [hsTnT] from 118ng/L to 236ng/L, 96 participants in each group and a within-group standard deviation of 291ng/L  would have a 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that low dialysate sodium concentration is inferior to standard dialysate sodium concentration.  Modelling a quadrupaling of [hsTnt], 22 patients in each group would be needed. Adjustment for baseline values of the [hsTnT] would be expected to increase power by giving narrow confidence intervals.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The SOLID Trial (ACTRN12611000975998) is currently underway. Its hypothesis is that reduced sodium exposure through the use of lower dialysate sodium concentration will reduce cardiovascular morbidity in haemodialysis patients, by reducing inter-dialytic hypertension and LV mass.
The Mac-Solid Extension trial will evaluate whether any benefit of lower dialysate sodium in reducing inter-dialytic hypertension and LV mass might be offset by increased rates of intra-dialytic hypotension and myocardial micro-injury.</summary>
