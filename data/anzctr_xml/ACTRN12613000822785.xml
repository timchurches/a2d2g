  <interventions>
    <interventions>Moderate-intensity cardiovascular fitness training prescribed and supervised by a physiotherapist in the outpatient rehabilitation setting. 
Frequency: 2 sessions each week; commence 5 minutes duration, progress by 2-5 minutes each session as client tolerates to a maximum of 30 minutes duration per session. Duration: 12 weeks. 
Mode: Stationary bike; treadmill or overground walking; cross trainer; stepper, as deemed appropriate by physiotherapist. Intensity: Moderate intensity training will be calculated using the heart rate reserve method, or Karvonen method, where moderate-intensity is 40-59% maximum (ACSM., 2010). Target heart rate will be calculated each session. BORG-RPE and heart rate will be used to monitor moderate-intensity exercise. 
Participation in home exercise program will occur concurrently with supervised sessions (ie. during same 12 week period). Participants should commence the home exercise program once deemed safe to participate in a particular mode, generally overground walking, and self-monitor their own work levels using heart rate monitoring or the BORG-RPE scale.  Frequency: Weeks 1-4: 1 session; Weeks 5-8: 2 sessions; Weeks 9-12: 3 sessions, at duration consistent with supervised sessions. Participants will be provided with a weekly home exercise record with clear recommendations of mode/duration/intensity, and check boxes to record exercise completion; BORG-RPE or heart rate.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard low-intensity exercise program, prescribed by physiotherapist and supervised by physiotherapist or allied health assistant in outpatient rehabilitation setting. 
Frequency: 2 sessions each week. Session duration will commence at 10 minutes for Weeks 1-4; progress to 20 minutes for Weeks 5-8; and 30 minutes for Weeks 9-12. 
Overall Duration: 12 weeks.
Mode: general mobility and balance exercises at low intensity, including walking in rails, stationary bike, strengthening, standing balance. Intensity: Heart rate (pulse oximetry) and BORG-RPE will be monitored every 5 minutes to ensure participant is maintaining low intensity exercise (&lt;40% HRR method). 
Participation in home exercise program including low-intensity exercises prescribed from supervised program. This will commence at week 1 and continue for 12 weeks (ie. concurrent 12 weeks as supervised program)
Duration will commence at 10 minutes for Weeks 1-4; progress to 20 minutes for Weeks 5-8; and 30 minutes for Weeks 9-12. Weeks 1-4: One session; Weeks 5-8: Two sessions; Weeks 9-12: Three sessions. Participants will be provided with a weekly home exercise record with clear recommendations of exercises/repetitions/intensity monitoring, and check boxes to record exercise completion; BORG-RPE or heart rate.  </comparator>

    <concealment>If deemed potentially eligible by their treating physiotherapist, potential participants will be contacted by the CI who will confirm eligibility and perform the recruitment and consent process. In the event that CI Reynolds is the treating physiotherapist for a potential participant, potential participants will be contacted by PI Skinner. Participants will be offered an interpreter if they have a non-English speaking background. 
Information regarding medical history and co-morbidities will be sought from the medical history available to treating physiotherapists, and participants will be responsible for full disclosure of information on health status or previous experiences.

Prior to randomisation, participants will attend an outpatient neurology appointment with a Western Health consultant neurologist, either Dr Tissa Wijeratne or Dr Hans Tu.  This appointment will enable screening of participants to ensure they are deemed medically appropriate to undergo graded exercise testing.  Assessment of stroke severity will also be conducted using the NIH Stroke Scale and the Modified Rankin scale. 
A medical notification form has been devised for Dr Wijeratne or Dr Tu to complete. This will be forwarded to the research team prior to randomisation. A participant will only be randomised if this form states a person is medically appropriate to undergo graded exercise testing.

    <sequence>The randomisation sequence will be generated by a third party using a randomisation table (computerised sequence generation) and allocation concealed in opaque envelopes. Randomisation will be stratified by beta blocker medication use to maximize even distribution in each group

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a pilot randomised controlled trial. The main aim is to test whether it is possible to recruit and follow trial procedures in addition to working out how much benefit may come from the treatment in order to make sure enough participants are recruited for a future large randomised controlled trial. The main hypothesis is that adding cardiovascular (or fitness) training to normal rehabilitation in people who have had a stroke will be possible to do and safe for the patient. The next aim is to test the effect of the fitness training on cardiovascular fitness, walking speed and endurance; quality of life (QOL) and depression. 
The objective of the future randomised controlled trial will be to determine whether the moderate-intensity CV training program significantly improves the defined outcomes compared to usual rehabilitation care.
The trial will be run in an outpatient rehabilitation service of a tertiary public hospital in metropolitan Melbourne. People will be eligible to be in the trial if they have been diagnosed with a stroke more than six weeks prior; are over 18 years old; able to walk by themselves with or without a gait aid or supervision of another person; and do not have medical or other limitations to exercise. Participants currently taking medications that may affect heart rate response to exercise will be included in the trial. 20 people will be selected to receive either the treatment or normal care. People measuring outcomes won't know which group the patient is in. All participants will be tested for fitness (VO2 peak); walking speed; and quality of life and depression.
The treatment group will receive two supervised sessions of moderate-intensity fitness training each week for twelve weeks. Exercise will commence at 10 minutes, and progress incrementally, as tolerated, to 30 mintues duration, prior to progression of exercise intensity. Progression of duration and intensity will be determined by trained physiotherapists, using the Karvonen method (ACSM 2010). People will either exercise with a recumbent or standard stationary bike, treadmill, stepper or cross-trainer. Participants currently taking heart rate control medications will utilise a scale of how hard they are working to monitor exercise intensity. A home exercise program of CV training will be prescribed, and gradually increased in frequency.  People should progress to doing a total of 150 minutes of CV exercise in weeks 9-12 of the trial, as recommended by the NHF guidelines for aerobic exercise (Briffa et al 2006).  

People assigned to the usual rehab group will receive two sessions per week of a  light strengthening and balance exercise program. These participants will have heart rate monitoring at five-minute intervals to maintain low-intensity exercise. Session length will be progressed from 10 minutes for 4 weeks, to 20 minutes for 4 weeks, and 30 minutes for final 4 weeks. A general home exercise program will also be given to this group.
