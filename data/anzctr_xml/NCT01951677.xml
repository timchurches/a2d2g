  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a need for more effective and better-tolerated hepatitis B vaccines for low
      responder high-risk populations including patients with renal impairment and/or diabetes
      mellitus and those aged over 40 years. Several approaches are available to enhance the
      potency of hepatitis B virus vaccines including use of the more highly immunogenic antigens,
      replacing alum with potentially more effective adjuvants, and increasing the dose of vaccine
      antigen. A combination of these strategies is being tested in this study to identify the most
      promising candidate approaches to take forward into advanced clinical development</summary>
