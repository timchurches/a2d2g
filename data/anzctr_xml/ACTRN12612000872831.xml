  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Patients with mild-moderate osteoarthritis of the knee who are referred for surgical therapy, which in this case is arthroscopy, due to the failure of medical and physical therapy to adequately manage their condition.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will undergo arthroscopy as per the usual standard of this procedure. What will vary will be the pressure of the fluid used to visualise the joint with the arthroscopic device. In this case the fluid pressure will be run at 30mmHg as opposed to the standard pressure which can vary amongst different health centres but in this case will be 80mmHg. The length of the procedure can vary from patient-to-patient depending on what is discovered during the procedure by the surgeon. It is a day surgery procedure with the length of this lower pressure arthroscopy taking the same length of time as standard pressure.</interventions>
    <comparator>This group will receive arthroscopy under standard pressure. In this case, patients will undergo arthroscopy as per the normal standard of care with a higher fluid pressure, e.g. 80mmHg, rather than 30mmHg.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will be looking at patients who have osteoarthritis of the knee. Such patients will be referred by their doctor for knee arthroscopy. These patients usually have mild-moderate osteoarthritis of the knee and will undergo arthroscopy to reduce their pain and improve function. At the moment, when the arthroscopy is performed, a certain fluid pressure is used. This trial will try using a lower pressure and compare it with the current standard. It is hypothesised that patients who get the lower pressure will have less pain, less bone marrow swelling and increased degree of function. These are the three areas the trial will be assessing and will be comparing this with patients who get the current standard pressure, 6 weeks after the arthroscopy.</summary>
