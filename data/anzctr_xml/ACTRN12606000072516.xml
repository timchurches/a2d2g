    <interventions>An audiovisual computer program that educates patients with rheumatoid arthritis about methotrexate in addition to standard care.                                                                                   The information in the computer program is derived from a review of the literature and consultation with rheumatologists.                                                                                                   The duration of the program is 15-20 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                              The patients will be administered the computer program within a week of being started on methotrexate by their rheumatologist.                                                                                  Standard care is define as information provided verbally to the patient at the time of methotrexate commencement by their rheumatologist +/- written information provided at the discretion of the rheumatologist or pharmacist. Patients will be followed up for 6 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this trial is to improve communication of information provided to patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are starting treatment with methotrexate.
All outcomes will be measured by a blinded assessor (not the treating rheumatologist). The patients will also be blinded in that they will not be aware of the trial at the time that they receive the educational intervention and will not be informed that their knowledge will be tested until they attend for the 6 week review at which time the patient knowledge questionnaire will be administered under supervision.</summary>
