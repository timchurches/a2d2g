    <interventions>This project aims to explore the prospect of a pharmacist-instigated asthma self-management intervention; whether the introduction of a Peak Flow Meter with appropriate education can improve asthma control and engagement in asthma self-management. 
The study was designed as a parallel before-and-after randomised controlled-intervention pilot study, conducted in four separate steps. 
Step 1: The first meeting involved a guided survey (part 1: to gather the subjects baseline information) as well as two validated questionnaires (part 2: to assess the subjects asthma knowledge and asthma control, and all participants were provided with asthma education. 
Step 2: The second meeting involved the completion of the second survey by all participants (only part 2). 
Participants allocated into the interventional group were provided with a peak flow meter, a diary to record their measurements, and education on how to use the device. The participants were encouraged to measure their peak expiratory flow every morning and whenever they feel that they may be experience airflow limitation. The participants allocated into the control group were not given any information about the PFM, however both groups asthma management was reviewed.
Step 3: At the third meeting all participants were asked to complete a third survey (only part 2). Participants in the control group were now provided with a PFM, a diary to record PEF measurements, and education on how to use the device (as per intervention group in Step 2). 
In a follow-up, all participants were asked to complete a fourth survey (only part 2).
The meetings took place at a time and location convenient to the participant and researcher at 4-week intervals (+/-1 week), which took approximately 30 minutes per meeting.
Asthma education provided in the first meeting acted as a longitudinal control in order to exclude any improvement of asthma self-management due to asthma education during the introduction of the peak flow meter. Information about asthma and peak flow meter use was obtained through standardised material provided by the Asthma Foundation, the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, evidence based researched information (e.g. journal articles, Asthma Management Handbook), and education delivered during the university course Bachelor of Pharmacy at Charles Darwin University.
Information provided included an explanation of asthma symptoms, aetiology and pathophysiology, relevant information about medications (e.g. relievers, preventers and symptom controllers) and asthma devices (including information about inhaler techniques and maintenance, benefits of certain devices, etc.). Further information was given about the perception of asthma symptoms, triggers, instructions on how to manage an asthma attack, and when to consult a doctor. Asthma management information comprised the treatment goals and self-management information on medication storage, breathing exercises, regular doctor reviews, AAP use, lifestyle modifications, exercise as well as diet and other medication that may influence asthma control. Further information was provided if requested such as on exercise-induced asthma, asthma-related diet and other considerations. The information was provided in accordance to individuals treatment and needs. In addition, the subject inhaler technique was assessed, any questions were answered and written educational information was offered.

Introduction
Asthma is a common chronic disease in Australia with suboptimal self-care. The peak flow meter (PFM) is a simple device available at pharmacies that measures a specific part of lung function, the peak expiratory flow (PEF), which can be utilised by people with asthma for their disease management.
Objective
To identify if the introduction of PFM with appropriate education can improve engagement in asthma self-management.
Methods
The study was designed as a before-and-after controlled intervention pilot study, conducted in 3 separate steps each including a meeting with the researcher. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a PFM and asthma education, whereas the controlled group only received asthma education. The participants asthma management was compared using validated questionnaires and formative feedback.
Results
Twelve subjects were recruited (five intervention and seven control). The effect of asthma knowledge and asthma control determined by questionnaires was similar between the two groups. However, majority of feedback was positive, and indicated an increase in self-awareness of their asthma.
Conclusions
The study does not show great improvement in asthma control. However, the findings are limited by small sample size and relatively good asthma control at baseline of most subjects. In addition, the long term benefit of asthma control is not assessed and follow-up assessment is recommended for future studies. The finding suggested that participants are more confident in their asthma control after the intervention, and it is achievable to integrate PFM education and monitoring into pharmacy practice. The service can expand current pharmacist service in multidisciplinary approach to optimise asthma control, and potentially improve asthma self-management.
