  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of the study is to compare a high dose epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) chemotherapy regimen, plus Filgrastim support, given over a 9 week period with a standard epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (EC) chemotherapy regimen given over 18 weeks.  The total dose of EC is the same.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate whether the same total dose of chemotherapy given in half the time (with Filgrastim support) will result in improved quality of life in patients with breast cancer, due to greater time without toxicity or symptoms of disease.  Quality of Life is measured by standard tools developed by the ANZ BCTG including Quality adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (TWiST and QTWiST).

The main analysis will be performed after recruitment of the planned 225 patients, with a further 2 years of follow up.  It is estimated that 3 years of accrual and 2 years of follow up will be required.  The primary analysis will compare all randomised eligible patients on the two treatment regimens with respect to quality of life, survival duration, time to disease progression and quality adjusted survival analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the first year after the beginning of treatment and the complete period of follow up.
