    <interventions>This study investigated the impact of the melanoma awareness video Dear 16-year-old me, a self-assessment of perceived melanoma risk, and a control condition.

'Dear 16-year-old me" is a five minute melanoma awareness video developed by the David Cornfield Melanoma Fund in 2011, which is available online. The video addresses the importance of protecting and checking ones skin via personal testimonies from real life melanoma survivors and their families, who share with their younger selves the advice that could have prevented them or a loved one from developing melanoma. 

The risk self-assessment used in this study was one component of a self-administered melanoma questionnaire that assesses personal risk, level of concern, protective behaviour, and knowledge (Gillespie et al., 2011). For the purpose of this study, only the risk component of the questionnaire was used (the Personal Risk for Melanoma Questionnaire; PRMQ). This 7-item self-assessment collects information about skin type, hair colour, and other personal factors that can contribute to an individuals likelihood of developing melanoma. Each response attracts a score, and the sum of these is a numerical indication of melanoma risk, ranging on a scale from -2 to 22.

      <outcome>Intended sun protection behaviours were measured using the Sun Protection Behaviours Scale (Weinstock et al., 2000), with two items modified to include SPF 30+ specifications, Participants rated how often they intended to engage in 10 sun protection behaviors (e.g., Wear a hat) when out in the sun next summer on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = never to 5 = always. </outcome>

      <outcome>Skin cancer fear was measured using 8 items adapted from the Breast Cancer Fear Scale (Champion et al., 2004), which assesses the extent of cancer-specific fear. Participants rated their agreement with statements regarding their beliefs about skin cancer skin cancer (e.g., The thought of skin cancer scares me) on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived threat of skin cancer was assessed using three perceived severity items and three perceived susceptibility items from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale (Witte, 1996). Responses were averaged to create an overall index. Participants rated their agreement with statements about the severity of skin cancer (e.g., I believe skin cancer is severe) and their susceptibility (e.g., I am likely to contract skin cancer) on a scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>A series of 3 (Group: "Dear 16 year-old-me", PRMQ, control) Ã— 3 (Time: baseline, post-intervention, follow-up) between-within subjects analyses of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to determine the impact of the intervention materials on perceived threat, fear, and intended sun protection scores. A Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of .017 was employed to account for multiple comparisons. Post hoc analyses using the LSD post hoc criterion for significance were used to determine differences between groups. 
Power analysis was conducted prior to the study in order to estimate the required sample size. To attain a desired power of .80 or above for a corrected alpha level of .017 and a small effect size (ES = .3), a total sample of n=147 was necessary. On the basis of 50 respondents per condition, the current sample of n=222 at baseline and n=187 at follow-up was adequate to conduct analyses of variance with effects of small size.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This was the first study to investigate empirically the impact of the online melanoma awareness video, Dear 16-year-old me, on sun protection intentions and related cognitive processes in young adults aged 17-30. We examined changes in perceived threat, skin cancer fear, and intention to participate in a variety of sun protection behaviors after exposure to Dear 16-year-old me, the personal risk for melanoma questionnaire (PRMQ), or an informational control condition. It was anticipated that: (1) participants exposed to Dear 16-year-old me or the PRMQ would demonstrate significant improvements in perceived threat, skin cancer fear, and sun protection intentions post-intervention, (2) participants in the control condition would not demonstrate any significant changes in perceived threat, skin cancer fear, or sun protection intentions post-intervention, (3) all significant effects would be maintained two weeks later at follow-up. A mixed within-between subjects design was used. Participants were randomly allocated to one of three experimental conditions: Dear 16-year-old me, PRMQ, control) and completed an online questionnaire at three time points (baseline, post-intervention, two-week follow-up).Data were obtained from 222 participants (158 female) at baseline and 187 at follow-up. There was a significant interaction between group and time for intended sun protection behaviors and perceived threat, with participants exposed to Dear-16-year-old me reporting the greatest improvements. Heightened perceptions of threat among participants exposed to Dear 16-year-old me were maintained at follow-up, although increased levels of skin cancer fear were not. Sun protection intentions increased across all groups over time, but this increase was significantly greater in the intervention groups than the control group. The results suggest that Dear 16-year-old me is a promising intervention for reducing skin cancer risk among young adults. The study findings support the assertion that providing people with narrative evidence from other real people can be an effective strategy to increase perceptions of personal health risk and encourage health protective behavior.</summary>
