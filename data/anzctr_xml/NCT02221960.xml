    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preliminary Antitumor Activity - The endpoints for assessment of antitumor activity include objective response (OR), disease control (DC), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and 3-year overall survival (OS)</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics of MEDI6383 or MEDI6383/MEDI4736 - When MEDI6383 is administered alone, the endpoints for assessment of PK of MEDI6383 include individual subject MEDI6383 concentrations in serum at different time points after MEDI6383 administration. When MEDI6383 is administered together with MEDI4736, the endpoints for assessment of PK of MEDI6383 and MEDI4736 include individual subject MEDI6383 and MEDI4736 concentrations in serum at different time points after MEDI6383 and MEDI4736 administration.
