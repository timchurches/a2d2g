    <summary>A multicenter phase 3 safety trial in which 5,700 subjects will be assigned in a 2:1 ratio to
      receive 120 µg rLP2086 vaccine in a 0, 2, 6 month schedule or control. The control group will
      receive HAVRIX vaccine at month 0 and 6 and saline at month 2.

      All subjects will be followed for 6 months after the last vaccination to assess safety and
      tolerability.</summary>
