    <interventions>Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty(SLT):  this procedure will use  frequency doubled, 1-switched Nd:Yag lasers emitting at 532nm with a pulse duration of 3ns, spot size of 400um and pulse energies ranging from 0.2-1.7mJ, coupled to a slit delivery system with a helium-neon laser (HeNe) aiming system and any mirrored gonio lens that doesn't magnify for all patients randomised to SLT treatment. The laser will be focused on the trabecular meshwork using the HeNe aiming beams and a single laser  pulse will be delivered at the 3 o'clockposition.  The laser energy will be increased or reduced by 0.1mJ increments until fine 'champagne' bubbles are generated.  Initial 180 degrees treatments of approximately 50 applicaiton will be applied. There can be up to 3 SLT treatments administered during the trial depending on the IOP response to treatment.  Each procedure will take approximately 30-40 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The following types of Ocular Hypotensive eyedrops will be able to be prescribed to those subjects randomised to the topical medication arm:Prostaglandin analogues 1 drop per day (Latanoprost/Xalatan 0.005%, Bimatoprost/Lumigan 0.03%, Travoprost/Travatan 0.004%), beta-blockers 1 drop twice daily (Betagan 2.5mg per mL/5mg per mL, Betoptic 0.25%/0.5%, Tenopt/Timolol 0.25%, 0.5%), alpha-agonists 1 drop twice daily ( Alphagan 0.15%/0.2%), Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors 1 drop twice daily (Azopt 1%, Trusopt 2%), combination eyedrops 1 drop twice daily (combigan 0.2%/0.5%, Cosopt (2%/0.5%, Duotrav (0.004%/0.5%), Xalacom (0.005%/0.5%).  All drops will be adminstered indefinitely unless response to treatment is not adequate or side effects not tolerated.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aims of this study are to determine the effectiveness of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT)
with topical medication therapy in the treatment of early Glaucoma with regards to Quality of Life and
Cost-effectiveness. The study also aims to determine factors associated with the outcomes of these two
therapies, such as pre-treatment IOP and compare the safety and efficacy of the two therapies.
Two groups of patients will be recruited for the study:
1) patients with a diagnosis of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma who have not previously received treatment
for this and;
2) patients with a diagnosis of Pseudo-exfoliative Glaucoma who have not previously received treatment.
Patients will be asked to undergo a Quality of Life Questionnaire Interview over the telephone and will be
asked to provide information on the costs related to their health care, treatment of their glaucoma and
attendance at appointments. They will also be clinically examined where information including their
intraocular pressures, visual fields, optic discs and visual acuity will be recorded. They will also be asked to
provide information relating to their ethnicity, level of education, date of birth, employment status and
medical history. Participants will be randomized to either receive Selective laser Trabeculoplasty or Topical
eye drops at the Baseline visit. They will then be seen every 6 months for 2 years. If in the first 6 months,
however, they do not achieve a 25% reduction in Intraocular Pressure from baseline levels, they will be seen
6 weekly until this is achieved. Analysis of the data will be on an intention to treat basis where participant
outcomes will be analysed according to the group they were randomised rather than the actual treatment
they received. The types of analysis to be performed includes Rasch analysis of the Quality of Life
questionnaire responses, Cost Effectiveness analysis, multivariable regression models and generalised
estimating equations. This study addresses novel outcomes that have previously not been addressed
before, including taking into account the patients perspective by examining the impact of the two types of
treatment on patients quality of life and also the cost of the two treatments, both to the patient and to
society.</summary>
