    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive:
1)	Personal information about their melanoma genetic risk.
2)	Telephone access to a genetic counsellor; 
3)	Printed and electronic general educational materials on melanoma preventive behaviours including sun exposure, sun protection and skin examinations.

Determination of genetic risk: From participants saliva samples, we will genotype specific variants in 20 genes that have a confirmed association with melanoma risk. All variants will have been identified through adequately powered and replicated large, international studies. Genetic risk estimates for melanoma will be presented both as: 1) an absolute-risk and relative-risk estimate of the participants lifetime risk of developing melanoma; and 2) a broad genetic risk level  low, average, high. Participants will not be given their individual genotypes, only the risk estimates derived from them. A persons lifetime risk of melanoma based on the 20 selected genomic variants will be estimated using published statistical methodology. The calculation assumes a multiplicative model and is based on the persons genomic variation, the odds ratio for melanoma associated with each variants risk allele from replication studies or meta-analyses, the corresponding population frequency of each risk allele, and age- and sex-specific melanoma residual lifetime risk estimates from NSW cancer incidence data. 

Communication of information on personal melanoma genetic risk: When it is time to give the participant the information on their personal genetic risk of melanoma, they will be contacted by telephone by the studys genetic counsellor. At this time, the genetic counsellor will ask whether or not the participant has any questions or concerns and will check that they still wish to receive this information (verbal consent) before talking to them about their personal melanoma genetic risk derived from their saliva sample. When speaking to the genetic counsellor, participants can decide whether they would like to 1) receive their risk information from the genetic counsellor over the telephone, followed by receiving the same information in a written format; or 2) whether they would prefer not to speak to the genetic counsellor at that time, but would prefer to first receive their risk information in a written format. Regardless of whether or not participants elect to receive their risk information first over the telephone from the genetic counsellor, all participants will receive written communication of their personal melanoma genetic risk either via mailed letter or emailed letter (according to personal preference as indicated on the Consent Form). If the participant has any further questions about the information we send them, they can contact the studys genetic counsellor by telephone to discuss further. The genetic counsellor will provide a mandatory follow up call to all those participants who elect to wait to receive their risk information via letter where the results indicate a high risk. There is no limit on the number and duration of telephone-based counselling sessions. A qualified genetic counsellor will administer the sessions.
</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants randomised to the study (both intervention and control groups) will receive written educational materials on melanoma preventive behaviours including sun exposure, sun protection and skin examinations. 

The control group will also provide a saliva sample for DNA testing and genetic risk determination at the same time as those in the intervention group. The control group are offered their personal genetic risk information at the end of the study (about 8 months after the saliva sample). All participants will have access to a study-dedicated genetic counsellor by telephone at the time of consent and when they receive their results.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sun exposure. Measured using time (mins) spent outdoors during peak UV hours (10am-2pm/11am-3pm [depending on daylight savings]) on weekdays and weekends during the past month: "Thinking about the past month, we would like to know the times of day as well as the usual length of time that you spent outside between 9am and 5pm on a typical weekday/Saturday/Sunday. (Participants tick one response: 0,&lt;15,15-29,30-44,4560 mins; for each 1-hour time period between 9am and 5pm)." 

In a 10% random sample of participants, we will objectively measure UV exposure using polysulfone film time-stamped UV dosimeter badges  the gold standard for assessing cumulative and daily personal UV exposure. They will be mounted in custom-made wristbands attached to the left wrist, and worn over 2 weekdays and 2 week-end days, which is sufficient for estimating habitual weekly behaviour.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified and selected through the Cancer Council NSW ‘Join a Research Study’ initiative. The 'Join a Research Study' is a register of people who have agreed to be included on a database for potential research projects. The 'Join a Research Study' database maintains information about people, currently mostly from NSW, who have consented to be contacted by researchers conducting ethically approved studies for the purposes of cancer research. These individuals have completed a basic demographic questionnaire and have supplied some health information including medication, individual and family cancer diagnosis. The database is managed by the Cancer Research Division at Cancer Council NSW, and has ethics approval from Cancer Council NSW Human Research Ethics Committee. Randomisation will be provided by the Australia and New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group (ANZMTG) or the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, ensuring allocation concealment. </concealment>
    <sequence>We will use 1:1 weighting, and Minimisation (dynamic/adaptive random allocation) to ensure the groups are balanced by risk score (low or average; high), skin colour (fair; olive or brown) and sex (male; female) as the behavioural effects of the intervention may differ according to these factors. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary analyses will be an intention-to-treat comparison of intervention and control arms for differences in sun exposure, sun protection and skin examination outcomes at 3 months. We will also compare the psychological and socio-ethical outcomes. Where possible, we will conduct subgroup analyses stratified by genetic risk level (high, average, low) and skin colour (fair, olive/brown). Two-sided tests will be used for all analyses. For binomial outcome variables (e.g. proportion having a whole-body skin examination), we will use log-binomial models to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals; for continuous outcome measures (e.g. mean time spent outdoors) we will use ANCOVA. Both will be adjusted for baseline values. We will use mixed models to account for repeated measures when comparing behavioural outcomes over time. Mediator analyses will be conducted using autoregressive mediation path models for individual mediators using Mplus. We will use established methods to adjust for the effects of measurement error in the relative risk estimate for self-reported sun exposure by: 1) calculating a validity coefficient between the self-reported and objective UV dosimeter measures of sun exposure; and 2) using this validity coefficient to adjust the relative risk for the self-reported sun exposure association. Importantly, we will be able to assess for differential misclassification by assessing whether the validity coefficients differ between the three genetic risk strata.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to determine whether knowledge of personal genetic risk of melanoma, compared to standard prevention advice, can motivate behaviour change among the general population. 

Who is it for?
People aged 18-69 years from the general population, who have never had melanoma and have registered with 'Join a Research Study' database.

Study details
All participants in this study will be required to provide a saliva sample and have their DNA tested to determine their risk of melanoma. Participants are then randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive personal information about their melanoma genetic risk, with access to telephone-based genetic counselling as well as written educational materials on melanoma preventive behaviours including sun exposure, sun protection and skin examinations. Participants in the other group will receive only written educational materials on melanoma preventive behaviours during the intervention period. This group will then be offered genetic risk information at the end of the study (about 8 months after the saliva sample). 

The aim of this study is to pilot methods for an intervention that provides information on personal genetic risk of melanoma to participants from the general population, and to gather pilot and feasibility data regarding its short-term effectiveness on sun protection, sun exposure and skin examination behaviours, as well as the broader impact on ethical, social, psychological and economic outcomes.
