  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be an individualised website that women in the intervention group can access to gain support to maintain breastfeeding.
Women will be able to log onto the website as often as they like to obtain breastfeeding information, watch a breastfeeding demonstration video, participate in a discussion forum with other mothers or email other registered online mothers as part of a virtual community. In addition, women experiencing difficulty will be able to contact the researcher directly via email for assistance. 
The trial will run for 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group of women/mothers will not have access to the website but to the standard postnatal support already available.

In WA, all new mothers receive a universal schedule of visits with a Child Health Nurse. The first visit is most often in the home within 1 - 2 weeks postpartum. A follow up visit is held at the Child Health Clinic within 6 weeks postpartum.

Control mothers are also able to access any other services and information available to them e.g. the internet (other general sites, lactation consultant, Australian Breastfeeding Association).</comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects will be randomly allocated to the control or intervention group by the computer as they register to be involved in the study.

The research officer will recruit participants while in hospital after the birth of their infant. The research officer will be unaware of the group allocation. The participant will only be allocated to the control or intervention group after they have registered to be part of the study. 

Randomisation will be determined centrally by computer once the participant has registered to be involved in the study.</concealment>

    <summary>The Using the Internet to support breastfeeding duration project will be conducted from 2009-2013. Women from regional WA will be invited to take part in the project where they will be exposed to a high level of support through the Internet. The breastfeeding outcomes of these women will be compared with women from regional WA who only access those services normally available to them.</summary>
