  <interventions>
    <interventions>1 gram of tranexamic acid directly infiltrated into the periarticular tissues mixed with the standard local anaesthetic solution. The local infiltration analgesic (LIA) mixture consists of 150mls of 0.2% ropivicaine with 5micrograms per ml of adrenaline.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood loss as calculated by the haemoglobin balance method.

This method assumes that the blood volume (BV in ml) on the 5fth day after surgery is the same as that before surgery. BV is estimated by taking sex, body mass and height into account. The loss of Hb (in grams) was then estimated according to the formula:

Hb loss=BV x (Hbi-Hbe) x 0.001+Hbt

where Hb loss (g) is the amount of Hb lost, Hbi (g/litre) the
Hb concentration before surgery, Hbe (g/litre) is the Hb
concentration on the 5fth day after surgery and Hbt (g) is the
total amount of allogeneic Hb transfused. A unit of banked
blood was considered to contain 63g Hb at our institution. The blood loss (ml) was related to the patient's preoperative Hb value (g/litre):

Blood loss =1000 x Hbloss/Hbi

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Major joint surgery is associated with significant blood loss which often requires transfusion. Tranexamic acid is a recommended medication to assist with limiting blood loss. It acts by preventing the breakdown of blood clot. The usual dosage is multiple intravenous injections. The optimal dose is unknown. This study will examine the effects of direct injection of tranexamic acid into the site of surgery and compare this to the intravenous route. The hypothesis is that this will be as effective if not more effective than intravenous use and is easier to administer.</summary>
