  <interventions>
    <interventions>A one hour depression specific individually tailored acupuncture protocol, will be performed every week for eight weeks, from gestation week 24 through to 31 inclusive, by the chief investigator, on randomised consenting depressed pregnant women.  </interventions>
    <comparator>1. A Progressive Muscle Relaxation comparator aimed at providing 'equivalent attention' to the acupuncture intervention is to be included in the same format, that is, weekly one hour sessions over the eight week period from gestation weeks 24-31.  These sessions will be performed as individual sessions with the practitioner, as is the case with the acupuncture arm and at the beginning the Kessler 6 will be collected, as well as a brief history in regard to current symptomology.  At the end of the session, 5 minutes will be spent assessing post-session feedback.  The sessions will focus on achieving overall body relaxation in each session with the first session being dedicated to this.  Subsequent sessions will focus on overall body relaxation in addition to a different area of the body for example the back, in which tensing and relaxing of the area will be performed.  The participants will be lying comfortably on their sides or back, depending uopon their preference.

2. Due to the morbidity of the participant population all participants will receive standard hospital antenatal mental health service care.  In addition, 32 women will be randomised to a 'usual care' group that will provide a control to monitor 1) use of mental health services and 2) depression disease progression.  This group will differ to the intervention groups in 2 aspects only namely 1) not receiving interventions and 2) not providing qualitative feedback in regard to their experiences of being involved in 'an intervention'.  This group will be required to: provide blood samples at gestation weeks 24 and at the end of week 31; saliva samples at gestation weeks 24, 28 and the end of 31; provide baseline demographic information upon recruitment; EPDS, DASS and WHOQoL at gestations weeks 24, 28 and the end of 31; provide feedback in regard to sleep at gestations weeks 28 and at the end of week 31; have hospital data collected in regard to birthing outcomes and provide the BaM at 6 weeks postnatal.  In addition, as these women are not to be regularly seen by the chief investigator, the chief investigator will telephone these women on these week to fill out the Kessler 6, to ensure the women are not worsening dramatically in their depression severity.  If a high score is obtained or if the cut-off score is reached, these women will be immediately refered to the emergency mental health services team CoHMET.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Pregnant women will be eligible if they are: 18 years of age or older, at 24 weeks of gestation, currently experiencing a mood disorder and have a Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of greater than or equal to 13. </inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A study poster will be included in antenatal information packs at two Western Sydney hospitals. Women identified during routine antenatal staff screening, or by clinicians with EPDS greater than or equal to 13 will be referred to the researcher, screened for eligibility and recruited upon signing of a patient information sheet and consent form.    Randomisation and concealment will be undertaken by two independent researchers. The sequence will be generated by computer and concealed in opaque envelopes. </concealment>
    <sequence>Three groups of 78 random numbers were computer generated to enable stratification for the 3 models of antenatal care (obstetrician, standard and caseload midwifery) as well as providing within each group an acupuncture, PMR and usual antenatal depression hospital care allocation. Additional random numbers were generated to ensure sufficient are available for each model of care, as equal numbers are not anticipated to be recruited from the each model, for example, few women are expected to be recruited from the 'obstetrician' model, as this group generally comprises high risk pregnancies and hence, many participant in this group will be ineligible for the study.  </sequence>

    <designfeatures>The morbidity of this population is considered sufficiently serious to maintain existing treatment and the interventions will be evaluated as adjunctive therapies. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This trial is designed to demonstrate a difference in means EPDS scores at the end of the intervention. Assuming a mean score of 8.9 with a standard deviation (SD) of 5 in the acupuncture group versus 13 with a SD of 6.5 in the usual care group, with an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a sample size of 75 participants is required. High attrition rates of up to 30% have been reported in this population, hence an additional 30% will be recruited, resulting in a total sample size of 96, with 32 participants being randomized into each arm. A range of data analysis techniques will be used including descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations, frequency and percentages) to describe the characteristics of the study population. An intention to treat analysis will be undertaken, with between group differences explored using mixed effects ANOVA for primary and secondary endpoints for depression, stress, anxiety and quality of life EPDS, DASS and WHOQoL. Further statistical advise will be sought in regard to exploring the effect on OT / OT-R between groups. Effect sizes will be reported with 95% confidence intervals. The analysis will be considered significant if the p value is less than 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression in pregnancy is common and also associated with detrimental consequences to both mother and child.  Current treatments are limited in that they are not universally effective and also many pregnant women are reluctant to take anti-depressant medications during pregnancy, due to fear of negative foetal effects.  Acupuncture may offer a safe alternative as preliminary evidence is suggestive that it is effective in reducing depressive symptoms both during pregnancy and also into the postnatal period.  In order to strengthen this evidence base further research is required.  How acupuncture may achieve this effect is also unknown and in order to investigate this further, this study aims to assess whether acupuncture positively influences a hormone that is involved in stress buffering, mood stabilisation and maternal / infant bonding.</summary>
