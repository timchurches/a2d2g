  <interventions>
    <interventions>While effective treatments are available for mild levels of alcohol and drug dependence the repeated and persistent, long lasting nature of the disorder often involves people attending groups to prevent relapse. One type of approach considers whether by learning to accept and just notice the cravings for substances, instead of trying to suppress or fight off the cravings, makes it easier for people to use different or opposing behaviours to prevent relapse. This study examines the effect of an eight session programme designed to disrupt  thoughts, feelings, and bodily functions implicated in stress-initiated relapse to alcohol consumption.

The intervention will compare a Mindfulness based intervention adapted from Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression (Segal et al . 2002) with a standard alcohol support group (ASG) treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:

Mindfulness groups:   8 x 1.25 hr /week of mindfulness training  (n=14, 2  groups, Total n=28)

ASG Groups:       8 x 1.25 hr /week of ASG (n=14, 2 groups, Total =28)

Session-Specific Description of Mindfulness and ASG Interventions
Session		Mindfulness Based Intervention	
1.	Discussion of mindfulness and automatic drinking; mindfulness of craving; mindful breathing and body scan

2.	Discussion of cognitive reappraisal; practice of mindful de-centring and mindful breathing

3.	Discussion of attentional re-orienting as means of coping with negative emotions and craving; mindful breathing; mindfulness of perceptions &amp; sensations

4.	Discussion of craving; practice of "urge surfing," mindfulness of craving, and contemplation of negative consequences of drinking; imaginal alcohol cue exposure; mindful breathing practice

5.	Discussion of the relationship of the stress response to craving; imaginal stress exposure; mindful breathing

6.	Discussion of thought suppression, aversion, and attachment; exercise in the futility of thought suppression; mindful breathing and acceptance

7.	Discussion of relational triggers for relapse; mindful communication; compassion meditation

8.	Breathing Review; discussion of how to maintain mindfulness practice; development of mindful relapse prevention plan; imaginal rehearsal of mindful relapse prevention; mindful breathing

Session:                       ASG treatment
	1.	Discussion of triggers for alcohol dependence relapse

2.	Discussion of justifications for relapse and using alcohol to mask one's emotions

3.	Discussion of how participants cope with emotions of anger and sadness

4.	Discussion of how participants cope with craving and managing compulsive behavior

5.	Discussion of stress and methods participants use to relax without alcohol

6.	Discussion of the attempt to maintain control and loss of control

7.	Discussion of physical health promotion and ways to recreate without alcohol

8.	Discussion of co-dependence relationships and the challenge of forming friendships without alcohol

    <concealment>All the people who are currently in the therapeutic community will be invited to attend an informal presentation about the study conducted by the student investigator and clinical psychologist at the therapeutic community. The prospective participants will receive the following information:

Nature and Purpose of the Study
What the Study will Involve
Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal from the Study
Benefits of the Study
Possible Risks
Reimbursement 

People who would like to participate may do so at the end of the presentation by signing the consent form in the presence of the presenters. Persons wishing to consider their participation can do so during the following week and can complete the consent form in the presence of the clinical psychologist at the therapeutic community. Two weeks following the informal presentation participants will becontacted and interviewed to check that they have given formal written consent by a research assistants who will conduct screening interviews. 

Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be allocated a number by the therapeutic community clinical psychologist.   The list of participants and their assigned codes will be held in a locked filing cabinet at  the therapeutic community administration. The student researcher will not have access to this list. Data will only have the de-identified two number code for analysis purposes. A random sample calculator will be used to allocate participants to one of two treatment conditions. Participants will be asked not to discuss treatment experiences between the two conditions during the period of the research.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random sample calculator (graphpad.com) will be used to randomly assign subjects to treatment groups. 

The total population (56) at the Therapeutic Community will be offered both treatments at the completion of the 3 month follow up stage.</sequence>
