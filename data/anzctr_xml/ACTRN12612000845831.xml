  <interventions>
    <interventions>We enrolled all relapsing idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis patients seen at our Department between July 2004 and April 2011. The patients received Prednisone and Methotrexate for one year.
The enrolled patients received prednisone (PDN) at a starting dose of 0.5-1 mg/Kg/day depending on relapse severity then tapered to 5 mg/day within 6-8 months and kept at a maintenance dose of 2.5-5 mg/day until month 12. The tapering schedule was left at the discretion of the treating clinician. PDN was given as oral tablets once daily for one year. 
Methotrexate (MTX) was given orally (or intramuscularly if the oral administration was not tolerated) at a starting dose of 10-15 mg/week, rapidly titrated up to 15-20 mg/week; the MTX dose was kept unchanged until month 12.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary study end-point was the
remission rate at month 12, with remission being defined
as disappearance of symptoms, normalisation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein values, and absence of hydronephrosis.
Remission was assessed basing on patients symptoms, imaging assessments (CT or MR) and blood tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>change in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis thickness.

This outcome was assessed basing on the measured thickness of the retrperitoneal tissue during the imaging assessments (CT or MR).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months, 12 months, end of follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>variations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive
protein values

This outcome was assessed on blood analysis results.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months, 12 months, end of follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>change in estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR)

This outcome was assessed on blood analysis results.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months, 12 months, end of follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>presence or absence of ureteral obstruction and of ureteral decompressive device.

This outcome was assessed basing on imaging assessments (ultrasounds, CT or MR) results.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months, 12 months, end of follow-up.</timepoint>
