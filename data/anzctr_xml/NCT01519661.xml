    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - TBM100

Experimental: Tobramycin Inhalation Powder (TIP) - Eligible patients were assigned to four capsules of TIP at 28mg dosage strength, inhaled b.i.d. in the morning and in the evening via the T-326 inhaler, for 28 days (on treatment), followed by 28 days of no study treatment (off treatment). Each treatment therefore consisted of 112mg tobramycin (4 capsules of 28mg each) with the total daily dose = 224mg tobramycin (112mg b.i.d.). These 56 days represented 1 cycle of therapy.


Treatment: drugs: TBM100
Tobramycin inhalation powder was assigned as four capsules at 28mg dosage strength. It was inhaled b.i.d in the morning and in the evening via the T-326 Inhaler.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Deaths - Adverse events were deemed treatment-emergent if the onset date/time was on or after the date and time of first study drug. All adverse events were included after this time during both on and off-treatment periods.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relative Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Percent Predicted - Spirometry was performed at each visit. FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 were recorded at all visits according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. FEV1 = the volume of air expired in 1 second. FEV1 % predicted is a normalized value of FEV1 calculated using the Knudsen equation, based upon participant's age, gender and height. FVC (forced vital capacity) = the maximal volume of air exhaled with maximally forced effort from a position of maximal inspiration. FEF25-75 = forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of the FVC. Relative change in FEV1 % predicted from baseline to pre-dose day X = ((pre-dose day X FEV1 % predicted - baseline FEV1 % predicted) / baseline FEV1 % predicted)  100.</outcome>

Results are presented for the sum of all biotypes of Pa, with data transformed using a base 10 logarithm.</outcome>
