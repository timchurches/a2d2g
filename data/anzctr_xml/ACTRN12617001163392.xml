  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to evaluate whether sending routine reminder letters and/ or reminder phone calls in a womans preferred language (Arabic or Italian) is associated with an increase in rates of booking a breast screening appointment. Women who have recorded their preferred language as either Arabic or Italian at their initial breast screening appointment with Breast Screen Victoria will receive their routine 2-yearly reminder letter to attend breast cancer screening  in their preferred language (with English on the other side). In addition, women who are greater than 27 months since their last screen ("lapsed screeners") will be telephoned in their preferred language to remind them to book an appointment to screen and to assist them to book an appointment if required.
Participants will receive only one reminder letter and only one phone call.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the routine reminder letters in preferred language, the control group will continue to receive their reminder letter Breast Screen Victoria in English, as per usual practice.
For the "lapsed screeners", the control group will not receive any intervention (Breast Screen Victoria do not routinely telephone lapsed screeners).</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size, routine reminder letter: For a pooled sample, the aim is to detect a 10% difference in screening rates between each intervention and the usual care group; a pooled sample size of 373 per intervention arm will be sufficient to detect this difference (based on 80% power and a Type 1 error rate of 5%).  We are interested in sub-group analysis by cultural group, and as the number of Italian women due to be rescreened is approximately 30% higher than for Arabic women, this sample size can be randomly allocated as: 
	Arabic women=160 in each arm. This will detect a 15% increase in screening rates (from a baseline screening rate of 56% ). Based on findings from other studies, it is reasonable to assume that this slightly higher response rate is achievable for Arabic women
	Italian women=213 in each arm. This will detect a 10-15% increase in screening rates.
Given the nature of the study design, there is no need to inflate the sample sizes to allow for drop out. 
Sample size lapsed screeners: Lapsed screeners will be randomised to intervention and usual care. Assuming a conservative current screening rate of 10% for lapsed screeners (this rate is unknown by Breast Screen Victoria, but can by definition be assumed to be 0%), a 15% increase in screening (power=80% and Type 1 error rate=5%) would require a total pooled sample size of 200. Given that the number of Italian women is approximately 30% higher, this sample size can be allocated as:
	Arabic women=43 in each arm. This will detect a 25% increase in screening rates.
	Italian women=57 in each arm. This will detect between 20-25% increase in screening rates.
Analysis: For each cultural group, categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. No continuous data will be collected for this study.  Primary and secondary outcomes will be modelled as proportions. Differences between control and intervention groups will be analysed using chi-square.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether providing reminder letters and phone calls in women's preferred languages improves breast cancer screening rates in North-West Melbourne, Australia.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are in the BreastScreen Victoria region of North-West Melbourne and are eligible for breast cancer screening, who has previously identified your preferred language as Italian or Arabic, and who are due to receive their 2-yearly routine reminder letter, or have not re-screened following a reminder letter at least 3 months previously.

Study details
All participants in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the usual reminder letter only (in English), or to receive the reminder letter in their preferred language (as well as English on the reverse side) and a phone call at 3 months following the reminder letter if no appointment has been made.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on whether providing reminders for breast cancer screening in women's preferred language can improve the rates of rebooking in these populations.</summary>
