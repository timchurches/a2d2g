  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive a 7 day pre-phase of dasatinib (70mg tablets, twice daily) prior to chemotherapy. Dasatinib will then be given at 50mg twice daily in combination with intensive chemotherapy using oral and intravenous drugs. Intensive chemotherapy consists of alternating courses of hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycicn, and dexamethasone) with methotrexate plus cytarabine.  Each course of dasatinib plus chemotherapy lasts 14 days and a maximum of 8 courses will be given.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of the drug Dasatinib combined with chemotherapy for treating people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cancer of bone marrow and white blood cells) who also have the Philadelphia Chromosome.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you:
- are aged 1670 years
- have the Philadelphia Chromosome
- have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia which has not yet been treated.

Trial details:
All participants will receive Dasatinib tablets for 7 days prior to chemotherapy. Dasatinib will then be given at 50mg twice daily in combination with intensive chemotherapy using oral and intravenous drugs. Each course of Dasatinib plus chemotherapy lasts 14 days and a maximum of 8 courses will be given.

Dasatinib is used to reduce the risk of relapse by killing cells with mutations that might otherwise be resistant to the more commonly used drug in this situation, called imatinib. The trial aims to assess the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of Dasatinib plus chemotherapy.</summary>
