  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aims of the project are to: (1) Develop and validate an online psychological treatment program specifically designed to diagnose and treat Panic Disorder (PD) and/or Major Depressive Episode (MDE), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) associated with IBD; and, (2) Make this specialized service available free of charge to all individuals with IBD throughout Australia and internationally.

The treatment program, a CBT based support program, address several key issues identified in the literature and in the IBD clinics, including; psychoeducation about IBD, nutrition and IBD, mindfulness and relaxation strategies, managing pain, dealing with worry and unhelpful thoughts, and identifying and establishing adaptive cognitive coping strategies. 

Participants, over 14 weeks (completing one module per week in their own time [max 2 hours/module]) complete the assessment and treatment modules they will also be asked to provide feedback and suggestions regarding the IBDclinic content in weekly questionnaires (mailed back at the end of the intervention).</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU)

Participants allocated to the TAU groups (TAU-MDE, TAU-PD, TAU-GAD, TAU-SAD) will have access to the standard referral services, such as GPs, psychologist, counsellors, medication, etc). In addition they will have limited access to IBDclinic so that they can complete the ePASS assessments.  Participants allocated to the treatment groups (IBDclinic -MDE, IBDclinic-PD, IBDclinic -SAD, IBDclinic -GAD) will be given access to ePASS and the relevant treatment module.  With the patients permission, gastroenterologists will provide the researchers a summary of the individuals diagnosis, disease severity score (CDAI or UCDAI) and psychological condition.</comparator>

      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: Difference in rating on ePASS of anxiety or depression between the treatment as usual and IBDclinic intervention groups.

e-PASS is broken up into a series of modules and each module assesses for a particular mental health condition (e.g., Panic Disorder). Depending on how you answer the questions in each module, you will either be asked to continue to complete more questions or you will by-pass that particular module and jump to the next one that assesses for another mental health condition (e.g., Social Anxiety Disorder). This process continues until you reach the last module. Once completed e-PASS will automatically generate a feedback summary form that will provide you with the results of your online psychological assessment and treatment recommendations (if symptoms were identified).</outcome>

    <summary>Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinics at Royal Melbourne Hospital (3052) and St Vincents Hospital (3065).

This research involves the development and evaluation of an online intervention designed to provide individually tailored interventions to treat Panic Disorder, Major Depression, Social Anxiety, and Generalised Anxiety associated with IBD.  Research has shown that people with IBD have higher levels of Panic Disorder (PD) and Major Depression (MDE; Major Depressive Episode), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) than people with other chronic health conditions.  While research on the effectiveness of psychological interventions in IBD is encouraging to date only limited work has been done on the evaluation of these programs.  The aims of the current research project are to: (1) Develop and validate an online psychological treatment program specifically designed to diagnose and treat PD GAD, SAD, and/or MDE symptoms associated with IBD, and (2) Make this specialized service available free of charge to all individuals with IBD throughout Australia and internationally.  

In this project a three stage development and evaluation of an online intervention for IBD: (1) Development stage where an IBDeTherapy website is developed, revised and tested; (2) Evaluation stage I where 40 IBD patients complete a 14 week intervention program online; and, (3) Evaluation stage II involves 240 individuals from an IBD outpatient hospital cohort (Intervention groups: 30 MDE, 30 PD, 30 SAD, 30 GAD; Treatment as usual control groups: 30 MDE, 30 PD, 30 SAD, 30 GAD) in a large trial of the program that incorporates changes based on the initial evaluation stage.  The present project is innovative because provision of online programs for IBD sufferers has the potential to provide better psychological care to these people than previously available. In addition, the established effectiveness of online intervention programs with clinical populations suggests that an online intervention is likely to have a high uptake and thus reduce the pressure on the health system.</summary>
