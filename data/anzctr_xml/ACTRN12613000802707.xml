    <interventions>This is an observational study of patients undergoing hepatic resection to characterise the changes to coagulation which are experienced and correlate these with patient, perioperative and surgical factors.  
Patients will be observed from the day of surgery until 1 year post surgery with review points at: Day 1, Day 3, Day 5 (if certain conditions met), week 2-3 (clinic review time), week 4-6 (clinic review time) and 1 year (clinic review time).  

At the 1 year review only survival status, cancer recurrence and reporting of any further bleeding or clotting events will be recorded.  No blood tests or endothelial assessment will occur at 1 year.  </interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the temporal pattern of thromboembolism and bleeding events throughout the perioperative period for hepatic resection surgery

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an observational study evaluating bleeding and clotting complications in patients undergoing liver surgery for cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and are undergoing hepatic resection (i.e. surgical removal of all or a portion of the liver) for malignancy at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Study details Changes to the blood clotting system following liver surgery have not been well characterised and information is conflicting. The traditional view is that as the liver makes important clotting factors surgery would reduce this production and make patients more likely to bleed. However, some recent work has suggested that actually liver resection patients are prone to blood clotting and the bigger the surgery the higher the risk. This study aims to use laboratory tests of coagulation to determine what actually occurs. Patients will be observed from the day of surgery until 1 year post surgery with review points at: Day 1, Day 3, Day 5 (if certain conditions met), week 2-3 (clinic review time), week 4-6 (clinic review time) and 1 year (clinic review time). Data collected from this study will help us to develop guidelines for management of blood clotting around the time of liver surgery. Additionally, the rate of bleeding and clotting complications will also be recorded. </summary>
