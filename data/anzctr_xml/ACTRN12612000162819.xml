  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were randomized to 2 groups according to applied sedation protocol as follows. 
Group 1: intravenous bolus saline was administred before propofol 
Group 2: intravenous bolus 0.25 mg/kg ketamine was administered before propofol.
In each group propofol dosage was titrated according to patients sedation level. For both groups target sedation level was 1-2 with Modified Observer's assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Sedation
Assessed both by patients with questionniares and by the endoscopists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaires were performed to patients before discharging and 24 hours after the procedure.
Endoscopist was asked to evaluate the quality of sedation at the end of the procedure between 0 and 10 (0: worst and 10:best)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of adverse events such as apnea, bradycardia, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, agitation, dreaming. The patients will be observed for the adverse events after the procedure until discharge. Therefore clinical assessment will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During and after the procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recovery time;
Time to spontaneous eye opening, time to discharge and aldrette scores.
The aldrete score is a score of 1 through 10 assessing a patient after anesthesia for discharge criteria. The Aldrete score assesses level of consciousness, respirtory status, circulatory status, activity and oxygen saturation</outcome>
      <timepoint>After the procedure
Aldrette scores were recorded at 2.5 minutes intervals after the procedure</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Propofol is frequently used for sedation in endoscopy units. Usually opioids are used in combination to propofol in order to improve the quality of sedation. However combining opioids with propofol usually raises the incidance of adverse events such as apnea. Ketamine is usually used for sedation for invasive procedures outside the operating room especially in children. Its not preffered in adults for sedation because of agitation and hallucinations which can be prevented by using sedative or hypnotic agents. The most important advantage of using ketamine is that it does not supress the airway reflexes. 
Thus it can be hypotised that ketamine may be a better agent of choice than opioids to combine with propofol during sedation.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of ketamine added to propofol in terms of propofol sparing effects, quality of sedation, adverse events and recovery times.</summary>
