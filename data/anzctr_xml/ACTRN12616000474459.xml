  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a controlled trial with cluster allocation of participants identified by their maternal and child health nurse as being at risk of mood disorder. Participants who meet SCID criteria for major depressive episode (post partum onset) will be cluster allocated in groups of between three and five to one of two conditions: either treatment as usual via their maternal and child health nurse; or treatment as usual PLUS a group therapy of a 10-week Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) with mother-child content (IPT-MC). Assessment will be made by mental health clinicians qualified to administer SCID (at least provisional psychologist status). 
Treatment: Group facilitators will be psychologists with specific training in IPT-MC. The intervention is 10 x weekly 1.5 hour session. There is an additional partners-only session for the partners of participants, conducted during either Week 7 or Week 8. This psychoeducational in nature only, providing information on PND and suggestions to support their spouse focussed on listening to requests for support, and emphasising both instrumental and emotional support as options. 
IPT focusses on communication strategies used by participants to gather, access, and negotiate both emotional and instrumental support. The sessions involve participants brainstorming and working on communication strategies. Particular focus is paid to the role transition to parenthood and how that affects social support; communication with the new baby; communication with their partner; and communication with other social supports. Participants are strongly encouraged to attend all 10 sessions and monitored however are not excluded if they miss sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>TAU: All participants, including those allocated to the treatment as usual group, will receive their normal 'best practice' care by their Maternal and Child Health Nurse, including any option as currently exist in the community. This includes referral to GP for psychological intervention/medication, sleep interventions ("sleep school"), educational, support, or intervention groups, or "new parents" group for those with babies of appropriate age.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Women need to have a sufficient grasp of English to participate in a group therapy, and this will be determined by their ability to participate fully in the assessment interview. If they are unable to understand the content of any of the interview questions or are unable to verbally communicate their answers, they will be considered to not be able to benefit from a group therapy. Women will also be excluded if they fulfill any of the following criteria: current substance abuse, diagnosed manic/hypomanic episode or psychosis; current inpatient psychiatric admission; or participation with any of their children in an attachment-based mother-child intervention. </exclusivecriteria>

    <sequence>This is a cluster allocation procedure in which groups of three to five women are grouped together. The first three women who agree to participate in the trial in the same Council site, are grouped together. This group may include three, four, or five women if additional women become eligible for inclusion within three weeks of the allocation being made. The allocation is made once three women are eligible to be grouped. The next group of three to five women is again grouped based on location and a cutoff of three weeks after the date that three women become available. This group is allocated to the alternate condition. For example, if the first allocation was to IPT-MC, the next group are automatically allocated to TAU. The purpose of cluster allocation is to reduce the amount of time eligible women spend waiting to participate in the program.

    <statisticalmethods>An umbrella MANOVA will test the main and interaction effects for a design incorporating 2 treatment groups (between groups) x 3 treatment times (within groups) x 4 response variables. MANOVA will be completed for the primary outcomes (EAS maternal sensitivity, maternal attachment self-report, parenting stress, and infant behaviours). A separate 2 x 3 x 3 MANOVA will then be completed for the secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety, and social adjustment).
Repeated measures ANOVA follow-up tests will be conducted for each individual measure, and those that reveal significant effects would have t-tests for individual differences. This is in line with the approach taken by Forman et al (2003) in their study on the effects of IPT on maternal sensitivity. Planned contrast between-groups, two-tailed t-tests would test the individual differences between the mean scores (change from baseline) for the control and intervention groups at each time point. With an alpha level of 0.05 and a power level of 0.8, the effect size was set based on estimated MAI scores from the Mulcahy et al (2010) study of group IPT for PND. This gives an initial sample size required of n=32 participants. To account for moderate clustering within the groups, the number was increased by 50% to n=48 participants, and rounded to 50.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post-natal depression affects a mother's wellbeing and also has developmental and emotional risks for her child. More research is urgently required on interventions employing combined treatment for post-natal depression and the parenting relationship. This study trials an adapted interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for post-natal depression which incorporates a focus on the mother-child relationship and uses attachment theory to inform that focus where required. The study is a controlled trial with cluster-allocation of participants identified by their maternal and child health nurse as being at risk. Participants who meet criteria for post-natal depression will be allocation in groups of between three and five to either a group therapy of a 10-week IPT with mother-child content (IPT-MC), or to treatment as usual via their maternal and child health nurse.
The trial addresses the need for investigations into combined mother-child relational and mood interventions. It recognises difficulties associated with the recruitment of new mothers suffering from depression and attempts strategies to overcome these barriers to care.
