  <interventions>
    <interventions>A vitamin B12 supplement capsule for oral  supplementation. The capsule contains cyanocobalamin 6mcg [Vitamin B12 0.1% water soluble] and microcrystalline cellulose as the filler filled into a vegetable Capsugel. Participants in the vitamin B12 supplement group are to take one capsule daily (by oral ingestion) continuously for a period of six months. Repeat bottles of vitamin B12 supplement capsules will be hand delivered to participants at six weeks, and three months and four and a half months post enrolment into the study. Any remaining supplement capsules from the previous period will be manually counted to measure compliance with capsule intake.  At the completion of the six month study period the vitamin B12 supplementation group will be offered individualized dietary advice to increase or maintain their intake of vitamin B12 containing foods to a minimum intake of 2.4 mcg of vitamin B12 per day. This advice will be given once only at the six month (and final) measurement visit.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator 1: Placebo capsule only for 6 months. The placebo is a capsule for oral supplementation that is visually identical to the vitamin B12 supplement capsule. It contains Microcrystalline cellulose as filler and red food colour powder as colour, filled into a vegetable Capsugel. The placebo treatment will be one capsule daily (by oral ingestion) continuously for a period of six months. Repeat bottles of placebo supplement capsules will be hand delivered to participants at six weeks, three months and four and a half months post enrolment into the study. Any remaining placebo supplement capsules from the previous period will be manually counted to measure compliance with the capsule intake. At the completion of the six month study period the vitamin B12 supplementation group will be offered indivdualized dietary advice to increase or maintain their intake of vitamin B12 containing foods to a minimum of 2.4 mcg of vitamin B12 per day. This advice will be given once only at the six month (and final) measurement visit. 
Comparator 2: Vitamin B12 dietary advice only at baseline, six weeks, three months and six months. This involves one on one individualized dietary advice to increase or maintain intake of vitamin B12 containing foods. The dietary advice will be administered by the researcher and will be tailored to the participants preferred intake of vitamin B12 containing foods as assessed from one on one interviews with the participant and the researcher administered food frequency questionnaire at baseline, six weeks, three months and six months. The dietary advice will recommend in writing the quantity and type of vitamin B12 containing foods required for a minimum dietary vitamin B12 intake of 2.4 mcg per day, ongoing over the six month study period. In between the data collection periods, the researcher is available to participants by telephone or email if any clarification of the vitamin B12 dietary advice is required.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants recruited through advertisment.
Stratified into one of two strata by meat/non-meat eating diet. Participants from each stratum randomly assigned to one of the three intervention groups. A third party not directly involved in the research will be responsible for the randomisation process using a sequence matched random number table. That third party will keep in a locked safe, the confidential record of the participant study ID matched to their sequence number and name. Direct members of the research team will not be aware of who has been assigned to what group or the matching of a name to the study ID.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random number tables. As participants volunteer to take part they will be allocated a meat or non meat strata sequence number that corresponds to a number on the table allocating them to one of three groups. The sequence number and its matching to the random number will be known only to the third party not directly associated with the research. Direct members of the research team will not have access to the participant name/ sequence number/random number matching table.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>One of the intervention groups is a dietary advice group to compare the efficacy of dietary advice to increase serum B12 with the B12 supplementation and placebo groups. It is not feasible to blind the dietary advice group participants or the research assistant providing dietary advice and collecting the group data. The data from this group will be entered and initially analysed with the researcher unaware of which group the data is from.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to increase vitamin B12 stores in South Asian women of child bearing age. The hypothesis is that individualized dietary advice to increase intake of vitamin B12 containing foods will be more effective over 6 months than low dose (6mcg) B12 supplementation which in turn will be more effective than placebo in increasing serum vitamin B12 levels. Blood samples will be taken to monitor serum B12, folate, Active B12 ( HoloTC) , glucose, insulin, lipids, and full blood count at entry into the study, 6 weeks and 6 months post enrolment</summary>
