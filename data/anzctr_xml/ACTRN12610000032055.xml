- Have provided written informed consent before any trial procedures are undertaken 
- Be aged 60 years or older, and 
- have a lifetime history of depressive symptoms (defined as a K-10 score ranging from 16 to 29) meaning that participants included in the trial will be at greater risk of depression. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if they: - Have a history of stroke/other serious cerebro or cardiovascular illness, neurological, psychiatric or neurodegenerative disease or other significant illness; Show clinically relevant levels of depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the time of screening or, receive a diagnosis of depression based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) at the time of completing the medical assessment; Are suicidal at the time of screening or at the time of completing the medical assessment; Show abnormal liver function or; Are currently taking anti-depressant medications and it is deemed unadvisable by the trial psychiatrist to cease these medications for the period of the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will originally be recruited, via mail, through the Australian Electoral Commission, as per previous methods. Those who consent to participate will complete the initial eligibility screening interview over the telephone to identify any current depressive symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Once telephone screening is complete, all participants will undergo a medical examination with a trial physician. As recruitment occurs, the allocation of treatment to participants will be administered independently of personnel in day-to-day contact with participants through an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) managed by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre. As recruitment occurs, a member of the Beyond Ageing Project Team will call the IVRS to carry out the random allocation. Each individual will be randomly assigned a value of 1 to 3, corresponding to one of the intervention arms, using the IVRS. The allocation of intervention arms to each numerical value will be documented by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, not to be revealed until the completion of the trial unless un-blinding is required in an emergency.</concealment>
    <sequence>Our randomization procedure is based on variable length blocks and is administered  independently of personnel in day-to-day contact with participants. 

Stratification will be according to sex, region and presenting depression severity (score on the K10). The last factor is used to ensure that the 'tail' of participants with higher levels of symptoms is distributed equally across conditions.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The two different medication types are quite different in appearance, hence to ensure participants are blind to the treatment they are receiving, we are using two placebos. Participants will take two different medication types each day. Either: Four omega-3 capsules and one placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) tablet or; one sertraline hydrochloride tablet and four placebo (oil) capsules or; four placebo (oil) capsules and one placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) tablet.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate whether two interventions; omega-3 fatty acids supplements (fish oil) and the antidepressant, sertraline, are able to reduce or prevent depression and cognitive change. The study will run over 12 months and participants will be randomly allocated to one of the interventions or to a placebo condition.  

Participants will be assessed at different time points by telephone interviews, self report surveys, medical examinations and brief psychological assessments. These assessments will look at the effectiveness of the two interventions in reducing symptoms of depression and/or new cases of depression and reducing cognitive decline (e.g. changes in memory, concentration and thinking) associated with ageing. 

Additionally, because depression is believed to have a biological basis and because both these interventions influence brain activity, participants will also be invited to have three brain scans over the time of the study. We hope to track the effects of fish oil and sertraline on the brain changes associated with the normal ageing.</summary>
