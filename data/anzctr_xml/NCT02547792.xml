  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase 1, single-center, placeb-controlled, double-blind study. The purpose of this
      study is to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an oral vaccine tablet to prevent
      seasonal influenza B tested at two dose levels (low and high dose). The study will enroll 27
      subjects in the low dose cohorts (3 sentinel open label subjects followed by 24 subjects
      (randomized 2:1 to vaccine vs placebo, respectively). Subsequently, 27 subjects will be
      enrolled in the high dose cohort in a similar manner as to the low dose cohort. Safety and
      immunogenicity will be evaluated at Day 28. Long term safety follow-up will be evaluated
      through 1 year post vaccination.</summary>
