  <interventions>
    <interventions>Health and Wellbeing for Girls will be run as a Grade 8 (ages 13-14 years) endorsed elective course during normal curriculum time in 2017. The elective course will be implemented and evaluated as a group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in one secondary school. All students who choose to complete the elective course in 2017 will be randomised by class into either the intervention group (who complete the program Semester 1) or the wait-list control group (who will receive the program in Semester 2). There will be four (4) classes involved in the study, with approximately 90 girls participating in the program in 2017.

The Health and Wellbeing for Girls program is an evidence-based program that will be delivered by two experienced and qualified physical education teachers. It will be delivered within 5 hours of curriculum time per fortnight over two school terms (20 weeks), and includes relevant and enjoyable theory and practical components relating to mindfulness, wellbeing, physical activity behaviours, socio-emotional health and resilience. The feasibility and the effectiveness of the 20-week multi-component curriculum program for improving a range of health and wellbeing outcomes in adolescent girls in the school setting will be assessed using validated measures at baseline (Week 1 Term 1 2017) and at 6-months (Week 1 Term 3 2017). Participants will also be asked to give their opinions about the program via a short evaluation survey at the completion of the program.
Information provided to the classes includes activities on:
        Self - acceptance  and awareness, 
 	Cyber bullying / The effects of Social Media and Coping Strategies
 	Understanding that Body Image and Self Esteem can be improved
 	Sexual Health and Assertiveness / Recognising our Strengths
 	Stages of Girlhood / Girlhood to Womanhood
 	Drugs and their Impact on Decision Making
 	Importance of Positive Thinking On Achievement
 	Improving relationships amongst girls.
Mindfulness meditation techniques are taught, along with Yoga, 3 minute High Intensity Interval Training, Fitness activities and Games.
5 one-hour sessions are delivered during the fortnight in which PowerPoint presentations, video clips and questions, along with discussion group formats are utilised.
Register of attendance at every lesson is monitored electronically and a lesson register is kept by the teacher.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well recognised that wellbeing has close links with learning (NSW Department of Education and Communities, 2015b); where improvements in wellbeing have the potential to bring about positive change in self -concept and a lack thereof, can negatively affect a students engagement and success in learning (NSW Department of Education and Communities, 2015b). Consequently, there has been increased attention given to the study of wellbeing over the past decade, particularly in educational or school settings.
The wellbeing of adolescents has become a recent focus in public health due to the prevalence and rise in mental health disorders in this age group in recent times (with approximately 20% of adolescents worldwide having a diagnosed mental health illness) (Patton et al., 2012); and with the negative health consequences associated with physical inactivity trends in this age group (World Health Organisation, 2014). In Australia, the proportion of young people aged 1624 years having high or very high levels of psychological distress is approximately 9%, the prevalence of mental disorders is approximately 26% (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2011), and almost 80% of adolescents are not meeting physical activity guidelines (Hallal et al., 2012). Mental disorders and physical inactivity are now considered leading causes of ill-health in this age group, often with lasting effects throughout adulthood (Kieling et al., 2011; Kohl III et al., 2012; World Health Organisation, 2014).
Of note, there is a distinct gender pattern in physical and mental health after the age of 13 years, with adolescent girls generally reporting more mental health problems than boys and exhibit lower levels of physical activity (Beets, Bornstein, Beighle, B.J., &amp; Morgan, 2010; Myrin &amp; Lagerstrom, 2008; Nitzko &amp; Seiffge-Krenke, 2009)
When combined with inadequate coping strategies, increased stress levels in the adolescent years can have profound and negative health consequences (including anxiety and depression) (Chrousos, 2009; Dougall, Hyman, Hayward, McFeeley, &amp; Baum, 2001; K. A. McLaughlin &amp; Hatzenbuehler, 2009a, 2009b; K. J. McLaughlin, Baran, &amp; Conrad, 2009; Seiffge-Krenke, Aunola, &amp; Nurmi, 2009)
