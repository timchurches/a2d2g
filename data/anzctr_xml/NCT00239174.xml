  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of SR147778 on weight loss over a period of
      24 weeks when prescribed with a hypocaloric diet in obese patients. The secondary objective
      is to assess the safety and tolerability of SR147778 and to assess the effect of SR147778 on
      several secondary parameters (such as waist, metabolic parameters) over a period of 24 weeks
      when prescribed with a hypocaloric diet in obese patients.</summary>
