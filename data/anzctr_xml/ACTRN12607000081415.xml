  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evidence supports the use of progressive strengthening, functional training, and aerobic exercise in stroke rehabilitation, with improvements noted even when patients are more than 6 months after stroke. However, limitations of current studies are that the main outcomes are measured in a clinical environment, which may not relate to a change in usual activity in an individuals usual environment. Recently activity monitors have been introduced as a way to measure walking during usual activity and for longer periods. 
Although it is known that rehabilitation exercise programmes can improve strength, walking speed and endurance and balance following stroke, it is not known whether this translates into the change in the amount or speed of walking that an individual does in their home or community environments. This study aims to look at the effects of a group exercise programme to see if it changes walking (as measured by an activity monitor) in home and community environments as well as walking as it is usually measured (with tests in a physiotherapy clinic).</summary>
