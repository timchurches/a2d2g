  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group = 6 week reminder.

The intervention will consist of text message reminders sent to the participant's phone at 6 weeks postpartum, with a subsequent reminder at 3 months and 6 months if the participant does not report having undertaken an oral glucose tolerance test. The text messages will include the participant's first name, but will otherwise be generic. The text message will remind the participant that it is time for them to have an oral glucose tolerance test to see whether they have type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. We also ask the participants to let us know when they have had the test, and the results of the test, although this part of the text message is for data collection purposes only.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group = 6 month reminder.

The women in the control group will receive a text message reminder at 6 months postpartum to have their oral glucose tolerance test.  

As with the 6 week group, the text message will remind the participant that it is time for them to have an oral glucose tolerance test to see whether they have type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. We also ask the participants to let us know when they have had the test, and the results of the test, although this part of the text message is for data collection purposes only.

The study's primary outcome is whether or not an OGTT was undertaken by 6 months,  so this 6 month reminder will not influence the primary outcome.

Note: The National Gestational Diabetes Register (NDSS Australia) sends out a reminder letter at 12-16 weeks after the expected due date, and women in both intervention and control groups may sign up to this register.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether oral glucose tolerance testing has been undertaken by six months postpartum.

Details: 
To determine whether or not oral glucose tolerance testing has been undertaken by 6 months postpartum, three main methods of data collection will be utilised: 

(1) asking participants to let us know whether they have had an OGTT in the initial text message
(2) asking participants whether they have had an OGTT in the 6 month postpartum follow up questionnaire
(3) checking the clinical information system in the hospital to see whether an OGTT has been done

Further data collection methods may be considered if data collection is not adequately complete using these methods alone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months postpartum</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of women having other blood glucose tests.

Details: 
The "other blood glucose tests" are glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose. This data will be collected only via the 6 month follow up questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months postpartum</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of potentially influential factors between responders and non responders in the intervention group. 

Details: 
These factors have been selected as a result of literature review and careful consideration.

Trial entry weight and height will be measured for BMI calculation.
Some additional baseline characteristics and data relating to gestational diabetes will be asked verbally at recruitment. Maternal and neonatal outcomes relating to gestational diabetes will be collected from medical records. Finally, the 6 month postpartum questionnaire asks some questions regarding both current and past lifestyle as an indicator of tendency to adhere to health-related recommendations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Various</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Test results from OGTT (where applicable)

Details: OGTT test results will be collected via multiple methods to ensure data collection is as complete as possible:
(1) asking participants to provide their results in initial text message
(2) asking participants to provide their results in the 6 month postpartum follow up questionnaire
(3) checking the clinical information system in the hospital for results</outcome>
      <timepoint>From six weeks to six months postpartum</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preferred reminder system. 

Details: Women will be asked in the 6 month follow up questionnaire what their preferred mode of reminder system is (postal, email, text, voice call).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months postpartum</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost of text reminders. 

Details: Text message credits have been purchased at a set cost and the number of text messages sent will be recorded for both the intervention and control groups.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes, or glucose intolerance, that develops during pregnancy. Women who have had gestational diabetes are many times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the future compared with women who have normal blood glucose levels during pregnancy. Thus, it is important to screen these women after they have given birth to see whether they have type 2 diabetes, such that it can be treated, or to see whether they are on the way to developing type 2 diabetes (have impaired glucose tolerance), such that preventative changes can be made. 

The best way of detecting type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance is with an oral glucose tolerance test, and this test is recommended by many health organisations, such as the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society, to be undertaken in the early postpartum period. Despite this, evidence shows that many women who have had gestational diabetes do not receive this follow up testing. 

The DIAMIND study is aiming to test whether a text message based reminder system (using mobile phone technology) will increase the number of women who have had gestational diabetes who undertake oral glucose tolerance testing in the postpartum period.</summary>
