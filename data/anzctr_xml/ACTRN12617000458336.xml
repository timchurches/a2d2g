    <statisticalmethods>There is no statistical rationale for the selected sample size of the single-dose and multiple-dose treatment cohorts. The sample size was based on prior experience to ensure that the safety and tolerability of IONIS-TMPRSS6-Lrx will be adequately assessed while minimizing unnecessary subject exposure.
All eCRF data, lab data transfers, and any outcomes derived from the data will be provided in the subject data listings. Subject data listings will be presented for all subjects enrolled into the study. Descriptive summary statistics including n (number of subjects), mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, interquartile range (25th percentile, 75th percentile), and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables will be used to summarize most data. Where appropriate, p-values will be reported.
All statistical tests will be conducted using 2-sided tests with 5% Type I error rate unless 
otherwise stated.
For analysis of Cohorts A-C, the placebo subjects in these cohorts will be pooled into a placebo group. </statisticalmethods>
