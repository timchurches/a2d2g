    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were based on blood loss data from Sheehan et al (mean +/- SD, 843 +/-487 ml) and an inferiority margin of 300 ml deemed as clinically significant. With beta = 0.20 and alpha = 0.05, 33 patients were required for each group to ensure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval would be below the non-inferiority limit of 300ml.

Descriptive statistics of the study groups at baseline; means and standard deviations or 95 % confidence intervals (95% CI) will be presented except where indicated. Geometric means and standard error of the mean (SEM) will be presented for skewed outcomes. Group differences will be assessed using the two sample equal-variance t-test and chi-squared or Fisher exact tests where required. 
The primary outcome will be regressed on oxytocin dose (3IU vs 5IU) adjusted for BMI, pre-delivery vasopressor dose, parity and the presence of a uterine atony risk factor. A logarithmic transformation of the outcome variable will be performed after assessment of model residuals, back-transformed (geometric) means and 95% confidence intervals will be presented, and these limits will be used to assess non-inferiority. 
Propensity weighting will be used in all regression models to adjust for the non-random allocation of participants to treatment groups. A logistic regression model with the covariates; age, weight, previous caesarean section, seniority of obstetrician, seniority of anaesthetist,  will be used to generate propensity weights.
All models will be checked for violation of model assumptions. A p-value of 0.05 will be considered significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study sought to determine whether 3IU oxytocin was comparable to standard 5IU regarding postpartum blood loss in pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthetic, but could reduce blood pressure elevating medication (vasopressor) requirements and adverse events. We hypothesized that patients receiving 3IU oxytocin would be non-inferior to 5IU regarding postpartum blood loss and superior regarding uterine tone, incidence of low blood pressure (hypotension), blood pressure elevating medication (vasopressor) requirements and adverse events.</summary>
