  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two melatonin 3mg capsules, 6mg dose, will be administered via naso-gastric tube at 21:30 for 7 consecutive nights, in addition to temazepam tablet.  The starting dose of temazepam will be 10mg.  Treating doctors may prescribe further sedative-hypnotic therapy, statum or single orders only, as rescue sleep therapy if patient does not sleep on assigned study medications.  At the discretion of the treating team, the dose of temazepam may be increased the following night from 10mg, at daily increments of 10mg, to a maximum of 30mg.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nocturnal total sleep time (22:00 to 06:00) - excludes time spent asleep after sleep rescue therapy is administered.

Two objective measures of sleep duration will be used to estimate consistency of results.  These measures include wrist actigraphy, and nursing assessment.  Quality of sleep will be determined by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ).</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of awakenings during nocturnal sleep.

Two objective measures of nocturnal awakenings will be used to estimate consistency of results.  These measures include wrist actigraphy, and nursing assessment.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Episodes of agitation.

The Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS) is routinely used in The Alfred ICU for assessment of sedation and agitation.  The MAAS is located on the back of the ICU observation chart and patient's MAAS scores are documented hourly on the front of the observation chart by nursing staff.  A MAAS score of 5 or more indicates agitation.</outcome>

    <concealment>Clinical pharmacists, nursing and medical staff may identify and refer to the principal investigator patients who are potentially eligible for this study.  If patients meet the criterias for inclusion into this study, a member of the research team will consent the patient or the person responsible for the patient.  Treating doctors will indicate whether individual patients are suitable to provide written informed consent.   Patient enrolment will only occur from Monday to Friday as there is insufficient staff on the weekend to assist with identification of eligible patients.

On study Day 1, The Alfred Clinical Trial Pharmacy will randomise the consented patients by computerised block randomisation, in a ratio 1:1, to melatonin 6mg plus temazepam 10mg or placebo plus temazepam 10mg.  Melatonin and placebo capsules will be dispensed by The Alfred Clinical Trial pharmacists.  This ensures that investigators, participants and medical staff are blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally in the pineal gland at the base of the brain.  It is important in regulating sleep.  Usually melatonin levels in the body are high overnight and drop during the day to maintain the sleep-wake cycle.  However, in critically ill patients there is evidence to suggest the normal secretion of melatonin is lost or diminished.  This may contribute to sleep disruption in critically ill patients.

This study will be conducted as a randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.  Sixty patients with a tracheostomy in the intensive care unit (ICU) with poor sleep will be recruited.   Participants will receive temazepam, a sleep medication, plus either placebo or melatonin at night for 7 nights.  Hours of sleep during the day and the night will be documented through nursing observation and actigraphy (a wrist-watch which records wrist movements and translates it into sleep periods).  Quality of sleep will be assessed with the use of the Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire.  

The study will help determine if there is a role for the addition of melatonin to usual sedative-hypnotic medication for the management of sleep disruption in ICU patients.</summary>
