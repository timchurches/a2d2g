  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants must have biopsy proven locally recurrent prostate cancer. Biopsy will be performed by a Urologist. Participants will have PSMA-PET scan and MRI in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine by experienced Radiologists in the Royal North Shore Hospital before starting stereotactic radiotherapy.  Participants will  require fiducial markers inserted in the prostate and may require hydrogel insertion depending on the location of the recurrence. If these are required, it will be done by experienced radiation oncologists. Fiducial markers insertion involves inserting three gold markers into the prostate. It will be used  to locate the prostate accurately during radiation treatment. Hydrogel is a temporary gel being injected into the space between the prostate and rectum to reduce the dose of radiation received by the rectum to minimise side effects from the treatment. There will be  three groups of participants, each group will receive different level of radiation dose to test the safety of increasing radiotherapy dose. Group 1 will receive 36 grays (radiation dose unit) in 6 treatments. Group 2 will receive 38 grays in 6 treatments and group 3 will receive 40 grays in 6 treatments. The incremental dose escalation will cease if any excess acute or late grade 3 toxicity. Focal Stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) will be delivered two to three times per week, every second day. The number of treatments per week will depend on the day of the week you start your treatment (ie ,if you start your radiotherapy on Wednesday, you will have two treatments that week etc). You will have a total of 6 treatments.  Each radiotherapy session will take 30 minutes. Patients will be reviewed weekly or second weekly. Toxicity will be recorded. A Safety Committee will be formed containing multi-disciplinary team members. All serious adverse events will be reported to the Principal Investigator and HREC within 24 hours. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is  to examine the feasibility, safety and toxicity of focal stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) for locally recurrent prostate cancer following definitive external beam radiotherapy. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or above who has been diagnosed with biopsy proven locally recurrent prostate cancer.

Study details
All participants in this study will first receive two different types of scans to locate the suspected regions of recurrence  these scans are called prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They will then proceed to receive six treatment sessions of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). The first 12 participants will receive a radiation dose of 36 grays (radiation dose unit). If this is tolerated, then the next 12 participants will receive a dose of 38 grays. Again if this is tolerated, then the final 12 participants will be treated at a dose of 40 grays.

After treatment, all participants will have follow-up every 4 months for the first two years, After  two years patients will have routine follow-up (6 monthly for one year, then yearly thereafter until 10 years). During the follow-up period, Patients will have PSA and toxicity assessments. PSMA-PET scans will be repeated at 12 and 24 months post treatment. Study related outcomes will be collected for 2 years. After 2 years outcomes will be collected as per departmental protocol.
The study aims to combine the non-invasive advantages of SBRT re-irradiation using functional MRI plus PSMA-PET scans to define and treat the area of recurrence rather than the whole prostate gland.
