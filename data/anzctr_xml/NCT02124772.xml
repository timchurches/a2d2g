    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Trametinib
Treatment: drugs - Dabrafenib

Experimental: Part A - Trametinib Dose-Escalation: Trametinib is administered orally once daily (OD) under fasting conditions. The starting dose of trametinib (0.0125 milligram per kilogram per dose [mg/kg/dose]) is 50% of the recommended fixed dose in adults (2 mg OD). The second dose level (0.025 mg/kg) is equivalent to the recommended dose in adults (2 mg PO daily). The third dose level (0.040 mg/kg) is equivalent to the maximum tolerated dose [MTD] in adults (3 mg PO daily).

Experimental: Part B - Tumor-Specific Expansion: Trametinib is administered orally once daily under fasting conditions in 4 disease-specific cohorts of subjects Trametinib will be continued until disease progression.

Experimental: Part C - The trametinib dose administered in Part C will be the trametinib monotherapy RP2D from Part A. The monotherapy RP2D of dabrafenib in children will be established on a separate trial (BRF116013). The specifics for Part C will be determined following completion of enrollment into Part A.

Experimental: Part D - The trametinib and dabrafenib doses administered in Part D will be the combination trametinib and dabrafenib RP2D from Part C.


Treatment: drugs: Trametinib
Trametinib is available in tablet (0.125mg, 0.5mg, 2mg dose) as well as in powder form for Oral Solution (0.05mg/mL dose). It is recommended that subjects drink 4 to 6 mL of water/kg body weight following dosing.

Treatment: drugs: Dabrafenib
Dabrafenib is available in capsules (50mg and 75mg) as well as in powder form for Oral Suspension (10 mg/mL dose) and taken twice a day. It is recommended that subjects drink approximately 1 ounce (30 mL) of water for every 10 pounds of body weight following dosing.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a 4-part (Part A, Part B, Part C and Part D), Phase I/IIa, multi-center, open label,
      study in pediatric subjects with refractory or recurrent tumors. Part A is a repeat dose,
      dose escalation monotherapy study that will identify the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) on
      the continuous dosing schedule using a 3 + 3 dose- escalation procedure. Part B will evaluate
      the preliminary activity of trametinib monotherapy in 4 disease-specific cohorts of subjects.
      Each cohort will enroll at least 10 response-evaluable subjects (evaluable for response is
      defined as a subject with a pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose disease assessment or clinical
      assessment of progression of disease). Part C is will be a 3+3 study design to determine the
      safety, tolerability and preliminary activity of the RP2D of trametinib in combination with a
      limited dose escalation of dabrafenib. Part C will enroll up to 24 subjects. Part D will
      evaluate the preliminary activity of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in 2
      disease-specific cohorts of subjects diagnosed with LGG and LCH. LGG cohort will enroll
      approximately 20 response-evaluable subjects and the LCH cohort will enroll approximately 10
      response-evaluable subjects. The overall goal of this trial is to efficiently establish safe,
      pharmacologically relevant dose of trametinib monotherapy and trametinib in combination with
      dabrafenib in infants, children and adolescents and determine preliminary activity of
      trametinib monotherapy and trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in selected recurrent,
      refractory or unresectable childhood tumors.</summary>
