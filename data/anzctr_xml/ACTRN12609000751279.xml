  <interventions>
    <interventions>After a two-week run-in period, the subjects will be treated three times per week for four weeks. Four key (common) acupoints and two supplementary acupoints will be used. Hwato disposable pre-sterilised needles will be used. The needle will be 0.22 mm in diameter. The length of the needle will depend on the acupoint locations (25  50 mm). The duration of each acupuncture session is 25 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham acupuncture will be used as the control treatment, needles will be inserted shallowly, 1.5 cm lateral to the selected acupoints. The subjects will be treated three times per week for four weeks. The duration of each acupuncture session is 25 minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-assessed nasal (sneezing, watery rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion and nasal itching) and non-nasal (ocular itching, watering, and redness, and itching of the ears and/or palate) symptom scores. Subjects will record these symptoms in a diary daily as well as assessing the overall severity weekly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 1, 2,3, 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire (RQLQ) that consists of seven domains: sleep, practical problems; non-nasal/eye symptoms; nasal symptoms; eye symptoms; activities; and, emotional function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks, 1, 2,3, 4</timepoint>

      <outcome>Relief medication score (RMS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks, 1, 2,3, 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse event record. An adverse event record form will be provided for all subjects to record any unexpected signs, symptoms, and feelings during and after the treatment period. Details of any adverse events will be scored using a six-point scale (0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, and 5 = extremely severe) to indicate the severity of these events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Weeks 1, 2,3, 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Age between 18 and 70 inclusive; a history of at least two years of typical symptoms of SAR, or of persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) with seasonal exacerbation, including watery rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal obstruction and nasal and ocular itch. Although it is common for SAR sufferers to be also sensitised to allergens such as house dust mites, seasonal worsening of symptoms markedly increases morbidity and it is considered unlikely that such worsening of symptoms during the period of high grass pollen counts would be due to PAR rather than to SAR. However, a positive skin-prick test to rye grass pollen will be required for all participants.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>History of Human immunodeficiency virus(HIV); current pregnancy or breast-feeding; other current active respiratory diseases such as asthma, sinusitis, and rhinitis medicamentosa; pollen desensitization during the last 6 months; nasal polyposis; other structural defects of the upper respiratory tract; hepatitis B or C; and, currently use systemic corticosteroid therapy or anticoagulant medications. Respondents with atopic dermatitis and who are regularly using topical corticosteroids will also be excluded. In addition, subjects who have experienced acupuncture within the last 24 months will be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Seasonal allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is a common condition with high prevalence in Australia, being most pronounced during spring and early summer when pollen counts are highest. There is no proven cure for hay fever. Many hay fever sufferers seek alternative therapies such as acupuncture. We propose to undertake a rigorous study, using well-established clinical trial methodology, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture in the treatment of hay fever.</summary>
