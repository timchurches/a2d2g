  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a synthetic drug of the nitrothiazolide class.  The main metabolite of NTZ is tizoxanide.  The active ingredient is 2-acetyloxy-N (5-nitro-2-thiazolyl) benzamide) at a concentration of 100mg/5ml.

The dose to be given is 7.5mg/kg by mouth (or nasogastric/nasoenteric tube) three times per day for five days. 

The oral suspension is supplied as a pink coloured powder formulation that is reconstituted with 48 ml water prior to use to a final volume of 60 ml. To reconstitute, the bottle containing the powder should be tapped until the powder flows freely. Approximately one-half of the total amount of water required for reconstitution is then added and vigorously shaken to suspend the powder. The remaining volume of water is then added and again shaken. Where possible NTZ should be administered with food.  Should the participant vomit within 15 minutes of study drug administration, the dose should be repeated once.

To monitor adherence, drug accountability will be completed by the clinical trials pharmacist in conjunction with the principal investigator.  At dispensing participants will be counseled on the returns procedures for the study drug and compliance will be checked on return of study drug by a member of the research team as delegated by the principal investigator in conjunction with the clinical trials pharmacist.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>All endpoints will be analysed on an intent-to-treat and per protocol basis.  The Intent to Treat population (ITT) is defined as all randomised participants whose parents have provided informed consent.  Participants will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomised irrespective of the treatment received. The Per-protocol population is defined as all randomised participants with informed consent who:
I.  receive and tolerated a minimum of six doses of the treatment they received in the period between randomisation and Study Day 4 clinical assessment.
II.  did not receive rescue treatment with NTZ

Primary Endpoint:
The RACS will be calculated as the sum of change from baseline to Study Day 4 in the RDAI score and the standardised score for respiratory rate (RR) percentage change over the same time.  The standardised score for change in RR is weighted such that there is a reduction of 1 unit for a decrease in rate of &gt;5% but equal to &lt;15%, 2 units for a decrease of 15-25%, etc., thus negative values signify improvement.
RACS=(RDAI baseline-RDAI Day 4) + round (1-RR Day 4/RR baseline) x -10

Secondary Endpoints:
Mean change in log transformed viral nasal secretion between baseline and Study Day 4 will be compared between the placebo and NTZ treatment groups using a two sample t-test.  Geometric mean difference with appropriate 95% confidence intervals will be presented.

Duration of hospital admission will be coded as the time until hospital discharge and compared between the treatment groups using a log rank test.  Kaplan Meier estimates, with 95% confidence intervals, will be calculated and graphed to illustrate the length of time that the participants remain in hospital for each treatment group.

The frequency of use of oxygen therapy, supportive ventilation, intensive care unit and supportive hydration therapy will be compared between the placebo and NTZ treatment groups using Fisher's Exact test.  The duration of use of each procedure will be tabulated by treatment group.

Further analyses may be deemed necessary for all efficacy endpoints using either multivariate regression of Cox Proportional Hazard Models to adjust for importance covariance; these may include age at enrolment, pre-term birth, smoking and overcrowding in the household.  Appropriate adjustment for multiple testing will be applied to all secondary efficacy endpoints.  An A priori stratified analyse will also be performed by causative pathogen, grouped possession of the NTZ target glycoprotein.

The frequency of all safety and tolerability endpoints will be compared between the placebo and NTZ treatment groups using Fisher's Exact test.  No correction will be employed for multiple testing.

A sample size of 49 completers per treatment arm are required to detect a change of at least two points on the RACS scale. This is based on a standard deviation of approximately three (from previous studies, Lowell et al. 1897, Schuh et al. 2002), a significance level of 5% and power of at least 90%. A completer is defined as an eligible patient who has a clinician assessed RACS score on study day 3 (thus requiring RDAI and respiratory rate assessments at baseline and Study Day 3). It is anticipated that 20% of patients will be lost to follow up or will not be available for the clinician assessment within +/- 6 hours of Study Day 3, therefore, 62 patients will be recruited per treatment arm. A decrease of two points on the RACS scale is considered to be a useful decrease of clinical relevance to the study setting. The total sample size for the study is 124 infants and children equally  randomised (1:1) to placebo or NTZ treatment, which is reasonable over the planned two year period of the study based on the rate of admission to the studys site for bronchiolitis, and recruitment rates from previous studies.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:
Bronchiolitis is an extremely common cause of respiratory illness in infants caused by viral infection. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether treatment with nitazoxanide (NTZ) reduces the duration and severity of respiratory symptoms caused by bronchiolitis. 

Justification:
Bronchiolitis affects over a third of infants in their first two years of life, and in Australia approximately 5,000 infants are hospitalised every year with the condition (Garcia et al. 2010).  This is estimated to cost the healthcare system between 32 and 62 million dollars per year (Deshpande &amp; Northern 2003). Infants who are born prematurely, or who have lung disease or heart disease are at the highest risk of developing bronchiolitis and also have the most severe disease. Bronchiolitis increases the risk of subsequently developing recurrent wheezing and asthma in childhood (Shay et al. 1999).  An effective treatment would be of enormous benefit, not only by reducing infant suffering, but also by reducing the impact on parents and the healthcare system and the long-term consequences of infection.

Participant Groups:
This study will involve 124 infants between the ages of 1 and 12 months with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis (62 in each study arm).

Project Design:
This study is a phase II double-blind randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of oral nitazoxanide for the treatment of bronchiolitis.

Methods:
Parents of infants presenting to Princess Margaret Hospital and diagnosed with bronchiolitis will be invited to participate. Following a full explanation of the study, informed consent will be taken from interested parents. A brief clinical history of the illness will be taken, and the infant assessed for respiratory distress using a validated scoring system (the Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument). A painless swab will be taken from the front of the infants nose to try and detect the virus that has triggered the illness. Infants will then be allocated at random (similar to tossing a coin) to receive either treatment with NTZ or placebo for five days. Infants will be reviewed after three days of treatment, and 
their respiratory distress score repeated. The change in the score, combined with a change in respiratory rate will be used to calculate the Respiratory Assessment Change Score (RACS). In order to assess if NTZ is a useful treatment for bronchiolitis the RACS will be compared between the placebo 
and the NTZ groups. Symptoms over the first week of illness and oxygen requirement will also be compared using a parental completed diary card. To see if NTZ reduces the amount of virus present, a nasal swabs at day 3 and day 5 will be collected and the viral load compared with that at baseline. For infants that need to be admitted to hospital, the amount of medical support need ed will be recorded (for 
example, the need for oxygen therapy) as well as the duration of hospitalisation. The number of times that the infant has to come back to hospital for either bronchiolitis or wheeze will be recorded over the six months after treatment using electronic hospital records. 

Expected Outcomes:
This study will determine whether NTZ is an effective empirical treatment for bronchiolitis. It will also help us to understand what effect NTZ has on the amount of virus present and how viral load changes over the course of the disease. If this study shows that NTZ is a useful treatment, then a larger study will be conducted enrolling infants that present to primary care facilities.</summary>
