  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Every session has the same structure (starting with a quiz, facts and new content, exercises to practice and ending with a self-compassion exercise) the 9 topics of the online sessions are: Cyber Bullying
Feelings
Staying Calm
Being Confident
Problem Solving
Being Assertive
Worrying
Keeping Calm
Self-Esteem


2. We do not need an activity log as the programme itself monitors adherence. any activities will be automatic emailed to the USYD email account.

3.We will meet with the teacher for a 1 hours training session with a clinical psychologist (myself).

The online program includes psycho-education about cyber bullying and cognitive-behavioural strategies aimed at reducing the likelihood that a young person will experience cyber bullying or reducing the impact of any bullying experienced. The online intervention includes 9 online sessions (each between 15 to 20 minutes every 2 or 3 days) over 4-5 weeks.

The first session will be led by a teacher in the class room, either using the students' personal laptops or in a computer laboratory. Session 2 to 9 will be conducted under supervision by the teacher. Teachers will be trained and made familiar with each session before completed by the children, and will be prepared for potential questions or problems.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All students in grades 7 to 9 in each participating school will be invited to participate in the trial.  Students must provide written consent and parents will have the option to opt their child out of the research.

The randomisation will be carried out at a school level, not an individual student level (cluster randomisation). Once i determine whether a school is eligible, a second person (Caroline Hunt) will conduct the allocation (concealed).

The concealed randomisation will be carried out at a school level, not an individual student level (cluster randomisation). Once the Lead Investigator (Karoline Prinz) determines whether a school is eligible, she will make contact with a second person at a central administration site (Caroline Hunt) who will conduct the allocation, using a spreadsheet which hides the random number sequence until required.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number generator will be used to create a sequence t determine whether a school is in the treatment or waitlist condition. After each school is recruited the school will be entered into a spread sheet where it will be determined if the school is in the control group. One of the investigators other than the lead investigator will organise the random allocation to conditions.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A two-group mixed model ANOVA will be used to assess for differential change over time between the two conditions for the key primary and secondary outcomes.

A sample size of approximately 60 students within each group will be sufficient to detect a medium effect size differences between interventions (standardised mean difference of 0.50; power .80; alpha .05). In terms of the effect of cluster randomisation, we believe that a childs grade will provide the most appropriate level of clustering for the analysis and the intracluster correlation will need to be large to significantly reduce power in this case (Kerry et al., 1998). Reliable estimates of the intra-class correlation are required to ensure robust sample size calculations and we will not have these until our data are analysed; however our previous school analyses have shown similar clustering effects to be small and non-significant (e.g. Berry &amp; Hunt, 2009; Rose, Hawes &amp; Hunt, 2014). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the trial is to establish if the use of an online psycho-education and cognitive-behavioural intervention will decrease the likelihood that a young person will experience being cyber bullied, and also reduce the impact of any bullying experienced. The program is designed to decrease vulnerability to bullying by building coping responses over time.We hypothesise that young people who complete the on-line intervention will experience decreased bullying (particularly cyber bullying), increased self-compassion, and decreased emotional and behavioural symptoms, relative to young people who do not complete the intervention. </summary>
