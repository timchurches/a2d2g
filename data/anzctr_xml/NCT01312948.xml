Treatment: devices: Prototype mask (known as Pixi)
This is a prototype mask to be used with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy. The mask attaches to the face, covering the nose, and is kept in place with headgear. Therapy is delivered through the mask via a tube which attaches to the CPAP or NIV device.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Usability Ratings of the Pixi Paediatric Mask Compared With the Child's Current Mask - Before trialling the Pixi mask, parents rated the usability of their child's usual mask using a 0-10 Likert Scale where 0 = poor and 10 = excellent. After trialling the Pixi mask, parents then completed the same questionnarie for the Pixi mask.
Usability was defined as a single overall score of mask performance. Parents considered mask seal, comfort, stability and red marks when scoring each mask for usability.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Equivalence of Apnea-hypopnea Index (AHI) on the New Pixi Mask Compared With the Child's Usual Mask - Apnea-Hypopnea index (AHI) is a measure of the severity of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). It describes how many events of compromised breathing occur each hour of sleep. The higher the AHI, the more severe the SDB (mild 5-15, moderate 15-30, severe &gt;30). In clinical practice an AHI &lt;5 demonstrates efficacy of treatment. AHI was recorded during a monitored sleep study on the new Pixi mask, and compared with the AHI from a monitored sleep study on the child's usual mask. The outcome hypothesis was that the Pixi mask AHI would be equivalent or reduced compared to the patients usual mask</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate a newly developed pediatric mask (known as Pixi) on children aged
      2-7 using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or Non-invasive ventilation (NIV)
      treatment. The participants will undergo a monitored sleep study, followed by a 7 night trial
      of the Pixi mask in the home environment. During the study usability will be measured through
      questionnaires filled in by the parent and clinician.

      The study hypothesis is that the usability of the mask will be superior to the patient's
      usual mask.</summary>
