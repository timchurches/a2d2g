  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fatigue is a common and persistent problem after brain injury. This study aims to look at whether group sessions focusing on increasing physical activity or fatigue management education can reduce levels of fatigue for people who have experienced a brain injury, in comparison to those receiving treatment as usual</summary>
