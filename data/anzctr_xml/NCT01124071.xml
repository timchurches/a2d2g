  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To investigate the acceptability of a Korean diet in overweight and obese Australians. - This will be determined at baseline and 4 week timepoints throughout the study by participants completing a Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ). The FAQ addresses 10 components of food acceptability along a 7-point Likeart scale. The FAQ is a recognised instrument for testing food acceptability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>13 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To examine the differences in weight loss between the Korean diet intervention and the Western diet intervention in overweight and obese Australians. - This will be determined by assessing differences at baseline and 12 weeks for weight, BMI and percent BMI change.</outcome>
      <timepoint>13 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate changes in a number of indicators of metabolic disease in both groups - including anthropometry, Blood Glucose Levels, insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, liver function, hormone function and inflammatory markers.</outcome>
