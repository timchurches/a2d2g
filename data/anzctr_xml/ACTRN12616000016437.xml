    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoints are the severity of PDPH, as measured by the incidence in each group of a rating of severe at 24 hours after commencing treatment; and the AUC 0-72 h for pain (headache) scores. Previous data suggests that approximately 70% of women will develop a PDPH after unintentional dural puncture with an epidural needle and 40% of women will rate their headache as severe initially. 
Using the severity of pain as a primary endpoint will require a sample size of approx. 85 per group or total 170 to test for a 50% reduction in the treatment group. To allow for those who do not develop a PDPH (0.7 x N = 170) plus withdrawals and loss to follow-up, this will be increased to 150 per group (300 patients). 
There are few data on AUC in this situation, but in different populations and using the drug as treatment, women start around the 7-8/10 and have reduced to 2-4/10 after 3-4 days of pregabalin. Based on women in the placebo group starting on pain scores of 8, reducing to 6 on day 2 and 4 on day 3, a rough estimation of 72 h AUC would be ~430 (8x24h + 6x24h + 4x24h). Using a conservative estimate of standard deviation ~340 (representing 80% AUC),  the sample size of  300 women would have &gt; 90% power to show a 30% reduction in 0-72 hour AUC PDPH score in the active treatment group and a one-quarter reduction in the need for epidural blood patch, assuming an incidence of 60% in the control group.

An intention to treat analysis will be performed. Descriptive statistics will be median, interquartile range (IQR) and range or mean (standard deviation [SD]) as appropriate and categorical outcomes will be summarized using frequency distributions. The Chi-square test or Fisher exact tests will be used for comparisons of categorical outcomes between groups. Comparisons of continuous outcomes between groups will be based on Mann-Whitney tests, assuming lack of normality. P-values of &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of pregabalin against headache resulting from unintentional dural puncture in obstetric patients having epidural analgesia for labour and delivery.
The primary question addressed is Does pregabalin reduce the severity of post-dural puncture headache in postpartum women after unintentional dural puncture? Our hypothesis is that oral pregabalin will significantly reduce the severity of post-dural puncture headache in postpartum women experiencing the complication of unintentional dural puncture. The question is addressed by conduct of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority clinical trial. The study drugs will be commenced after unintentional dural puncture and patients followed for one week, with the incidence and severity of headache important outcomes showing whether pregablin is effective compared with a placebo.
