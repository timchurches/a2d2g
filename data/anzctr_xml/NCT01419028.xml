          -  The responsible IRB/IEC/REB does not require informed consent per a review of their
             documented local policies for collecting retrospective data on patients who are
             deceased; AND

          -  Written confirmation is received from the responsible IRB/IEC/REB confirming that the
             abstracted data can be analyzed and used to support regulatory filings by the Sponsor

          -  Patient must have a documented diagnosis of HPP as indicated by 1 or more of the
             following:

          -  Documented ALPL gene mutation(s)

          -  Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) below the age-adjusted normal range and either plasma
             pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) or urinary phosphoethanolamine (PEA) above the upper
             limit of normal

          -  Serum ALP below the age-adjusted normal range and HPP-related radiographic
             abnormalities on X-ray

          -  Patient must have onset of signs of HPP prior to 6 months of age and have
             documentation of 1 or more of the following characteristics of perinatal and infantile
             HPP:

          -  Respiratory compromise (up to and including respiratory failure) requiring institution
             of respiratory support measure(s), requiring medication(s) for management of
             symptom(s), and/or associated with other respiratory complications (e.g.,
             pneumonia(s), respiratory tract infection(s))
