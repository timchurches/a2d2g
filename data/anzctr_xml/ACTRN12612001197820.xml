  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: experimental data has shown a reduction of flap necrosis after local heat application to a supraphysiological level resulting from the up-regulation of heat-shock proteins, such as HSP-32 &amp; 70. The proteins maintained capillary perfusion and increased tissue tolerance to ischemia. The purpose of this translational study was to evaluate the effect of local heat pre-conditioning before skin-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction. 

Methods: a prospective non-randomised trial was performed from July 2009  April 2010. 50 consecutive patients at risk of skin flap necrosis (BMI &gt;30, sternal-to-nipple distance &gt;26cm or breast size &gt;C-cup) were included in the study. Twenty-five patients were asked to heat-precondition their breast 24-hours prior to surgery using a hot water bottle with a water temperature of 43 degrees centigrade (thermometers provided), in three 30-minute cycles interrupted by spontaneous cooling to room temperature. Skin flap necrosis was defined by the need for surgical debridement. LDI images were taken preoperatively to demonstrate an increase in tissue vascularity. 

Results: 36% of women (n=25) without local heat-treatment experienced skin flap necrosis, 12% developed skin flap necrosis in the treatment group, (n=23; p = 0.047 (95% CI 1% to 47%)). LDI scanning of the heated breast demonstrated an increase in vascularity compared to the contralateral non-heated breast. Median length of inpatient stay for treatment group was 4 days, controls 8 days (p = &lt;0.001). 

Conclusions: the data suggests that in selected cases, local heat-preconditioning is a simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective method of reducing skin necrosis and length of hospital stay following skin-sparing mastectomy.</summary>
