  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention groups: Participants will be randomised into the following groups: a) Supervised high intensity interval training as a single bout of aerobic exercise (4 mins; 90% VO2max) ; b) Supervised traditional prolonged moderate intensity aerobic exercise (45 mins; 60% VO2max); c) control group who will receive standard physical activity and dietary advice. All exercise is to be performed on a stationary cycle ergometer.

Exercise sessions are to be completed by the participants 3 times per week, for a duration of 12 weeks. 

Participants who are randomised into the high intensity group will progressively increase the duration from 1 minute at 90%VO2max to 4 minutes. The moderate intensity group will incrementally progress in intensity in accordance to training adaptations. 

All exercising participants will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and records of heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be collected during each exercise session. Blood glucose measures will be taken prior to exercise and if symptoms arise of hypo/hyperglycaemia.




</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the "control" condition" will receive an initial individual counseling session (approximately 1 hour) with one of the study investigators involving advise on physical activity as per current Australian recommendations. This includes doing activity on most days of the week aiming for a minimum of 150 min per week of moderate intensity aerobic activities and counseling on appropriate activities. Participants will also receive advice on healthy eating (as per current NHMRC guidelines) focusing on low saturated fat, low alcohol and high fibre intake with counseling on portion sizes. Participants will also receive further one-on-one follow up sessions each 3 weeks (approximately 45 min each) for the entire intervention period (12 weeks).</comparator>

      <outcome>Cardiorespiratory fitness assessed via graded exercise test on a stationary cycle ergometer to maximal aerobic capacity. This will be calculated using a breath by breath gas exchange analyser. The test will start at 35 Watts and 65 Watts for men and women respectively and increase by 25W every 2.5 minutes until volitional fatigue or other test termination criteria reached. Heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be collected every minute duration the test. </outcome>

    <summary>Aims and hypotheses: To examine the efficacy of novel versus traditional exercise therapies on metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that all exercise interventions will improve abdominal, liver and pancreas fat levels, insulin sensitivity, fitness and cardiovascular health compared with control.</summary>
