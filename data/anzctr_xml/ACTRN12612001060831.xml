  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treadmill training; frequency: 5 days/week; duration: 8 minutes/session; belt speed: 0.2m/s. 
The intervention started when infants were able to produce 10 supported steps on a treadmill within 1 minute trial (as long as it happened before turning 13 months corrected age, if they were to be included in this study). Treadmill training continued until the infant was observed walking 3 independent steps over ground, or the infant turned 24 months corrected age.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group did not receive treadmill training. All families were visited on a monthly basis to videotape five 1-minute trials of the infants stepping while being supported on a treadmill.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefits of treadmill training in infants who are at risk of having delays related to their movement development.  In addition, previous research has suggested that there might be a relationship between how infants perform their steps on the treadmill and the age of onset of independent walking. Therefore, this has also been explored.
Hypotheses: treadmill training in infants at risk for developmental delays may: a) lead to earlier onset of walking; b) increase the number of steps taken per minute; and c) improve correct foot positioning during stepping relative to an untrained control group.</summary>
