  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers are required to undergo three modified barium swallow (MBS) studies in one day of testing. During each MBS volunteers will swallow:  
- 3 sips of liquid &amp; barium sulphate (ratio 2:1)
- 100ml serial swallows of liquid &amp; barium (ratio 2:1)
- 3x15ml puree fruit &amp; barium (ratio 3:1)
- 3x15ml diced fruit &amp; barium (ratio 3:1)

Each MBS will be assigned a different study condition:
- control (no nasogastric tube)
- experimental (fine bore nasogastric tube insitu)
- experimental (wide bore nasogastric tube insitu)

Radiological screening time for each MBS will be 2-3 mins. Skin fluoro time and skin effective dose data will be collected and monitored to ensure total effective dose does not exceed 2 milliseverts as per ethics protocol. 

There will be a minimum 30 minute break between the control and first experimental condition, and minimum 60 minutes between the first and second experimental conditions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is to undergo a modified barium swallow (MBS) without a nasogastric tube insitu (ie. a normal baseline swallow)</comparator>

      <outcome>A change in a 4 point pharyngeal residue severity scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every swallow recorded for each volunteer will be rated following the uploading of MBS images to IMPAX (hospital integrated review and reporting system).
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A change in the duration of pharyngeal transit (temporal measures of swallowing). Images are recorded in 300 frame loops of 15 per second - one frame equals 0.067 seconds. Duration of pharyngeal transit is calculated by counting the number of frames for this swallowing stage, and multiplying by 0.067 seconds. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A nasogastric tube (NGT) may be inserted into the nostril and passed down through the pharynx (throat) to the stomach to feed patients who are unable to swallow or are unable to eat and drink adequate amounts. 

If a patient starts or continues eating with a NGT in place, clinical experience suggests the presence of a NGT within the pharynx may in fact interfere with swallowing and hinder a patients return to oral intake.   

Changes in swallowing due to NGT presence have been shown in young volunteers, but not investigated in older individuals. With increasing age we get changes to the normal swallow. As a large proportion of patients requiring NGT feeding are elderly it is important to understand what impact, if any, a NGT might have on an ageing swallow. 

The aims for this study were to determine what effects, if any, fine-bore and/or wide-bore NGTs have on: (1) airway penetration-aspiration, (2) pharyngeal residue, and (3) duration of pharyngeal transit in older healthy adults.
