  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, double blinded (patient and investigator), multi-centre trial assessing bone healing of distal femoral fractures in the elderly population comparing Far Cortical Locking Screws (FCL) to standard locking screws (SL). FCL screws engage in the plate and the far cortex of the bone allowing a small amount of motion at the near cortex of fixation whereas the standard locking screws engage in the plate and both near and far cortices of the bone. The study population will comprise patients over the age of 60 years who have acute distal femoral fractures suitable for distal femoral locking plate fixation using a NCB fracture plate. A total of 100 patients will be enrolled in the study. Each patient will undergo standard surgical locking plate fixation of the distal femoral fracture using either 3-4 FCL screws for fixation of the proximal femoral fragment in the intervention group, or 3-4 standard NCB locking screws (NCB screw, Zimmer) for fixation of the proximal femoral fragment in the control group. The number of screws is predetermined by the length of the fracture and the treating physician and must be a minimum of 3 screws. The technique of bridged plating will be applied to both groups. The procedure is performed by an orthopaedic surgeon for both groups.</interventions>

Patient details will be entered into a software program for generation of a randomisation number and allocation to either the FCL or SL arm of the study. This will be concealed from the patient and assessing investigator by keeping the allocation document confidential and private. Additionally, radiographs and CT scans taken will be assessed by means of independent assessors where the proximal fixation (i.e. the FCL or SL instrument) is blocked to eliminate bias.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be done electronically through an online system based in Sydney whereby the treating team will log in to randomisation website and/or call a 24hour randomisation hotline to be assigned to SL or FCL treatment group. The software will generate a random number assigned to one arm of the study.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Participants will be reviewed clinically and radiologically at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 18weeks, 26 weeks, 1 year and a telephone consult at 2years. Clinical Review will involve history and examination and the data will be recorded in a questionnaire. Radiological analysis will be via plain film radiographs (x-rays) and a single CT scan at the three month follow up that will include a full leg length view (scout view for maquette assessment).  Analysis of information will take place at the completion of the trial and will involve the following methods of assessment:

Modified RUST score analysis 
Plate and screw failure/ breakage at six months
Number of patients healed at three months, six months and 1 year
CT callus qualification of bridging

At the completion of the study all the plain film radiographs and CT scans will be collected electronically and the fracture segment will be isolated in a picture format such that the fixation type (i.e. FCL or standard locking screw) cannot be identified. These images will be reviewed by a panel of experts blinded to the treatment (including 2 Orthopaedic Surgeons (one registrar and one consultant) and 1 Radiologist) to assess radiographic healing as per the parameters above (RUST score and cortical bridging on CT). The reviewers will be blinded as the fixation method on xray will be blocked out and CT sections restricted to limit analysis to the fracture site alone. All results will be recorded and analysed by a statistics team. </designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently no literature on the use of far cortical locking screws when compared to standard locking screw constructs in human patients, we know of one RCT currently in progress with Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society (COTS). The COTS study will look at the treatment of distal femoral fractures using Zimmer MotionLoc screws versus standard locking screws in all age groups and include high impact trauma cases. 
This study proposes to look more specifically at callus formation and fracture healing in older patients treated with FCL versus standard locking plate fixation, with the inclusion of peri-prosthetic distal femoral fractures. Fixation in these fractures is generally more challenging and therefore it is of interest to establish whether FCL is a valuable option also for these cases. Fracture healing by secondary healing with bridging callus formation will be the principal measurable outcome to demonstrate the potential differences in fixation between FCL and standard locking screws.</summary>
