  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participating patients will be dispensed with three 200mg doses of the probe drug, proguanil. The patients will be advised to take a single oral dose (200mg) of the probe three hours in advance of each of their next three routine blood tests. These tests may be as little as one week or as much as three months apart.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To elucidate the biological correlation between CYP2C19 functional activity and cancer progression in patients with carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract at 3 hours post administration of proguanil.
CYP2C19 functional activity will be measured by plasma samples.Cancer progression is defined as per standard clinical practice.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3 hours post administration of proguanil</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the relationship between CYP2C19 activity and cachexia as measured from plasma samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All patients will have blood collected at baseline for determination of CYP2C19 genotype and measurement of cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). 3 hours prior to the patients next three routine blood tests a single oral dose (200mg) of the probe (proguanil) will be administered. The above mentioned determinations will be repeated on each of these occasions.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To test the hypothesis that there is no association between CYP2C19 activity and circulating markers of inflammation as measured from plasma samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All patients will have blood collected at baseline for determination of CYP2C19 genotype and measurement of cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and C-reactive protein (CRP). 3 hours prior to the patients next three routine blood tests a single oral dose (200mg) of the probe (proguanil) will be administered.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study builds on our previous work looking at how the body processes cancer drugs.  Many drugs are metabolised in the liver by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family.  The level of enzyme activity varies from person to person.  This is important, as poor metabolism of some drugs may put some people at greater risk of side effects, while extensive metabolism may mean the drug does not work as well.  Cyclophosphamide is an important anticancer drug that is metabolised by a liver enzyme called CYP2C19.  About 3% of Caucasian populations are genetically poor metabolisers for CYP2C19.  Our recent work suggested that people may actually lose CYP2C19 metabolism simply through the fact of having cancer.  It is possible to measure CYP2C19 activity in an individual by giving them a small dose of a test drug such as proguanil.  In this study we plan to see how CYP2C19 metabolism changes (i) between people with different amounts of cancer in their body and (ii) in individual people with cancer as time goes on and their cancer changes.  The knowledge gained from this study will help us in future as we try to better tailor cancer drug doses to the individual.</summary>
