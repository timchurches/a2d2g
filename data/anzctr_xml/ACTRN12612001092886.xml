  <interventions>
    <interventions>Evaluating the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in Tanzania. Drug will be administered orally using a 6-dose regimen of artemether-lumefantrine (a fixed combination of 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a tablet) twice  a day for 3 days. (Patient weighing 5-14kg - one tablet, patients weighing 15-24kg - two tablets, patients weighing 25-35kg - 3 tablets).</interventions>
    <comparator>N/A -is a one-arm prospective evaluation of clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated malaria</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of artemether-lumefantrine treatment failure (early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure).

Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy), clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at day 28 following treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of adverse events in all enrolled patients will be documented. Parents or guardians of all enrolled patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.

Possible medicine related adverse effects include dizziness, itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, bodyache, diarrhoea, tinnitus and increased hair loss, macular rash, reduction in neutrophil counts and convulsions. However, it is likely that many of these effects are disease-related rather than medicine-induced.</outcome>
