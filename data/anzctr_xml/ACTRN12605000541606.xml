  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic rotator cuff pathology is a musculoskeletal disorder of the shoulder often characterised by pain and weakness.  It involves a specific group of muscles in the shoulder, which become damaged over time leading to a chronic loss of full shoulder function and the subsequent loss of quality of life for sufferers. There are few studies comparing the shoulder function of individuals with and without the condition and this is important to help us understand why the condition develops and what treatments might be more effective.

Physiotherapy is often used to improve lost shoulder function. Physiotherapists use techniques that aim to reduce pain and weakness of the shoulder, thereby improving function. However there are very few studies that actually evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy for this condition. 

The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether physiotherapy intervention, using current accepted techniques, is effective in reducing pain and stiffness and improving strength and shoulder function. Previous experience has shown that the benefits of physiotherapy have not been properly evaluated by good quality research, and we would like to investigate whether or not physiotherapy is a useful intervention for this condition. </summary>
