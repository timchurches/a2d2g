      <outcome>Tolerance, acceptance and compliance with the dietary regimen and bowel preparation regimen as assessed by a questionairre and food diary. The questionnaire contains questions about compliance with the bowel preparation regimen, medication use and some co-morbid conditions. It also contains questions with visual analogue scale responses in order to assess tolerance to the bowel preparation regimen. It has not previously been validated.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For a successful colonoscopy, good views of the bowel lining are essential. Ideally, a bowel cleansing preparation should be effective at cleaning out the bowel but should also be well tolerated with minimal abdominal discomfort, nausea or other adverse symptoms.  

Historically, oral intake on the day prior to colonoscopy has been limited to clear fluids alone - without food.  Rather than a restriction to clear fluids, a low-residue diet may also result in good quality bowel preparation.

This research project is aiming to determine whether there is any difference in the bowel cleansing quality or how well it is tolerated (such as the degree of hunger, nausea, interference with daily activities) between a standard dietary restriction to clear fluids and a low-residue diet (one that contains few indigestible components) on the day prior to colonoscopy.</summary>
