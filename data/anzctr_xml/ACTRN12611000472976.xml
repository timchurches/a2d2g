    <interventions>3,5-diiodothyropropionic Acid (DITPA) will be administered daily started at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/d and increased to 4.75 mg/kg/d.  The dose may be escalated from 1.5 mg/kg/d in increments of 33%, at the discretion of the treating physician.

The daily dose will be divided into 3 equal portions given close to 8 hours apart.

It is anticipated that DITPA therapy will be lifelong.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety and tolerability of orally administered DITPA in patients with AHDS.

Safety Assessments will include: Physical examination including weight; Vital signs; Neurological examination and imaging (including Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Echocardiogram (ECHO), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter 24h ECG; Cranial and Abdominal ultrasounds; Thyroid function tests (including TSH, fT3 and fT4); Bone metabolism; Blood gas analysis; Blood chemistry; Haematology; Urine dipstick and Adverse Events.

Patients will be closely monitored for possible risks, side effects and discomforts including:
-Arrhythmia (irregular or abnormal heart beat rhythm)
-Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
-Hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure)
-Dyspnoea (difficulty in breathing)
-Weight Loss
-Reduction in Appetite
-Diarrhea 
-Change in blood test results
-Accumulation and damage to every organ
-Carcinogenicity.
-Having a blood sample taken may cause some discomfort or bruising. Sometimes, the blood vessel may swell, or blood may clot in the blood vessel.  Rarely, there could be a minor infection or bleeding. If this happens, it can be easily treated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physical exams and vital signs will be performed at baseline then twice daily for a minimum of 2 days upon commencement of treatment, then on a weekly basis for the first month, followed fortnightly up to month 3 and monthly up to month 12.

Blood chemistry/haematology and blood gas analysis will be performed at baseline then every second day during the first 4 days of treatment, then weekly for the first month, followed fortnightly up to month 3 and monthly up month 6.  Lipid studies are performed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

Echocardiogram (ECHO) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at baseline then months 1 and 6.  A Holter 24h ECG recording will be performed at baseline, after 4 days of treatment and at months 1, 3, 6 and 12.

Adverse events will be recorded as they occur throughout the duration of the study.

An abdominal ultrasound will be performed at baseline and at month 6 and 12.

Bone age Xray will be performed at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.
DXA bone density scan will be performed at baseline and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacodynamics and biochemical response of orally administered DITPA in patients with ADHS.

Pharmacodynamic and Response Assessments will include: Thyroid function biomarkers; Levels of DITPA in blood; weight gain; neurological examination; growth parameters and feeding pattern; neuroanatomical development; neurophysical developement; vision and hearing; motor function assessment; neurodevelopment assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Thyroid function biomarkers will be measured at baseline, once daily for 4 days into treatment, then on a weekly basis for the first month, followed fortnightly up to month 3 and monthly up to month 12.

DITPA levels in blood will be measured on Day 1 and 4 of treatment, then on a weekly basis for the first month, followed fortnightly up to month 3 and monthly up to month 12.

Neurological exams and growth parameters/feeding patterns will be performed at baseline, then on day 2, then weekly for the first month, followed fortnightly up to month 3 and monthly up to month 12.

An MRI will be performed at baseline and month 12.

An EEG will be performed at baseline and after 6 months.

A Vision and hearing assessment will be performed at baseline and at 6 months.

Motor Function will be assessed at baseline and at 6 months.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is currently no approved curative therapy for infants with MCT8 deficiency. Treatment for individuals with this disease aims to provide relief for any symptoms (e.g., treatment with propylthiouracil to reduce the symptoms of peripheral hyperthyroidism) and support in the care of the patient. No treatment up to now has shown to alter the ultimate progression of neurological impairment
DITPA is a thyroid hormone analogue with an MCT8 independent neuronal uptake. As a thyroid hormone receptor antagonist, DITPA is known to have distinct thryiod hormone effects on the cardiovascular system, such as an increase in left ventricular systolic performance, improvement of diastolic function, and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Furthermore, DITPA is known to decrease serum lipoproteins and body weight.</summary>
