  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Debilitating Fatigue is a common complaint in survivors of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and can persist for years after the acute event, causing lack of physical activity and participation in rehabilitation and socialisation.  Currently there are no pharmaceutical agents approved for the treatment of this fatigue.  Modafinil has been shown to reduce fatigue in patients suffering other neurological conditions such as MS and Parkinson's disease, and to improve cognition and memory.  This study will aim to measure the efficacy of modafinil in survivors of stroke and TIA experiencing self-reported fatigue.</summary>
