  <interventions>
    <interventions>10-week (3 sessions per week, 1 hour per session), center-initiated home based functional task exercise program. For the first 4 weeks, center-based sessions will be scheduled twice weekly supported with once weekly home practice with caregiver, followed by once weekly center-based and twice weekly home practice session for 4 weeks, then once biweekly center-based sessions for the last 2 weeks. The intervention program will be conducted by occupational therapist. Physical parameters associated with balance, strength, flexibility, mobility will be incorporated to daily functional tasks. All exercise sessions began with a 5-10 minute warm-up consisting of light stretching designed to increase flexibility, 30-40 minute core exercise and end with a 5-10 minute cool-down. Functional tasks for core exercise include table task and dinning task will be used according to the training protocol and training guidelines.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive an existing computer cognitive training program (1x 60 minute session,once weekly for week1-2 and once bi-weekly for week 3-10, with home exercise in a total of 10 weeks). All the participants will continue with their usual routine medical care.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of the present study is to determine whether a functional task exercise program supervised by caregivers would improve the cognitive function of cognitive decline older adults at risk for Alzheimers Disease (AD) in a randomized controlled trial. It is also hypothesized that functional task exercises can improve the capacity of everyday problem solving. A further aim is to assess whether the use of meaningful functional tasks as intervention media would reduce functional decline and promote a sense of satisfaction in older adults with cognitive decline.</summary>
