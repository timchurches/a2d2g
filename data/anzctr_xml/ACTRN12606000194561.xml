  <interventions>
    <interventions>The UCLA questionnaire is completed by the patient at home within 24 hours of attending for a post operative appointment and handed in a sealed opaque envelope to a receptionist and stored unopened until data entry. This takes the patient 5-10 minutes. Separately and in computer generated random order the patient is physically assessed by 2 outcome assessors in separate rooms and separate UCLA forms are completed by each assessor , sealed in opaque envelopes and stored separately until data entry is commenced. These forms are completed at 2 months following subacromial decompression and 4 months following rotator cuff repair.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The UCLA shoulder score is used to asess the outcome of rotator cuff surgery in the shoulder. Currently this score is assessed clinically- requiring patients to attend for a doctor's appointment. The hypothesis is that with adequate instruction the patient could complete this form at home and this would increase participation in studies which may follow up patients 10 years later. These patients would not have to travel long distances for a clinical assessment for research purposes only. Patients, assessors 1 &amp; 2 are blinded.</summary>
