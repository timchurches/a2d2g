  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will be divided into three arms in a specific order and different interventions will be delivered at the different arms:

Arm 1 
Before period: Standard recovery ward care after surgery
- This period will be 4 to 5 weeks in duration 
- Eligible patients will be admitted to the recovery room and surgical ward care according to usual hospital procedures until discharge from the hospital

Arm 2 
Transition period: The introduction of the "Advanced Recovery Room Care" for up to 24 hours after surgery
- This period will be 4 to 5 weeks in duration
-Eligible patients will be admitted to the "Advanced Recovery Room Care" after surgery for up to 24 hours 
-Advanced Recovery Room Care will differ from the standard recovery ward care by providing short-term enhanced care to eligible patients after surgery with regular rounds of monitoring by Drs (approximately 3 hourly) and with the use of a checklist 
-The types of treatments received at the "Advanced Recovery Room Care" will be dependent on the complications experienced by the patients such optimising analgesic status and cardio-respiratory fluid 
- Eligible patients will also be assessed on the morning of Postoperative Day 1 and be transferred to the appropriate wards dependent on the patient's status

Arm 3
After period:: Use of Advanced Recovery Room Care for up to 24 hours after surgery 
-Eligible patients will be admitted to the "Advanced Recovery Room Care" after surgery for up to 24 hours 
- Eligible patients will be monitored on regular rounds (approximately 3 hourly) and guided by a checklist 
- Eligible patients will also be assessed on the morning of Postoperative Day 1 and be transferred to the appropriate wards dependent on the patient's status</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment would be considered as the "before period" as standard recovery ward care is provided to eligible patients after surgery. The type of ward care delivered would be dependent on the type of surgeries and the potential complications experienced by the patients. The care provided will also be dependent on the local practices of the hospital. 

Briefly, eligible patients would usually wake up in the recovery room and will be monitored by a nurse before getting transferred to the ward. </comparator>

    <designfeatures>The study design is before and after therefore, patients who are scheduled to have surgeries early on (once this study has commenced for about 4 to 5 weeks ) then will most likely receive standard recovery ward care. 

Dependent on the time period patients will undergo surgery, they will either receive:

a.) Standard recovery ward care
 OR 
b.) Advanced recovery room care for up to 24 hours after surgery and will be transferred to standard recovery ward care and a higher level of ward care if required. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>Being a feasibility study this study does not require a specific sample size. However, we anticipate that we will collect data on 480 patients that will inform the formal sample size calculation for the subsequent definitive trial of clinical effectiveness. Based on the premise that pilot sites will have units of 3 beds on average (based on a nurse to patient ratio of 1:3), and will function 4 nights per week (Mon-Thurs), four sites allow 48 patients to be studied per week. 

Analyses of feasibility objectives will be descriptive or based on estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Differences in outcome measures will be evaluated between before and after period via independent Student t tests, chi-square tests or logistic regression. The Bonferroni methods will be used to adjust the level of significance for outcome measures so the overall apha level is 0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We know that patients with serious illness undergoing surgery are at risk of major complications after surgery and benefit from treatment by specialists in Intensive Care and High Dependency Units. It is more recently recognised that patients with less serious medical illnesses (such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension) undergoing certain surgery also have a high risk of life-threatening complications in general postoperative wards in the early hours after elective surgery.
Recent evidence suggests that providing these patients with advanced treatment in the early hours after surgery may benefit their recovery from surgery in terms of the risk of serious complications and time to return to home and that overall health care costs may fall. It is also possible that there is a positive impact on post-discharge return to normal
living, which may also positively impact on health care costs.
We already have skilled medical and nursing teams in place in recovery rooms to provide very short-term advanced care for these patients, but often there is no option to continue this beyond a few hours. We propose that an anaesthesia led advanced care service based in operating suite recovery rooms can care for both the sicker patients currently being sent to the wards after surgery and the less sick of the higher risk patients currently being admitted the high dependency beds. We call this combined group of patients medium risk for early and late complications.
To fully test this proposal we will need to conduct a large multi-million dollar randomized trial at over 20 hospitals. Before we can do that trial we need to conduct a study of the feasibility of elements of the trial. This feasibility study will examine the impact on patients and the health care system of providing advanced post-anaesthesia care with the skilled staff and facilities in recovery rooms.
Formal screening of patients preoperatively, including using computer risk-assessment tools to assist clinical judgment will be tested to identify the patient group at risk. A group of these patients will receive advanced  postanaesthesia care in a small number of hospitals around Australia, with careful measurement of the effect on their recovery from surgery.
If the results of this feasibility study show a potential benefit to patient and the health care system, and that we can expect to complete the large randomised trial. </summary>
