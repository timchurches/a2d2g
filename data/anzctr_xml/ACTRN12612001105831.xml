  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, crossover trial. Conditions will follow a 2 (placebo/glucose) X 2 (+/- secondary task) design.

Participants will be required to come for 5 visits. The first visit is a practice day where participants complete screening questionnaires and familiarise themselves with the study procedures and tests. The following 4 days are scheduled at least 48 hours apart and participants are randomised to receive one of two treatment drinks (25g glucose/placebo) and +/- the secondary tracking task. 

Participants will be given a glucose drink on two testing days and a placebo drink on two testing days to be consumed orally. The drinks contain 20 ml of orange cordial in 150 ml water containing either 25g of glucose or 30 mg saccharine. These drinks have been used in numerous previous experiments into the effects of glucose on cognition. The two drinks are sensorily indistinguishable.

If they are in the secondary tracking task condition, they complete the tracking task on the computer while listening to the words. Following the word presentation, there is a word recognition task where participants are presented with the 20 original words mixed with 20 new words. Participants indicate whether or not the word was in the original list by clicking yes or no. If they indicate yes, they are prompted to indicate whether they (1) remembered it was in the original list, (2) know it was in the original list, or (3) guessed it was in the original list.

Drinks will be consumed within 5 minutes, thereafter followed by secondary tracking task and memory encoding.</interventions>

      <outcome>Word recognition accuracy and reaction time

During memory encoding, participants will be orally presented with words via headphones connected to a computer screen. Eight of the words will be included as buffers, four at the beginning of the list and four at the end. Participants in the secondary tracking task condition will additionally complete the tracking task while listening to the words. This consists of participants following a moving target using the computer mouse. Following a short delay, there is a word recognition task where participants are presented with some of the original words mixed with some new words, one at a time on the computer screen. Participants indicate whether or not the word was in the original list by clicking 'yes' or 'no' with the mouse. If the participant responded 'yes', they are prompted to indicate their level of confidence of their answer. They click 'remember' to indicate conscious recollection of an item's appearance, 'know' when the item feels familiar but cannot recall its actual occurrence, or 'guess' if they are uncertain whether an item appeared. Standard instructions for this word recognition paradigm will be utilised.</outcome>

      <outcome>ERP waveforms

In this study electroencephalagram (EEG) will be recorded from a 64 channel electrode cap using the Neuroscan system during the encoding and response stages of the recognition memory task. Electroculogram (EOG) will be recorded using tin electrodes above (E1) and below (E3) the left eye, above (E2) and below (E4) the right eye, from the outer canthi of the left (E5) and right (E6) eyes. Prior to performing the memory task eye movement data will be recorded from each subject to enable artifact to be removed from the signal during analysis. Event related potential (ERP) responses will be time-locked to word presentation during the encoding and response stages. ERP components recorded during the response stage of this task for previously unstudied items will be compared to those which participants indicate a 'remember' or 'know' response. Effects of glucose facilitation and effort will be assessed by comparing the averaged ERP components for the gluocose/placebo and tracking/non tracking conditions respectively.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will respond to advertisements and pass a telephone screening interview before coming in for their screening and enrollment session. Participants will be allocated the next available sequential identification number which will correspond to a treatment number. 

Both treatments are identical in appearance. Treatments will be in cups with lids with the participant identification number and treatment day clearly labelled by a disinterested third party. The trial products must be stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Until dispensed to the participants, the trial products will be stored in a securely locked area, only accessible to authorized personnel.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. All 24 participants will be assigned a treatment and secondary task order using a Latin square. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The randomisation order that has been placed next to the participant’s number will be the allocated treatment order for that individual.</sequence>

If they are in the secondary tracking task condition, they complete the tracking task on the computer while listening to the words. Following the word presentation, there is a word recognition task where participants are presented with the 20 original words mixed with 20 new words.

If they indicate yes, they are prompted to indicate whether they (1) remembered it was in the original list, (2) know it was in the original list, or (3) guessed it was in the original list. 64 channels of EEG will be recorded during whilst participants perform this recognition memory task. Levels of blood glucose, insulin and cortisol will be taken throughout the study days</summary>
