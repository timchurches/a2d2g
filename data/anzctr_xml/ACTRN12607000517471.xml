    <interventions>The Medtronic CareLink Network is a system which allows patients with a CareLink monitor, to transmit data from their implanted device to their doctor directly from home using their phone line. Over 9 months a combination of clinic visits and CareLink transmissions will occur allowing comparison of the characteristics of the 2 methods for device follow-up.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiology patients who receive an implanted device (pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator or cardiac resynchronisation therapy device) return to their doctor on a regular basis to have their device interrogated and followed-up. There is a new method of following-up these devices from the patients home called the Medtronic CareLink Network. Patients use a Monitor to interrogate their implanted device (that is, to collect information from the device using the antenna attached to the Monitor). The monitor then uses an analogue landline to send the encrypted data to the central database.  Clinicians can access the information from the patients implanted devices by logging into the secure, password-protected Website.
	The goal of the ACQUIRE Study is to assess the impact of remote device monitoring on time and financial burden for patients, clinicians and clinics themselves. Furthermore, the acceptance, ease of use, satisfaction and impact of the system will be assessed for both patients and clinicians, respectively. The time and financial impact will be investigated in order to better understand the potential value to economic stakeholders.  The economic stakeholders include patients, caregivers, clinicians, and health care systems.</summary>
