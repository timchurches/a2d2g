  <interventions>
    <interventions>Web-based Physiotherapy (WBP) and Blue prescription (BP) combination group: The 12 weeks of WBP will be delivered via a website designed and evaluated for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), containing a library of over 200 exercises, each exercise page consists of a video clip, audio, and text description of each exercise and a timer. Some local NZ registered physiotherapists will have one face-to-face visit (one hour) with each participant. Based on this first visit, exercise goals with the participant will be agreed and an individualised exercise programme prescribed using the web-based resource. Participants will be asked to complete a digital diary of exercise participation via the internet, available for remote viewing by the physiotherapist who can alter the patient's programme, dependent on progress, and monitor adherence and adverse events.  After 12 weeks of WBP, participants will then receive the BP approach for 12 weeks. Participants will be have given a Zoom visit for 30 minutes, Zoom is similar to Skype but has been found to be more user friendly and require less broadband, by the same physiotherapist and, using the technique of motivational interviewing, together decide on a programme of physical activity (the participant chooses a physical activity they would like to do), how often and for how long. The physiotherapist will conduct a second Zoom visit approximately two weeks later, providing further advice or information. In the third Zoom visit (12 weeks later), the physiotherapist will ask the participant to identify any barriers to ongoing physical activity participation, encouraging the participant to problem-solve to maintain engagement.  During this 12 week period, the therapist and the participant will also be in contact via telephone, email or text message to enable the physiotherapist to support the participants engagement in physical activity. Also, the WBP website will be accessible for the participant to use until the follow-up session (one year after baseline). The control group will be asked to complete all the five questionnaires and send them to research assistance at baseline then they have to wait for six months. Within this six-month they will receive another same questionnaire packs in the weeks 12 and 24. Then, 
Each participants diary on the WBP website (in WBP and BP combination group) will be used to address three items. Firstly, the number of days participants use the diary will be assumed to be an indicator of participation. Secondly, participants will report difficulties encountered on the WBP website diary as well as in their emails, text messages, emails or telephone calls. Thirdly, participants will record on the WBP site when the complete each exercise, this will be taken as their physical activity.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be asked to complete all the five questionnaires and send them to research assistant at baseline then they have to wait for six months. In the waiting time, they will have their usual activities.  Within this six-month they will receive the same questionnaire packs in weeks 12 and 24. Then, the control group will receive the same interventions as the experimental group. Their next assessments will be in weeks 36 and 48. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	Qualitative evaluation:(composite primary outcome)
To explore participants perceptions of the combined interventions, outcome measures, and adverse events, semi-structured, in-depth interviews will be held once, via a Zoom meeting, at the completion of the interventions.  The interviews will be recorded by Zoom application facilities and then transcribed word for word. Pain, muscle soreness, and new relapse will be considered as adverse reactions. The pain and muscle soreness  will be assessed by registered physiotherapists and their reports will be used in this respect. New relapse will be acceptable if the participants' GPs report it.

    <statisticalmethods>A thematic framework analysis will be used to analyse participants interview data. After familiarisation with the data, a coding and charting process will be used to identify potential patterns and associations in the data. Diary data will be analysed in two ways. First, the number of days that the intervention group participants used the diary. Second, all diary entries will be read carefully to identify difficulties encountered and adverse events as a result of participating in the programme. These findings will be reported narratively. The normality of continuous data (quantitative parts) will be tested and confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive statistics, such as standard deviation, average, and range will be reported. Repeated measurement analysis will be used to investigate the between-group effects on the quantitative outcome measures with the simultaneous effect of time and group variables (interaction effect) analysed. The effect of other factors such as gender (male-female), age, and EDSS as confounding factors will be entered into the model. The significance level will be considered to be p&lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to increase physical activity in people with MS living in rural settings. According to the Transtheoretical Theory (Hayden 2014), behaviour change is a process that occurs in stages. Therefore, the Web-Based Physio (WBP) intervention may help the person to progress from the precontemplation or contemplation stages to the action stage (in other words get the person started in an exercise programme in their homes). This intervention can then be followed with the Blue Prescription intervention which might encourage the person to move through the Action stage to the Maintenance stage.
This feasibility study will be a wait list randomised mixed method design. Twenty participants will be recruited and will be divided into two groups, experimental and control. Each participant in the experimental group will receive the WBP intervention for 12 weeks followed by the BP intervention for 12 weeks. Participants will be assessed at baseline, after the first 12 weeks and after the second 12 weeks. One follow-up evaluation will be conducted at 6 months after the combined intervention. People in the control group will wait for six months and then commence the interventions
