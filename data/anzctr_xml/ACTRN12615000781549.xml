  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the 12 weeks for the training period, the experimental group, completed a total of 30 sessions (frequency of 3 and 2 sessions a week on alternate weeks). Each session consisted of 10 minutes of simultaneous application of Whole Body Vibration (WBV) and Electromyostimulation (ES) seated in the wheelchair with their feet on the platform. The frequency of vibration was set at 10 Hz and the amplitude at 5 mm (peak to peak). When ES was used, a rectangular, biphasic and symmetric wave with a pulse width of 400 microseconds and 8 Hz was applied. Three, 2-mm-thick, self-adhesive electrodes were used on each leg: one electrode (10x5 cm) was placed about 2 cm below the popliteal fold, and 2 electrodes (5x5 cm) were placed as close as possible to the motor points of the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis. Current intensity was increased until the subjects motor threshold (mean achieved intensity: 46.6 +/-12.3 mA increasing by 1mA per session.). Finally, interventions were applied by a qualified professional in sport sciences.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Popliteal Blood Flow
Popliteal artery was imaged in a longitudinal section with an ultrasound system (MyLab 25, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) using a pulsed color Doppler with a linear array transducer (LA 523, 7.5-12 MHz; length, 50 mm; Esaote, Genua, Italy) in the right popliteal fossa. The probe was positioned to maintain an insonation angle of 60 degree. Each ultrasound image was recorded for a period of 4 s. In that period, there were between 3 and 5 beats, and the mean of these beats was analyzed (MyLab Desk 8.0, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) to obtain mean (MBV) and peak (PBV) arterial systolic blood velocity. Arterial Resting Diameter (RD) was measured as a perpendicular line from the intima-lumen interface of the near to the far wall. Five images were recorded for each measurement. The highest and the smallest values were excluded, and the mean of the three remaining values was used for further analysis. Images were then analyzed using specialized software (MyLabDesk, Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy). 
Popliteal artery blood flow was calculated as MBVx3,14(RD/2)2x60.  All measurements were performed by the same researcher.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each subject was assessed in 4 different occasions: At baseline (B), after 6 weeks in the half of the training period (Post-6), after 12 weeks at the end of the training period (Post-12) and 8 weeks after the end of the training in order to evaluate the detraining process (D). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle thickness of the gastrocnemius
This is composite primary outcome. Muscle thicknesses of medialis (MG) and lateralis (LG) gastrocnemius were assessed with an ultrasound system (MyLab 25, Esaote, Genoa, Italy).  The measurement site was determined at 1/3 proximal of the distance between the lateral epicondyle of the femur and the lateral malleolus of the ankle. This distance was measured with the subjects lying on an examination bed with their knees fully extended. This site was marked on the skin to ensure the repeatability of the measurement. Subjects were asked to remark this reference everyday during the experimental period. Transversal images were recorded from the MG and LG. Five images were recorded for each measurement. The highest and the smallest values were excluded, and the mean of the three remaining values was used for further analysis. Images were then analyzed using specialized software (MyLabDesk, Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy). The same researcher took and analyzed all images.

      <timepoint>Each subject was assessed in 4 different occasions: At baseline (B), after 6 weeks in the half of the training period (Post-6), after 12 weeks at the end of the training period (Post-12) and 8 weeks after the end of the training in order to evaluate the detraining process (D). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bone Mineral Density
BMD was assessed at femoral neck cross-sectional area (total bone surface in a cross-section) by dual-energy x-ray absorption (DXA) with the Norland densitometer (XR-46, USA). DXA is the current standard for measuring BMD. Subjects were supine, with the foot braced and strapped to a plastic triangular frame, ensuring fixed internal rotation of 60 degree. </outcome>
      <timepoint>BMD was assessed at baseline (B), and after 12 weeks at the end of the training period (Post-12).

    <statisticalmethods>The normality of the dependent variables was checked and subsequently confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. During the pilot study, the necessary number of participants was set at 20 in order to registered variables could be analyzed using parametric statistical tests. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in group and time was applied. When a significant F-value was achieved, pairwise comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni post hoc procedure. Effect size statistic was provided to determine the magnitude of the effect independently of the sample size. Pearson's correlation coefficient between muscle thickness and resting diameter was calculated. Statistical significance was set at p=0.05. Values were expressed as mean +/-SD. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>the aim of this study was to analyze the chronic effects of simultaneous application of WBV and ES on the popliteal arterial blood flow in SCI subjects. Our hypothesis is that WBV+ES would elicit greater responses in the experimental group in blood flow and muscle thickness of spinal cord injuried subjects.</summary>
