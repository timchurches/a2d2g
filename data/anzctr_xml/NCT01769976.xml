Experimental: Daily energy restriction - 25% reduction in daily energy intake

Active Comparator: Energy balance diet - Diet provides 100% of energy requirements and is designed to achieve weight stability

Experimental: Periodic fasting with weight loss - Fast 3 days per week, and consume 1.5 times usual amount of food on other days

Experimental: Periodic fasting without weight loss - Fast 3 days per week, and consume double usual amount of food on other days

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine whether periodic fasting improves markers of diabetes
      risk and cardiovascular health, and will compare this to the effects observed with daily
      dieting by energy restriction, and also with no change in energy intake.

      It is hypothesized that periodic fasting, with or without weight loss, will be as effective
      as daily energy restriction to improve markers of metabolic health and energy metabolism.</summary>
