  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise Group
The exercise group will perform a 40-60 minute program of leg strengthening and balance exercises three times per week for 6 months. Participants will attend a monthly exercise class conducted by a physiotherapist in association with their Parkinson's NSW Support Group, as well as perform the exercises at home. Resistance for the strengthening exercises will be applied using weighted vests. Cueing strategies will be used to assist patients to manage freezing. Participants will also receive advice on falls prevention and a falls diary for recording any falls.

    <concealment>Block randomisation will be used to allocate participants to treatment groups. All participants from the same support group will be allocated in equal numbers to treatment and control groups at the same time. Randomisation will be done by someone not involved in subject recruitment or assessment and will occur off site at a central location. By allocating all participants from one group together at a central location, recruitment staff will be unable to predict any participant's group allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite optimal medication, people with Parkinson's disease living in the community experience frequent and recurrent falls. These falls result in major adverse consequences both personally and economically for the person with Parkinson's disease and their families. Poor balance, reduced leg muscle strength and and freezing of gait have been found to be independent predictors for falls in people with Parkinson's disease.

This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the effect of a 6 month support-group based exercise program on falls risk as well as balance, lower limb muscle strength and freezing of gait in people with Parkinson's disease who are falling or at risk of falling.

Any reduction in falls rates has the potential to improve the quality of life of individuals with Parkinson's disease and their families as well as reduce the financial costs to them and the health care system.</summary>
