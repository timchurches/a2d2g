  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a regimen
      containing once-daily elvitegravir (EVG) versus twice-daily raltegravir (RAL) added to a
      background regimen (1 fully-active ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) plus 1 or
      2 additional antiretroviral (ARV) agents) in HIV-1 infected, ARV treatment-experienced adults
      who have documented resistance, or at least six months experience prior to screening with two
      or more different classes of ARV agents.

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive EVG plus background regimen
      (Elvitegravir group), or raltegravir plus background regimen (Raltegravir group). Due to
      known drug interactions, participants in the Elvitegravir group receiving RTV-boosted
      atazanavir (ATV) or RTV-boosted lopinavir (LPV) as part of their background regimen will
      receive elvitegravir at a lower dose (85 mg).</summary>
