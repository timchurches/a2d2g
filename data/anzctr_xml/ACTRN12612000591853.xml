  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with ITP have reduced numbers of platelets in their blood, which makes them at risk of bleeding, which may be severe. The reduced platelets are due to them being destroyed by the patients own immune system (autoimmune). Treatment of this usually involves the use of broadly acting drugs to reduce this immune reaction. Drugs such as prednisone are often effective but have significant side effects. A new class of drug provides more targeted treatment with fewer side effects. The drug rituximab was developed to treat patients with cancer of the cells of the immune system and the dose used is high.

This trial uses rituximab, which has been shown to be effective at high dose, in a lower dose schedule. There is some data to suggest that the lower dose may be sufficient and this study seeks to confirm this by treating a statistically sufficient numbers of patients to draw firm conclusions. Patients eligible for the study will have severe ITP which has not responded satisfactorily to standard therapy. Assuming the results of the lower dose are satisfactory the benefits of therapy being cheaper, and the risk of side effects being reduced, would make this treatment an advance in the care of patients with ITP.</summary>
