  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arthritis has been reported as a risk factor for falls. Few studies have investigated the
      effect of balance training on balance performance in women with lower limb arthritis. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a four-month individualised home exercise
      programme in improving gait stability and balance for women with arthritis.</summary>
