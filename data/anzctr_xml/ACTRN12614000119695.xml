  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single-site robotic cholecystectomy is a novel technique aimed to minimize the surgical trauma by performing the whole intervention through a single access in the umbilicus where a specifically designed port device is placed for instruments and camera insertion. The robotic platform is expected to improve the surgical task due to the several advantages offered by computer-assisted technology with respect of conventional laparoscopy. One of the commonly reported pitfall of robotic surgery is that the overall duration of the procedure may be increased when compared to the traditional approach due to the docking time spent for robot and trocars positioning, while the dissection time is usually unaffected. A single-site robotic cholecystectomy takes about 60 minutes including docking time, on average, depending on surgical team's experience and patients' characteristics. </interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional (4 ports) laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the traditional gold-standard approach based on the placement of four abdominal trocars through which the camera and the instruments are inserted. Its duration is variable depending on surgeon's experience and patient's characteristics but it usually takes 45 minutes-1 hour, on average.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation was based on the primary endpoint (50% reduction of post-operative pain 24 hours after surgery). The use of VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) allows to determine the distribution of pain in patients undergone to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy, thus identifying three groups of patients, each provided with different numerosity:
-Mild pain (VAS 0-3): 10%
-Moderate pain (VAS 4-7%): 70%
-Severe pain (VAS 8-10%): 20%
The sum of VAS rates measured 24 hours post-operatively on each of the four access sites (hidden by pieces of dressing tapes at the end of both techniques to blind the patient and the monitor) was considered. Based on the aforementioned experience of pain distribution after conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the hypothesis is that 90% of patients undergone to this technique will complain moderate-severe pain at that time point. Therefore, if a 50% pain reduction is expected in patients with moderate-severe pain within the single-site robotic group (hence shifting from 90% to 45%), the number of patients to be enrolled in each group should have been 28 in order to keep a 5% alpha-error and a power of 90%. Assuming a potential drop-out rate of 7%, 30 patients at least were supposed to be enrolled in each study arm.  
Statistical analysis of primary endpoint was performed by comparing the results of the two groups using Fisher's exact test for categorical data while t Student test for continuous data and calculating the difference between proportions of patients with severe or moderate pain along with its relative 95% confidence intervals. The same was done for secondary endpoints where the changes over time of the sum of VAS rates were compared using regression model for repeated measures.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Randomized studies have failed to demonstrate significant outcome benefit after single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The new robotic single-site platform allows improved stability of instruments and smoother dissection, which might reduce tissue trauma with potential positive effects on local inflammation and postoperative pain.
Two groups of 30 eligible patients were randomized to receive either SIRC or CLC. During the first postoperative week, patients and study monitors were blinded to the type of procedure performed by the application of four pieces of dressing tape at the end of surgery. Site-specific pain was assessed 6 hours postoperatively, and at one, seven and thirty days after surgery, when a 1 to 10 cosmetic score was also administered to patients. Primary endpoint was 50% pain reduction at 24 hours after surgery in single-site robotic group versus conventional laparoscopic group. Secondary endpoint were post-operative pain trend over time based on "total VAS" (the sum of the VAS rates on each abdominal access site) and site-specific VAS values at 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 and 30 days post-operatively and cosmetic result measured with a 0-10 patient  satisfaction scale at 30 days after surgery.
Results of this trial showed that single-site robotic technique does not offer any significant reduction of post-operative pain when compared to the conventional laparoscopic procedure. The cosmetic advantage of the single-site robotic
approach is balanced by an increased risk of incisional hernias and higher costs.</summary>
