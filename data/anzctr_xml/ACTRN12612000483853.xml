  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Tristel Wipes System provides high level disinfection for non-lumened medical instruments.  The first step is the Pre-clean Wipe which is impregnated with a low-foaming surfactant system combined with triple enzymes, the second step is the Sporicidal Wipe and Activator Foam which is sporicidal, mycobactericidal, bactericidal, virucidal and fungicidal and the third step is the Rinse Wipe which is impregnated with de-ionised water and a low-level of antioxidant which has been gamma irradiated to make sterile.  The three step process takes under two minutes and is carried out immediately post nasoendoscopy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator Arm 1 - Cipex OPA is a solution containing ortho-phthaldehyde which is used in conjunction with an Automated Endoscopic Reprocessor (AER).  The flexible nasoendoscope is placed in the AER and the cleaning cycle initiated.  The cycle consists of a 10 minute soaking and soak rinse phase in Cidex OPA, a rinse 1 phase for 7 minutes in potable water, a rinse 2 phase for 6 minutes in potable water, a 30 second alcohol rinse and then a 3 minute air purge to dry the instrument. The process is carried out immediately post nasoendoscopy.
Comparator Arm 2 - PeraSafe is a powder system which when dissolved in water yields peracetyl ions, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide giving an aqueous solution and functions by oxidising proteins. Perasafe powder is added directly to a container of lukewarm water until it has dissolved and then transferred to a cyclinder.  The working portion of the nasoendoscope is immersed in the solution of PeraSafe contained within a cylinder for a minimum of 10 minutes and is carried out immediately post nasoendoscopy.</comparator>

      <outcome>Microbiology Endpoints
-Equipment samples collected following disinfection immediately prior to use of the scope by swabbing the tip and shoulder of the nasoendoscope.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effectiveness of the 3 disinfectants used
-The total per-patient cost of high-level disinfection with the Tristel Wipes, Cidex OPA and PeraSafe systems will be calculated using data collected from the participants undergoing nasoendoscopy.  These costs will include a per-procedure estimate of the AER and cylinder, all disposables, irrigation fluids, nursing time and scope damage caused by the disinfectants.
-Timing of the 3 processess and measurement of participant through-put; time needed for the cleaning process as an indicator of relative efficiency.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cost effectiveness will be analysed from data from all participants in the trial.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease-of-use and odour will be assessed using a 5 point Likert scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be rated by the nurses using the disinfection equipment on each study day.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant, surgeon and nursing staff safety
-all participant adverse events will be recorded regardless of whether these are likely to be related to the disinfectant.  Any adverse event is unlikely following nasoendoscopy other than mild irritation or rhinorrhea.
-incidence and severity of eye irritation and conjunctivitis or other reactions will be reported by the surgeon using the nasoendoscope on the study day</outcome>
      <timepoint>-participant AEs recorded 3-7 days post nasoendoscope
-surgeon reaction up to 3 days post nasoendoscope</timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be allocated to the next available nasoendoscopy clinic. When all the available spaces for a clinic are filled, the randomised high level disinfectant (i.e. Tristel Wipes, PeraSafe or Cidex OPA) for that day will be determined by the study statistician and relevant staff notified. In this way, investigators allocating participants to a clinic day do not know which disinfectant will be used on the day. While each individual participant is not randomly allocated to disinfectant type with this approach, it has the advantage that each participant is allocated to the next available clinic.  It is anticipated that there will be at least 30 clinic study days.  The randomisation process will be undertaken by the independent statistician to ensure there are equivalent numbers of Tristel Wipes, PeraSafe and Cidex OPA study days and approximately equal numbers of participants in each disinfectant group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation by using a randomisation table created by a computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation)</sequence>

    <designfeatures>It is not possible to blind the people conducting the disinfection since the three products are different in appearance and procedures required.  However the ENT surgeons and the participants will be blinded.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are several methods and agents whihc can be used to provide high-level disinfection of 'semi-critical' instruments such as flexible nasoendoscopes, however non-corrosive methods are required because of the composition of the instrument.
Cidex OPA (ortho-Phthalaldehyde;1,2 - benzenedicarboxaldehyde) has been widely used for high-level disinfection but may elicit an allergic reaction in workers if protective equipment is not used and the vapours produced may be an irrtant to the respiratory tract and eyes (Cidex OPA Directions for Use; 2004).  Perasafe solution is at pH 8.0 at which peracetic acid and peracetyl ions exist at a 50:50 mixture to minimize corresiveness and maximise efficacy against acid resistant bacteria (PeraSafe product information-DuPont).  
Tristel Solutions Ltd (UK) produces a range of high-level disinfectant products which use chlorine dioxide chemistry and the products have also been used as a disinfectant for a wide variety of instruments and surfaces without safety issues (Tristel data file).  Therefore the use of Tristel Wipes is expected to pose a very low risk to patients, surgeons and nurses.  If Tristel Wipes are shown to be at least ast effective as Cidex OPA and PeraSafe in terms of post-intervention complications for patients, less in-use problems for the surgeons and nurses, then it may be a preferable product to use for high-level disinfection of nasoendoscopes.</summary>
