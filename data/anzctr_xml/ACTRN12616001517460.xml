    <statisticalmethods>All tests of the effect of treatment on outcomes will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. That is, all randomized patients will be analysed in the group to which they were randomised regardless of whether they received the assigned treatment and regardless of any protocol deviations or violations. Analyses of outcome variables will, however, exclude data from infants who withdraw from study treatment and withdraw consent for use of their data. All primary statistical analyses will be unadjusted and tests of significance will be two-sided. Any departures from intention-to-treat will be documented and reported. With regard to sample size calculation for our initial studies we propose the following:
Assuming that approximately 60% of infants in this study would otherwise have required intervention for PDA, a sample size of at least 42 infants per group would be required to detect a 50% reduction in the need for intervention, with a 95% confidence interval and a power of 80%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The optimal management of PDA is highly controversial with a lack of consensus regarding the need to treat, timing of intervention, the most appropriate pharmacological agents (including dose, dose intervals, duration, repeat courses, routes of administration) and the role of surgical intervention. Traditionally, the medications we use to treat PDA are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which decrease prostaglandin production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX). The most commonly used medications, indomethacin and ibuprofen, have a success rate of approximately 70% - 85%. Unfortunately these medications are associated a number of unwanted adverse effects due to decreased blood flow to the brain, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. Exposure to these medications puts vulnerable preterm infants at risk of significant complications such as intestinal perforation and necrotising enterocolitis. The alternative to medications is surgical intervention, which also carries significant risks, particularly for extreme preterm infants. 

Paracetamol is a medication with an excellent safety profile in infants when used to treat mild to moderate pain and fever. Although the mechanism of action of paracetamol is not completely understood, part of its spectrum of activity resembles that of a COX-2 selective inhibitor. Similar to traditional NSAIDs, this results in decreased prostaglandin production. It is therefore intuitive that this may also be effective in promoting ductal closure without the adverse effects associated with NSAIDs. Early experiences with the use of paracetamol for ductal closure have been encouraging. Paracetamol appears to have similar efficacy to NSAIDs, without the gastrointestinal complications associated with NSAIDs, and is well tolerated in the preterm infant population. It has been suggested as a safe alternative medication in situations where other medications have failed or are contraindicated. 

The aims of this study are to study the effect of early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus with paracetamol and to examine the safety and efficacy profile of paracetamol during the early postnatal period. We hypothesise that early treatment with paracetamol will reduce the number of infants requiring intervention for PDA and that the use of paracetamol in preterm infants with a patent ductus arteriosus will result in a higher rate of ductal closure compared with placebo. We also am to show that paracetamol can be used safely in preterm infants during the early postnatal period.
