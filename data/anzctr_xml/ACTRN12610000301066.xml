  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the intervention group will participate in a 12-week worksite-based physical activity intervention based around increasing their average daily work day steps.  The intervention will comprise 2 distinct treatment phases targeting behaviour adoption (weeks 1-4) and adherence (weeks 5-12) using Stages of Behaviour Change principles.  The adoption phase of the walking intervention will consist of individually targeted supervised 60-minute education/information group sessions of 5-6 participants held once per week.  The adoption pahase group sessions will be facilitated by a physiotherapist or exercise physiologist. Participants will discuss the benefits of becoming more active; how to initiate behaviours to achieve activity goals; how to identify strategies for overcoming lapses etc); how to set individual steps per day goals; and how to self monitor progress using the pedometer and a walking diary to record work day steps.  Each session will conclude with a 20 minute group walk.  The adherence phase of the walking intervention will be self-directed and remotely monitored to encourage participant compliance and progression.   Participants will select their own preferred walking option(s) from three alteratives, depending on their own life circumstances or individual preference with the intention of progressively increasing average work day steps.  The first of these walking options, termed walking routes will use prescribed walks around the campus over which participants will be asked to complete at least 20-30 minutes of continuous, brisk walking every work day. The second walking option, termed walking within tasks will encourage participants to accumulate step counts throughout the working day. Rather than prescribed routes, the office, lectures and seminars will be targeted as environments  where tasks could be completed standing and walking, rather than sitting, for example walk and talk tutorials or meetings.  The third walking option, termed walking for transport will provide participants with an information pack to facilitate safe walking to and/or from work, using identified walking paths and public transport facilities.  Particpiants will be encouraged to select a mix the options from day-to-day depending on their preferences.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will receive no intervention for the 12-week treatment period during which they will be encouraged to continue with normal behaviour and refrain from commencing any new physical activity or exercise program.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average work day step count: will be measured by pedometer (Yamax SW-200) and averaged over five working days at each time point</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention (baseline), end adoption phase (end week 4) and post-intervention (end week 12).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical health status: will be measured by three standard measures of cardiovascular and metabolic health
1. Blood pressure: duplicate measures of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) will be taken two minutes apart using an automated device Microlife BP A 100; Microlife AG, Widnau, Switzerland) after the participant has rested in a seated position for five minutes.
2. Waist circumference: duplicate measurements of the waist circumference will be made at the level of the trunk where the girth is minimal (i.e. where there is a noticeable indentation of the trunk), usually 1 inch or 2.5 cm above the umbilicus, or if there is no noticeable indentation the tape will be located at the umbilicus.  A steel tape measure KDS F10-02 (KDS Corporation, Japan) will be used to ensure the tape does not stretch during measurement. 
3. Body fat percentage will be assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis procedures using an electronic body composition analyzer (Tanita BF 350; Tanita Corporation, Tokyo Japan) following recommended procedures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention (baseline),  and post-intervention (end week 12).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mental health status: The psychological wellbeing of participants will be measured by a validated self-administered questionnaire; Kessler-10.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention (baseline),  and post-intervention (end week 12).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity participation:  will be measured by the validated Active Australia Survey</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention (baseline),  and post-intervention (end week 12).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Work ability - will be measured by two self administered questionnaires: the Work Ability Index (Australia) which is an adaption of the Work Ability Index (WAI); and by the Work Ability Survey (WAS).</outcome>
