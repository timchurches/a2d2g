    <concealment>Subject must satisfy all eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent to participate.
Eligible subjects will be enrolled and assigned in sequential order to one of the three treatment groups (olive oil, triglyceride omega-3 or phospholipid omega-3) using a participant/randomisation number sequence generated in advance that randomly assigns subjects to one of the three groups. This randomisation schedule will be generated by an independent data manager and provided to a separate independent entity responsible for labelling the investigational product.
To preserve masking, the three different types of oral supplements will be packaged in identical containers. Investigators collecting and analysing data will not be involved in the reconciliation of returned study product.</concealment>
    <sequence>An independent data manager will generate a simple random number sequence in Microsoft Excel for participant randomisation. The sequence will include equal numbers for the three treatment groups. The code will be kept by the independent data manager and made available for labelling of the investigational product by sequential participant number. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dry eye disease is a common condition, affecting up to 30% of adults. Common symptoms of dry eye disease include eye irritation (e.g., burning, grittiness, scratchiness, wateriness) and/or fluctuations in vision. Currently, the main form of treatment for dry eye disease is the use of artificial tears (lubrication drops), which can assist in reducing these symptoms by supplementing the deficient tear fluid. However, as artificial tears fail to address the underlying cause of dry eye disease, for many patients they are inadequate in completely relieving symptoms. New and enhanced therapeutic treatments are therefore needed. 

Inflammation plays an important role in the development of dry eye disease. There is growing scientific evidence that dietary supplementation with omega-3 essential fatty acids, may be of benefit in reducing inflammation throughout the body, including in the eye. A well recognised source of omega-3s is fish oil, which has undergone some preliminary investigations in relation to treating dry eye disease, however further research is needed to substantiate these findings.

The aim of this proof-of-concept, single site clinical trial is to evaluate the benefit of phospholipid form omega-3 supplements for the treatment of dry eye disease, and whether this form of omega-3 provides any benefit over triglyceride omega-3s. The effects of both forms of omega-3 supplements will be compared with a control group, who will consume an olive oil supplement. </summary>
