  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants (patients with HIV infection attending the Auckland City Hospital Infectious Diseases Unit) in the intervention group will receive an augmented smartphone application to use for three months (in addition to standard care). 

The application contains three components designed to facilitate adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART); 
(a) 24 hour timer reminding the participant when to take their medications 
(b) predicted blood concentrations of medications based on medication-taking as entered into the application by the patient
c) graphical representation of HIV &amp; CD4 cell activity based on predicted medication concentrations and blood tests.

1. Standard care for patients with HIV infection at Auckland City Hospital is an appointment at the Infectious Diseases outpatient clinic once every six months (with either an Infectious Diseases consultant or specialist nurse) and a blood test once every three months (to determine CD4 count and HIV viral load). There is no additional care for participants taking part in the study.

2. Participants will be only asked to enter their medication use into the application. Thus, the frequency of use will depend on the complexity of their treatment regimen. Any use of the application in addition to entering medication use is completely at the participants discretion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will also receive a smartphone application to use for three months (in addition to standard care). However this application will only contain component (a) - the 24 hour timer reminding the participant when to take their medications. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HIV viral load (copies/ml)

The HIV viral load will be measured in the Virology Laboratory (Lab Plus, Auckland City Hospital) by the COBAS AmpliPrep/Taqman HIV-1 Test. This is a RT/PCR based assay that effectively detects all HIV-1 group M subtypes. It can quantitate HIV-1 RNA over the range of 20 - 10,000,000 copies/ml.</outcome>

      <outcome>Pharmacy dispensings (the number and dates of dispensings of ART for each participant from 01 January 2012 to 01
September 2013, and the dates of any missed collections, were obtained from local pharmacy

The total and percentage of CD3, CD4 and CD8 positive cells will be measured by flow cytometry in the Cell Markers section of the Haematology Laboratory, (Lab Plus, Auckland City Hospital). </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smartphone application usage 
(i.e. the number of times that each participant viewed each particular component of their application, and
the amount of time spent on each component). Data were recorded on the smartphone application and analysed using Google analytics software.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one and two weeks after randomisation
one and three months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of smartphone application

Participants were asked how satisfied they were with the application and how useful they found each particular component for reminding them to take their medications. The questionnaire enquired about specific properties of the application, namely; ease of use, visual appeal, discretion, information provision, and an overall rating. Each item was rated on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) with relevant anchors. 

Each participant was also asked whether they would recommend the application to other patients on ART, and (in an open-ended question format) which features of the application worked well, which features did not work well, and any improvements they would make to the application.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation: Previous randomised controlled trials of adherence-promoting mobile technologies for people living with HIV have found large effect sizes for differences between control and intervention groups (Lewis et al., 2013; Moore, Hardy, Skolnik, &amp; Moss, 2011). A total sample size of 52 participants was estimated to be required, in order to detect a large effect size (f = 0.40) for a difference in self-reported adherence to ART between the active control group and intervention group. This calculation was on the basis of a power of .80 and an alpha level of .05, using a one-way between groups analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). To account for participant attrition, a total sample of 60 was deemed an appropriate target for recruitment. 

Statistical Analysis: The data were analysed using the SPSS version 20.0 software (Chicago, Illinois). Data were assessed for normality, and non-parametric testing was employed for analysis of variables which did not have a normal distribution. One-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), controlling for baseline measures of the outcome variable, were used to examine the effects of the intervention on adherence to treatment, perceptions of HIV infection, and beliefs about ART.

McNemars tests were conducted to ascertain if there were any differences in the proportion of non-adherent participants (as classified using the composite adherence measure) at baseline and three month follow-up, in the intervention and active control group. Correlational analyses were used to explore the relationships between application use, changes in illness perceptions and medication beliefs, and changes in adherence to ART. Independent samples t-tests were carried out to assess the effect of group allocation on application usage and evaluations of the smartphone application.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine whether a smartphone application is a useful tool to help patients with HIV remember and manage their medications. Specifically, we intend to compare the effectiveness of two smartphone apps with different capabilities. 

To do this, people who are currently living with HIV, attending the Auckland City Hospital Infectious Diseases clinic and use a smartphone are being asked to participate in this study. 

Participants will then be randomly allocated to one of two smartphone application groups. All participants will be asked to use their respective app for three months.

It is hypothesised that participants in both groups will become more adherent to their ART medication. Specifically, it is aniticipated that the smartphone application designed to enhance patients' understanding of their HIV infection will be more effective in improving/maintaining adherence to ART.
