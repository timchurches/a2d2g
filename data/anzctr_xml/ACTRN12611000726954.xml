  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clinical Supervision [CS] is the provision of time-out and an opportunity within the context of an ongoing professional relationship with an experienced practitioner to engage in guided reflection on current practice, in ways designed to develop and enhance the practice in the future. In practical terms, CS has come to mean small groups of Supervisees (n=~6) or dyads (1:1) attending a pre-arranged meeting with an appropriately trained Clinical Supervisor, for 45-60 minutes per session, at a monthly frequency, for facilitated reflective discussion, in confidence, around matters of professional relevance and importance. In this trial, the outcomes of CS were measured one year after it was introduced into the working arrangements of mental health nurses across Queensland.</interventions>

    <sequence>In this trial, a method to generate the sequence in which subjects were randomised was not appropriate. The randomisation process took place at the level of Mental Health Unit, not at the level of subjects. Postcode analysis of the database derived from a previous and separate State-wide Clinical Supervision Staff Survey showed no systematic patterns of CS activity in Queensland, which allowed identification of green-field locations for an RCT. Accordingly, formal invitations were distributed to all Heads of Mental Health Services and other key professional/administrative staff across Queensland for expressions of interest. The Joint Chief Investigators followed-up with personal site visits and detailed correspondence to all who had indicated a preparedness to participate. Eight sites were found to be unsuitable because CS activities were reportedly already in place. Subsequently, Area Nursing Directors and/or Nurse Unit Managers in 17 adult mental health facilities in nine geographical locations across Queensland provided written consent for the study to be conducted. The allocation of facilities to either an Intervention or a Control Arm of the RCT was random, insofar as the Research Team was blind to the characteristics of the facilities that comprised the pool that met the entry criteria [viz; bereft of existing CS arrangements and a willingness to participate in the trial]. The randomisation process by which final choices were made also took cognizance of the relative size of the mental health nursing workforces and of the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia [ARIA]. An appropriate balance was sought to ensure that urban and regional areas were represented in the trial. The eventual design, therefore, was weighted in favour of the intervention arm for pragmatic reasons. All Control groups contributed to the outcome data collection, only.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical supervision [CS], a structured staff support arrangement, has shown promise as a positive contribution to the clinical governance agenda and is now found reflected in health policy themes elsewhere in the world. However, CS is underdeveloped in Australia and the empirical evidence base for the informed implementation of CS, per se, has remained elusive. This large and generously funded pragmatic randomised controlled trial tested the relationships between Clinical Supervision, quality of care and patient outcomes, in mental health settings in Queensland, Australia. Twenty four mental health nurses attended a training course to equip them to provide Clinical Supervision to groups of colleagues in their respective work places across the State. A suite of outcome measures, each with established psychometric properties [including The Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale] measured differences within and between participants in the Intervention and the Control Arms of the trial, over a one year period. Findings confirmed that beneficial and sustainable CS outcomes accrued for Supervisors and Supervisees, and for patients in one private sector mental health facility. However, the effect Clinical Supervision had on nominated outcomes remained difficult to demonstrate across a broad front. Plausible explanations were offered for this and a new framework for future outcomes-related research studies was suggested, in the continuing attempt to strengthen an empirical evidence base for Clinical Supervision.</summary>
