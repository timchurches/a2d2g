  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention phase will involve two weeks of FES cycling for 30-45 minutes, four times a week. The actual duration of individual FES cycling sessions will be determined by the participant's capacity to continue and will be supervised by their treating therapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two weeks of usual rehabilitation. Usual rehabilitation commonly involves a combination of functional task retraining; strength and fitness training; maintenance of joint range of movement and muscle length. The rehabilitation program is tailored to the individual to optimise independence and quality of life. 
This is a cross over trial where the order of intervention / control phases are randomised and separated by a one week wash out period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Urine output as assessed by a blinded assessor. Measurements during both phases will be taken over a one hour period either immediately following FES cycling (if the participant is at the end of the experimental phase) or sitting quietly (if the participant is at the end of the control phase). Measurements during both phases will be performed while the participant is sitting quietly. Prior to each measurement, fluid intake will be restricted for 3 hours according to normal recommended intake for weight.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Fourteen participants from 2 NSW Spinal Units will be recruited. Possible participants will undergo a screening process and suitable participants will be invited to participate. Randomisation must occur within one week of initial screening and consent. Once the eligibility checklist is complete, eligible participants will be randomised to the order of experimental and control phases named phase one and phase two.
The randomisation schedule will be formulated by an independent person. Each participantâ€™s allocation will be placed in sealed opaque and sequentially numbered envelopes that will be kept off-site. A participant will be entered into the trial when baseline details are logged, an envelope is opened and the phase order provided.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal cord injury results in loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function below the level of the lesion. This has serious implications on activities of daily living and psychological well being. Specifically, significant loss of lower limb motor control leads to marked changes in peripheral circulation, increasing the risk of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers and limiting footwear options. 

Functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling is an increasingly popular part of rehabilitation programs following recent spinal cord injury. The functional electrical stimulation cycling unit uses electrodes on the main muscle groups in the lower limbs to cause contractions of paralysed muscles to generate a cycling motion. There is mounting anecdotal evidence to support the use of FES cycling to improve urine output, and reduce lower limb swelling and spasticity. However, there is little good quality research to confirm these claims.
Thus the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of FES lower limb cycling on urine output, lower limb swelling and spasticity. The results of this study will have implications for the rehabilitation of people following spinal cord injury. In particular, they will provide high-quality evidence to guide clinical practice and assist with prescription and recommendations for FES cycling.</summary>
