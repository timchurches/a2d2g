    <interventions>AKP-11 is a small molecule entity with anti-inflammatory activity. The study involves the daily topical administration of ~1 g of 3% topical AKP-11 formulation (~0.5 g 2 x times a Day) and matching placebo to up to 65 participants with plaque psoriasis to a target site (one or more plaques with or without healthy skin) with an area of up to the size of 121 cm2, identified by an investigator,   for 6 weeks. Participants will be randomized 1:1 into AKP-11 formulation/placebo groups. At every visit, the participant needs to return used and unused sachet/s to the study personal for accountability purposes.

    <concealment>Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a randomization number in the order of final eligibility for entry into the study using a randomization schedule generated prior to the start of the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either AKP-11 or placebo treatment. As this is a double-blind, placebo controlled study, both the study personnel and participants will be blinded as to which treatment they are to receive. Dispensed investigational product will be identified by the randomisation number. No labelling will be included that could cause blind leakage.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase II study to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of topical doses of AKP-11 when administered to participants with mild to moderate psoriasis. AKP-11 is a Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist, developed by Akaal Pharma PTY LTD.  AKP-11 targets the immune activity, inhibits the over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and factors including the inflammation. AKP-11 has been tested in several immune/ inflammatory diseases including psoriasis patients (Phase I) in order to establish its efficacy. The twice daily topical application of 0.5 g of 3% ointment containing 15 mg AKP-11 or matching placebo in up to 65 participants for 41 days. Participants will be randomized 1 to 1 into 3% AKP-11 and Placebo groups respectively.
