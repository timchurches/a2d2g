    <interventions>This study will investigate the use of iron transfusion intraoperatively in patients who are known to have iron deficiency anaemia, or become anaemic due to blood loss during surgery. The dose of iron is calculated based on patient age, gender, weight and haemoglobin level and is administered as a one off infusion in theatre. This is an observational study looking at indications, patterns of use and any adverse effects noted while administering an iron transfusion intraoperatively. The study will take place over a three month period, from the end of July to the end of October 2013. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of intraoperative iron transfusions. This will be assessed by the anaesthetist administering the transfusion completing a data collection form during the surgical procedure, outlining patient demographics, type, dose and duration of iron transfusion and other data including the indications, adverse effects noted and logistical factors contributing to the decision to give iron. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Three month period from end of July to the end of October. Data sheets will be completed by the anaesthetist as the iron transfusions are administered and collected on a daily basis. The results will be reviewed on a weekly basis throughout the three month period, and finally analysed at the end of the three month period. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of adverse outcomes secondary to an intraoperative iron transfusion. Adverse effects may include skin itching and urticaria, bronchospasm, back pain, nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, headache, hypotension, tachycardia, joint or muscle pain, syncope and circulatory collapse. These adverse effects are listed on the data collection form. The anaesthetist administering the transfusion will assess whether any adverse effects occur related to the iron infusion and will then record this on a data collection form. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Three month period from end of July to the end of October. Data sheets will be completed by the anaesthetist as the iron transfusions are administered and collected on a daily basis. The results will be reviewed on a weekly basis throughout the three month period, and finally analysed at the end of the three month period. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of patients requiring blood transfusion after intraoperative iron infusion. Once the data collection forms are submitted, the principal investigator will access a hospital patient information system and which will document whether any units of blood product were administered to the patient after the surgery. This information will be recorded on the data collection form. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The study will be undertaken over a three month period from the end of July to the end of October. This outcome will be assessed at the end of the three month period, once all data forms have been submitted. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a prospective observational study, which aims to investigate the use of intraoperative iron infusion, initiated by anaesthetists, during surgical procedures at Fremantle Hospital over a three month period. The use of intraoperative iron transfusions is highly variable among anaesthetists, and the study aims to investigate the logistical and other practical reasons for this. It will identify the indications for intra-operative iron transfusion and note any adverse effects in the perioperative period. A secondary aim is to investigate postoperative haemoglobin values and need for transfusion postoperatively in patients who have received an intraoperative iron transfusion. Iron infusions have been shown to be a valuable therapy for anaemia, and this study investigates the effectiveness, safety and efficiency of providing that therapy intraoperatively. </summary>
