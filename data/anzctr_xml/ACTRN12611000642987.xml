  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized, controlled nutrition intervention trial designed to evaluate the health benefits of pulses will be conducted in 160 older overweight adults by a collaborating team from the University of Manitoba and the Nutritional Physiology Research Centre, University of South Australia.
Prior to beginning the trial, volunteers will undergo a series of cognitive and cardiometabolic (blood pressure, blood vessel function, body composition) tests. They will provide a fasting blood sample and their dietary intake and regular physical activity will be assessed.
Volunteers will be allocated to one of two intervention groups:-

1. Pulse group: consume foods delivering 100g of pulses daily for 12 weeks
2. Control group: consume energy matched non-pulse foods for 12 weeks

Cognitive, cardiometabolic, dietary and physical activity assessments and blood sampling will be repeated at 6 and 12 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A common aspect of obesity and ageing is that both are associated with reduced arterial compliance. Reduced arterial compliance is in turn associated with impaired cognitive function, particularly in people with metabolic syndrome. For instance, it has been demonstrated that an inverse relationship between ankle brachial index and cognition was exacerbated in people with the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, prospective studies have indicated that reduced arterial compliance is associated with a more rapid progression of cognitive decline. Therefore, effects on arterial compliance might provide a common link between the effects of these conditions on both CVD and impaired cognitive function and interventions which improve arterial compliance may improve both CVD risk and cognition in older adults with obesity.
A preliminary study conducted in Manitoba showed that the consumption of1/2 cup of pulses for 8 weeks improved arterial function (arterial compliance and ankle-brachial index), body composition (BMI) and blood lipids in patients with peripheral artery  disease. Given the aforementioned associations between improved arterial function and cognitive performance, it is possible that incorporating pulses into an ad libitum diet will improve cognitive function in overweight/obese adults.
The aim of this research is to evaluate the health benefits of regular pulse consumption (100g per day) by:
a) demonstrating that the incorporation of pulses into the diet can improve cerebral vasodilator responsiveness in older overweight/obese adults who are at risk of obesity- and age-related cognitive decline and,
b) that improvements in cerebral vasodilator responsiveness are associated with improvements in cognitive and blood vessel function arising from reductions in cardiovascular disease risk factors and inflammation.</summary>
