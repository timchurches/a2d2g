A previous study on assessing vascular function in obese kids compared to kids with normal BMI reports higher peak perfusion and longer recovery time among obese kids (Schlager et al., 2011). With the effect size observed in this study, a sample size of 800 will give 90% power at 5% significance level. Therefore, we expect the proposed study to be adequately powered. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main pregnancy complications preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, small for gestational age pregnancy (SGA) and spontaneous preterm birth are associated with adverse health outcomes for the mother and offspring. Maternal preeclampsia and gestational hypertension are associated with higher blood pressure in the offspring as early as at 6 years of age and a higher risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in the offspring in adult life. Emerging evidence suggest that children born SGA or born preterm are also at a similar increased risk. 
We aim to identify early cardiovascular risk factors including obesity and vascular impairment among children aged 9-10 years.
The proposed study includes children aged between 9-10 years from the SCOPE (Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints) study. The SCOPE study was conducted in Adelaide during 2005-2008 and 1164 nulliparous pregnant women, their partners and babies were recruited. Detailed information was collected during pregnancy. Of the 1164 women in the study, 861 had uncomplicated pregnancies, 93 developed preeclampsia, 118 had gestational hypertension, 95 normotensive women delivered SGA babies and 69 delivered preterm.
We will invite all children of women recruited to the SCOPE study to participate at age 9-10 years. Data will be collected on diet, physical activity, height and weight. Haemodynamic measures will be done noninvasively as follows. Central blood pressure and augmentation index (an indicator of arterial stiffness) will be measured using the USCOMBP+. Cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance will be measured using the USCOM 1A. Microvascular function will be assessed by Post Occlusive Reactive Hyperaemia method using Laser Doppler. The results of children born after complicated pregnancies will be compared with those of children born after uncomplicated pregnancies.
