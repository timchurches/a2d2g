  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will have three arms, two intervention groups and one control group. 

Intervention: 

The interventional groups will receive an injury prevention program (IPP) session either before or after their training or match. The team will be the unit of randomisation and intervention will be delivered at the team level. Each session will be approximately 20 minutes and will have exercises are divided in to 4 stages: 1) dynamic stretching and running exercises, 2) strength and agility, 3) balance and core strength and 4) game based exercises, with a total of 14 exercises to complete. This program has specific exercises targeting the body regions most commonly injured in cricket and will not require any equipment other than regular cricket gear. The reason for this is to make this IPP accessible to all as buying additional training equipment may be difficult for some community clubs.  

Frequency and Duration: Twice a week during the season (approximately 15-20 mins for session). Needs to be done throughout the 6 month season with a minimum at least 20  weeks of delivery. 

Who delivers the sessions: The team's coach. If a team has a Physiotherapist or a Strength &amp; Conditioning coach they will deliver it. 
* Before the start of the season the team's coaching staff will be trained by the researchers on how to deliver the program. This training will be a single 2 hour workshop 4 weeks before the start of the season and a supervised 30 min session during the first week of training in the season. 

Description of exercises: There will be a total of 14 exercises which could be performed with cricket equipment. Exercises include: Hip-in and out running, lunges, vertical and lateral jumps, back extensions, push-ups, planks and its variations, 3 run sprinting with bats, shoulder external &amp; internal rotations with a bat, modified rows &amp; balance on cricket balls. 

The program will have two levels, beginner and advanced. the variations between the two are primarily a) increase in number of repetitions of an exercise by 50% in the same time i.e: increase from 6 reps to 9 reps b) modified rows are only in advanced program c) balance training done on 2 balls under each foot for beginners and of 1 ball under each foot for advanced, All participants will start with the beginner program and progression to the advanced level this will be subjective and determined by the coach by looking at their form.

Monitoring adherence: All coaches will have a log-book in which player attendance will be marked. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of injuries in the intervention groups when compared with the control group. 

The program will be conducted twice a week in the intervention group and injuries will be prospectively monitored on weekly basis.. The injuries will be monitored every week by calling the coach to find out which players got injured. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be assessed bi-weekly through the cricket season which ranges between 20-24 weeks.  *(Because some teams get knocked out early they may only play 20 weeks, others can play around 24 weeks). </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Match performance  assessed by ranking in the points ladder, number of victories, number team runs and aggregated wickets taken by the team. </outcome>

rate of 30 injuries/100 players in the control group, adjusting for cluster and an anticipated drop-out rate of 5% intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.08]. The
teams will be randomised by club. All teams in the playing region will be invited for participation. Allocation concealment will be maintained by revealing the group allocation after randomization.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cricket is the most participated summer sport in Australia. It has increased in popularity over the past decade with the Twenty20 cricket rising as the most popular form. There is growing evidence that the injury rates in junior and amateur cricketers are higher as compared to professional cricketers. Yet, at the community level there are no standardized cricket specific injury prevention programs. Other sports such as Soccer, Rugby, AFL, Basketball, etc. all have implemented such programs at community level. 
Soomro et al 2016. showed that injury prevention programs (IPPs) are an effective tool to help reduce injuries in adolescent team sports. The pooled analysis of over 100,000 athletes in this study showed that IPPs reduced the risk of injury by 32%, Injury rate ratio (IRR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.54-0.84, p &lt;0.05). These programs reduce injury risk by improving neuromuscular strength, agility and limb coordination with a combination of strength, plyometric and balance exercises.

Since majority of cricket injuries are of non-contact origin and concentrated around soft-tissues, therefore exercise based interventions and improvement of players fitness through appropriate training has been suggested to reduce such injuries. IPPs have been shown to improve strength ratios, thus reducing another contributing factor i.e. strength imbalance from the injury etiology. Considering the overwhelming evidence on the efficacy of IPPs, the development, implementation and clinically validating cricket specific IPP may potentially assist in reducing cricket related injuries. </summary>
