    <interventions>Essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is part of myelproliferative disorders (haematological malignancy) that affect usually adult patients. This disease is characterised by high platelet counts and may associated with either bleeding or clotting. There is no data available currently regarding treatment strategy or response for this cohort of patients in northern Tasmania. This study will target ET patients who are presenting at the Launceston General Hospital for a period of 12 months. Although this haematological cancer is considered relatively uncommon, an increased incidence from 1 to 3 cases/100,000 population per year was observed based on the recent WHO 2008 diagnostic criteria, taking into consideration genetic markers, mainly the JAK2-V617F mutation, in conjunction with a lower threshold of platelet levels (450/nL). ET disease is a treatable chronic disease with at least three different medications that are currently available in Australia. There is no clear records or documentation in Tasmania regarding the response rate and complications of the disease as well as toleration to these different medications. We are assessing for all patinets in the study; the full blood count, genetic abnormalities and record the response to the treatment. This will be conducted via reviewing medical data and laboratory results. The duration of the trial will be 12 months period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this retrospective study was to assess ET patients who were treated with different anti-platelet agents and to elucidate the risk factors, gender prevalence and molecular genetics within different treatment modalities for ET. This study aims to evaluate drug tolerance and response to the treatment with hydroxyurea, anagrelide, IFN a and aspirin (either alone or in combination with the three aforementioned cytoreductive therapies). Furthermore, exploratory analysis of full blood counts (FBC) and JAK2 mutation results of all patients were conducted in order to establish any correlation between these haematological indices, treatment and disease outcomes, with the purpose of aiding clinicians to recognise the best treatment approach and improve the disease outcome by using the most appropriate management.</summary>
