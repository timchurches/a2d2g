  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male/females aged between 18 and 64 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests. A
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator
             determines that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will
             not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) within the range 18 to 29.0 kilogram (kg)/meter (m)^2
             (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the
        investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as
        obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
        postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a blood
        sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 MlU/mL and
        estradiol less than 40 picogram (pg)/mL (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory. Females on
        hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required
        to use the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior
        to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

        Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic
        gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or urine hCG test prior to dosing AND Agrees to use
        one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the
        product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
        risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for 5
        terminal half-lives after the end of the study (i.e. until after the follow-up visit is
        complete).

        OR has only same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%).

          -  Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) greater than or equal to 85% predicted and
             a FEV1/ Forced Vital capacity (FVC) ratio greater than or equal to 0.7

        (2.7%), 250 mL pre-mix full strength spirit (5%), 100 mL of wine (13.5%) and 30 mL of

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GSK961081 is a novel bifunctional molecule that combines muscarinic antagonism and
      beta2-agonism in a single molecule and is in development for the treatment of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is a randomised, open-label, six-way crossover,
      single dose study. This study evaluates the drug delivery and systemic pharmacokinetics of
      GSK961081 following concurrent administration of GSK961081 and fluticasone furoate via dry
      powder inhaler (DPI) in comparison to GSK961081 DISKUS. There will be six treatment periods
      and 7 days washout period in the study. Subjects will attend the unit in the morning for
      dosing and will be resident until 12 hours post administration. All subjects will receive six
      treatments.</summary>
