    <interventions>Intervention technique in the toggle-recoil group

The toggle-recoil technique was performed, as modified by Mc Timoney. The participant was lying on the stomach. The therapist crossed the forearms and contacted the transverse processes of the fourth thoracic vertebrae (T4) with the pisiform bones. While the subject was breathing out the therapist delivered a fast posterior-anterior impulse to achieve the manipulative thrust. The thrust should be short range and fast.

A single spinal manipulation technique was performed to participants in this group.

The treatment protocol lasted for about two minutes in this group.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention technique in the dog-technique group

The subject was placed in the supine position with both arms crossed over the chest. The technique was performed as follows, being the fourth thoracic vertebrae (T4) the targeted vertebrae. 
The caudal hand of the therapist located T4 bilaterally with a fist-contact. Then, the therapist placed the other hand against the subjects elbows and added flexion and posterior slide movements to reduce the slack. The subject was asked to breathe in and while breathing out the therapist used the body to push through the subjects arms in an anterior to posterior direction impulse to deliver the high-velocity low-amplitude thrust.

Subjects in this group received a single spinal manipulation.

Intervention time in this group lasted for about two minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in self-perceived neck pain by at least 35%

A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess self-reported pain. The VAS is considered to be a valid, effective, sensitive, easy to use, and reproducible method to assess acute and chronic pain. In addition, VAS is an accurate tool to detect immediate and clinically relevant changes in pain perception.
The VAS consists of an horizontal 100mm line, that ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 mm (severe pain). The subject was asked about the current level of pain in rest position. </outcome>

Second evaluation was made 20 minutes after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in Cervical Mobility by 25%

Cervical mobility was measured using the Cervical Range of Motion Basic (CROM) tool (Performance Attainment Associates, St Paul, MN, USA).
The participant was seated in a chair with no back rest and both feet on the ground. Measurements were taken in the following order: flexion, extension, right and left side bending, right and left rotation. The CROM has been shown to have a high inter-examiner reliability, between 0.8 and 0.87. In addition, it is an easy tool to use and requires only one evaluator.
</outcome>
      <timepoint> First measurement was made immediately after intervention (2 minutes)

Second evaluation was made 20 minutes after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decrease of Mechanosensitivity in the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), fourth cervical vertebra (C4) and upper trapezius muscle by at least 20%

The pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum amount of pressure needed to evoke discomfort or pain.To measure PPT, an analogue pressure algometer (Baseline, FEI Inc., White Plains, NY, USA) was used. 

Pressure algometry was carried out with the subject seated, in the spinous process of the fourth cervical and thoracic vertebraes (C4 and T4), and in the area described for the location of the tense band of the upper trapezius muscle, in the mid-point of the distance between the acromion and the seventh cervical vertebra. 

Following previous references, the mean of three measurements was taken as the reference value. Pressure algometry has proven to be a valid tool and has shown an inter-examiner reliability of 0.91 </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There seems to be a correlation between cervical-thoracic and upper thoracic limitations in mobility and neck pain. However, there is some scarce evidence supporting the use of thoracic spinal manipulation as a therapeutic tool in subjects with cervical pain. 

Based on previous findings, the authors of the study hypothesized that, after applying a thoracic spinal manipulation technique in subjects with chronic mechanical neck pain significant improvements would be found immediately after intervention and in the short term in self-perceived neck pain, cervical mobility and sensitivity to mechanical pressure.
