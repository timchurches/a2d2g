    <statisticalmethods>In a recent pilot study, the use of Chewing Gum decreased the incidence of PONV from 75% to 39%. However we believe we should take a conservative view and hypothesize a smaller decrease from 75% to 50%. We Estimate 90 patients will be needed to have 80% power at an alpha of 0.05 for significance. 

Variables will be assessed for normality and log transformed if appropriate. Baseline comparisons will be performed using Fischer's exact tests and reported as n(%). Continuous normally distributed variables will be compared using Student t-tests and reported as medians [interquartile range]. Comparison of ordinal outcomes will be by means of Fisher's exact test. A P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication that may cause significant morbidity. It is usually treated with anti-emetics. Recently, Chewing Gum (GC) showed similar level of efficacy to ondansetron in a pilot controlled trial of surgical patients. Moreover, CG has bee shown to reduce postoperative gut malfunction and vomiting after colorectal surgery However, to date, CG has not bee studied in the prevention of PONV in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Thus we aim to perform a study to evaluate the comparative effect of CG compared with the effects of taking a 20 ml sip of water in the prevention of PONV in patients admitted to the ICU after major surgery. 
Patients will be randomly allocated to be given sugarless plain CG or a 20 ml sip of water 4 hourly for 24 hours. The nurse looking after the patient will record the effects of the intervention on the presence of nausea, its duration, and severity using a visual analogue scale every 4 hours. The number of episodes of vomiting and retching will be recorded. Rescue anti-emetic therapy if the nausea is rated &gt; 5, or if vomiting has occurred. Nausea and vomiting assessments will be made 30 minutes after the patient had been given rescue medication. 
If the CG intervention proves effective, it will represent an important and easily deployed, safe step towards making the patient's post-operative period less distressing.</summary>
