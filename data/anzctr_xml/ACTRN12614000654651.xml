  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a major health problem which is becoming increasingly costly to individuals and society. It is a major risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular and liver disease, sleep apnoea, some cancers and osteoarthritis. Despite obesity research being a priority area, current prevention is having little impact at a population level as obesity rates are increasing and treatment programs are generally seen as ineffective because there is little weight lost, or there is weight regain. Pharmacotherapy to reduce hunger improves weight loss, particularly when combined with lifestyle intervention.
This study involves using dexamphetamine (DEX), an old drug that is cheap and has been shown to be effective for losing weight. The dose will be titrated in a way that is highly innovative in terms of the treatment of obesity but is supported by decades of experience in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Its complications are already known and are almost exclusively dose dependent. DEX has the potential to provide a cheap and effective alternative to the currently available expensive anorexigenic medications and surgical treatment. 
The project is designed to test a) whether DEX is safe and more effective than placebo for treating obesity complicated by obstructive sleep apnoea over a six month period and b) whether weight loss can be sustained for 2 years after ceasing the study drug.
