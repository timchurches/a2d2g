  <interventions>
    <interventions>Series of seven weekly sessions of Healing Touch treatments delivered in the participant's home.  All sessions delivered by the same Level 4 trained Healing Touch registered nurse. 
Treatment time generally averaged 30 min, with rare exceptions of 20 minutes for 2 participants who could not tolerate supine position on massage table, and with 0-1 of 7 treatments in each participant's series extending beyond 30 min to a maximum of 40 minutes, depending on the technique being used for that treatment session.


Healing Touch is an energy-based therapy that uses gentle touch on or above the body in particular locations in a specific sequence that differs for each of the 35 techniques within the established curriculum certified by the American Holistic Nurses Association.  A different technique was used each week.  

Participants in both the intervention group and the comparator group were settled on to a massage table provided by the Healing Touch Nurse, and positioned with pillows for comfort and proper anatomical alignment, fully clothed except shoes.   A lightweight sheet was placed over the participant for comfort and to prevent tactile perception of the provider's skin versus the placebo touch, after which a soft sleeping mask and ear plugs (to reduce sensory interruption and to maintain masking to group allocation) were applied by the Healing Touch Nurse.  Techniques were chosen based on taking a short history at each home visit, and on an energetic assessment. Vital signs were taken before and after each treatment session for both groups.</interventions>
    <comparator>Series of seven weekly sessions of mimic healing touch (placebo) treatments delivered in the participant's home, delivered by the same provider as active treatment, to preserve participant blinding.  Treatment time generally averaged 30 min, with the rare exception of 15 -20 minutes for 1 participant who could not tolerate lying still with the sleeping mask applied for longer than 15 -20 minutes related to anxiety issues.

Participants in both the intervention group and the comparator group were settled on to a massage table provided by the Healing Touch Nurse, and positioned with pillows for comfort and proper anatomical alignment, fully clothed except shoes. A lightweight sheet was placed over the participant for comfort and to prevent tactile perception of the provider's skin versus the placebo touch, after which a soft sleeping mask and ear plugs (to reduce sensory interruption and to maintain masking to group allocation) were applied by the Healing Touch Nurse.  

Mimic techniques were done after taking a short history at each home visit.  Vital signs were taken before and after each treatment session for both groups.

A repertoire of 10 placebo techniques were created and administered by the same Healing Touch Nurse, to preserve participant blinding to group allocation. A different technique was used each week, as occurred for the Intervention group. Techniques were given the same names as actual Healing Touch techniques to preserve participant blinding in case they observed the Healing Touch Nurse making chart notations or spoke to other participants in the study.  Typically mimic direct touch techniques at one treatment session were alternated  with indirect touch mimic techniques at the next treatment session, to preserve participant blinding to group allocation.

Placebo techniques simulated both direct touch and indirect touch. Direct touch was simulated by the placement of soft leather gloves filled with an inert material to mimic the weight and texture of the provider's hands, and kept in place for 5 minutes in locations on the body not used for actual Healing Touch techniques, in a pre-determined sequence for each placebo technique, always placed with the top sheet between the participant's clothed body and the gloves. 

Indirect touch was simulated by the use of an A5 size laminated booklet (Healing Touch Technique Review Cards produced by the Colorado Center for Healing Touch), which were used in a gently sweeping motion around the participant's body, in a pre-determined sequence for each created placebo technique, with one sweep approximately every minute. 

In addition, the Healing Touch Nurse refrained from the usual practice of grounding, centering and attuning to the participant prior to administering the placebo techniques, and purposefully engaged in unrelated cognitive functions to avoid any inadvertent focus on the participant at hand.</comparator>

      <outcome>Vital Signs: temperature, pulse, respirations, systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Temperature was assessed using a digital oral thermometer. Blood pressures were obtained by use of a stethoscope and an analog syphgnomanometer on the left arm only. Pulse and respiratory rates were obtained by placement of the stethoscope on the participant's upper chest, counting for 30 seconds for pulse and then another 30 seconds for respirations, and then doubling the rates to obtain a rate per minute for charting. Participants were told their heartbeat was being counted, but were not told their breaths per minute were being counted, to avoid conscious alteration of respiratory rate.</outcome>
