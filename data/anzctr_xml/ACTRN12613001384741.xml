Previous studies by our group have shown that the gastrokinetic effects of drugs are substantially altered by changes in glycaemia.  In this study we wish to determine the pairwise difference between the four  study days as the primary endpoint. However, it would be of substantial interest to estimate the interaction between glycaemia and GLP-1.  In particular to compare (i) placebo-hyperglycaemia vs. GLP-1 hyperglycaemia (ii) GLP-normoglycaemia vs. GLP-1-hyperglycaemia.  Given the complexity of the power calculation we have discussed the sample size with a biostatistician.  With a sample sizes of 10 the minimum detectable differences is 9 minutes. This is using a significance level of 0.01 to account for an adjustment for multiple post-hoc testing across the other comparisons that we are interested in.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The major mechanism of action of GLP-1 agonists in lowering post-prandial glycaemia is their ability to slow gastric emptying. Acute hyperglycaemia itself is known to slow gastric emptying substantially and it is likely that many patients will be hyperglycaemic at the time of GLP-1 administration. If GLP-1 does not further slow gastric emptying during marked hyperglycaemia then it is likely the agonists will have only a minimal effect to attenuate postprandial glycaemia. The latter observation would support a rationale to reserve GLP-1 agonists until fasting glycaemia is reduced, eg. by initial insulin therapy, whereas if the hypothesis is rejected then GLP-1 agonists would be a rational choice as single agents even in patients with marked fasting hyperglycaemia. Accordingly, it is important to determine whether hyperglycaemia per se affects the capacity for GLP-1 to slow gastric emptying.</summary>
