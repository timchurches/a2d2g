  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sixty NSW primary schools will be randomised to either a one day intervention or control. Students in grades 2 and 3 attending the intervention schools will wear their sports uniform for one day (when they would normally wear a traditional uniform) and which is not their scheduled sports day. The one day that the students wear their sports uniform will be randomly allocated. Teachers will be asked to note which students forget to wear uniform on the particular day. Nothing else will be required of schools or students. Students in control schools will continue with normal uniform practices for the school week. </interventions>

    <concealment>Schools will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention or control group via a central randomisation process by computer Block randomisation will be employed to ensure group allocation is approximately equal. Data collectors will be blind to group allocation. Due to the nature of the intervention school staff will be aware of their group allocation. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this randomised control trial is to evaluate whether students, in particular girls, are more active during the school day if they are wearing their sports uniform as opposed to their normal formal uniform. Sixty primary schools in the Hunter Region and Mid North Coast will be randomly allocated to an intervention or control group. </summary>
