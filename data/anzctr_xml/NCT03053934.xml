    <interventions>Behaviour - Online video-based counselling
Behaviour - Traditional in-person counselling

Active Comparator: Traditional in-person - Participants randomised to this arm will receive traditional in-person counselling (i.e., treatment will be conducted with the client and clinician occupying the same physical location/room)

Experimental: Online counselling - Participants randomised to this arm will receive treatment from a clinician via videoconferencing (i.e., communication between the client and clinician will occur via webcam)


Behaviour: Online video-based counselling
Videoconferencing facilitates communication between individuals (i.e., the counsellor and the client) in different geographical locations enabling them to interact simultaneously with each other on a computer monitor in real time. In other words, both the client and the therapist communicate live using both visual and audio aids simulating in-person therapy albeit from two separate geographical locations.

Behaviour: Traditional in-person counselling
Traditional in-person counselling is often referred to as "face-to-face" and can be loosely defined as any mental health intervention, whereby the clinician is in the same room with a client. The terms "in-person" and "same room" are used less frequently, but it has been argued that these terms are more descriptive (since in videoconferencing, clients are also seen "face-to-face" on screen). Therefore, the current study uses the term "in-person" to describe traditional, face-to-face counselling.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Group x Time Interaction for overall mental health as measured by the K10 from baseline to 16-week follow up - 0 to 16 week difference in K10 scores in group x time interaction. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) (Kessler et al., 2002) is a 10-item questionnaire intended to yield a global measure of distress based on questions about anxiety and depressive symptoms that a person has experienced in the most recent 4-week period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8-week follow-up, 16-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Group x Time Interaction for the Outcome Rating Scale from baseline to 16-week follow up - 0 to 16 week difference in ORS scores in group x time interaction. The Outcome Rating Scale (ORS, Miller, Duncan, Brown, Sparks, &amp; Claud, 2003) will also be administered at all three time points. This is a 4-item self-report inventory that measures three different dimensions of client functioning generally considered as valid indicators of treatment progress: individual (or symptomatic) functioning, interpersonal relationships, and social role performance (work adjustment, quality of life).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8-week follow-up, 16-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Group x Time Interaction for Quality of Life from baseline to 16-week follow up - 0 to 16 week difference in AQoL-8D scores in group x time interaction. The Assessment of Quality of Life-8D (AQoL-8D, Richardson et al., 2014) is a 35-item measure of health related quality of life which is sensitive to mental health issues, and is suitable for calculation of QALYs.
This measure is to be administered at all three data collection points, however, due to the length of this measure, it would be too time consuming for participants to complete this measure over the telephone. Therefore, this measure will only be completed by participants who complete the assessment online.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8-week follow-up, 16-week follow-up (only administered to participants completing the survey online)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Therapeutic (or Working) Alliance - The Working Alliance Inventory - Short Revised (WAI-SR). This is a 12-item form of the WAI (Horvath &amp; Greenberg, 1989). It is a self-report inventory that measures the quality of the therapeutic relationship from the client's perspective.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8-week follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Client Satisfaction - The NHS Friends and Family Test (FFT). This is a single-item measure used to help service providers understand whether their clients are satisfied with the service provided.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8-week follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Client and Clinician Experiences - Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted on clients and clinicians to further investigate their respective experiences with the form of treatment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 months post-treatment</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the study is to establish whether online video counselling is at least
      equally acceptable and equally as effective to clients and clinicians of the Veterans and
      Veterans Families Counselling Service (VVCS) as in-person counselling. If this is confirmed
      by the evaluation then online video counselling can be made more widely available to support
      the veteran and ex-service community, especially for those who may otherwise be unable to
      attend therapy and for clients who would prefer such web-based services over in-person
      sessions.</summary>
