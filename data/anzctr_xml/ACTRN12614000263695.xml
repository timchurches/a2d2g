  <interventions>
    <interventions>The recruited patient will have a transperineal ultrasound scan performed in order to determine the position of Tension Free Vaginal Tape - Obturator (TVT-O).  This is a non-invasive procedure with no radiation exposure. The whole scan process will last for around 15 minutes. The recruited patient will have 2 scans after insertion of TVT-O treatment at post-operative 3rd and 6th months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The position of TVT-O in relation to urethra by perineal ultrasonography. During the scan, the distance between the tape and urethral longitudinal smooth muscle will be measured. Furthermore, the length of tape span in relation to the urethral length will also be measured.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The associated post-operative voiding symptom in relation to position of TVT-O determined by perineal ultrasounography. These data will be collected via Demographic and voiding symptom questionnaire. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient subjective satisfaction in relation to position of TVT-O determined by perineal ultrasonography. These data will be collected via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life improvement in relation to position of TVT-O determined by perineal ultrasonography. These data will be collected via the validated Incontinence impact questionnaire 7 (IIQ7) in Chinese format.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is carried out in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Queen Elizabeth Hospital. We will try to recruit all women presented with Udodynamic stress incontinence with Tension free vaginal tape - obturator done for joining this study. 
Before the development of perineal ultrasound, the position of TVT-O is only determined by clinical experience and whether the post-operative voiding symptom is related or not is again determined by clinical experience. This study designed to determine the position of TVT-O at 3 and 6 months post-operatively and hence determine the associated urinary symptoms in order to study the relationship between the tape position and post-operative voiding symptoms.</summary>
