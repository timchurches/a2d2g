    <interventions>Study Drugs are dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL). One group was treated with Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) over 3 days and another group is treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) over 3 days for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In a separate group of patients with P. vivax malaria, DP was also used for treatment. 

DP (oral tablet) with a dose of 4mg/kg for D and 20mg/kg for P daily over 3 days based on weight band

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated falciparum and vivax malaria. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 3 sites Pailin, Pursat and Rattanakiri provinces, Cambodia.  The WHO 28-day and 42-day in vivo protocol was used.  Patients with uncomplicated P.f or P.v malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria were enrolled and treated on site with DP or AL and monitored weekly for 28 days for P.v cases and 42 days for P.f cases. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients were classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period were used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis were used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection.  The results of this study are being used to assist the Ministry of Health of Cambodia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. f and P.v malaria.</summary>
