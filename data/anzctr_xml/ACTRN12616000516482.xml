    <designfeatures>Dose-ranging pharmacokinetic study. Participants will be administered increasing doses of vaporised botanical cannabis flower bud (Bedrobinol 13.5% THC) for a period of 7 days, administered by vaporisation three times daily 60 minutes before meals, with dose increments daily</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints: 
Pharmacokinetic assays will use high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma concentrations and efficacy parameters (NRS appetite) will also be used to develop a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model using NONMEM (Registered Trademark) VII software, which incorporates inter-individual and residual unexplained variability. Patient factors contributing to the parameter variability will be modelled using standard forward-inclusion/backward deletion methods. Model section will be based on the objective function value and standard diagnostic plots. The final model will be evaluated through visual predictive checks and bootstrap analysis. The developed model will be utilised to determine the relationship between dose-concentration-effect and the factors influencing this. Monte Carlo simulations will be conducted to simulate dosing regimens and target exposure values and will identify appropriate dosing strategies for employment in the proposed phase III study that are most likely to meet therapeutic targets.

Feasibility endpoints; 
feasibility data will be summarised by descriptive statistics for all endpoints. Frequency counts and percentages will be used for categorical variables, and mean, range, interquartile range and 95 % confidence interval of mean for continuous variables. Outcomes and complications will be summarised across the range of concentrations seen in this study.

Sample size:
Statistical comparisons of pharmacokinetic parameters between patients classified as therapeutic and non-therapeutic (according to appetite and Quality of Life (QoL efficacy assessments) will be conducted in order to determine the relationship between drug exposure and effect; a sample size of 30 patients has been selected to examine this objective. Previous research has indicated that 36% is a reliable estimate of inter-subject variability in THC area-under-the-curve values; therefore, in order to detect a 40% difference in exposure (area under the curve) between the groups, at 80% power and an a-level of 0.05, a sample size of 30 patients is considered sufficient, allowing for a 90% retention rate.
Based on the proposed Phase III sample size (n=246), and using published methods to determine feasibility study sample sizes, a sample size of 30 for this phase I/II study also allows reasonable estimation of feasibility and percentage completion of study protocol and measures</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether a vaporised form of medicinal cannabis is feasible and effective in increasing appetite in cancer patients with anorexia. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible for this trial if you are aged 18 or over, have an advanced cancer and have been suffering from anorexia for at least two weeks. 
Study details: Participants will receive a range of doses of vaporised botanical cannabis flower bud one hour before your meals (three times a day) for 7 days unless side effects occur. Each dose may be different from the previous dose, but they will all be made up to the same weight of plant material by adding different amounts of inactive plant material (placebo, which has the same characteristics of leaf cannabis with the active components removed).   Participants will have blood samples taken at multiple timepoints up to 4 hours following each morning dose and will complete a number of questionnaires and a daily food record to determine the concentration of the drug in the blood, and to monitor its effect on appetite, mood and other factors. 
It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether inhalation of medicinal cannabis is feasible for achieving a safe and effective blood concentration for the treatment of anorexia in cancer patients.
