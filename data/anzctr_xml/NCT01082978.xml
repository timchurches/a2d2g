Treatment: devices - Paper Portable Health File

Experimental: Electronic (USB) Portable Health File - Patients randomized to this arm of the trial will be given a USB memory device that contains the Portable Health File (PHF) software. The portable health files contained core medical data which functions as a subset of a comprehensive medical record. The portable health file is updated by the health care provider at each visit and could also be updated by patient between visits if necessary.

Experimental: Paper Portable Health File - Patients randomized to this arm of the trial will be given the paper Portable Health File. The paper Portable Health File contains core medical and other important data which functions as a subset of a more comprehensive medical record. This paper-based portable health file is updated by health care providers at each visit. The PHF can also be updated by patient between visits.

No Intervention: Usual standard of care - Patients randomized to this arm of the trial will not be given a Portable Health File. This arm is the concurrent control comparator arm.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Combined endpoint of deaths, hospitalisations (excepting day only hospitalisations), and serious out-of-hospital events - The primary outcome is the total number of important clinical events (all hospitalisations except same-day hospitalisations, all serious out-of-hospital events and deaths).
See above: The assigned treatment (i.e., the e-PHF or p-PHF) will be used for 4 years total. Patients will also be followed for an additional 3 years beyond the conclusion of the randomised trial to see if there are any longer-term lag effects.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The PHF trial will assess the acceptability and long term outcomes resulting from the usage
      of electronic (carried by the patient on a USB memory device) and paper portable health files
      in a population with high intensity use of medical services. The rationale is that use of the
      portable health files provides a conduit of direct communication among health care providers
      of a patient's important health care information and this leads to better care and patient
      outcomes.

      Primary hypothesis: Addition of a patient-held portable health file (PHF) to usual care
      improves patient outcome and quality-of-life compared to usual care alone.

      Secondary hypothesis: Addition of patient-held portable health file (PHF) to usual care is
      acceptable and satisfactory to patients and their health care providers.</summary>
