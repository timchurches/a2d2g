  <interventions>
    <interventions>Human Papilloma Virus DNA Assessment and Sperm DNA Fragmentation Investigation will be performed on sperm samples of patients with history of recurrent pregnancy loss and/or recurrent implantation failure. After having informed consent, 250 microL of sperm sample will be reserved from each participant on the day of oocyte retrieval for HPV DNA and DNA fragmentation assessment. HPV DNA will be determined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using commercial kit. If the sample get diagnosed as positive for HPV, genotyping will be performed. Sperm DNA fragmentation (damage) will be analyzed using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay with commercial kit. Correlation between HPV status and DNA fragmentation of the sperm sample will be determined and further correlation analysis regarding IVF/ICSI cycle outcomes and sperm assessments will be discussed. Total duration of the study will be approximately 6 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is going to evaluate the correlation of HPV-DNA existence in sperm samples and infertility.Also, relationship between HPV infection and sperm DNA damage will be examined. In the literature, limited number of studies evaluating HPV positivity and infertility relation reported higher number of HPV positive male cases in infertile population compared with not-infertile cohort. Additionally, abortion rates are more common and on-going pregnancy rates are lower in patients (both male and female) with HPV infection in the literature. In summary, HPV infection may impair fertility with several mechanisms and should have to be elucidated especially in infertile cohort. This study aims to evaluate the relation between HPV infection and fertility outcomes in IVF/ICSI cycles and also aims to evaluate the relation between HPV infection and sperm DNA damage in this study population. More prospective studies are needed to support routine use of HPV DNA examination in infertile population. </summary>
