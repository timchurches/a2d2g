  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a 3 year multicenter, randomized, double-masked controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an Intravitreal Fluocinolone Acetonide (0.59 and 2.1 mg) implant in patients with unilateral or bilateral non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye.  Eligible subjects will receive either a 0.59mg or 2.1mg implant (assigned according to a randomization code) surgically inserted in one eye. In patients with bilateral disease, the more severely affected eye will be implanted.
Subjects will be followed for a period of 3 years, the approximate time period over which the implants are designed to release FA.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy outcome in this trial is the proportion of patients who suffer a recurrence of uveitis in the study eye within 34 weeks following implantation vs proportion of patients who suffered a recurrence in the 34 weeks preceding implantation. 
Assessment based on presence or absence of statistically significant difference (two-tailed, alpha =0.05)</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary efficacy outcomes consist of recurrence rates and time-to-failure in study vs fellow eyes, changes to the adjunctive treatment required to control uveitis, proportion of patients with improvement of visual acuity, cystoid macula edema, treatment dose effects on recurrence rates and time-to-failure, and improvement in QOL survey scores.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The analysis of efficacy and safety will take place when all subjects have completed a 34-week period post implantation and reviewed at 1, 2 and 3 years post implantation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety variables include: Proportion of eyes with IOP control issues i.e. IOP&gt;25mmHg and &lt;6mmHg, Increase in lens opacity by 2 grades from baseline, reduction of &gt;10dB in visual field defect mean deficit, adverse events, concomitant medication, changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory values, visual acuity and ophthalmoscopic examination findings. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The analysis of efficacy and safety will take place when all subjects have completed a 34-week period post implantation and reviewed at 1, 2 and 3 years post implantation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
