  <interventions>
    <interventions>People will be screened via telephone and undergo radiographic evaluation. Baseline testing will be performed at the University of Melbourne and the participant randomised into one of two groups: (i) hip strengthening; (ii) no strengthening control. The intervention will last for 12 weeks after which all participants will be reassessed by the same blinded assessor.  

The exercise intervention will comprise 7 visits over 12 weeks to one of 7 physiotherapists located around Melbourne plus home exercises five times weekly. A comprehensive exercise manual will be produced. Programs comprise standardized progressive strengthening exercises but the physiotherapist will individually determine the repetitions (up to 10), sets (up to 2) and resistance  depending on the persons pain level and response. Resistance will be obtained from cuff weights to the ankle and theraband. These will also be provided for home use. The exercises will comprise sidelying hip abduction, hip abduction and adduction in standing with theraband, and isometric hip adduction squeezes.
