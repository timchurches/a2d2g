  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administration of eribulin mesylate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 as an IV bolus infusion over 2-5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle, where the duration of each cycle is 21 days. Treatment will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment of Physician's choice:
1. Vinorelbine or 
2. Gemcitabine or
3. Docetaxel or
4. Pemetrexed (nonsquamous histology only).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival measured from the date of randomisation until date of death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be performed when the target number of events
(~425 deaths) has been observed; this is estimated to take approximately 31 months from the start of the Randomization Phase assuming an accrual rate of 20 subjects per month.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare progression-free survival (PFS) between Arm A and Arm B.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be followed up from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression, or date of death, whichever occurs first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Histologically or Cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC
2. Advanced NSCLC not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy, with radiological evidence of disease progression following the last anti-cancer treatment.
3. Presence of Measurable Tumour Disease
4. Confirmation of the presence or absence of EGFR mutations prior to study enrolment. However, subjects with unknown EGFR status and who have received prior treatment with an EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) can be enrolled.
5. Subjects must have received at least two prior regimens of treatment for advanced NSCLC, which should have included a platinum based treatment and in subjects with tumours harbouring EGFR mutations, an EGFR TKI.
6. ECOG performance status 0,1 or 2
7. Adequate Liver, Renal and Bone marrow functions.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Subjects who have received any anti-cancer therapy within 14 days, or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer), prior to randomization
2. Subjects who have not recovered from toxicities as a result of prior anti-cancer therapy to less than Grade 2
3. Subjects who have previously been treated, or participated in a study with eribulin, whether treated with eribulin or not. The TPC option must not include the same agent which the subject received in a prior regimen
4. Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy more than CTCAE
Grade 2
5. Significant cardiovascular impairment
6. Subjects with a high probability of Long QT Syndrome
7. Subjects with active brain or subdural metastases</exclusivecriteria>
