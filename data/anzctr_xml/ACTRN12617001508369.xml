  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of:
1. Three training modules of approximately 3 hours duration. These will be offered on an on-line platform (Smart Sparrow) which is an interactive eLearning courseware used at the University of NSW. Both GPs and practice nurses  will access these modules in their own time. These will  focus on the principles of health literacy and clinical weight management. The modules will also overview study protocols and processes including patient enrolment , the process for conducting health assessments, registering patients with the lifestyle app (My SNAPP), and procedures to ensure patients are followed up and referred to Get Healthy telephone counselling. 
2. A medical record audit of practice data performed using Doctors Control Panel (DCP) software. We will use a de-identified audit to illustrate the completeness of practice recording of risk factors and the same variables will be collected on eligible, consenting patients at baseline, 12 months and 18 months. This will be managed by the Field Research Officer (FRO) . 
3. Three practice facilitation visits will be provided by a trained facilitator from a local Primary Health Network (PHN). Each face to face visit will be of 1-1.5hrs duration and provided at intervals during the 6-month intervention period. The aim of the practice facilitation is to support general practices in the intervention arm of the HeLP trial to implement effective preventive care which is tailored to the needs of, and develops the knowledge and skills of overweight patients with low health literacy. Facilitators will receive training on the delivery of the sessions and will document these using a facilitator diary.
4. A health check visit for eligible and consenting patients will be undertaken within 4 weeks of recruitment performed by the Practice Nurse. This will utilise the 5As framework (assess, advise, agree, assist and arrange) and cover the following: 
Assess -	Review baseline BMI, waist circumference, diet and physical activity, cardiovascular and diabetes risk, language and health literacy. 
Advise/ Agree - Provide brief advice using video vignettes; check patient understanding using teach-back method; download and log into My SNAPP (an app developed for the trial available on smart phone and tablet); work with each patient to register for the app, set up their profile and instruct them on the use of the app. 
Assist - Introduce the Get Healthy telephone coaching program to the patient, (outline purpose of the program and details about participation).  If the patient wants to participate, assisted referral is made to the program in the presence of the patient. Get Healthy will provide tailored patient lifestyle coaching over 10 one-hour sessions. Coaches are trained by Get Healthy to deliver coaching sessions.
Arrange - Arrange follow up communication and a second visit with the practice nurse at 6 weeks and with the GP at 12 weeks. A 12 month review will be provided by the GP.

Fidelity of the intervention will be assessed by the following measures:
	% of intervention patients who receive health check at baseline, 6 week reviews by the practice nurse and 12 week review by the GP
	Usage of My SNAPP determined by Healthy.me captured analytics (% of patients with documented goals related to lifestyle change; usage data including number of times app accessed; number of pages accessed)
	% who received assisted referral to the Get Healthy telephone counselling service (English speaking/Arabic speaking)
	% of patients who take up (one or more sessions) of the Get Healthy telephone coaching program (English speaking/Arabic speaking)
	% of patients who complete the Get Healthy program (English speaking/Arabic speaking). Completion is defined as completing six of the 10 allocated sessions)

      <outcome>eHealth literacy

eHealth literacy assessed using the e Health Literacy Scale (eHeals) delivered by a researcher using a telephone interview. The eHEALS is an 8-item measure of eHealth literacy developed to measure consumers combined knowledge, comfort, and perceived skills at finding, evaluating, and applying electronic health information to health problems.  </outcome>

      <outcome>Cost of the intervention. We will use MBS and PBS data and public hospital data from the State Health Departments to assess the cost of the intervention. The MBS, PBS and State data will capture most primary care costs. Non-charged PN visits will be assigned an hourly rate based on PN salary levels plus on-costs. Questions on patient costs in accessing lifestyle services and programs, and non-Medicare funded allied health will be included in the patient questionnaire. Cost estimates will be generated for referrals to community based programs. In the base case analysis, undertaken from a health service perspective, referrals to allied health professionals will only be costed if supported by a Medicare claim. The incremental costs of the intervention, will be presented alongside the consequences with respect to changes in quality of life (in the form of QALY gains informed by the EQ5D-5L) and differences in health literacy, behavioural outcomes, and clinical measures (BMI, blood pressure and Lipids). Deterministic and bootstrapped sensitivity analyses will be undertaken to identify key uncertain parameters and represent uncertainty around the mean estimates, respectively.</outcome>

    <summary>Being overweight or obese increases the chance of a person developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. This study aims to help these people find and use relevant health information to improve their diet, increase the amount of physical activity they do, and generally improve their health, thereby preventing the development of chronic disease. 

We are conducting this study in general practice because most Australians routinely visit their general practitioner (GP). We will be supporting GPs and practice nurses (PNs) to provide a smart phone/tablett app (SNAPP) that will allow each person to monitor aspects of their health like their weight, blood pressure and cholesterol and to track changes in these over time. Each person will receive individualised information, advice and support that will help them to set some achievable goals around lifestyle change. Each person will also be offered ten sessions of confidential telephone based counseling over a three month period. Nurses will guide this process and make assisted referrals for patients so they can access the help they want.

Our research has shown a need for this type of program and previous results suggest that these programs can create lasting health benefits. This study aims to provide a non- judgemental approach and provide the assistance and advice needed to improve motivation, to stay on track and achieve individual goals.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of a primary care based preventive care intervention. The intervention is tailored to the needs of, and develops the knowledge and skills of overweight or obese patients with low health literacy.

The overarching research question is:
Can an eHealth intervention tailored to low health literacy and targeted at overweight and obese individuals from general practice change: 

a) Patients general health literacy and eHealth literacy?
b) Physiological risk factors?
c) Lifestyle behaviours  smoking diet, alcohol and physical activity? 
d) The preventive care they receive in general practice from GPs and PNs and their adherence to planned care?

PRIMARY HYPOTHESES: 
1. Compared to those attending control general practices, overweight or obese patients who attend intervention practices will, at 6 and 12 months: 
a) Increase health literacy related to preventive care by 10% at 6 and 12 months
b) Increased self-reported physical activity and daily fruit and vegetable intake by 10% at 6 and 12 months 
c) Decrease physiological risk factors by 7%: weight, blood pressure, at 12 months
These changes will be greater for intervention group patients with lower than those with higher health literacy.

    <publicnotes>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial We aim to recruit 40 practices (20 in each arm) and 1600 patients belonging to those practices (800 each arm). The target numbers refer to patients and not practices. We are targeting 5 LGAs in NSW (Canterbury, Liverpool, Fairfield, Bankstown and Campbelltown) and 5 LGAs in Adelaide (Playford, Port Adelaide/Enfield, Onkaparinga, Charles Sturt and Salisbury).</publicnotes>
