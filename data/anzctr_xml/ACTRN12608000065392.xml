  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention consists of footwear, orthoses, exercise and general podiatric care:  
The study runs for 1 year from baseline assessment. 
All interventions will be for 1 year except for the exercise program which is for 6 months. 

(i) Footwear - assessment  of current footwear, and if required, financial assistance in purchasing footwear more appropriate footwear  

(ii) Orthoses - customised insoles of preformed EVA insoles with poron padding to accommodate plantar lesions  

(iii) Home based exercise program  consisting of stretching exercises for the ankle and 1st metatarsophalangeal joints and strengthening exercises for the ankle  and toe plantarflexor muscles. The exercise program will be performed three times a week for 6 months (from baseline to follow up assessment). The program will be 30 minutes long with approxiamtely 20 minutes of strengthening and 10 minutes of stretching.  

(iv) General podiatric care consisting of nail trimming and callus and corn reduction every 8 weeks for 1 year</interventions>
