  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.An intravenous intervention of 0.025mg/Kg Zoledronic Acid (ZA) at each visit, the first being within 4 weeks of screening, then at 3 monthly intervals, (5 doses). 
2.The calculated dose of reconstituted ZA will be diluted in 50ml of (0.9%) Normal Saline and infused over 30 minutes. The maximum dose to be given is 2 mg/infusion. 
3. Vitamin D 400 International Units (IU) oral capsule supplementation daily for 15 months for duration of study

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if 12 months of intravenous zoledronic acid improves femoral head sphericity in children and adolescents with Perthes disease. Deformity Index (DI) using Anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the pelvis the DI compares the affected hip to the unaffected side. All measurements performed blinded at 24 months by a single observer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 24 months following randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if 12 months of intravenous zoledronic acid improves hip function and pain in children and adolescents with Perthes disease. Assessment using the modified Harris Hip Score and Faces Pain Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3,6,9,12,18 and 24 months visits.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety of 12 months of intravenous zoledronic acid in children and adolescents with Perthes disease. Measured by: 1. Biochemistry and Haematology: urea, electrolytes, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and full blood count. Urine-Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin or Pregnancy Test (BHCG). Analysis will occur at the local treatment centre and be performed only on the intervention group (B) Mineral homeostasis and Bone turnover markers: 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), Serum Osteocalcin, Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase, aminoterminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP), serum collagen-type I Ntelopeptides (NTX). These will be performed in both intervention (Group B) and control group (Group A) 2. Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA scan): Lumbar spine, total body and bilateral femoral neck will be assessed. The magnitude of any increase in bone mass from ZA will be recorded. If age matched z-score for total body or lumbar spine becomes &gt;3.0 ZA therapy will be discontinued. These will be performed in both intervention (Group B) and control group. (Group A) 3. Bone Age: There is a known delay in bone age in Perthes Disease. Radiographs will be evaluated by a single investigator. This will be performed in both intervention (Group A) and control group Group B) 4. Pelvic X-Ray.This will be performed in both intervention (Group A) and control group Group B) 4. Auxology: Height and Weight </outcome>
      <timepoint>Biochemistry and Haemotology: Baseline, 6,12 and 24 months visit. DXA Scan: Baseline, 12 and 24 months visit. Bone Age: Baseline, 12 and 24 months visit. X-Ray: Baseline,,12 and 24 months visit. Height and Weight: Baseline, 6,12 and 24 months visit. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomised study that will investigate the safety and effacy of intravenous Zoledronic Acid and standard care compared to Standard Care in children and young adolescents, diagnosed with Perthes Disease.
The hypothesis is that 12 months of intravenous zoledronic acid will retard femoral head collapse resulting in: improved femoral head sphericity at 24 months and improved hip function and reduced hip pain at 24 months</summary>
