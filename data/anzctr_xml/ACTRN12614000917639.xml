  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants underwent cough reflex testing (CRT) before intubation and after extubation for coronary artery bypass grafting.  This study was observational.
CRT is performed by asking the participant to inhale nebulised citric acid.  The citric acid is presented via face mask.  The participant is instructed to "try not to cough".  If the participant produced a cough on 2 out of 3 trials their cough was considered present.  Three concentrations of citric acid, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.2 mol/L, were interspersed with normal saline trials to establish each participant's baseline.
Baseline CRT was performed before surgery and follow-up CRT was performed within two hours of extubation and then every morning and evening until the participant had a present cough at baseline level, withdrew or was discharged from hospital.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The study population is patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic surgery at Wellington Hospital.  This is a single cohort observational study.  With 100 participants the study will have 90% power to estimate the proportion of patients whose cough reflex has diminished with a measurement error of +/- 10% (Stata/IC 11.2, StataCorp LP, Texas, USA). 
The average time post-extubation of each follow-up and the
percentage of participants with cough response present at baseline level at each follow-up will be calculated.Time to cough response present for each participant will be plotted using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log rank tests performed to evaluate for significance between groups with an a priori significance level set at .05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants undergoing CABG had a baseline cough reflex test (CRT) before surgery/intubation.  The CRT was repeated within two hours of extubation.  Participants with no change for their baseline had no further testing as cough was considered unchanged.  Participants with absent cough were retested every morning and evening until baseline cough returned or the participant withdrew, was discharged or died.  The cough reflex is an important airway clearance mechanism that protects the airway from aspiration.  The researchers wanted to determine how long patients' cough is absent after intubation and if any variables are predictive of recovery.</summary>
