  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of 12 weeks supplementation with a commercially available polyphenol-rich seaweed extract, called Maritech Synergy.  
The extract will be consumed in the form of oral tablets, in a dose of 2000 mg extract (containing 600 mg polyphenols) taken daily, over the course of 12 weeks.
Adherence will be assessed by collecting used tablet boxes from participants and counting the leftover tablets, as well as through the use of a check off chart.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator consists of 12 weeks supplementation with a placebo.
The placebo will be taken in identical oral tablets, but will contain rice flour in a dose of 2000 mg.  Also to be consumed daily over the course of 12 weeks.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power analyses were performed to identify the required sample size to detect a difference between the intervention and placebo groups for change in fasting LDL cholesterol, at a power of 80%.  Based on data from the literature a total of 52 individuals is required, with 26 per treatment group.  Fifty-eight individuals will be recruited to allow for a dropout rate of approximately 10%.

All results will be assessed for normality.  Where possible, skewed distributions will be log transformed before analysis. The level of significance is accepted at p= &lt;0.05. Data will be expressed as mean ± SD (parametric) or median ± interquartile range (non-parametric) unless otherwise stated. Analyses will be performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).  Independent samples t-tests, or Mann-Whitney U tests for non-parametric variables, will be used to determine differences between the groups in the changes in outcomes from baseline to week 12 (primary outcome).  A mixed between-within subjects analysis of variance will be used to assess the secondary outcome of differences between the groups across the three time points (baseline, week 6 and week 12).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this research is to determine whether consuming a polyphenol-rich seaweed supplement for 12 weeks will reduce LDL cholesterol levels in adults with elevated LDL cholesterol at baseline.  It is hypothesised that the group who receive the seaweed extract supplement will have a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol levels than the group who receive the rice flour supplement.</summary>
