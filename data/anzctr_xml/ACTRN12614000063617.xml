  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prospective, participant-masked, clinical trial where participants will wear prototype (test) and commercial (control) lenses bilaterally. Up to 6 contact lens designs will be assessed against commercial control lens. The 6 lens designs are the top performing designs based on the results of a non-dispensing pilot study, which assesses the short-term visual performance in adults.  The designs differ by power variations across the lens surface. It is voluntary for all the participants to complete all six stages and no 'washout' is required between each stage. Participants will wear the lenses on a daily wear, daily disposable basis for up to 7 days before crossing over to the next lens design. Questionnaires will need to be completed on day 2, 4 and 6.  </interventions>

NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
*Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
*Previous corneal refractive or strabismus surgery.
*Any binocular vision problems which may be exacerbated with the use of the study products or prevent adequate use of the device such as amblyopia, strabismus, excessive phoria and accommodative or convergence difficulties.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Myopia (also known as near or short sightedness) is a condition of the eye where objects viewed in the distance appears blurred. Conventional methods of correcting this optical condition include spectacles and contact lenses. The rate of progression of myopia tends to be more rapid in the younger age and high degrees of myopia can lead to complications such as retinal degeneration and detachments, choroidal neovascular membranes and an increased risk of primary open angle glaucoma.

Numerous studies have investigated different contact lens optical designs to correct and potentially treat myopia. One theory in the attempt to reduce myopia progression is to target the stimulus on the peripheral retina. Previous studies have shown that the peripheral retinal stimulus plays a role in myopia progression.  It is now known that peripheral hyperopia, where the stimulus or focus falls behind the retina, can be a trigger for myopia progression. Myopic eyes tend to have peripheral hyperopia and unfortunately the design of conventional spectacles and contact lenses used to correct myopia, actually exacerbates this. 

Thus, in an attempt to minimise myopia progression, the optical design of contact lens should bring the focus from behind the retinal periphery to either on or in front of the retinal periphery. This concept has been tested in contact lenses previously and progression of myopia was found to be 34% less than when wearing spectacles only. Newer optical designs with this concept are required to be tested to enhance the myopic progression effect, however, as the lens designs are novel, myopic participants are required to test the lenses and ensure both vision and subjective acceptance of the lens prior to longer term assessments on the efficacy of these lenses.

Previously conducted clinical studies assessed numerous prototype lenses after short-term (1.5 and 6 hours) lens wear compared to commercially available equivalent contact lenses in adults. The best performing prototype lenses from the short-term trial have been selected for further testing in the current study against the best performing commercial contact lenses for use in children and young adults.
