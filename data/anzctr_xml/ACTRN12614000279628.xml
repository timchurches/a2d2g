  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated in the intervention group will undertake the usual phase II cardiac rehabilitation offered at the University of Auckland Cardiac Rehabilitation Clinic. The cardiac phase II cardiac rehabilitation program will be based on evidence-based guidelines and will be supervised by a certificated clinical exercise physiologist.  A modification of two previously used behavioral-based interventions (including education on health consequences of sedentary behaviour, goal setting and advice on how to change the behaviour) will be additionally provided for these participants . The intervention will last 12 weeks. The intervention will consist on 3 educational sessions. The first session will last 30-45 minutes and the other 2 sessions 15 minutes each.  The appointment will be in the week 2, 5 and 9 of the program. The different appointments will coincide with the first training day of the week. The intervention will be delivered individually based on the baseline assessments. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well established that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with reduced health risk in cardiac patients. However, in addition to the generally accepted association between physical activity and health, emerging evidence suggest that sedentary behaviour is still harmful for the cardio metabolic risk factors even after controlling for physical activity. It has been also reported that almost a half of stable coronary heart patients depict a sedentary behaviour. On the other hand, it is now growing evidence that breaking sedentary behaviour confer cardio metabolic benefits to adults and some studies has shown that reduces the sedentary behaviour is possible  . However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in cardiac rehabilitation context trying to reduce the sedentary behaviour along with keep the exercise program. We therefore aim here to test the effectiveness of new behavioural-based intervention for reducing sedentary behaviour outside the clinics in a sample of cardiac participants attending to a phase II cardiac rehabilitation program.  If shown to be successful this intervention may have implications for cardiac rehabilitation research, policy and practice, and ultimately the health of cardiac patients in New Zealand and elsewhere. </summary>
