      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Dermatology-Specific Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Total Score (Quality of Life and Outcome Assessments. Measures: Participant Reported Outcomes [PRO]) - DLQI is a participant-administered, 10-question, validated, quality-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains, including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Response categories include 0 (not at all), 1 (a little), 2 (a lot), and 3 (very much); and "not relevant" and unanswered responses were scored as "0." Total scores range from 0 to 30, with higher score indicating greater quality of life impairment. A 5-point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant. Least Squares (LS) Mean change from baseline was calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline score as covariate, treatment, pooled center, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) - The NAPSI scale is used to evaluate the severity of fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps. The fingernail bed and fingernail matrix are each divided into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for fingernail bed Ps and fingernail matrix Ps, each with scores of 0 (none) to 4 (Ps in all 4 quadrants), depending on the presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of Ps in each quadrant of the fingernail bed or matrix. The NAPSI score of a fingernail is the sum of scores from each quadrant of the fingernail bed and fingernail matrix (maximum of 8). The total NAPSI score equals the sum of all fingernails and ranges from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating more severe Ps. LS mean change from baseline in NAPSI score was calculated using MMRM with baseline score as covariate, treatment, pooled center, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16 Items (QIDS-SR16) Total Score - The QIDS-SR16 is a self-administered, 16-item instrument in which a participant is asked to consider each statement as it relates to the way they have felt for the past 7 days. There is a 4-point scale for each item ranging from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). The 16 items are scored to give 9 individual depression domains (sad mood, concentration, self-criticism, suicidal ideation, interest, energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance [initial, middle and late insomnia or hypersomnia], decrease/increase in appetite/weight, and psychomotor agitation/retardation), which are summed to give a single score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores denoting greater symptom severity. LS mean change from baseline in total QIDS-SR16 score was calculated using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, pooled center and baseline QIDS total score.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in All Scores of the Work Productivity Activity Impairment Questionnaire-Psoriasis (WPAI-PSO) - The (WPAI-PSO) is a 6-item instrument used to assess the impact of psoriasis on productivity impairment within the past 7 days and has four domains, namely, absenteeism, presenteeism (reduced productivity while at work), an overall work impairment score, and impairment in daily activities performed outside of work. Four scores are derived as percentages: absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment (absenteeism and presenteeism), and impairment in activities performed outside of work. Percentage is calculated as each score * 100 and ranges from 0 to 100; greater scores indicate greater impairment. LS mean change from baseline in each WPAI-PSO score was calculated using the (ANCOVA) model with treatment, pooled center and baseline WPAI value.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) Scores - The SF-36 is a participant-reported outcome measure evaluating participant's health status. It comprises 36 items covering 8 domains: physical functioning, role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and general health. Items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths. The 8 domains are regrouped into the PCS and MCS scores. The summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better levels of function and/or better health. In this study, the SF-36 acute version was used, which has a 1 week recall period. LS mean change from baseline in SF-36 score was calculated using the ANCOVA model with treatment, pooled center and baseline SF-36 score.</outcome>
