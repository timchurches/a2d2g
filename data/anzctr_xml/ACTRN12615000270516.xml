  <interventions>
    <interventions>First time mothers booking for pregnancy care at the Womens who are randomly allocated to the  intervention group, will receive the Parenting Kit titled "Growing Together" which consists of: 
A book of A4 size that covers the journey from conception to one year of age. The book includes information for women regarding pregnancy care options, physical changes in pregnancy, cultural considerations, where to access support, labour and birth information, postnatal information regarding infant feeding, sleep, interaction with baby, and information about caring for a baby throughout the first year incorporating sleep, settling, nutrition, self care. The book has a strong focus on mental health issues which is addressed throughout.

An App that has been specifically designed for the project. It will have individual modules - Pregnancy, Parenting, Your Journey and Stories and videos. The Pregnancy module contains information on early pregnancy; healthy pregnancy; labour and birth; pregnancy and birth care and your pregnancy -week by week. The Parenting module includes information on newborn feeding; self care and support; being at home with your baby; feeding your older baby and down the track. Your Journey provides gestation specific advice to women around pregnancy care. There is also a section with a wide range of stories and videos which women can read or view. The App is very interactive, and has push notifications, links to various appropriate sites and many other features. It will be available only via a unique code, and each woman will be given only two codes  one for herself and the other for her partner or support person.

A childrens book written by Mem Fox titled Ten little fingers and ten little toes  which is aimed at encouraging parents to read to their children, as well as having what are considered to be important messages for the parents.

The duration of the intervention is from recruitment until the final survey at 12 months of age. The intervention is intended to be used as women see fit which would occur in the "real world". As such, there is no expectation that they will use the intervention for a set amount of time each week, or any strategies to monitor adherence to the use if the kit, other than discussion using the kit with the midwife in clinic.

    <concealment>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial; in order to reduce the risk of contamination, clinic days will be randomly allocated rather than individual women. All eligible women on an intervention day will receive the Parenting Kit. A parenting kit will be attached to the woman’s history at her booking in visit, and given to the woman by the midwife conducting the visit. An identifying sticker will be placed in the woman’s medical record so she is easily identified as being in the intervention arm at subsequent visits.
Individual consent will not be gained. However, when the first survey (at 36 weeks gestation) is sent, all women (in both control and intervention groups) will be informed of the evaluation and their choice of opt out from receiving further survey or telephone interview.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Each study day (i.e. 4 days x 24 weeks = 96 days total) was randomised to either the control or intervention arm. The randomisation was stratified by clinic day (i.e. Mon, Tu, Wed, Thu) to ensure that the treatment allocation was balanced within each clinic day. Blocked randomisation was used with variable block sizes. The randomisation list was produced in Stata version 13.1 using the “ralloc” command.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Given the importance of maternal health and coping on the infants health, to determine the sample size for this component we have used the experience of motherhood questionnaire (EMQ), a 20-item self-report measure. The EMQ has been described as a coherent and valid measure of overall coping which is significantly related to and indicative of maternal depression, toddler temperament, social support and life events. It therefore seems reasonable to theorise that the kit may impact on these factors.  The EMQ scale goes from 0 to 80, with lower scores indicating better maternal health and wellbeing, and the proportion over and under 40 (often the median) has been used here. To detect a difference of 50% compared to 60% scoring 40 or less between new mothers who have received the kit and those who have not would require 408 per group (that is 816) with 95% confidence and 80% power.  Allowing for loss to follow up we aim to recruit 1000 mothers to the RCT component of the trial.  This will be an adequate sample size to find meaningful differences (if they exist) in all the other outcomes being measured. We have not allowed for any potential effect of clustering given our randomisation method will ensure that relatively equal numbers of women from the four geographically-based teams (i.e. the main factor which may introduce differenced) will be allocated to both trial arms.
Data will be analysed by intention to treat. Randomising the various clinics over the 22 weeks of 'recruitment' and having such large numbers is likely to result in groups that are evenly distributed - however we will adjust for confounders. The first stage of the analysis will describe the demographics in the two groups using numbers and percentages, and this data will enable us to understand what factors we need to take into account in the analysis of outcomes. Proportions of women scoring above 40 on the EMQ will be compared using an odds ratio, and logistic regression used to adjust for confounders, with an adjusted odds ratio (and 95% confidence interval) presented. Comparison of means will be undertaken for continuous variables using t-tests where data were normally distributed or medians compared otherwise using Mann-Whitney U tests. STATA will be used for data analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Parenting Kit, titled Growing together, has been designed to guide prospective and new parents from conception until their child is one year of age. . 

The idea is that the kit is generic, with the aim being  that if effective it will be able to be rolled out throughout Victoria. 


A team from Judith Lumley Centre at La Trobe University are conducting a cluster RCT to evaluate the Parenting Kit. The two arms of the trial will consist of a control group receiving standard care and intervention group receiving the Parenting Kit.
Various outcomes will be measured including maternal health and well-being, womens experience of motherhood, attachment, infant development, and parental confidence. The views and experiences of health professionals will also be evaluated.
