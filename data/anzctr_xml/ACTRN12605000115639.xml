  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children who are enrolled in this trial, will have CMT1A. They will have a course of 6 monthly botulinum toxin injections for 2 years into one leg. This leg will be chosen at random, and the other leg will act as the control.</interventions>
    <comparator>The other leg will act as the control.</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be changes in foot shape and posture in the treated leg compared to the untreated leg.
This will be measured by Xrays, Foot posture index and Clinical photographs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Xrays - taken at baseline, and at conclusion (2 years).
Foot posture index - baseline, then every 6, 12, 18 months and at conclusion.
Clinical photographs - baseline, then every 6, 12, 18 months and at conclusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To ensure that the use of botulinum toxin will not have detrimental effects on foot posture and deformity, using:
X-rays  done pre- and post-trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Foot posture index and clinical photographs  done pre-trial , then every 6 months till completion of the trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Children will have a non-fixed bilateral pes cavus due to Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A. All patients will have a definite clinical diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which will be confirmed where possible by neurophysiologic testing and/or genetic testing of the patient or an affected first-degree relative. The diagnosis of pes cavus will be based upon clinical examination and foot X-rays.</inclusivecriteria>

    <sequence>There is no stratification. The chief investigator and the physician injecting the botulinum toxin are aware of the leg selection for treatment. The investigators doing the follow-up assessments are blinded to the treated leg. The selection of the limb is done by the chief investigator by coin flip.</sequence>
