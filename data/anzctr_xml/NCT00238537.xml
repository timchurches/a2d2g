    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In patients with penumbra, there will be attenuation of lesion growth (outcome T2 lesion volume - acute DWI volume ) with tPA.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Hypotheses</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In the non-penumbral group, lesion growth will be lower and will not be attenuated by tPA.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Favourable functional outcome (mRS 0-2) will be more likely in patients with penumbra receiving tPA.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>That the proportion of patients achieving good neurological outcome (an 8 point improvement in NIH-SS or outcome NIH-SS of 0, 1) will be greater in those patients with a penumbra receiving tPA.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (sICH) will be predicted by the size of the baseline DWI volume in those patients receiving tPA.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reperfusion (greater than 90% PWI lesion reduction, or recanalisation on MRA, between the acute and sub-acute interval), will be increased (in patients with penumbra) receiving tPA.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In patients with malignant mismatch (Definition DWI 100ml or more and / or PWI 100ml or more) there will be unfavourable clinical outcome (even if there is attenuation of growth).</outcome>
