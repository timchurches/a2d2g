Experimental: RESSCT plus Standard Care/Therapy - Regular Early Specialist Symptom Control Treatment (RESSCT) and Standard Therapy.
Participants will be seen within three weeks of randomisation by the Specialist Palliative Care Team (SPCT), (regardless of, and in addition to, all other treatments being offered). The initial meeting will be an approximately 1 hour consultation with a member of the Specialist Palliative Care team. This may be either a Consultant or Specialist Palliative Care Clinical Nurse Specialist (SPCCNS).
Patients will then continue to be seen regularly on at least a 4 weekly basis (regardless of other treatments, interventions and symptoms) by a member of the SPCT, with consultations lasting approximately 30 minutes. These monthly reviews will continue until end of trial (EOT) or patient death.

No Intervention: Standard Care/Therapy - The standard care/therapy control group will continue to receive all appropriate, standard treatment for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) currently available to them and will be initiated by the patient's General Practitioner (GP), the cancer MDT or lead respiratory physician as required.


Other interventions: Regular Early Specialist Symptom Control Treatment (RESSCT)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) frequently have significant physical
      symptoms, with up to 92% of patients complaining of three or more symptoms at presentation.
      Such symptom scores are similar to those reported in advanced non small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) and have been demonstrated to correlate with interference with activity and worse
      quality of life (QOL). Several studies have reported that baseline Quality of Life (QOL) is a
      significant prognostic factor for survival in NSCLC patients. In 2010, a non-blinded
      randomised controlled trial of 151 patients in the United States (US) demonstrated an
      improved QOL, fewer depressive symptoms and improved survival with early, regular specialist
      palliative care team (SPCT) involvement in addition to their routine care.

      The RESPECT-Meso study will examine the effect on quality of life following early Specialist
      Palliative Care (SPC) involvement for Regular Early Symptom Control Treatment (RESSCT) in
      addition to routine care in patients with newly diagnosed MPM in the United Kingdom (UK).</summary>
