  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will seek volunteers from an office environment. Participants will be randomly allocated into one of four interventions arms for a period of 5 weeks.

The intervention groups will allocate the time spent either sitting or standing every hour they are at work.

Arm 1 - 60 minutes sitting
Arm 2 - 40 minutes sitting, 20 minutes standing
Arm 3 - 30 minutes sitting, 30 minutes standing
Arm 4 - 20 minutes sitting, 40 minutes standing

Each participant in Arms 2-4 will be provided with an adjustable sit-stand workstation (Model- Ergotron Workfit S or A; or equivalent) which will be retrofitted to their existing computer workstation or desk and personalised to each participants preferred sitting position and standing height. Instructions will be provided on how to adjust the sit-stand workstation between sitting and standing. Participants will receive a computer app reminder to change posture according to the postural variation group they are allocated to. 

Adherence to the protocols will be assisted through the use of an App installed on participants computers. They will also receive visits from the research team and emails to remind them to follow their allocated protocol.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be assigned to Arm 1, where they are asked to work as normal throughout the trial. These participants would not have a desk retrofitted to their work station.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The acceptability of different sitting-standing protocols and data collection procedures.
One measure of acceptability will be response and retention rate of participants.
A study aspects questionnaire has been developed to investigate specific aspects of the study and what participants opinions of each. Qualitative measurements of the acceptability of the study will also be gauged through focus groups upon the conclusion of the study. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Response rates and retention will be recorded  at both baseline (the end of week 1) and intervention (the end of week 5) time points when data is collected.
As participants complete the intervention(the end of week 5 of the study after 4 weeks using the sit stand desk) they will complete the Study Aspects questionnaire. 
Once all intervention groups have completed their involvement in the 5 week study, focus groups will be held to further understand participants adherence and acceptability of the protocol. The focus group will be held in the week after the trial finishes. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The impact of the different sitting-standing protocols on participants sedentary behavior. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ) questionnaire measures time spent sitting, standing, walking and doing more physically demanding tasks at work. It will be completed at the end of baseline (week 1) data collection and at the end of the intervention (week 5) to gather self report changes in sedentary behaviour at work. 

The ActivPAL will collect objective information on participnats sedentary behaviour inside and outside of work when worn on the participants thigh for 7 days during week 1 and 7 days during week 5 of the study. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical Activity  objective monitoring: At baseline and follow-up participants will wear a small and lightweight inclinometer/accelerometer for 7days. 
Habitual physical activity: Validated questionnaire - The Active Australia Questionnaire will gather habitual physical activity data, which can be compared to the objective data from the ActivPAL. 
These are composite and related outcomes which will all be compared to each other to confirm understanding of physical activity and sedentary behavior of participants. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During 5 week intervention. At baseline, participants will wear the ActivPAL device for 7 days continuously. Then at the completion of these 7 days, they will fill out the mentioned questionnaires. This will be repeated in the 4th week of the intervention. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Musculoskeletal: the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire will measure the 7-day prevalence of musculoskeletal discomfort.
Biomechanical strain: Kinematic sensors (Dorsavi) measuring muscle activity will be fitted on participants on two different days (2 weeks pre-intervention and on a day during the intervention). The sensors are unobtrusive, placed on the lower back and do not restrict the participants for performing their work or exercise activities. 
These musculoskeletal and bio-mechanical outcomes will be used in composite to increase our understanding of the impact of the protocols on musculoskeletal discomfort in an office setting. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During 5 week intervention. At baseline, participants will wear the Dorsavii for 1 day at work. Then at the completion of the baseline data collection week, they will fill out the nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire. This will be repeated in the 4th week of the intervention. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood samples (optional): hourly blood samples will be taken during the test day to measure glucose levels which are an indicator of metabolic levels. Those providing blood samples will do so on one day at baseline and one day during the final week of the intervention. Controlled and timed meals will be provided on these days. Participants will all eat the same dinner, then fast for 10 hours before starting work. During the work day, participants will have to follow a strictly controlled diet.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Biological markers will be compared between baseline and intervention blood collections. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to the protocols will be measured by the activPAL devices. Perception of participants adhering to the protocol will be further gathered in the focus group discussions. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Qualitative data will be collected via focus group discussions once all participants have completed the intervention. Focus group discussions will be recorded, transcribed and separately analysed using a thematic analysis.</timepoint>

    <concealment>For this pilot study, staff from the Division of Population Health Sydney Local Health District will be invited to volunteer. We will aim to recruit 40 staff members. 
Participants will be assigned codes upon enrollment in the study and all collected data will be anonymously linked.
A central administrator allocated all participant codes to an intervention group using permuted blocks. Once assigned, a member of the research team referred to this list to inform participants which intervention group they had been assigned to. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Few studies have compared sitting on a standard ergonomic chair with working on a sit-stand desk in terms of health benefits. In terms of broader cardio-metabolic benefits of alternative office working modes, research on standing is particularly scarce and the very few studies that examined how cardiometabolic blood biomarkers respond to replacements of sitting were done in laboratory conditions that are not necessarily translatable in real-life office environments. Very little evidence exists on how changes in work time sitting influences fatigue, and mood, or after work hours physical activity and sedentary behavior.

The objectives of this pilot intervention are to examine:
The acceptability of and adherence to different sitting-standing protocols to participants
b) 	The impact of the different sitting-standing protocols on participants outcome measures (see below) 
c) 	The acceptability of and adherence to data collection procedures such as taking blood samples and wearing an inclinometer for 7days (24hrs a day), and a kinematic sensor for 2 days.

This pilot study will provide valuable information on planning for a larger randomised controlled trial which will examine the effects of different sitting-standing modes on the health of office workers.
