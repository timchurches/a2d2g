Experimental: HMPL-689 - Subjects will receive a single dose of HMPL-689 or matching placebo on Day 1. The planned dose levels in ascending order are: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 mg (7 dose cohorts with 8 subjects in each cohort). Within each cohort, randomization ratio of 3:1 is followed to dose 6 subjects with HMPL-689 and 2 subjects with placebo.

Placebo Comparator: HMPL-689 placebo - Subjects will receive a single dose of HMPL-689 or matching placebo on Day 1. The planned dose levels in ascending order are: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 25 and 30 mg (7 dose cohorts with 8 subjects in each cohort). Within each cohort, randomization ratio of 3:1 is followed to dose 6 subjects with HMPL-689 and 2 subjects with placebo.
