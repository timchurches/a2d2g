  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial aims to test the safety and efficacy of a new pressure recording device (the HeartPOD). Once a subject has fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and signed a consent form, the device would be permanently implanted in the wall of the left atrium to continuously monitor left atrial pressure. The pressure readings are viewed on a hand held computer (PDA) which receives the information by wireless transmission through the skin.

The device is implanted and monitored for 12 months. The first 6 weeks will be used to assess the safety of the device. For the first three months the participants medication will only be altered based on symptoms, but pressure recordings will be taken to correlate pressures with symptoms. For months four to six medication will be adjusted based on symptoms and left atrial pressure. At months seven to twelve medication will be managed by the participant based on the pressure reading and instructions given by the PDA.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite  improvements in treatment of heart failure over the last three decades it still carries a higher mortality rate than most  cancers and is the most common reason for hospitalising people over the age of 65. Current treatment for heart failure is medication, adjusted based on the person's symptoms and / or weight gain. Adjustment of drug therapy can  prevent rapid deterioration and the need for hospitalisation. 

Studies with cardiac catheterisation have demonstrated that one of the best predictors of the severity of heart failure and its response to treatment is raised left atrial pressure which often occurs several hours to several days before the onset of symptoms.  Left atrial pressure cannot be accurately estimated from clinical assessment, and currently can only be estimated infrequently at single time points by invasive catheterisation of the right heart.

This trial aims to test the safety and efficacy of a new pressure recording device (the HeartPOD). This device would be permanently implanted in the wall of the left atrium, to continuously monitor left atrial pressure. The pressure readings are viewed on a small personal digital assistant (PDA) (hand held computer) which receives the information from the device by wireless transmission through the skin.

Th trial will enrol 20 participants who will have the device implanted and monitored for 12 months. The first 6 weeks will be used to assess the safety of the device. For the first three months the participants medication will be altered based on symptoms, but pressure recordings will be taken to correlate pressures with symptoms. For months four to six medication will be adjusted based on symptoms and left atrial pressure. At months seven to twelve medication will be managed by the participant based on the pressure reading and instructions given by the PDA.</summary>
