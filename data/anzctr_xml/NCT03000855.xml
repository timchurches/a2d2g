  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - EUS-guided choledocho-duodenostomy
Treatment: surgery - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with covered metallic stent

Active Comparator: ECDS - EUS-guided choledocho-duodenostomy

Active Comparator: ERCP with CSEMS - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with covered metallic stent


Treatment: surgery: EUS-guided choledocho-duodenostomy
The CBD would be identified by a linear echoendoscope and a suitable puncture site in the bulb of the duodenum would be located. The common bile duct would be punctured with a 19-gauge needle and the position would be confirmed by aspiration of bile and contrast injection. A 0.025" or 0.035" guide wire would be passed through the needle in to the CBD. A fully covered metal stent would then be inserted after track dilation.

Treatment: surgery: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with covered metallic stent
After cannulation of the CBD, a cholangiography would be performed to assess the diameter of the CBD, the length and position of the biliary stricture. The endoscopist would decide on the appropriate size of SEMS to be placed. The stents should be visible from the duodenal lumen after deployment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>EUS - guided choledocho-duodenostomy (ECDS) is an established option for bile duct drainage
      in unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures when endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) fails. However, how primary ECDS compares with ERCP with
      covered self-expanding metallic stents (CSEMS) in unresectable malignant distal CBD
      strictures is uncertain.

      The aim of the current study is to compare primary ECDS versus ERCP with CSEMS in
      unresectable malignant distal CBD strictures. We hypothesis that ECDS is associated with a
      higher 1-year stent patency rate.</summary>
