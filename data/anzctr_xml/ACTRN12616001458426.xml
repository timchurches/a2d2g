  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be recruited from an independent clinical trial that involve induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) challenge  QP15C20. As part of these independent clinics trials participants are inoculated with a low dose of malaria which is subsequently closely monitored in the community for 8 to 10 days prior to treatment. Based on the level of malaria detected in these trials participants are then admitted to the trial unit (confinement period) for administration of an anti-malarial agent to treat the induced infection and determine the efficacy of this agent. If participants are recruited into this study they will have an observational PET/MRI scan. The timing of this scan will work in accordance to the malaria inoculation schedule of the independent clinical trial. Participants will receive a whole body PET/MRI scan and dedicated brain MRI within approximately one week prior to inoculation and on one to two days prior to confinement with peak parasitaemia post inoculation. Scans will be performed on the Biograph mMR PET/MRI system after the intravenous infusion of the standard radiotracer 2-(18F) fluor-deoxy-D-glucose(FDG) (18F FDG) and MAGNETOM Prisma 3T MRI system. Collected images will be reviewed and reported by experienced radiologists specialising in MRI and nuclear medicine reporting. Quantification of 18F FDG uptake measurements will be established for intra-individual scans using Patlak model analysis and semi quantitative SUV measurement with reference to an 18F FDG external control. An estimated dose of 4.5MBq per kg (based on screening weight) 18F FDG is to be administered by infusion (minimum dose 90MBq, maximum dose 400MBq). </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional nuclear medicine imaging techniques such as PET/MRI imaging are commonly used in fields such as oncology to look at the bioactivity and biodistribution of disease. These techniques have previously been applied to infectious diseases, although data is limited. We propose a pilot study to investigate the use of 18F FDG PET/MRI imaging in malaria infection. Participants taking part in malaria challenge studies will be invited to undergo whole body PET/MRI imaging before and after malaria inoculation. </summary>
