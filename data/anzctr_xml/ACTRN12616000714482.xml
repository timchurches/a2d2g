  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible Subjects will enter the study and commence the Enrolment Period 1, a 14-day period during which all Subjects will receive capsules, the capsules will be consumed twice daily, one in the morning and once in the evening.
Upon completion of Period 1, Subjects who remain eligible will be randomised to one of two possible treatment sequences (Inactive Control  FLX-787 or FLX-787  Inactive Control). FLX-787 or Inactive Control are both oral beverages which will be taken twice daily for one of two 14-day Cross-over Periods. Self-administration will take place in the morning approximately within an hour of rising and in the evening approximately 45 minutes before going to bed.
Subjects will be allocated to each treatment sequence in a 1:1 ratio. There will be a 7-14 day Wash-out Period between Period 1 and Period 2. Each Cross-over Period (Periods 2 and 3) is 14 days. There will be a 7-14 day Wash-out Period between Periods 2 and 3.
Assessments will be performed and surveys will be completed at each clinic visit according to the study events flow chart.
In addition to the in-clinic assessments, Subjects will be completing daily telephone surveys through an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) to document information on the previous days muscle spasms/cramps (including number of, time, duration, location, and pain level), the level of spasticity according to the NRS and study product compliance.
Subjects will return to the centre for an End of Treatment Visit (or Early Termination Visit if they withdraw before the end of the study).
In addition, a follow-up telephone interview to assess adverse events (AEs) will take place 30 days after the last administration of the study product.
Each clinic visit will have a +3-day visit window after the due date to account for scheduling conflicts/holidays/weekends.
Subjects will be given an additional six (6) doses of study product to allow for continued dosing through the 3-day visit window if needed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to evaluate the effects and safety of FLX-787 in patients with MS who experience muscle cramps and spasms. We aim to assess the effect of FLX-787 on muscle spasms/cramps. FLX-787 is self administered morning and evening.
Flex Pharma hypothesizes that activating Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channels, which are known to exist in primary sensory neurons in the mouth, oesophagus and gut increase inhibitory tone in the spinal cord and prevents repetitive firing of alpha neurons thereby relieving the cramp. This study investigates whether the ingredients in FLX-787 activate the TRP ion channels relieve muscle cramps in paitents with MS</summary>
