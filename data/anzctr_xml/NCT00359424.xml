    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - IV rt-PA alone
Other interventions - endovascular therapy

Active Comparator: intravenous (IV) rt-PA alone - Group one will receive the standard dose of intravenous (IV) rt-PA alone given over an hour.

Experimental: Endovascular therapy - Group two will receive a lower dose or a standard dose of IV rt-PA and then undergo an angiogram test (cerebral angiography) right after the medicine is given to check for blood clots. If a clot is not seen then no more treatment will be given. If a clot is seen, the neurointerventionalist will then choose (based on the location and extent of the blood clot) a protocol approved endovascular treatment given directly in the brain artery that will be most effective in reopening the blocked artery.


Treatment: drugs: IV rt-PA alone
Intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only approved acute stroke therapy; Group one will receive the standard dose of IV rt-PA given over an hour.

Other interventions: endovascular therapy
Group two will receive a lower dose or the standard dose of IV rt-PA and then undergo an angiogram test (cerebral angiography) right after the medicine is given to check for blood clots. If a clot is not seen then no more treatment will be given. If a clot is seen, the neurointerventionalist will then choose a protocol approved endovascular treatment given directly in the brain artery that will be most effective in reopening the blocked artery. Endovascular therapy can be implemented with or without interarterial rt-PA use.

      <outcome>National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS) &gt;&gt; Dichotomized 0-1 Versus 2 or Greater. - The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a serial measure of neurologic deficit, is a 42-point scale that &gt;&gt; quantifies neurologic deficits in 11 categories, with 0 indicating normal function without neurologic deficit and higher
&gt;&gt; scores indicating greater severity of deficit.</outcome>

      <outcome>Barthel Index (BI) Dichotomized 0-90 Versus 95-100 - The Barthel Index (BI)is an ordinal scale used to measure a subject's performance in activities of daily living (ADL) in ten variables- feeding, transfer (bed to chair), grooming, toilet use, bathing, mobility on a level surface, stair use, dressing, bowels and bladder. It is an assessment of independence in ADL and is scored in increments of 5 points. The lowest possible score on the index is 0 which implies total dependence on others for ADL and the highest total score is 100 which indicate full independent in ADL. A higher score is associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence.</outcome>

      <outcome>Trail Making Test Part A Time - The Trail Making Test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching that is thought to be sensitive to the presence of cerebral dysfunction. It is a timed test consisting of two parts where the subject is asked to draw a "trail" made by connecting numbers in sequential order (part A) and then in part B the combination of numbers and letters. Scoring is calculated separately for Parts A and B but both scores are provided as the minutes and seconds it takes for the subject to complete each part. Normally, the entire test (A and B) can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes.</outcome>
