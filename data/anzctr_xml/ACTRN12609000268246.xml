  <interventions>
    <interventions>Antenatal care model in which birth plans will be introduced, promoted and emphasized in the intervention health units during antenatal clinic visits through provider- participant dialogue and will be performed during routine antenatal care visits as per national guidelines (attendance four times in pregnancy for women with no pregnancy complications preferably the first visit before 16 weeks, second visit at around 28 weeks, 3rd visit between 32-34 weeks and the 4th visit at around 36 weeks). Parallel to the national level, the median gestation age at first antenatal attendance is at six month and it is thus expected that most women will attend three times at most: initial visit at six months, second visit between seven and eight months and the last at nine months. The consultation time for each woman will be approximately 40 minutes at initial attendance and for approximately 15 minutes during the subsequent visits. The provider-participant dialogue will be on  preparations for normal birth by identifying a skilled birth attendant and place of delivery, transport arrangement to reach the place of delivery or emergency care, financial arrangements to pay for transport and services, knowledge of where and to whom to go for help. The other discussions will be on the knowledge of danger signs during pregnancy, labour, delivery and postpartum for the mother and newborn and when to seek help when a complication arises, support in looking after the home and children while the woman is away, identification of a birth companion  and identification of compatible blood donors. The dialogue will be on-going throughout the attendances and will start during the initial visit and end at the last visit when plans that have been formulated and those that have been completed will be documented by the care provider. Participants male partners will also be invited to participate in the dialogue. Two copies of the formulated/completed plans will be made and one given to the woman to keep and show up at a health unit she will seek delivery care. The remaining copy will be kept by the provider.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a cluster randomized controlled trial in a health care setting. 18 health units in the district will be randomly assigned to the intervention (antenatal care with emphasis on birth plans) and control (antenatal care as currently provided). All consented women in the clusters (health units) at least 24 weeks gestation will be recruited into the study. The names of all health units (clusters) will be sent to London where randomization into either the intervention or control arms will be done by an off the site statistician. Study sites (clusters) allocation will thus be concealed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Justification for the project:
Birth plans are conceptually compelling as a safe motherhood strategy to increase killed care at delivery and immediately after, but robust empirical evidence is lacking to support their effectiveness. The proposed study meets the United Nations Depelopment Programme (UNDP)/United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)/World Health Organization (WHO)/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) research objectives of improving maternal and perinatal health by generating evidence of effectiveness of
interventions currently promoted through providing evidence for the effectiveness of birth plans (or lack thereof) to increase skilled care at delivery and after delivery as a strategy to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality.
Proposed Research:
In most developing countries including Tanzania, many more women attend antenatal care than deliver under care of skilled providers in health care settings. Having skilled delivery care providers at birth provides prompt and effective way of managing serious complications as they arise in order to reduce most maternal deaths.
Birth plans are one of the components of focused antenatal care in many developing countries and is promoted as a strategy to increase skilled care at delivery. However, robust empirical evidence lacks to support the effectiveness of birth plans to increase skilled delivery care. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 18 health
units involving at least 760 women in Ngorongoro district, rural Tanzania to determine the effectiveness of birth plans in increasing skilled care at delivery and after delivery. 18 health units will be randomly assigned to provide antenatal care with renewed emphasis in birth plans (intervention) provided by care providers or control (antenatal care as currently provided). The district has over 6000 annual deliveries. Women will be interviewed twice, at first encounter and one month after delivery. Variables to be collected will be on sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric history (past and present), components of antenatal care provided, barriers to skilled delivery care utilization and care satisfaction. The primary outcome will be the proportional of women who will seek delivery at the available health units. The proportion of women who will seek post delivery care and care satisfaction as measured on a five point Likerts scale will be the secondary outcomes.</summary>
