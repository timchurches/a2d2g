  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this randomized, two-arm and open label study is to demonstrate that the
      treatment of a daily dose of 3x10mg dydrogesterone orally is as effective and safe as the
      daily dose Crinone 8% intravaginal progesterone gel 90 mg for the luteal support in women who
      are unable to conceive a child and are undergoing IVF. The treatment will start on the day of
      oocyte retrieval and continue until pregnancy is negative or until week 12 gestation.

      Patients will be followed during treatment until 30 days after delivery to record any safety
      and tolerability data of the patient and their newborn (s).</summary>
