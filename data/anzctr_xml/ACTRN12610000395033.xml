  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to receive one of the three injection techniques below:
1. Fast without aspiration  Administration into the deltoid at 90 degrees. This involves a rapid plunge, no aspiration, &amp; withdrawal of the needle following immunisation lasting less than 1 second. 
2. Slow with aspiration  Administration into the deltoid at 90 degrees. This involves a slow plunge, aspiration, &amp; slow withdrawal of the needle following immunisation over a period lasting 5-10 seconds and 
3. Slow without asperation - Administration into the deltoid at 90 degrees. This involves a slow plunge, no aspiration, &amp; slow withdrawal of the needle following immunisation over a period lasting 5-10 seconds.</interventions>
