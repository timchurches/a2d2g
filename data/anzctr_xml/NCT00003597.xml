Experimental: Cohort 1 - Chemotherapy days 0-4, G-CSF (5 µg/kg/d) as a daily subcutaneous injection beginning on Day 5. All patients receive recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO). rhTPO began on the last day of ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin and Etoposide) chemotherapy (Day 4) and subsequent doses will be administered on Days 6, 8, 10 and 12 (5 doses total). The initial dose of rhTPO was 1.2 µg/kg/dose and was subsequently escalated to 2.4 and 3.6 µg/kg/dose as tolerated. Therapy will continue for maximum six courses. Pharmacokinetic data will be obtained (during course one only).

Experimental: Cohort 2 - Chemotherapy days 0-4, G-CSF (5 µg/kg/d) as a daily subcutaneous injection beginning on Day 5. All patients receive recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO). The dose of rhTPO 1.2 µg/kg/dose and subsequently escalated to 2.4 and 3.6 µg/kg/dose as tolerated. Patients assigned to Cohort II will receive pre-chemotherapy rhTPO at 3.6 µg/kg/dose on Days -5, -3, -1, and post-chemotherapy rhTPO on Days +4, +6, and +8 (6 doses total. Subsequent courses of chemotherapy will begin as soon as the ANC recovers to
= 1,000/µL and the platelet count to = 100,000/µL between days 21 and 35. Therapy will continue for maximum six courses. Pharmacokinetic data will be obtained (during course one nly). For the second cohort, full data collection will occur for cycles one and two and limited data collection for cycles 3, 4, 5, and 6.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as thrombopoietin and G-CSF may
      increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a
      person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of colony-stimulating factors in treating
      children who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors and who are receiving chemotherapy.</summary>
