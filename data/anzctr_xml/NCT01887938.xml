    <exclusivecriteria>1. The patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, is unable to return for safety
             evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study) as determined by the
             Investigator.

          2. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to agents used for sedation or
             is thought to be at an unacceptably high risk for associated potential complications

          4. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical
             investigations or use of any investigational product (drug or drug delivery device)
             other than those used in HGT-MLD-070 within 6 months prior to study enrollment or at
             any time during the study.</exclusivecriteria>
