    <interventions>Pulsed Radiofrequency Treatment (PRF)
This will be delivered via percutaneous radio frequency needle which will be inserted under ultrasound guidance with the tip positioned next to the neuroma.
PRF will be performed at a frequncy of 2Hz, 20msec pulses in a 1 second cycle of 120 seconds duration at a temperature of 42 C.  This will be repeated three times whilst the needle is rotated until a 360 degree area of neuroma is covered. 

Before the needle is removed, a 2mL mixture of 1.5mL 1% lignocaine and 0.5mL Celestone will be injected around the neuroma.

The estimated total duration of the procedure will be 30 minutes.

There will be one treatment session.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on a power of 80% and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, the sample size required for the present study will be 30 per group for a total of 60 patients to detect a standardised difference of 0.75.

Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey tests for multiple comparisons will be used to compare the changes from baseline VNRS pain scores among baseline, post-procedure 1, 4, and 12 weeks. To compare the differences of VAS pain scores and satisfaction between groups, the MannWhitney U test will be used at each time point. To compare patients characteristics variables,
the Fishers exact test will be used for sex, treatment sites. The unpaired t-test will be used for body weight, height, body mass index, duration. Data analysis will be performed using SPSS 11.0 for window (SPSS Inc) on a personal computer. Values will be estimated as mean +/- standard deviation. A P value of &lt;0.05 will be taken to indicate a significant difference.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Multicentre randomised double-blinded sham-lesion control trial to evaluate the role and effectiveness of pulsed radiofrequency treatment (PRF) of a peripheral nociceptive trigger (i.e. neuroma) in the management of phantom and residual limb pain.  
Participants will be recruited through the Victorian Artificial Limb Program Outpatient Clinic at Royal Park Campus RMH.

Eligible patients will undergo perineuromal injections with local anaesthetic performed under ultrasound.  Responses will be recorded as positive if the participant experiences a decrease in pain intensity of at least 50%.  
Patients with a positive response will proceed to PRF or placebo assigned in a random manner.
Participants will be followed up at 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months.  
Measures of pain intensity (BPI), pain quality (SF MacGill Pain Questionaire), physical functioning (BPI), emotional functioning (DASS), patients global rating of improvement and satisfaction (PGIC), health-related quality of life, prosthetic use (TAPES-R), healthcare utilisation will be obtained at each review.
