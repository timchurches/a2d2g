    <concealment>Interested individuals responded to an advertising campaign calling for sufferers of hip pain. They underwent initial phone screening to exclude sufferers of systemic conditions or contraindications to manipulative therapy. Subjects were included if they met the inclusion and possessed no exclusion criteria. Eligible participants were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups; Protocol A or Protocol B. A random number generator was utilised to randomly sequence the two groups in allocations of six at a time.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment for the lower limb kinetic chian. We hypothesize the wider scope of treatment will provide better outcome in pain scores, overall effectiveness, range and motion and gait ability due to the inter-relationahip of the biomechanical change and addressing compensatory actions. We hope it will provide evidence to be included in guidelines for management of osteoarthritis and may provide alternative options to analgesics and surgery.</summary>
