    <comparator>Patients taking bromocriptine constructed the control group,because this drug have been widely used for the treatment of mastalgia and its efficiacy and adverse effects were well known.Control group will take oral half  tablet(2.5 mg)bromocriptine every  day begining  from  14th  day  of  menstrual  cycle ,to  the  first day of menstruation.This therapy  will continue during three consecutive menstrual cycles.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Breast pain  visual  analogue score(VAS).Patients will be given visual analogue score chart,on which numbers from 1 to 10 were located.Patient will sign one of these numbers according to their feeling of severity of breast pain,before the treatments and each month after the menstruation during three months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcome will be measured at the end of menstruation for three months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>drug  adverse  effects.Frequency of nausia,frequency of vomitting,frequency of headache,frequency of hypotensive syncope will be defined.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months  of  therapy,evaluation of  adverse  effects,Patients will be asked for frequently seen adverse effects when they visit hospital for the evaluation of their visual analogue score after each menstrual bleeding during treatment.Total frequency of these adverse effects for both groups will be calculated.</timepoint>
