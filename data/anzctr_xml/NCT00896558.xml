  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be the first repeat dose administration of GSK1322322 to investigate safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects as well as elderly volunteer subjects.
      The study will also include a P450 probe drug (midazolam) to evaluate the effect of
      GSK1322322 to inhibit or induce CYP3A4 substrates.</summary>
