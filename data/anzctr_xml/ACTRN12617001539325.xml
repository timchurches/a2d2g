  <interventions>
    <interventions>Baseline brief cognitive assessments with Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Reliable Digit Span, oral Trail Making Test-B were undertaken by MD Project Medical students on participants who were inpatients in Brain Injury Service or were referred for follow up in Brain Injury Outpatient Clinic. The baseline cognitive assessments were undertaken in a single session either in the outpatient department or in hospital. The baseline assessments are estimated to take 45 minutes in duration and are all undertaken on the same day. 

All participants were invited to undergo a formal neuropsychological test battery, estimated to take 60 minutes, were administered as close to the baseline cognitive screen as possible. The neuropsychological assessment was undertaken in a single session as close to the timing of the baseline cognitive assessment as possible in the hospital or outpatient setting. A trained neurospychologist attached to Brain Injury Unit or University of New South Wales were the designated neurospychologists.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether baseline cognitive screening tests, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Addenbrookes Cognitive Assessment-III (ACE-III), Oral Trail Making Test-B (oTMT-B), reliable Digit Span predict functional outcomes in patients following a traumatic brain injury and  whether they correlate with neuropsychological testing.  In addition, the study aimed to determine the accuracy and validity of baseline cognitive screening tests in the detection of those patients with cognitive impairment on neuropsychological testing. </summary>
