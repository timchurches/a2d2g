  <interventions>
    <interventions>The traditional Falls Risk Assessment Tool (FRAT) is currently used for all inpatient admissions to rate the falls risk of patients prior to initiating falls prevention interventions. It guides the user to firstly rate the risk of falls through a series of questions 7 questions which asks the user to score on a scale of 1-4 or low, medium or high. This research will remove this tool and therefore remove the rating scores for patients. 

The short FRAT will be a template which guides the user to falls intervention strategies only, The user will be asked if the person had a recent fall, change in cognition or decline in mobility. A yes to any answer will trigger the use of strategies targeted to the individual need to the patient. 
Patient focused falls interventions will be documented on a Short FRAT  based on observed and personalised need rather then the risk level. </interventions>

    <designfeatures>A pragmatic approach has been taken to the ward clusters based on best size, location in the hospital and flow of patients. 

The clusters have been grouped as:
1.	The Mornington Centre (3 wards)
2.	Rosebud Hospital (2 wards)
3.	Gold Links Road Hospital (2 wards)
4.	All wards on Level 5 of Frankston hospital
5.	Bass/Westernport/Port Phillip wards at Frankston Hospital
6.	Mental Health wards at Frankston Hospital 
7.	Short stay and evaluative medical wards at Frankston Hospital 
8.	Palliative Care at Golf Links Road
9.	Intensive care at Frankston Hospital. 
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary analyses will compare between intervention (New FRAT) and control (traditional FRAT) periods in the rate of falls (falls per 1000 patient days) using negative binomial regression and the proportion of patients who experience one or more falls versus no falls using logistic regression and  the rate of falls resulting in injury using negative binomial regression. Each analysis will use patient-level data that will be clustered within unit.

Only data from patients admitted following the start of trial will be included, and the data will be censored at trial conclusion for patients remaining on the units after this point. Patients already admitted to the units at the point where the unit transitions from being a control unit to an intervention unit will have their data censored from the day prior to the start of transition. This is to avoid contamination of data analyses by patients who are exposed to control and intervention periods on their unit.

Secondary analyses will be determined with regression analysis to determine any difference between groups. 

We have based the power analysis on the detailed falls data collected as part of the STOP-Falls trial. If we assume that the intervention will have an effect of the incidence rate of falls 0.7 (reduction of 30% by increasing targeted interventions)

This trial will have 70% power to detect a 30% reduction in the rate of falls given the design parameters of 9 clusters (streams) that are randomised, and a two-tailed alpha=0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent evaluation of the FRAT at Peninsula Health identified that use of prompted clinical judgement had higher sensitivity for when to provide falls interventions than the stratification of risk and allocation of score. This led to the development of a new FRAT with just interventions prompts. 

This stepped wedge cluster randomised control trial seeks to analyse this new method of falls intervention. The design aims to roll out the introduction of the new forms to each cluster over a 9 month period. All inpatient sites and wards of Peninsula Health will be involved in this roll out excluding Womens Health, Emergency and Paediatrics, due to different documentation requirements. 

The primary outcome of interest will be falls rates, secondary outcomes will also include rates of change in completions in FRATs, difference in time taken to complete new and old documentation with a potential economic evaluation of the cost of interventions. 

This research will provide important information about the way in which we both implement falls interventions but also seek to prevent these within the inpatient setting.
