  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Kessler 10 ( K 10 ), is the intervention studied. This is a questionnaire to detect psychological distress. It is a validated and recognized screening tool for psychological distress. In this study it will be used to asses carer psychological distress. The K 10 takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. This will only have to be completed on one occasion in the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Community nurse assessment of psychlogical distress. This will be based on our current asessment of carer psychological distress, which is the community nurse clinical judgement. This will be undertaken at the same visit that the carer is provided their K 10 questionnaire. The carer as per ethics does not have to complete the K 10 immediately, but once completed are required to post the K 10 back to the investigator.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of psychological distress. Comparison between K 10 scores as generated by patient completion of questionaire and the community nurse assessment. K 10 scores are stratified into groups that include nil distress, mild mental distress, moderate mental distress and severe mental distress. The community nurse will assess the level of distress as being well, mild, moderate and severe, based on clinical judgement. For statistical analysis scores of 1,2,3 and 4 will be given to the categories of well, mild, moderate and severe distress respectively. As a result total scores can be arrived at for each assessment for mean comparison.</outcome>
