    <interventions>Health Coaching, Education Alone

Health Coaching: In addition to the usual care, women in this condition will take part in a Health Coaching intervention program. Our specialised Health Coaching intervention has two components: (1) one-on-one sessions with a Health Coach, and (2) educational group sessions lead by a Health Coach, with key topics the same as described below for the Education Alone group education sessions but with Health Coaching included as well. The two components will be run concurrently for the Intervention group. 

- Initial meeting with Health Coach at 14-16 weeks gestation
- First Health Coaching session at 16-18 weeks gestation (face-to-face, 1 hour duration)
- First group education session (Intervention group only) at 20 weeks gestation
- Second group education session (Intervention group only) at 22 weeks gestation
- Second session with Health Coach at 24 weeks gestation (telephonic, 30 mins duration)
- Two brief follow-up sessions with Health Coach between 28-30 weeks (telephonic, 15 mins duration each)

Education Alone: Women in this condition will only receive two education group sessions run by an educator (not a Health Coach) that include the following key topics: dietary and physical activity guidelines in pregnancy; beliefs about pregnancy weight gain and body image; beliefs about postpartum weight loss and body image; mood changes during pregnancy; factors that protect a women against elevated depressive symptoms; and the negative consequence of postpartum weight retention for maternal and infant/child health.

- First group education session (Education Alone group only) at 20 weeks gestation
- Second group education session (Education Alone group only) at 22 weeks gestation</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: Women in this condition will be case-managed by their obstetrician, midwife or GP as would normally happen. This is the pathway available to the majority of pregnant women in the state of Victoria. Women will be assessed at baseline for current and pre-pregnancy BMI by the research fellow appointed to the study and will have follow-up assessments at the same time as the intervention women.</comparator>
