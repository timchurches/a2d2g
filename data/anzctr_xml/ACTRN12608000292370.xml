  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study only. In patients with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis this study observes what type of arthritis may develop over time. In addition we will observe whether patients who present with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis have better or worse long-term outcomes than those with rheuamtoid arthritis. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis we are observing lon-term disease outcomes. Duration of study at least 10 years.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The most common forms of inflammatory arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis) or crystal arthritis (gout). In many patients who present with acute arthritis it is not possible to determine the definite type of arthritis for some time. One of the challenges in early arthritis is to determine who will develop a chronic destructive type of arthritis such as RA, which leads to pain, suffering, and frequently irreversible joint damage. Earlier identification and treatment of patients with RA can reduce permanent joint damage. However, identifying patients with early RA, as opposed to other forms of arthritis can be difficult. Current diagnostic tests for RA are limited to those that detect joint changes after the disease is well established. We currently have an Early arthritis study (CTR/04/06/095) investigating novel markers in patients with early inflammatory arthritis. We wish to identify whether the novel markers in patients with undifferentiated arthritis are present in those with defined forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or osteoarthritis and thus may help in diagnosis of these conditions. We therefore require a cohort of samples from patients with a specific diagnosis.</summary>
