  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is listening to music of the participant's choice for 15 minutes before and during the turning procedure which takes approximately 3 minutes.                                                                                                                  Participants will be asked for their choice of music pre-operatively and will listen to this choice post-operatively.                                                                                                                                        This study will use a single blind randomised cross-over design.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Participants will be randomly assisgned to an intervention (music) or control group to begin the study.                                                                                                                                                  Participants' discomfort and anxiety will be measured 15 minutes prior to and immediatley after the turning procedure.                                                                                                                            After completion of the first arm of the study, participants will then 'cross over' into the opposite arm and the protocol repeated.                                                                                                                                        Based on previous research we anticipate each arm to take approximately 20 minutes with a 2 hour wash-out period between arms.                                                                                                                  Thus participants will complete the whole protocol in about 2 hours and 40 minutes. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies demonstrate that critically ill patients experience anxiety, pain and discomfort as part of their hospital stay. Being subject to numerous procedures common in the intensive care unit such as turning, endotrachael suctioning and wound care impact adversely on patients' experiences. The discomfort associated with these procedures can result in a number of stress sequela for patients that can be detrimental to their health and well-being in terms of their discomfort and anxiety levels. The challenge for nurses working in intensive care settings is to find ways to reduce these stressful experiences. Researchers hypothesize that listening to music is one way of reducing activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)axis that induces release of various hormones particularly cortisol which reduces immune function and peripheral perfusion. Stress reduction can potentially reduce HPA axis activation and enhance immediate, short- and longer-term.patient outcomes, in a clinical setting. The theoretical basis of music as an intervention for anxiety lies in its ability to promote relaxation and improve mood through the autonomic nervous system, which controls the stress response. It is believed that the auditory stimulation of music enhances activation of a number of neurotransmitters thereby diverting feelings of anxiety, fear and pain resulting in a more positive perceptual experience.</summary>
