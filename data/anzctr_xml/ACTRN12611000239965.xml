  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a trial with one experimental treatment condition where, following an initial assessment session in which participants are also taught basic calming techniques, each participant serves as their own 2-week wait list control then engages EMDR therapy for treatment of symptoms consistent with PTSD.  The minimal calming intervention includes teaching calm breathing, safe place, and identifying coping resources. EMDR therapy will utilise eye-movements as the dual attention task during desensitisation of trauma memories. EMDR therapy will follow the standard EMDR protocol outlined by Shapiro (2001). EMDR therapy is administered in 60-90 minute individual sessions on alternate days with one of 2 EMDR therapists and a translator over 17 days. Participants will receive a maximum of 10 active treatment sessions. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 3 month follow-up assessment following the end of therapy, resulting in a participation duration of approximately 4 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait list controlled. The duration of the waitlist period for each participant is 2 weeks.
Experimental conditions: (1) EMDR-with eye movements whereby participants act as their own control. 
There is not a seperate control group.
Note: The wiatlist control consisted of a minimal stabilization intervention. Whereby, following the initial asessment, and prior to the two week waitlist period,  basic calming techniques were taught to each participant (safe place and calm breathing). Participants supports and coping resources were also identified. Att he end of the initial assessment it took approximately 20mins to teach calming techniques, and participants were encouraged to use the techniques should they feel distressed during the waitlist period.</comparator>

Following an initial face-to-face assessment interview to assess trauma history and current symptoms consistent with PTSD, and at the end of the assessment participants are also taught 2 calming techniques and their coping resources are identified, participants will then be placed on a 2 week wait list for EMDR treatment. Post-treatment and 3 month follow-up assessment will be conducted by a second Timorese health worker/contact person involved in the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of EMDR when it used to treat Timorese people (aged 18-65) suffering from trauma realted symptoms consistent with PTSD. Since the efficacy of EMDR for PTSD has been established, this study will examine its effectiveness in a post-conflict, developing, Eastern nation. The aim is to treat 20 Timorese individuals suffering from PTSD symptoms using a maximum of 10 EMDR sessions provided on alternate days. A second aim is to examine the underlying mechanisms of EMDR by investigating the psychophysiolgical correlates of EMDR when these tasks are used. Findings of effectiveness will be discussed with reference to the utility and cultural appropriateness of EMDR, and the underlying mechanisms will be discussed with reference to orienting response and working memory theories of how EMDR may work. Implications for clinical practice in Timor Leste and directions for future research will also be discussed. </summary>
