  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>This trial does is not aimed at one particular health condition but rather prevention of many conditions which are associated with modifiable lifestyle factors such as lack of exercise or smoking. The two main health conditions preventable by our intervention are cardiovascular disease and cancer.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>We have developed a web-based decision aid (My Health Check) for 30 to 69 year olds, based on both evidence and personal preferences. Users are asked to complete a questionnaire which includes questions about their age, gender, and health behaviours relevant to My Health Check (up to 10 depending on their age and gender). They are also asked to rate how difficult they would find each health-check activity. Then they are asked to indicate how important each of four attributes (factors determined by focus groups as important when making decisions about preventive health activities) are to them. My health check then displays a list of health behaviours, ranked from greatest potential for gain to least potential for gain. Completing the questionnaire and interactive components of the decision aid could take up to 45 minutes, although this time may vary depending upon the responses to the questionnaire and how many of the links the user clicks on and reads. It must be completed in one go, participants cannot leave it and return later.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of the intervention group (intervention  =  My Health Check(MHC) website) who, three months later, have adopted at least one self-identified health preventive behaviour compared to the proportion of controls who adopt at least one self-identfied health preventative behaviour. 
This will be assessed using an online questionnaire. Participants will be sent an email with a link to the questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months after using the  'My Health Check' website</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of the intervention and control group who indicate they are likely to change their behaviour as a result of either MHC or the standard information. This will be assessed in the online questionnaire following either the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after using the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of the intervention and control group who indicate they found the information helpful. 
This will be assessed in the online questionnaire following intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after visiting the website .</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of  the intervention and control group whose rankings of the top 3 self- identified health preventative behaviour are consistent with maximising health gains. 
This will be assessed by comparing the participant's response with what the response would have been if it was based only on the first two attributes (avoid premature death and avoid chronic illness).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after visiting the website.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of the intervention group who adopt at least one of the health preventive behaviours based on the one of the top three behavours from the burden of disease data compared with the proportion of controls who adopt one of these behaviours. 
Note: this is similar to the primary objective but differs in that the behaviours are not ones which the user has chosen, but the behaviours which will result in the best health outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months after the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of the intervention and control group who change their top 3 priority behaviours after using th itervention (either MHC or the standard information).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after visiting the website.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Hunter Valley Research Foundation will recruit 1,100 participants by random digit dialling. Eligible participants who agree to be in the study will be asked a few questions, including their age, gender, mailing and email address. An ID number (from which age group and gender can be determined) will be generated for each participant at the time. They will then be asked to visit the My Health Check website where they can read the Participant Information Sheet and consent for the study online. Once participants have registered and completed the online consent, they will be randomised into either intervention or control groups using an algorithm (developed by the clinical trials centre (CTC)) which will ensure equal distribution of two age groups (under 50, 50 and over) and gender into the intervention and control arms of the study. Participants will then view the appropriate website.</concealment>
