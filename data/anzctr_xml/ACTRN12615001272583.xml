  <interventions>
    <interventions>On each study day, subjects will consume either (i) 20g whey protein concentrate, (ii) 5g guar gum, (iii) 20g whey protein concentrate + 5g guar gum each sweetened with 60mg sucralose or (iv) placebo (60mg sucralose alone) dissolved in 150 ml water (t = -20 min). 15 minutes later, subjects will eat a mixed standardized meal (65g powdered potato (Deb, Epping, NSW, Australia) reconstituted with 200ml water containing 20g glucose, 5g 3-O-methyl-glucose (3-OMG, a marker for glucose absorption), and one egg yolk containing 100 microL 13C-octanoic acid, within 5 min (t = -5-0 min). Breath samples will be collected immediately before, and every 5 minutes after, meal ingestion in the first hour and every 15 minutes for a further 3 hours for the measurement of gastric emptying . Venous blood sample (10 ml each) will be collected at t= -15, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 min for the measurements of blood glucose, serum 3-OMG, and plasma GLP-1, insulin and glucagon concentrations using established assays of our laboratory. At the same intervals used for blood sampling, appetite and gastrointestinal sensations will be assessed by means of validated 100 mm visual analogue scales. Each study day is separated by a 4 day wash-out period. Patients will be supervised during consumption of the preload and the mashed potato meal. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The number of participants to be included in the study is based on power calculations performed by a professional biostatistician, Ms Kylie Lange. Based on our previous work it was determined that the inclusion of 21 participants would enable the detection of 0.6 mmol/l difference in mean blood glucose concentrations after the test meal between treatments. Significance was set at P = 0.008 to enable correction for multiple post-hoc testing and power of 80%. 25 volunteers with type 2 diabetes, to allow for dropouts, will be recruited</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have previously demonstrated that consuming a mixture of whey protein and guar gum (a dietary fibre) before a meal (as a preload) can slow stomach emptying and improve blood sugar control after the meal in people with type 2 diabetes. In the current study, we want to compare the effects of the whey protein and guar gum given either separately or in combination in people with type 2 diabetes.
The current study is designed to evaluate the acute effects of whey protein and guar gum given in advance of the main meal either alone or in combination, on postprandial glycaemia (glucose levels after a meal), gastric emptying, glucose absorption, and the release of gut hormones and insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes.</summary>
