  <interventions>
    <interventions>Regional anaesthesia technique that is appropriate for the creation of arteriovenous fistula. (Regional anaesthetic technique involves the administration of any local anaesthetic agent to the upper limb brachial plexus for the purpose of anaesthetising the brachial plexus. These blocks include interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicullar, axillary blocks or any combination of the above.) The decision to administer a regional anaesthetic is at the discretion of the anaesthetist and surgeon involved. This study is observational only and will not be altering established practice.
The surgery itself is expected to take between 30 and 90 minutes. Patients will be followed up prospectively for 6 weeks from the time of surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>General anaesthesia technique for the creation of arteriovenous fistula. This involves the administration of agents to induce unconsciousness and prevent movement during the operation. For the purposes of this study, the use of a supraglottic or infraglottic airway device defines that general anaesthesia has taken place.
Patients will be followed up prospectively for 6 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>As this is a pilot study with the aim of moving towards a randomised control trial, the primary aim is to obtain a target recruitment rate at each hospital. That is, how many patients are eligible for inclusion in a future randomised trial, based on our inclusion criteria. As this trial is observational, there is no requirement for patients to consent to participate in this study.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years from start of recruitment, with a minimum timeframe of 1 year from start of recruitment to be able to establish this data (i.e. annual target recruitment rate).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Another important primary outcome for this pilot study is to assess the ability of a new online data collection tool to capture all relevant data. Data has to be entered by research personnel at each hospital which can be performed either after the six-week period of observation or contemporaneously. Thus, another of our primary outcomes is to determine the completion rate of our online data collection tool. The software used will allow for the assessment of completeness of the data collection at each hospital which will be expressed as a percentage.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Kidney disease is a significant health issue, with around 2500 new patients requiring treatment every year (Australian data). Around half of these patients will need a surgical connection between their artery and vein (an arteriovenous fistula or AVF) to facilitate being connected to a machine that functions like a kidney (a haemodialysis machine). There are many methods of providing anaesthesia for the creation of an AVF including a local anaesthetic-based technique to numb the entire limb where the AVF will be created, or a general anaesthesia-based technique where consciousness is lost. It is currently not known whether any particular anaesthetic technique is superior. Theoretical advantages of a local anaesthetic-based technique (also known as a regional anaesthetic) include the avoidance of a low blood pressure and better surgical conditions by making the artery and vein larger which may prolong the life of the fistula. On the other hand, potential disadvantages of a regional anaesthetic include the risk of nerve injury. There have been no good quality studies evaluating both these issues, although smaller studies have suggested benefit of a regional anaesthetic technique.

The aim of this study is to obtain prospective data from four hospitals regarding the six-week outcomes for patients having their first AVF created under a regional anaesthetic or a general anaesthetic. Patients will be recruited over two years. All four hospitals perform a significant number of regional anaesthetics for this procedure. The main purpose of this study is to determine the number of patients that would be eligible for a future comparative looking at the outcomes of AVF failure and peripheral neural injury; and to determine whether there are appropriate infrastructure mechanisms to collect relevant data for a future comparative trial. Another purpose of this study is to determine the direction of benefit (if any) of using a regional anaesthetic technique over a general anaesthetic technique for this surgery. This data will allow us to assess the feasibility of implementing a future trial where patients will be randomly allocated to receive either a regional anaesthetic or a general anaesthetic for this operation.

Determining the impact of anaesthetic technique on six-week outcomes is important as it has the potential to change anaesthetic practice significantly. Reducing the overall complication rate is beneficial to patients with end stage kidney disease. This will facilitate a smooth transition into haemodialysis after initial AVF creation.
