  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Participants of the training groups participated in individual 3 times per week, for 50 minutes sessions of EMG feedback upper muscle training and others participants participated of EMG-controlled exoskeletal upper limb powered orthosis for exercise training supervise by one physiotherapist with the same background during 2 months.
EMG Feedback: The participants realized series of flexion/ extension movements of the elbow, wrist and fingers joints. During the accomplishment of these exercises, the participants seated in front of the computer and will have visual aid of one feedback indicating how much of muscular contraction it must be produced for the accomplishment of each movement.  
EMG-Controlled Exoskeletal training: During the sessions the particpants realized series of functional upper limbs tasks , such as, to move blocks, boxes and other utensils etc. There is a active-assisted therapy.  During active-assisted training, the Exoskeletal provided assistance (by EMG activity trigger) in functional task if the subject was unable to reach it independently.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Participants of the control group  participated in individual weekly 50 minutes sessions of conventional physiotherapy, that involves strength, stretching and functional training exercises during 2 months. The treatment can vary as individual necessities.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compared the effects of 3 differents rehabilitation programs for stroke patients with upper limbs functional disabilities. Participants will take part in a 2 months supervised rehabilitation program  3 times per week, for 1 hour. We hypothesized that stroke survivors with persistent weakness after stroke would be able to safely and effectively control the EMG exoskeletal orthosis, allowing them to perform exercise training with the device.</summary>
