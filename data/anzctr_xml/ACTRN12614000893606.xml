  <interventions>
    <interventions>Immediately after finishing intrathecal injection, patients in the control group will be laid supine with a 10-15 degree tilt to the left and their lower limbs straight. The drug and dose of intrathecal injection will remain the choice of the anaesthetist and will not be controlled in this study.

Patients in the intervention group will be laid supine with a 10-15 degree tilt to the left and their lower limbs flexed at the hips and knees maintained for 45 seconds before straightening them as per the control group.

Note that if patient cannot tolerate the positioning, the manoeuvre is to be discontinued immediately and anaesthesia positioning will be continued with the patient's lower limbs straight as per the control group.

Measurement and documentation of the block height will take place every 3 minutes post intrathecal injection using ice to test cold sensation in the anterior axillary line</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess whether, following a spinal anaesthetic for caesarean, transient maternal hip and knee flexion in the left lateral tilt supine position can allow caesarean section to commence earlier than traditional positioning with lower limbs straight.
If this technique safely speeds up the onset of "adequate" surgical block suitable for the caesarean operation, it can potentially reduce the rate of caesarean sections requiring general anaesthetics. It is well established that in pregnant women requiring caesarean section most of the anaesthesia related risks have higher rate under general anaesthesia in comparison to spinal anaesthesia.
