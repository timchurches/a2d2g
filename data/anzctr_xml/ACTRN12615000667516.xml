  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in this study have central venous access devices (CVADs) used in adult intensive care departments.  Consenting patients will have their CVADs secured with one of the following randomly assigned dressings and securements:
Arm 1: Tissue Adhesive (TA) is a medical grade 'superglue'
(cyanoacrylate) used mainly to close skin lacerations/wounds as an alternative to sutures and staples. Within this study it will be applied to the CVAD insertion site, and used in addition to a chlorhexidine-impregnated bordered polyurethane dressing and sutures.
Arm 2: Sutureless Stabilisation Device (SSD) have a large adhesive padded footplate with locking clasp made of hard plastic or self-gripping soft fasteners. SSD are used in addition to bordered polyurethane.
Arm 3: Integrated securement and dressing products which combine the durability and visibility of the transparent polyurethane, whilst including an absorbent pad and additional security via bordering. A chlorhexidine-impregnated disc and suture will also be used.
Arm 4 (Control): Bordered polyurethane (BPU) dressings involve a clear polyurethane with an added external adhesive border of foam or cloth fabric. They are routinely used in conjunction with suture and are chlorhexidine impregnated.
The randomly allocated dressing will be applied until completion of therapy. The dressing will be applied at CVAD insertion and then changed every 7 days, or on disruption of the dressing integrity.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Feasibility outcomes will be assessed using descriptive statistics. Analysis will be intention to treat with patients the unit of measurement. Baseline group comparisons will be by clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of CVAD and dressing failure/100 devices and /1,000 device days (95% CIs) will summarise treatment impacts, with group differences tested. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (+ log rank Mantel-Cox test) will compare failure over time. Secondary endpoints of dwell-time, costs, dislodgement, occlusion, thrombosis, colonisation (skin/tip), infection (local/CLABSI/CRBSI/ BSIs), breakage, patient/staff satisfaction scores, adverse events and treatment group failures will be compared between groups using parametric/nonparametric techniques. Cox regression will test the effect of patient and device variables associated with failure e.g. insertion site, antimicrobial catheters, delirium. Analyses will adjust for stratification factors, and regression models will allow for clustering by hospital/ward. Data will be exported into PASW after cleaning outlying figures, missing and implausible data, with a random 5% sample of source data re-checked. All attempts will be made to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. P &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>About 500,000 Australians need a Central Venous Access Device (CVAD) each year for intravenous administration of medicines, chemotherapy and fluids. Insertion of these devices poses great procedural risk and complications are common during subsequent use. Between 20 and 50% of CVADs fail prior to treatment being complete. This includes CVADs becoming partially or wholly dislodged, occluded, thrombosis of the vein, fractured catheters, severe pain, or a bloodstream infection. These complications are associated with patient suffering, prolonged hospitalisation, more expensive healthcare costs and increased mortality.  

Two key factors in preventing complications are (i) securement - that CVADs are adequately secured to the skin, and (ii) dressings - that the incision is covered to prevent infection. CVAD securement has traditionally been via sutures, with a simple polyurethane dressing. This approach (sutures plus simple polyurethane) has been dominant since the 1980s, despite significant evidence of increased bloodstream infections. New alternative securement and dressing options have become available that may be superior to suture and simple polyurethane dressings for preventing complications, but these have not yet been adequately tested for efficacy or cost-effectiveness. 

CVAD securement and dressings cost the Australian health system millions of dollars each year, yet there is currently no high quality evidence from independent trials to guide decision making and practice on this topic. The proposed study is a high quality, pilot randomised controlled trial, designed to assess the feasibility of undertaking a full-scale efficacy randomised controlled trial, and provide preliminary data for an NHMRC project grant application. The full study would aim identify clinically- and cost-effective securement and dressing approaches that prevent CVAD failure. The 4 group trial will test 3 alternatives to standard care, a novel product  tissue adhesive (medical super-glue), and two commercial alternatives. This design will efficiently and rapidly test numerous treatments. The trial will additionally evaluate the acceptability of products to patients and clinicians, and apply an integrated approach to knowledge translation.
