  <interventions>
    <interventions>Maladaptive Perfectionism intervention: primary school children (aged 10-12, co-ed) initially complete baseline questionnaires, then received two intervention lessons (each 45 minutes in length) delivered once per week over 2 weeks by a skilled study team member in a school classroom setting. Lessons focussed on identifying/defining perfectionism; and the difference between adaptive and maladaptive perfectionism; and, and the value in making mistakes and being willing to give something a 'go'. Developmentally appropriate individual and group-based activities and media were specifically developed for the study. Post-intervention questionnaires were completed within the week of the second intervention lesson. A final assessment, using the same questionnaire as per baseline and post-intervention, was undertaken one month post intervention.

Promoting Self-Compassion intervention: primary school children (aged 10-12, co-ed) initially complete baseline questionnaires, then received two intervention lessons (each 45 minutes in length) delivered once per week over 2 weeks by a skilled study team member in a school classroom setting. Lessons focussed on identifying/defining self-compassion; being compassionate (self and others), understanding that everyone makes mistakes, being kind to oneself to support resilience.  Developmentally appropriate individual and group-based activities and media were specifically developed for the study. Post-intervention questionnaires were completed within the week of the second intervention lesson. A final assessment, using the same questionnaire as per baseline and post-intervention, was undertaken one month post intervention.</interventions>
