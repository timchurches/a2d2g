Experimental: PV-10 - Subjects will receive intralesional PV-10 to all Study Lesions on study Day 1. PV-10 should be re-administered at 28-day intervals until complete response, disease progression or study termination occurs.

Active Comparator: Chemotherapy or Oncolytic Viral Therapy - Subjects will receive (a) dacarbazine (intravenously at 850 m/m2) or temozolomide (orally at 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days), administered at consecutive 28-day intervals, or (b) intralesional talimogene laherparepvec administered on an initial 21 interval followed by consecutive 14 day intervals, until complete response, disease progression or study termination occurs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an international multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of
      single-agent intralesional PV-10 versus systemic chemotherapy or intralesional oncolytic
      viral therapy to assess treatment of locally advanced cutaneous melanoma in patients who (1)
      are not candidates for targeted therapy and (2) are not candidates for an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor. Subjects in the comparator arm will receive the Investigator's choice of
      dacarbazine (DTIC), temozolomide (TMZ) or intralesional talimogene laherparepvec as
      determined by Investigator preference and standard of care in the Investigator's country or
      region. Effectiveness will be assessed by comparison of progression-free survival (PFS)
      between all intent-to-treat (ITT) subjects in the two study treatment arms.</summary>
