    <statisticalmethods>Data will be compared with an independent sample t test or MannWhitney U test or chi square test as appropriate. Differences between variables over time will be analysed by paired t test or a repeated-measures analysis of variance (for multiple time points). A conventional alpha level of less than 0.05  will be used for all significance testing.

We did not have any previous data to help us with sample size calculation. Hence, we did an interim analysis after collecting data for 100 FBs. We defined fluid responders as an increase in MAP of at-least 5 mm Hg, 1 hour after administration of the FB,. We had 14% of patients who were classified as responders, hence with an assumed true prevalence of 0.14, with sensitivity of 0.8, specificity of 0.9, and power of 95% and desired precision of 0.05, we needed to study 498 FBs. We examined 500 fluid boluses in the study to allow for contingencies.  .

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective study was performed in a tertiary referral centre ED, where the number, types, and volumes of fluid bolus (FB); Indications of fluid bolus.; and their perceived success rates were recorded. The physiological effect of these FBs on blood pressure (MAP, mmHg), heart rate (HR, per minute), respiratory rate (RR, per minute) and temperature (Temp, Â°C) were recorded before, and 10 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hour and 4 hour after the FB. 

We hypothesized that, in a tertiary level ED of an Australian teaching hospital, FB therapy will have varied indications and have limited physiological efficacy. </summary>
