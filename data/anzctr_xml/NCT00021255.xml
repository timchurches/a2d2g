             ultrasound and/or CT scan and/or MRI, and bone scan. In cases of positive bone scans,
             bone X-ray evaluation was mandatory to rule out the possibility of metastatic bone

    <summary>Primary objective:

        -  Compare disease-free survival in women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
           (HER2)-neu-expressing node-positive or high-risk node-negative operable breast cancer
           treated with adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel with or without
           trastuzumab (Herceptin) vs trastuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin.

      Secondary objective:

        -  Compare overall survival of participants treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxic effects (including cardiac) of these regimens in these participants.

        -  Compare quality of life of participants treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy of these regimens in
           these participants.

        -  For substudy: Compare peripheral levels of shed HER2-neu extracellular domain with
           fluorescence in situ hybridization in predicting outcome in participants treated with
           these regimens.</summary>
