    <interventions>After stratification, patients will be randomized to receive either:

MDex: Patients will take oral melphalan at a dose of 0.22 mg/kg and oral dexamethasone at 40 mg daily for four consecutive days at the beginning of each cycle (days 1-4)every 28 days (MDex). 

or 

BMDex: cycles 1 and 2 = MDex (as above) with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 28 day cycle,
cycles 3  8 = MDex with bortezomib at 1.3 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 35 day cycle.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare in patients treated with melphalan and dexamethasone  or bortezomib, melphalan and dexamethasone: the hematologic response after 3 cycles.This will be scored as improved, stable or worsened after 3, 6 and 9 cycles of therapy, then every 6 weeks until disease progression or until 2 years after randomization. After disease progression the patients will be followed for survival and subsequent therapy at least every 3 months for at least 2 years.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hematological response at completion of therapy; 

The hematologic response will be scored as improved, stable or worsened after 3, 6 and 9 cycles of therapy, then every 6 weeks until disease progression or until 2 years after randomization. After disease progression the patients will be followed for survival and subsequent therapy at least every 3 months for at least 2 years. Secondary endpoints include hematologic and amyloid disease responses, and overall survival at 12 and 24 months. Patients will be followed until death and the date of death must be recorded.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>organ response rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months; 

Amyloid-related organ response will be evaluated on the basis of the accepted criteria described below: 

An improvement of one or more affected organ(s) is defined by:
For the Kidneys: a 50% reduction in 24-hour urine protein excretion in the absence of progressive renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance decreased by a minimum of 25% over baseline).

For the Heart (echocardiograms must be performed at the same institution): a minimum of 2 mm reduction in the mean left ventricular thickness (average of posterior wall and septal thickness) by echocardiogram,

or improvement of ejection fraction (EF) by at least 20%,

or reduction of NT-proBNP of 30% and more than 300 ng/L over the starting value.
For the Liver:
 a minimum of 50% decrease of an initially elevated alkaline phosphatase level,

or reduction in the size of the liver by at least 2 cm (determined by physical exam, US, CT or MRI). 

Improvement in organ function must be confirmed at the next visit, in the absence of worsening of any other organs unless worsening is considered a treatment adverse event.
The Investigators may elect to repeat seemingly spurious results.


amyloid-related organ involvement will be scored as improved, stable or worsened after 3, 6 and 9 cycles of therapy, then every 6 weeks until disease progression or until 2 years after randomization.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We propose to test in a phase III study (oral melphalan and dexamethasone (MDex), the standard therapy for AL patients who are not autologous candidates for stem cell transplant (ASCT), against bortezomib added to MDex (BMDex). The hematologic response rate with MDex is 60% with 30% complete responses. The median overall survival with MDex is 5.1 years and the median progression free survival is 3.8 years. The basis for the combination of BMDex includes the high activity of bortezomib in AL, particularly the high complete response rate and the rapidity of hematologic response to bortezomib and dexamethasone, and the large clinical experience in phase II and phase III studies with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone in myeloma. 

Untreated patients diagnosed with AL who are not candidates for stem cell transplant with melphalan 200 mg/m2 are the target population. Patients who are eligible for SCT with melphalan 200 mg/m2 but who decline the procedure can be enrolled in the study as a subgroup with stratified randomization. Because many newly diagnosed AL patients present with limited organ reserve, the eligibility criteria take into consideration the impact of cardiac involvement on overall survival using cardiac biomarker staging. Stage I and II patients will be eligible and stage III patients will be enrolled in an ancillary phase II study.</summary>
