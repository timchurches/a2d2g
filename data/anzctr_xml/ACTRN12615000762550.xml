  <interventions>
    <interventions>  This is a two-arm, double blind intervention feeding trial that will involve volunteers (16-50yrs). We aim to recruit 50 participants who will be split into two groups. In group one the participants will receive blackcurrant extract (240mg anthocyanins via oral capsule, everyday for 6 weeks) and participate in fatiguing/cognitive performance (week 1 and week 7). In group two the participants will receive a matched sugar placebo (240mg fructose and glucose via oral capsule, everyday for 6 weeks) and participate in fatiguing/cognitive performance (week 1 and week 7). The fatiguing sessions is a cycle test for 30 secs intervals. The fatigue threshold is calculated as the intensity where the individual displays a decline in peak cycle power output and a blood lactate level above their lactate threshold. this will vary between participants depending on their fitness level. Participants will complete the 30 secs cycle with 1 minute rest intervals until they are tired. They will complete this cycle test at the beginning of week one twice (once for baseline and to establish fatigue threshold) and then twice at the end of week seven. These sessions will be administrated by a physiotherapist and a qualified first aider will also be present. The cognitive performance will take 15 - 20 minutes (twice at both weeks 1 and 7) and consists of computerized tests. Over the 6 week feeding period the participants will be asked to consume their supplements (blackcurrant or placebo) in the morning at the same time. At the beginning of the week they will be asked to complete an online diet, energy, health and mood (PoMs) questionnaire. This questionnaire will ask them about their adherence to the pill schedule. Furthermore, participants will collect their pills once a week from the trial coordinator, who will also discuss adherence with the participants at that time. Randomization will be performed using a randomization schedule designed by a biostatistician, with study investigators and subjects blind to group allocation.   </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive performance</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive performance will be assessed at the familiarization session and in the main part of the trial. In the main trial, participants will be asked to perform a series of computerised tasks designed to test cognitive functioning. This will occur prior to, and immediately after performing repeated (usually 4-5) 30 second Wingate cycle tests designed to induce physical fatigue. Cognitive performance will be tested using 5 tasks; stroop, digit symbol substitution, trail making and complex reaction time,serial sevens, which examine various aspects of cognitive processing.  This will be assessed at week one and at week seven.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical exercise performance</outcome>
      <timepoint>Exercise performance is assessed on a stationary cycle ergometer, participants will be asked to cycle at maximum speed at braking torque (4% body weight) for 30 seconds. Using the participants physical performance measures: cycle work output (peak/average), physical fatigue index, lactate threshold (anaerobic capacity), blood glucose and ratings of perceived excertion parameters, we aim to assess changes in physical performance in the main trial before and after exercise-induced fatigue. This will be assessed at weeks one and seven of the trial. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Leukocyte mitochondrial DNA fragility</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mitchondrial fragility will be measured (i) pre-treatment; blackcurrant or placebo, (ii) just before and (iii) immediately after exercise induced fatigue or relaxation period, and finally (iv) after 20 minutes recovery period (all measured at week 1 and week 7). We aim to determine the effect of blackcurrant consumption over a 6 week period and/or exercise-induced fatigue on mitochondrial DNA. This involves isolating leukocyte DNA and using 'nested' PCR methodology using specific oligonucleotides that recognise a specific region of mitochondrial DNA that is susceptible to oxidative stress.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Recruitment. Participants will be recruited from a flyer posted on the appropriate notice boards local research institutes and community gyms. All interested individuals will have an initial chat with the trial coordinator and be provided with information sheet, health and fitness questionnaires and consent forms to take home for discussion with friends, family or whanau. Potential participants will have 2 weeks to decide whether they would like to take part in the study. Allocation concealment will be used. Study investigators and participants will be blinded from the dietary intervention. Allocation of dietary intervention is undertaken by a fellow scientist who is not involved in this study. Participant treatment allocation is held concealed until completion of the trial and analysis of the data is finished. </concealment>
    <sequence>This is a two-arm double blind intervention nutritional trial examining changes in cognitive performance after exercise induced fatigue. The participants will be split into two groups. Group one: blackcurrant extract and physical and cognitive fatigue. Group two: placebo and physical and cognitive fatigue. Study investigators and participants will be blinded from dietary intervention. Participants will be given their dietary treatment as an opaque gelatin capsule, which will mask the blackcurrant or placebo. Randomization will be performed using a randomization schedule designed by a biostatistician. This software will create two equal columns of random numbers that were allocated to the participants. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The overall aim of this study is to generate results that contribute to the growing meta-analysis data supporting the efficacy of dietary intervention on cognitive performance (Lambourne, &amp; Tomporowski, 2010). In this particular study we examine the effectiveness of a 6-week blackcurrant supplementation on cognitive performance after physical fatigue. Selection of cognitive tasks and calculation of subject power number for this current study are based upon a previous study reported by Haskell and colleagues (2010); Effects of a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement on cognitive function and fatigue during extended multi-tasking, Human Psychopharmacology, 2010, DOI: 10.1002/hup.1144, where the results indicate a 5% improvement in a Stroop cognitive test in people whove been on multivitamins for 9 weeks compared to those on a placebo. Application of these findings to estimate the power number for our 6-week blackcurrant supplementation intervention study indicates that to detect, say, a 0.04 at p=0.05 (one-tailed) for the same Stroop cognitive task the subject numbers required for 80% power needs to be at least 25 per group. Therefore, in this study we aim to use a total of 50 individuals divided into 2 treatment groups; placebo vs. blackcurrant supplementation. Power calculations for this study design were performed using the Genstats ASAMPLESIZE procedure, assuming a one factor ANOVA with blocks. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The influence of physical exercise on cognition is complex and is dependent upon a variety of factors including an individuals, age; gender and fitness level as well the type, intensity and duration of the exercise. Meta analysis reports show that physical exercise (even after one session) can improve mental acuity, whereas long-term high intensity exercise shows a decline in mental performance. Identifying nutritional intervention strategies that support cognitive performance during and/or after exercise would benefit those individuals taking part in sport training regimes that involve exercise-induced physical fatigue. In an attempt to support mental acuity during and after exercise-induced mental fatigue nutritional intervention studies have focused on reducing oxidative stress associated with physical fatigue. However exercise studies investigating the role of antioxidant supplementation on exercise performance show that long-term consumption of antioxidant supplements have no effect on physical fatigue and may actually delay recovery, thereby augmenting any detrimental effect of physical fatigue on cognitive performance. In contrast, consumption of whole fruit, especially berryfruit appears to facilitate recovery after exercise. In particular, eating blackcurrants prior to exercise has been shown to alleviate not only oxidative stress but also improve blood flow to a variety of tissues; increase oxygen delivery and blood lactate clearance. It is therefore feasible that daily blackcurrant consumption as part of sport training strategies facilitates recovery processes after exercise-induced physical fatigue and support cognitive performance. In this study we explore the effect of daily blackcurrant consumption for 6-week on cognitive performance after acute fatigue induced by exercise.</summary>
