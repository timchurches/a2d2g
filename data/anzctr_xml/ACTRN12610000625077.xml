  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants receiving the intervention will use an electronic self-monitoring and self-management program for 6 weeks, accessed via their mobile phone and computer.  The program consists of real time monitoring of symptoms with sms prompts, therapeutic modules, fact sheets, tips, motivational messages and a journal.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two control groups.  

(1.)  An online attention control providing minimal information about depression, anxiety and stress, together with weekly motivational messages for 6 weeks.

(2.)  A waitlist control, who will receive the full electronic self-monitoring and self-management program immediately after the intervention group concludes their treatment (6 weeks after the start of the program).</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via the Black Dog Insititute clinic and website, as well as through advertisements disseminated through community groups and large organisations (e.g. National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Telstra). Participants will provide informed consent and will be enrolled electronically into the study, under the supervision of the studyâ€™s research officer.  The random allocation of participants into conditions will be carried out electronically, under the supervision of a research officer not associated with the study.  Chief Investigators and research officers associated with the study will have no knowledge in advance of the treatments to which participants will be assigned.  Thus, allocation will be concealed using central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate whether a monitoring and self-help program delivered by mobile phone and computers can help people to manage their stress, anxiety or depression.  Participants will be randomly assigned to either a full interactive self-help program, which will include access to real-time self-monitoring with prompts and brief online modules grounded in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy; or a cut-down version of the program where participants will receive motivational messages and minimal information about depression, anxiety and stress as a control condition; or to a waitlist control. We predict those using the full myCompass program will report reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress after the 6 week program and at 18 weeks follow-up.</summary>
