    <summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of subcutaneous (SC) evolocumab
      every 2 weeks (Q2W) and monthly (QM), compared with ezetimibe, on percent change from
      baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in hypercholesterolemic adults unable
      to tolerate an effective dose of a statin (HMG-CoA (5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A)
      reductase inhibitors).</summary>
