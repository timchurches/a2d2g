    <statisticalmethods>The primary evaluation will be done according to the intention to treat principle. For question 1, all randomised patients (target 1000 patients) will be analysed according to their randomised arm. Secondary per-protocol and as-treated analysis will be done. The per-protocol analysis excludes patients that do and do not receive TBI in the chemotherapy and TBI-arm, respectively. The as-treated analysis will categorize the patients according to whether TBI is given or not.
The significance level is determined as 0.05 each for all questions.
Question 1: The one-sided confidence interval for the difference of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 4-year OS will be calculated.
A total of 1000 patients will be randomised. According to our previous experience, the 4-year OS in the control arm (with TBI) is about 70%. Monte-Carlo simulations show, that with a non-inferiority margin of about 8%, the power will be above 80% (given a one-sided alpha of 5%).
Question 2: Kaplan-Meier estimates will be used to estimate EFS. Log-rank test and Cox-regression will be used to compare HSCT using mismatched unrelated donors, haplo-identical family donors or mismatched cord blood.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ALL SCTped 2012 FORUM is a multinational study that explore the efficacy and efficiency of two different chemo-conditioning regimens (Flu/Thio with Treo or ivBu) in comparison to the standard conditioning regimen (TBI/VP16) for children and adolescents with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia undergoing Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation.

Who is it for?
Patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia diagnosed before or equal to the age of 18 and will be undergoing an Allogeneic stem cell transplantation before or equal to the age of 21. 

Study details:
This study will compare 2 different conditioning regimens. Eligible patients will be randomised (allocated by chance) to either total body irradiation containing regimen (TBI) or to non-total body irradiation regimen (non-TBI) and this will be followed by haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  
The study will compare the outcome of children with ALL who receive a total body irradiation conditioning regimen versus irradiation free conditioning followed by haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The study will also compare the outcome after mismatched donors, haploidentical family donors or mismatched cord blood.
