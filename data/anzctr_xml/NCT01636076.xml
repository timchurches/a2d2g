      <outcome>Patient Reported Outcome Measures: COPD Assessment Test - It consists of eight items, each presented as a semantic 6-point differential scale, providing a total score out of 40. A higher score indicates a worse health status. Scores of 0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30 and 31 - 40 represent a mild, moderate, severe or very severe clinical impact of COPD upon the patient.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Reported Outcome Measures: Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Sleep Scale: Without Quantity Subscale - Scoring the MOS Sleep Survey is a two-step process: All items are scored so that a high score reflects more of the attribute implied by the scale name. Each item is converted to a 0 to 100 possible range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. In this format, scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score. For example, a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score.
 Second, items within each scale are averaged together to create the 7 scale scores. Scales with at least one item answered can be used to generate a scale score. Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered. An additional measure is based on the average number of hours sleep each night during the past 4 weeks and are described in outcome measure 15.</outcome>
