  <interventions>
    <interventions>Walking training performed by a servo assistive robotic walker supervised by a physiotherapist for 20 sessions (40 minutes per session), 5 times for week for 4 weeks + conventional physiotherapy. 
Conventional physiotherapy (20 sessions, 40 minutes per session, 5 times for week for 4 weeks) involves exercise for trunk, hand recovery, exercise for tone control, exercise to improve global ability. 
The overall duration of the intervention is 4 weeks and sessions are administered in one-one mode.
The i-Walker is registered as medical electrical equipment in Spain (reg. Number 477/13/EC). The i-Walker s a robotic rollator that integrates sensors and actuators. 
It uses a standard 4-wheeled Rollator AD100 walker frame sized 500mm (W) x 600mm (L) x 850mm (H) modified for this purpose. Actuators are two hub motors, 100mm diameter, integrated in the rear wheels and are used for braking or helping the user. It is composed also by two modified handlebars with brake handle and force measurement; 32 strain gauges mounted in 8 bridges to measure handlebar forces and normal wheels forces, sensors are arranged in the frame to detect forces, tilt and movement, and  an integrated battery supplies power. 
Services provided by the i-Walker are: (i) active motor assistance to compensate lack of muscle force on climbs; (ii) active brake assistance to compensate lack muscle force on descents; (iii) active differential assistance to compensate asymmetric muscle force; (iv) recording of sensor measurements and actuators activities for later evaluation.
During the study we only used the service number 3 named Active differential assistance to compensate unbalanced muscle force. During training the amount of assistance (i.e. braking force in each hand) was reduced by the team following this principle: (i) assistance as needed; (ii) a progressive assistance reduction; (iii) safety concerns; (iv) patients ability to drive the device; (v) the affected leg and arm increase of spasticity.

    <comparator>Walking training performed by parallels bar and aid of physiotherapist for 20 sessions 5 times for week for 4 weeks + a 20 session 5 times for week for 4 weeks of conventional physiotherapy.
This training last 40 minutes per sessions and is administered in one-one mode. During session the physiotherapist help patients in transferring load on paretic leg, help patients during swing phase and correct posture and symmetry of the steps depending on patients degree of ability.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Subjects affected by mild/moderate stroke could benefit more from physiological overground walking training than a walking-like training performed in place with a device providing a body weight support. However patients poor balance and motor asymmetry limit the intensity of the overground training. Aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of an overground walking training performed with the servo-assistive robotic walker (i-Walker) on walking ability, balance and risk of falls in patients with subacute stroke. </summary>
