  <interventions>
    <interventions>All women with PCOS who fullfiled the criteria and agreed to participate in the study will be randomized (by computer-generated randomization) into two groups. Group 1 will be treated with Vitamin D 50000 units once orally for the first week followed by 1000 units orally daily for three months starting from the first day of a spontaneous cycle or progestin withdrawal and 100 mg clomiphene citrate daily orally for five days from day three of the menstrual period. Group 2 will be treated with placebo once orally in the first week followed by placebo daily orally for three months starting from the first day of a spontaneous cycle or progestin withdrawal and 100 mg clomiphene citrate daily orally for five days from day three of menses. Ovulation is confirmed by midluteal serum P values of &gt; 8.0 ng / ml.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Women attending the infertility clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. PCOS is being defined as any women with two out of three criteria 1). Oligo- or anovulation; 2). Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism; and 3). Polycystic ovaries and exclusion of other etiologies (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing's syndrome)</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>During the first visit to the infertility clinics, a thorough routine general medical, menstrual, and obstetrical history will be taken. In addition, a general physical and gynecologic examination will be performed including the womanâ€™s height, weight and waist. The body mass index (BMI) will be calculated for the grading of obesity and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) will also be determined. Women with history and physical examination suggestive of PCOS (infertility, oligomenorrhea, menstrual irregularities, hairsutism, and obesity) will be requested to have hormonal profile. Hormonal profile will be done in the laboratory services of KAUH. It will include: prolactin, TSH, free T4, LH, FSH, DHEA, DHEAs, T, free T, 17-OHP and Andresterone (A). Semen analysis will be done in the laboratory services of KAUH. Moreover, tests of tubal patency (hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy) will be performed as indicated. The obtained information and results will be recorded on a standardized forms developed for the purpose of this research project.  
All women included in this part will have a transvaginal ultrasound scans of the ovaries (this will be performed by experienced sonographer at KAUH).  The presence of polycystic ovaries will be diagnosed by the presence of 12 or more follicles in each ovary measuring 2-9 nm in diameter, and/or increased ovarian volume &gt; 10 cm3 according to international standards.

All women with PCOS who fullfiled the criteria and agreed to participate in the study will be randomized (by computer-generated randomization) assigned by sealed opaque envelopes into two groups. Group 1 will be treated with Vitamin D 50000 units orally for the first week followed by 1000 units daily for three months starting from the first day of a spontaneous cycle or progestin withdrawal and 100 mg clomiphene citrate for five days from day three of the menstrual period. Group 2 will be treated with placebo for three months starting from the first day of a spontaneous cycle or progestin withdrawal and 100 mg clomiphene citrate for five days from day three of menses. Ovulation is confirmed by midluteal serum P values of  &gt;  8.0 ng / ml.</concealment>
