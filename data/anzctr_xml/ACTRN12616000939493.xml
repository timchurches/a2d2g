  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is six weeks of consuming two 'SunGold' kiwifruit per day as part of the customary diet, with the exclusion of vitamin supplements. The control treatment is the customary diet with the exclusion of kiwifruit and vitamin supplements. For all participants there is a three week kiwifruit-free lead in period, a three week kiwifruit-free wash out period at cross-over, and a three week kiwifruit free follow up at the end of the second intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A pilot study of the metabolic effects of long term consumption of SunGold kiwifruit in healthy subjects. The primary hypothesis is that two kiwifruit consumed daily for six weeks will not have any harmful effect as measured by risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the study is to establish whether or not the increased intake of fructose  and glucose resulting from daily ingestion of two kiwifruit could lead to harmful metabolic change, or exposure to glycaemia. Conversely, whether the increase in Vitamin C and other phytochemicals as a result of consuming kiwifruit  could protect against the processes of inflammation and oxidation that lead to long term damage will also be investigated by measuring changes in several biomarkers indicative of inflammation and oxidation in the kiwifruit versus non-kiwifruit groups.
The study will employ a randomised cross-over design in which all subjects ingest two kiwifruit per day or no kiwifruit (their normal diet minus kiwifruit) for six weeks. There will be a kiwifruit-free lead in period of three weeks, a three week washout at cross over, and a kiwifruit-free follow up of three weeks. Blood samples will be taken five times from all subjects:  at the end of lead in, after intervention 1, after washout, at the end of intervention 2, and at the end of the follow up.</summary>
