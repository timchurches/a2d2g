    <interventions>Xenform anterior repair
The procedure for standardised Xenform anterior repair is as follows. Vaginal sub-epithelial layer infiltrated with local anaesthetic/saline solution to aid hydrodissection in the sub-epithelial fascial layer. After midline vertical skin incision a full skin thickness dissection of the anterior vaginal wall made from the level of bladder neck to the vaginal apex and bilaterally to each vaginal sulcus.  The endopelvic fascia is reinforced by standard midline plication with 2-0 polydioxanone suture. A 10" by 7" Xenform graft is shaped to make an anterior based sacrospinous graft.  Graft arms anchored to sacrospinous ligament with a Capio suturing device using 0 Monodec suture.  The graft is tacked to vaginal sulci, apex and bladder neck plus 2 central sutures over the midline fascial plication.using 2.0 PDS. Vagina is closed with a single locking 2-0 polyglactin suture.  Cystourethroscopy after intravenous Indigo carmine is performed.
Performed by Urogynaecologist or urogynaecology fellow
Duration 45-60 minutes</interventions>
    <comparator>Anterior colporrhaphy
The procedure for standardised anterior colporrhaphy is as follows. Vaginal epithelium infiltrated with local anaesthetic/saline solution to aid hydro-dissection within the vaginal epithelial layer.  After midline vertical skin incision a partial skin thickness dissection of the anterior vaginal is made vertically from the level of bladder neck to the vaginal apex and bilaterally to each vaginal sulcus.  The endopelvic fascia is reinforced by standard midline plication with 2-0 polydioxanone suture.  Interrupted lateral sulci sutures of 2-0 polydioxanone from the level of the bladder neck to the vaginal apex. Vaginal epithelium will be trimmed as required and closed with a single locking 2-0 polyglactin suture.  Cystourethroscopy after intravenous indigo carmine is performed.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 92 per group has approximately 80% power to detect a 15% difference between treatment groups in the binary composite outcome, based on a 77% success rate in the control group at one year after surgery (obtained from local hospital audit), with an alpha level at 0.05 (PASS Power and Sample Size Program for Windows 2011, version 8.1, Kayesville Utah). To allow for 15% loss to follow up, a total sample size of 212 will be recruited.

Frequency distributions and means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges will be used to summarise categorical and continuous data, as appropriate.  Chi-square or Fisher exact tests will be used to compare categorical outcomes between treatment groups, and t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests performed for comparisons of continuous outcomes. One interim analysis will be performed, anticipated to occur halfway through the study period, using the OBrien-Fleming spending function to determine the test boundaries. The nominal significance level at the first sequential test is 0.003 and at the final test is 0.049.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Female anterior pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is common.  In POP, the vaginal tissues become weak, causing descent of vaginal walls. In moderate to severe anterior POP, conservative treatments may be unsuccessful. In these cases surgical treatments can include:
*Surgical repair with a patients own tissue (anterior colporrhaphy)
*Surgical repair with reinforcement using a tissue graft to provide additional support.

The aim of this study is to compare two established surgical techniques for anterior POP to determine which has the best result.  The primary outcome will be measured using the following criteria. All three must be met qualify as success: 1) objective measures (anatomical), 2) subjective measures (validated quality of life questionnaire), 3) participant not having repeat procedure for anterior POP recurrence.  The primary outcome will be assessed at one year after surgery.

This is a multicentre blinded prospective randomised trial.  Participants will be randomised to:
1.	Anterior colporrhaphy
2.	Xenform anterior vaginal repair
Both procedures are routinely performed by urogynaecologists in the private and public sectors. 

Xenform Matrix (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) is used in Australia and by the urogynaecologists in Perth in the private and public sectors for surgical repair of POP.  Xenform has been approved since 2010 for POP repair by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration.

For the participants at Hollywood Private Hospital, they will be recruited from the surgeons private rooms.  Participants will be eligible if they have symptomatic anterior POP to the level of the hymen and desire surgical treatment. At recruitment, participants will have a pelvic examination to assess pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q as per International Continence Society).  A validated quality of life questionnaire (QoL) (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory Short Form 20) will also be administered.  POP-Q and PFDI-20 will be repeated one year after the operation.</summary>
