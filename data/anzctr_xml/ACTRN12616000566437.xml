  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physiotherapists are well placed in the primary care setting to promote and assess physical activity of healthy adults but the use of a measurement as intervention approach for physical activity promotion has not been investigated. It is noteworthy, that physical activity intervention studies have reported improvements in physical activity among control group participants who were measured but did not receive the intervention being trialed at the time. This indicates that physical activity measurement, as a potential physical activity promoting intervention, is worthy of investigation.

Following recruitment of eligible participants, they will be randomised to one of two groups: physical activity measurement 1 (PAM1; baseline &amp; 18-weeks) or physical activity measurement 2 (PAM2; baseline, 6, 12 &amp; 18-weeks). The physiotherapist assessor at baseline and 18-weeks will be unaware of the participants group allocation.  To identify a potential measurement effect, the groups will receive the measurement intervention on a different number of occasions depending on group allocation. PAM1 will receive the measurement intervention on 2 occasions (control) and PAM2 will receive the measurement intervention on 4 occasions, over an 18-week period. A different assessor (final year physiotherapy student) will be used for the physical activity assessments at 6 and 12-weeks.

Intervention
Physical activity measurement 1 (PAM1)
Outcome measures for participants randomised to PAM1 will be completed by a physiotherapist at the University of Canberra, giving participants an indication of their fitness and health status at baseline and 18-weeks. At baseline, participants will receive two brochures An active way to better health. National Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults and Dietary Guidelines for Australian Adults from the Department of Health and Ageing. The physical activity guidelines will be briefly discussed but they will not receive any other advice or support for increasing exercise or physical activity levels.

Physical activity measurement 2 (PAM2)
Outcome measures for participants randomised to PAM2 will be completed by a final year physiotherapy student at the University of Canberra, giving participants an indication of their fitness and health status at baseline, 6, 12 and 18-weeks. At baseline, participants will receive two brochures An active way to better health. National Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults and Dietary Guidelines for Australian Adults from the Department of Health and Ageing. The physical activity guidelines will be briefly discussed at each data collection point but they will not receive any other advice or support for increasing exercise or physical activity levels.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA, minutes) measured by accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X) and the Active Australia Survey (AAS). 

Accelerometry will be used to validate the data collected from the AAS. These two continuous measures will be collected at baseline and 18-weeks. The AAS has been designed to measure participation in leisure time physical activity and to assess the participants knowledge of current public health messages about the health benefits of physical activity. It offers a short and reliable set of questions and applies to 1 week preceding the interview, including walking for transport. The AAS has been reported as reliable and of acceptable validity.

Covering the same time period as the AAS, participants will wear an Actigraph GT3X accelerometer for 7-consecutive days over their right hip (held in place with an elastic waist band) while awake. Accelerometers allow an objective measurement of quantity and intensity of movement and have been found to be reliable and valid. The raw data collected by the accelerometer will be used to obtain the time spent in different physical activity intensities. We will use the Freedson Combination energy expenditure algorithm to determine the intensity cut-points. This outcome variable will be used to investigate whether participants have reached the Australian physical activity guidelines (150 minutes MVPA and 5 sessions per week).

      <timepoint>Baseline and 18-weeks.

Please note, accelerometry and the AAS will also be collected for PAM2 at 6 and 12-weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional aerobic capacity (short self-paced step test (STEP protocol)).

The step test is an indirect measure of aerobic capacity, requiring a set of 2 x 20cm steps.Participants step up and down a standardized set of 2 steps, 20cm each 20 times at a self selected pace. Time to complete the test and post-test heart rate are recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 18-weeks.

Please note, the step test will also be conducted for PAM2 at 6 and 12-weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life (AQoL-6D) - short self - administered questionnaire.

The Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instruments are health-related multi-attribute utility quality of life instruments. The AQoL-6D takes 2-3 minutes for the participant to complete and covers the following dimensions - Independent Living, Mental Health, Coping, Relationships, Pain, Senses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 18-weeks.

Please note, the AQoL-6D will also be completed for PAM2 at 6 and 12-weeks.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This study will examine the effect of 6-weekly measurement of physical activity on physical activity undertaken 18-weeks after baseline (adjusting for any between group differences at baseline). The key purpose of this preliminary study is to understand the likely effect of this measurement as intervention approach to inform sample size calculations for a future large-scale trial and therefore, there is no data available to inform power estimates for this study. Data will be analysed according to the intent-to-treat principle based on group assignment. Significance level will be set at p &lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Physiotherapists perceive the provision of physical activity advice as part of their role, and there is some evidence that physiotherapists can counsel effectively for physical activity behaviour change. In addition, simply measuring physical activity levels, without any other intervention, can cause people to change their physical activity behaviours, resulting in more physical activity being undertaken in the daily lives of adults. Considering this, objective measurement of physical activity by physiotherapists may result in favourable increases in their patients physical activity levels. This  novel measurement as intervention approach could prove to be a very efficient yet effective way to incorporate health promoting physical activity changes into physiotherapy consultations, in a number of different settings. The number of physiotherapy consultations per year in Australia has been estimated to be greater than 23 million. With the ever increasing access to objective activity monitoring devices (accelerometers in smartphones, wrist, shoe or arm worn devices etc.) combined with the broad reach of physiotherapy interventions, even a modest effect of a measurement as intervention approach, with accountability to their physiotherapist, may prove to be an efficient approach to increase the populations physical activity levels in a meaningful way. However, preliminary work is required to determine the effects of potential measurement intensity (in terms of the frequency of measurement). 

Methodology: A pilot (two parallel arm) randomized control study conducted over 18-weeks at the University of Canberra will inform a larger study to determine if regular measurement of physical activity by physiotherapists increases physical activity levels in Australian adults (18  64 years old).
