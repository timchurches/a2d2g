  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individuals will be asked to visit the Human Performance Lab at Massey University, Palmerston North on two occasions, 24 hours apart. During the first visit, individuals will have height, weight and blood pressure measured. Individuals will then be asked to provide a blood sample from a vein in their arm. Following this individuals will have their radial and corotid artery assessed via pulse wave analysis/velocity. Individuals will complete a 5 minute resting ECG. Each individual will then complete an incrememntal cycle ergometer test. Exercise commences at 0W and increased at 15W every minute until exhaustion. On completion of the exercise test you will be asked to repeat the blood sampling and corotid and radial pulse wave analysis/velocity measurement. Finally you will be asked to complete an exercise recovery questionnaire, SF36 questionnaire and the Multidisciplinary fatigue inventory-20. On return to the lab 24 hours later each participant will repeat the radial and corotid pulse wave analysis/velocity assessment, blood sampling, incremental exercise test, exercise recovery questionnaire and Multidisciplinary fatigue inventory. The approximate duration will be an hour and a half for the first day and one hour max on the second data. The tests are administered and supervised by an Exercise Physiologist.</interventions>

      <outcome>Pulse wave analysis and velocity will be assessed with SphygmaCor</outcome>
      <timepoint>Individuals will have pulse wave analysis and velocity tested before the exercise testing. Individuals will have pulse wave analysis and velocity retested 24 hours after initial testing. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Individuals will be asked to complete 6 questions regarding their recovery from peak oxygen consumption exercise testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Individuals will be asked to complete questions, following the initial exercise test, one day post exercise testing, following the second exercise test, day three (day after 2nd exercise test and then to describe how long it takes them to recover in days. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gene response to exercise testing measured by blood samples</outcome>
      <timepoint>Individuals will provide blood samples pre and post exercise testing. Individuals will provide 4 samples across 2 days. The samples will be analysed to see how they change pre and post exercise testing.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation.
Taking peak oxygen consumption  for the CFS subjects, Standard deviation appears to be around 1.8 ml/kg/min, take 0.05 as the significance level. An improvement would be of 1 ml/kg/min and the power 80%. Therefore it is possible to calculate a sample size of 21 required. 

The use of SPSS will allow for descriptive data on each health condition. Results of each health condition will be compared using T-test and Anova.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to show a difference in fatigue measured using physiological outcomes following repeated exercise in three groups of participants. These groups will include, Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalopathy and healthy age matched controls. Although individuals with MS, CFS/ME suffer from fatigue, it is expected that the type of fatigue and the way it affects the body is different and therefore the responses to physical incremental exercise separated by 24 hours will be different. </summary>
