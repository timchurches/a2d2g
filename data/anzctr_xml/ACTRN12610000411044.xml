  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy is a known cause of cretinism and mental retardation. There is now growing recognition that milder iodine deficiency may also be related to cognitive deficits. Mild iodine deficiency has been consistently found in all studies of pregnant women living in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian and New Zealand governments have recently mandated the use of iodised salt in breads as a strategy to combat iodine deficiency in the general population. However, this strategy may not sufficiently increase iodine intakes to meet the requirements of pregnant women, and Food Standard Australia and New Zealand has recommended that these women take a daily dietary supplement containing 150 ug/day of iodine. However, no studies have examined the effect of iodine supplementation in pregnancy on clinical outcomes of mothers or babies in regions with mild iodine deficiency. The aims of this study are to assess the effect of maternal iodine supplementation during pregnancy at levels designed to meet the recommended dietary intake on neurodevelopment of children at 2 years of age (primary outcome), and pregnancy outcomes and general health and wellbeing of mothers. Eligible pregnant women will be randomly assigned to take either a iodine supplement (150ug/d) or placebo dairly from enrolement to the end of pregnancy. Neurodevelopment of children will be assessed using Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development and maternal general health and mental function will be assessed using validated questionnaires.</summary>
