    <interventions>Dietary sodium intake was assessed via 24hr dietary recall methods (exposure).  The outcome of this study is assessing the change in sodium intake between study years 2007 and 2011/12. 
For the 2007 study i.e. 2007 Children's Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (CNPAS)) data was collected during Feb-Aug 2007. 
For the 2011/12 study i.e. the 2011/12 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (NNPAS)) data was collected May 2011- June 2012. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>2007 CNPAS: The target quota for each of the following age groups: 2-3, 4-8, 9-13 and 14-16 years was 1000 participants, to which a 400 booster sample was later provided by the state of South Australia to provide more detailed estimates for that state.  This study was designed and conducted by Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and University of South Australia and no power calculations are provided. 

2011/12 NNPAS: The sample was designed to ensure that within each state or territory, each person had an equal chance of selection and that reliable estimates could be produced for each state and territory.  A total of 12,153 people participated in the survey.  To enable comparison to the 2007 CNPAS survey, our analysis is restricted to children aged 2-16 years (n=2548).  The NNPAS was conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and no power calculations are provided. 

Analysis Plan:
 Analyses will account for complex survey design of both surveys (i.e. population weightings, clustering, stratification).  A two-sample t-test will be used to compare differences in continuous variables across survey years and a two-sample test of proportions will be used to assess differences in categorical variables across survey years. For food group analysis, differences in the contribution of sodium from food groups will be assessed by examination of survey design adjusted 95% confidence intervals. PC-Side will be used to estimate usual sodium intake and the proportion of children who consume more than the age-specific dietary recommendation, adjustments will be made for day type of diet recall and dietary recall sequence. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The aim of this study was to assess trends in sodium intake from food sources among Australian children and adolescents from 2007 to 2011-12.  To do this we have completed secondary data analysis of two existing data sets, the 2007 CNPAS and the 2011/12 NNPAS. </summary>
