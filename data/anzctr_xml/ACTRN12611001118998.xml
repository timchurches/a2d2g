    <interventions>Obervation of the effect of the varying pulse duration and frequency on paresthesia perception. Participants are observed for several hours on one day only. The whole study is expected to be completed in 9 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Spinal Cord Stimulation uses pain-masking signals which travel along one or two leads attached from an Implantable Pulse Generator. This patient perceives paresthesia in the area of pain following the programming of the device by the doctor or technician. The programs are based on the electrode polarity, pulse width, pulse frequency &amp; amplitude based on patient feedback of area &amp; type of paresthesia. The programming is done by adjusting the electrode polarity, choosing pulse width &amp; frequency according to the doctor / technicians experience, increasing the amplitude to perception &amp; asking the patient for feedback before trying further parameters. Programming is not usually done following a set matrix of frequency &amp; pulse width. Observational period extends to include the period for which the patient has the implant insitu.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in paresthesia perception related to location and extent of paresthesia begins by patient choosing the favourite/best coverage area from the programmed settings and draws area of pain on Tablet PC Template. All testing is conducted on the chosen electrode configuration. Patient records baseline Pain scores (VAS) historic, recalled pre-implant as well present score with stimulation off and stimulation on. Experienced Spinal cord stimulation programmer determines thresholds for perception, minimum and maximum comfortable which patient records on tablet PC template. Patient also reports paresthesia descriptors and rates percentage pain areas covered on data collection form.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we seek to investigate the effect of varying pulse width and frequency on paresthesia perception. This study seeks to confirm the findings of Yearwood et al (2007, 2010) that varying pulse width can shift the focus of paresthesia and to provide the first findings on the effect of frequency on paresthesia perception. In addition, we will report on the interaction between pulse width and frequency changes.</summary>
