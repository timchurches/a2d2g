  <interventions>
    <interventions>The women attending our clinics are routinely assessed for plevic floor muscle strength when they are examined vaginally. if they cannot contract their pelvic floor muscles, then they are eligible for enrollment in the study subject to their consent. They will all have had at least one visit with a physiotherapist prior to testing to ensure they have been taught the correct method to contract their muscles. The study consists of a 3/D(dimensional) ultrasound of pelvic floor muscles and an EMG (electromyography) of pelvic floor muscles .The women will undergo one ultrasound and one EMG study each over a 2 month period. each takes approximately 20 mins. This take place from when the participant is recruited and is not specific to time after childbirth. Many women present many years after childbirth.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>injury to pelvic floor muscle through childbirth using ultrasound and EMG assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The injury will be assessed at the time of testing using ultrasound and EMG. The time point is when the women attend for these tests (within a 2 month period).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ultrasound will examine for loss of anatomy of the pelvic floor muscles due to trauma from childbirth and EMG will assess for nerve damage to the pelvic floor muscles also from childbirth.</outcome>
      <timepoint>the damage will be assessed at the time of testing using ultrasound and EMG. The time point is when the women attend for these tests (within a 2 month period).</timepoint>
