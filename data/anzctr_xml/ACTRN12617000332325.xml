  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the delivery of the New Medicine Support Service by pharmacists.  Intervention patients will receive up to two telephone or face-to-face consultations (determined by patient preference) with a pharmacist over 4 weeks who will assess patient adherence to their new medicine; identify any medicines related problems; establish any support the patient may need; and answer any questions the patient may have about their new medicine.  In some cases a patient will only receive one consultation if at the first consultation the pharmacist deems it necessary to refer the patient back to their GP.

Consultations will generally take approximately 15 minutes and take place at approximately 2 and 4 weeks after dispensing of the patient's new medicine (study registration).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control patients will not receive the New Medicine Support Service and only the usual medicine counseling from their pharmacist.  Usual medicine counseling is the standard service a pharmacist provides to any patients they dispense newly prescribed medicines to.</comparator>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 712 patients from at least 47 pharmacies will be required.  Estimation of sample size was based on expecting an increase in adherence of 10%, based on a baseline adherence level of 60%, assuming 80% power, a two-sided test and alpha=0.05.  It is expected that each pharmacy can recruit approximately 16 patients over 4-5 months, based on a previous pilot. 

 Descriptive Analysis
Continuous data will be explored using means and standard deviations if the data are approximately normally distributed and medians and inter-quartile ranges if the data are not normally distributed. Categorical data will be described using frequencies and percentages. The following patient characteristics will be described by treatment-arm: age, gender, geographic location and condition the new prescription is for. 

Comparison between treatment arms
Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used for all outcomes. The ITT cohort is defined as all patients within a randomisation arm with measured outcomes or who are considered withdrawn from the study, without revoking consent. However, if a withdrawn patient also wishes to revoke their consent, they will not be included in the ITT analysis. 
To compare medicines adherence between the current practice and intervention arm patients, differences in the categorised MMAS-4, MPR and PDC will be examined using the chi-squared test or Fishers exact test as appropriate. Simple logistic regression will be used to assess unadjusted effect of the NMSS associated with the outcome measure. Multilevel logistic regression will adjust for data clustering (patient and pharmacy) and confounding by age, sex, disease and number of medications. The significance of the variables in the model will be assessed using the Wald chi-squared test and determination of odds ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals. Goodness of fit to the model with be assessed using chi-squared, G-test and the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics. Statistical significance will be assessed at the 5% level.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based on a pilot study conducted in England the New Medicines Service (NMS) was introduced under the NHS community pharmacy contract in the UK in October 2011 as an Advanced Service to provide support for people newly prescribed a medicine for a chronic condition including: asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; type 2 diabetes; hypertension; and conditions requiring antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy. The primary aim of the service is to improve medicines adherence and a randomised controlled trial demonstrated that the service was effective at improving patients adherence to their new medicine by 10%. NPS MedicineWise piloted this service to determine how it could be adapted for delivery in Australia and integrated into the workflow of community pharmacy. Evaluation of the pilot demonstrated that implementation in pharmacies across Australia is feasible and that the service was valued by both pharmacists and consumers. 

Following the successful pilot, this service is now being extended to a larger number of pharmacies. It aims to improve health outcomes by increasing patient adherence to new medicines for chronic conditions. This second phase will explore the ability to scale the service up to a larger number of pharmacies and measure consumer adherence to newly prescribed medicines through a randomised controlled trial.</summary>
