  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each volunteer will be given once daily at the evening time 20 mg lycosome-formulated simvastatin fused with 7 mg of lycopene or the same amount (20 mg) of unmodified simvastatin with no lycopene. Control patients will be given 7 mg of lycopene alone. All study products will be given orally for a period of 4 weeks. Adherence to the study protocol will be monitored by  questioning of the patients and plasma measurements of simvastatin at the end of interventional period.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Medical personal of outpatient clinic of the Sarartov’s Institute of Cardiology will be informed about launching the trial, its major goals and selection criteria for volunteers. Suitable individuals will be invited for preliminary check-up (physical and laboratory investigation) during the initial phase of enrollment. All suitable individuals will be re-screened after wash-out period of the trail before final decision on trial enrollment is made. Allocation is not concealed in the trial.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization of volunteers in the trial will be performed using widely accepted methods such as simple randomization and stratified randomization. Briefly, the software containing random number generator will be applied to database of the volunteers. They assigned group will be considered as a final. The groups will be balanced according to numerical age and gender with special software. Stratified randomization will be used to enhance statistical power of the final results and will ensure equality of groups in secondary selection criteria.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>For the assessment of normally distributed parameters, the Shapiro-Wilk method will be used. Students t-test will be then applied both for paired and unpaired samples. In cases where parameters are not normally distributed Mann-Whitney U- test and Kruskal-Wallis test will be used. ANOVA and ANCOVA will be used with post hoc analysis (Statistica 9 suit, StatSoft; Inc.). Statistical significance between two-tailed parameters was considered to be P&lt;0.05. Sample size determination was performed based on the results of pilot clinical trial. It was determined that a minimum number of patients in each group has to be 30 patients. Due to possibility of drop-outs targeted  number of patients is set to be 40 patients in each group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypercholesterolemia treatment is a challenging task in the modern internal medicine. Diet, exercise and inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) inhibitors are among therapeutic  options in the hypercholesterolemia. However statins are poorly absorbed in the intestine and have a low  bioavailability. Microencapsulation methods are shown to increase intestinal absorption and bioavailability of many drugs. We hypothesize that microencapsulation of statins with lycopene will increase bioavailbility of simvastatin and will enhance its therapeutic effect.</summary>
