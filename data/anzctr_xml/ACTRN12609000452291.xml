  <interventions>
    <interventions>A structured telephone intervention delivered by a cancer nurse. The primary carers of people diagnosed with poor prognosis gastrointestinal cancer (colorectal Duke's stage D, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder, bile duct or small bowel) will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire. Carers will then be randomised into the intervention or control group. Carers in the intervention group will receive five telephone calls from the cancer nurse in the 10 weeks following the patient that they are carer for is discharged from hospital (the first call is at Day 3 post-discharge and then the remaining four will be fortnightly ie Day 17, 31, 45 and 59). Calls will vary in duration and be dependent on each individual carer's need. It is anticipated that calls will last about 20 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Carers assigned to the control group will not receive any additional support and follow-up other than what has been provided or arranged for them (or the person they are caring for) by the treating medical team at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability. Acceptability will be assessed by ascertaining the proportion of carers who complete each call at each time point. Demographic and clinical characteristics of carers allocated to the intevrention group who did or did not accpet or complete each call will be compared to assess the acceptability. Furthermore, qualitative semi-structured interviews will be conducted at 3 months following the patient's hopital discharge and when the intervention is complete in order to gather detailed feedback of participant's views of the intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 3, 17, 31, 45 and 59 after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility. Feasibility of the intervention will be determined by assessing the number of calls required to achieve a successful intervention call. Mean, standard devaitions, median and range of time taken for calls at each time point will also be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 3, 17, 31, 45 and 59 after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy will be measured using The General Self-Efficacy Scale, a 10-item questionnaire that determines a general sense of percived self-efficacy relating to daily life hassles and adaption after experiencing stressful life events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Carer's will be assessed at 1 and 3 month after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients who are admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) for surgery for an upper gastrointestinal malignancy (oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder or bile duct, small bowel) or for Dukes D colorectal cancer will be invited to participate by their surgeon who will 
provide them with written and verbal information about the study and obtain written consent. Patients will be asked to nominate their main carer. 


The surgeon will provide the details of consenting patients to the research coordinator [RC] who will then visit the patient prior to their discharge from hospital.  The RC will explain the study processes in more detail and will obtain 
contact details for the nominated carer and permission from the patient for their carer to be contacted by a member of the research team. 
 

The RC will then contact each nominated carer and arrange to meet them prior to the patientâ€™s discharge from hospital.  The RC will explain the study to the carer, obtain written consent and ask them to complete a baseline self-administered questionnaire.  Demographic information about the carer will be obtained in a short face-to-face interview with the RC. 


The details of consenting carers and patients and baseline data will be forwarded by the RC to a second, independent researcher who will randomly allocate carers to the intervention or control groups using a computer-generated randomisation schedule. This will ensure allocation concealment in that the surgeons and RC who are actively involved in recruiting participants will be unaware of the group allocation sequence.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) will test a novel telephone-based intervention for carers of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. The intervention involves five structured calls from a nurse to the carer over 10 weeks, aiming to improve psychosocial outcomes for carers. This pilot study aims to assess the feasibilty and acceptability of the intervention and determine any impact on carer outcomes. If the results are positive, this telephone intervention will be evaluated in a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) and could be implemented broadly in both metropolitan and rural areas, and could be adapted for other groups of carers.</summary>
