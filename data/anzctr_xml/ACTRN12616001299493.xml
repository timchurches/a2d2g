  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive a one-off individual intervention delivered in the primary care clinic. 
The intervention will involve the following:
In the waiting room, a research assistant will provide intervention participants with an envelope prior to their GP appointment. The envelope will contain: a) a faecal occult blood test kit with: instructions for completion; pathology request form, and: pre-paid postage to mail the kit for analysis.
b) A feedback sheet containing screening recommendations for those at average risk of colorectal cancer (including recommended: age to commence screening; screening test; frequency of testing). The sheet will also include methods to obtain FOBT as well as what to do with the FOBT provided.

The research assistant will deliver the survey and for eligible patients will complete the pathology form but will not provide any medical advice or endorse completion of the intervention.

The general practitioner will endorse the FOBT during the patients appointment. The GP will reinforce the importance of completing the FOBT and recommend the patient complete the FOBT using a script provided by the research team during a pre-study training session.</interventions>
    <comparator>The usual care group will receive the usual care provided by their GP. This will include advice/ care related to the problem the patient is presenting with. No strategies will be implemented for the usual care group to facilitate routine provision of screening advice</comparator>

    <sequence>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with each recruitment day randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. A statistician not involved in the day-to-day implementation of the project will generate separate computer generated randomisation tables for each participating general practice.  Whilst the implementation cannot be concealed from the research assistant, they will not have access to the assignment schedule and only be made aware of allocation the day they attend the practice. A senior researcher not involved in patient recruitment will manage the randomisation list and liaise on a daily basis with the research assistants responsible for recruitment to inform them of the allocation for that day.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Aim 1: The proportion of patients completing CRC screening at the follow-up time point will be compared  using a logistic regression model. 
Aim 2: Differences in knowledge scores between the usual care group and the intervention group will be determined by ordinal logistic regression. 

For all tests we will use 2-sided p-values with a 5% significance level. 

The sample size was calculated on the basis of the primary aim. A sample of 80 patients per arm will enable detection of a 20% increase in self-reported CRC screening for patients in the intervention group compared to 5% in the usual care control group with 90% power at 5% significance. This calculation allows for a small design effect of 1.2 to allow for potential clustering by the design of the study (day of the week) and assumes on average 10 eligible patients will be available per day

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test a primary care intervention that is designed to improve uptake of bowel cancer screening among primary care patients. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 50 to 75 years, are presenting for a general practice appointment, and have been identified via a brief baseline assessment as being at average or slightly increased risk of bowel cancer. You will not be eligible if you have been screened for bowel cancer using a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the past two years or colonoscopy in the past five years. 

Study details
Clinics will be randomly allocated by day to intervention or usual care, therefore participants will receive the intervention based on the day of the week they attend the practice. Participants in the intervention group will receive: 
1) A faecal occult blood test kit 
2) A feedback sheet containing screening recommendations for those at average risk of bowel cancer 
3) General practitioner endorsement of the importance of faecal occult blood test screening. 

Participants in the usual care group will receive standard care, and then the feedback sheet once the study is completed.

All participants will be asked to complete a telephone interview 6 weeks after their initial appointment. During the interview, participants will be asked whether they have completed a faecal occult blood test within the past 6 weeks and will be asked questions to assess their bowel cancer screening knowledge.

It is hoped that this primary care intervention will be an effective way to increase the uptake of bowel cancer screening
