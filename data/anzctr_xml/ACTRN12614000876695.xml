    <interventions>Multicomponent Smoking Cessation Intervention (Varenicline + Behaviour Change Counselling; Stop Smoking Support) 

Varenicline will be administered orally via tablets in accordance with approved labelling. Dose titration will be: 0.5 mg/d for days 1 to 3; 1 mg/d for days 4 to 7; and 2 mg/d (the target dose) from days 8 to 84. In accordance with recommendations from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (2009), patients who successfully complete the initial 3-month course will be offered an additional 3-month course (2mg/d) to assist with maintaining abstinence.

Varenicline will be provided at no cost to participants. The initial course of Varenicline will be distributed at treatment planning. Patients who successfully complete the initial 3 month course will receive a further 84 day supply of Varenicline during their appointment with the radiation oncologist (RO) following RT completion. Medication adherence will be evaluated via self-report and pill count. Medication compliance will be explicitly discussed by the RO and psychologist as part of the Behaviour Change Counselling Intervention. The psychologist will also administer an established medication adherence questionnaire at each appointment.  At each follow-up assessment, participants will be asked to return the blister packs administered at the preceding timepoint. Any missed medication will be retained by the research staff and counted. Any outstanding medication will be returned to the participant along with the next instalment of medication.

At the time of treatment planning (simulation), RO's will offer brief medical advice to quit. This brief intervention is designed to supplement Varenicline administration to assist patients to stop smoking. Brief advice will also be integrated into routine consultations.

Intervention participants will also receive up to 10 sessions of manual-based motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered by a psychologist. Sessions will include 2 x pre-quit and 1 x quit day sessions (of up to one hour) and 7 x relapse prevention sessions (of up to 30min). Sessions will be weekly for the first four weeks and approximately fortnightly-monthly thereafter (as needed and according to patient preference). To position smoking cessation as central to radiotherapy, sessions will be offered in the radiotherapy outpatient department. Telephone sessions will be offered as an alternative, according to patient preference. Counselling is included given its efficacy at helping smokers quit (Fiore et al., 2008).</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as Usual
Participants assigned to this group will receive standard radiotherapy treatment from the RO. In regard to smoking cessation they will receive the standard NSW Health tobacco assessment and smoking cessation advice; they will not be prescribed Varenicline and will not receive additional smoking cessation counselling from a psychologist. </comparator>

Please note, that once patients are deemed to be eligible for the trial they will be required to refrain from starting non-study smoking cessation treatments (including, but not limited to, Nicotine Replacement Therapy, Buprenorphine, Psychological Intervention, Counselling).

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be recruited from the Calvary Mater Newcastle (CMN). A research assistant will work with clinic staff to identify potential participants. Potential participants will be identified by CMN staff in the month preceding the new patient clinic from the pool of patients who meet the following screening criteria:

1. Aged 18+
2. Diagnosis of head and neck cancer (including skin)
3. Scheduled to undergo radiotherapy (definitive or adjuvant) for head and neck cancer (curative intent)

Patients who meet the above criteria may be identified using treatment planning software (e.g. Varian or Mosaiq), discussion from team meetings, and/ or referral from hospital staff. Potential participants may also self-refer based on advertising material placed within the hospital. Initial communication with patients may be written, over the phone or in person.

Patients who meet the above criteria will be approached by a RO or CMN staff member at the new patient clinic.They will be provided with verbal information about the study and will undergo a brief screening interview to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. Interested and eligible patients will be given a copy of the information statement to consider and advised that a member of the research team will be in contact to confirm interest.

Before they attend their treatment planning appointment, eligible patients who have agreed to be contacted will then be contacted by a member of the research team (e.g. research assistant or psychologist) to confirm interest. According to participant preference, this contact may be in person or over the phone. Uncontactable patients may also be sent written communication.

Patients agreeable to participate will be invited to attend a baseline assessment. This appointment will be scheduled before the patient is due to attend their treatment planning appointment. The researcher will take consent (verbal or written) and complete the baseline assessment. According to participant preference, this appointment may occur in person, or over the phone.

Once a member of the research team has completed the baseline assessment, treatment allocation will be randomised using a free online randomisation service – “sealed envelope” (https://www.sealedenvelope.com). </concealment>
    <sequence>Once a member of the research team has completed the baseline assessment, treatment allocation will be randomised using a free online randomisation service – “sealed envelope” (https://www.sealedenvelope.com). Patients will be randomised prior to their treatment planning appointment with the RO. 

Using the page created for the study, the staff member will be required to enter the unique study password, their email address and a unique identifier (patient initials and date of birth). Randomisation is instantaneous. The randomisation results are shown on-screen and emailed to both a chief investigator and to the randomiser. 

The randomisation arms will be as follows:
Arm A: Treatment as Usual
Arm B: Multicomponent Smoking Cessation Intervention (Varenicline + Behaviour Change Counselling; “Stop Smoking Support”)

The free version of Sealed Envelope uses simple randomisation. Randomisation is also blocked (using random permuted blocks) to ensure that the groups are balanced periodically. 

Treatment allocation will be concealed from all members of the research team until after randomisation. Assessors will remain blind to treatment allocation.</sequence>

Rather, we intend to randomly allocate 40 patients to receive either stop smoking support or treatment as usual to assess feasibility (i.e. can HNC patients undergoing RT be recruited into a trial involving medication and smoking cessation counselling), adherence (to follow-up assessments, Varenicline and psychological support) and tolerability of Varenicline (i.e. side effects).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether a smoking cessation program may improve radiotherapy outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer. 

Who is it for?

You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, a smoker and have been diagnosed with head and neck cancer (including skin cancer), for which you are scheduled to undergo radiotherapy.

Study details

Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will participate in a multicomponent smoking cessation program which includes an initial three-month course of oral tablets (Varenicline), with the possibility of an additional three-month course to maintain abstinence, as well as 10 behaviour change sessions with a psychologist. Participants in the other group will receive standard NSW Health tobacco assessment and smoking cessation advice. Both groups will receive their standard radiotherapy treatment. 

Participants will be followed-up for up to 6 months, in order to determine compliance to and side effects of the smoking cessation program, behaviour change and tumour response to radiotherapy.
