  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 2 parts to the study. Participants can choose to complete Part A or Part A and B.
Part A involves participants using a computerised phonics treatment which trains letter recognition, parsing, letter-sound rules, and blending. Participants train at home for 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks.
Part B involves completing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain which lasts approximately 20 mins. Participants willl only complete the MRI once at baseline. </interventions>
    <comparator>This study uses a double-baseline control. At the start of the study, each child completes the test battery (Time 1). After 8 weeks of *no* treatment, they redo the same tests (Time 2). We will then subtract their scores at Time 1 from Time 2 to reveal their test retest effects on each test. These test retest effects will then be subtracted from each childs subsequent post treatment scores (i.e. Time 3 - after 8 weeks of training) and maintenance scores (Time 4 - 8 weeks after completing training). This allows us to determine how much each child improved due to training alone (i.e. excluding test retest effects) and to determine whether any effects were maintained after completion of training.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study has two parts - Part A and Part B. Participants can choose to participate in Part A alone or both parts of the study.
The aim of Part A is to see if a computer-based training program can improve the reading of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and reading difficulties. Many children with NF1 experience difficulty reading, particularly when sounding out unfamiliar words (phonological dyslexia). It is hypothesised that by teaching these children letter-sound relationships (phonics) their reading and reading related skills (e.g. spelling) will improve.
The aim of Part B is to identify parts of brain tissue and structure that may be related to children's reading abilities.</summary>
