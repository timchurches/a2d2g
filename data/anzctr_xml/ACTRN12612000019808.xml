  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of nilotinib as a treatment of patients with progressive or relapsing pigmented villo-nodular synovitis / tenosynovial giant cell tumour (PVNS /TGCT) who cannot be treated by surgery.
This study is an international, multicentre, non-randomised, open-label phase II clinical trial with a Bayesian design.
Who is it for?  You may be eligible for this study if you are aged 18 years and over, have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of inoperable progressive or relapsing PVNS/TGCT OR resectable tumour requesting mutilating surgery, and give your consent to take part. The full inclusion criteria details can be found in the relevant section of this form. 
Trial details:  In this study, you will receive the drug nilotinib in the form of 2 x 200mg capsules twice daily, taken orally over a total period of 12 months.  You will also be required to regularly attend clinic for routine tests and assessments.</summary>
