  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is observing the effect of standard chemotherapies Oxaliplatin , cisplatin and paclitaxel on neurotoxicity. These chemotherapy treatments are given intravenously through  a wide range of doses, patients may have 3 or 4 weekly cycles that may continue for between 4 and 10 cycles. This observational study will last approximately 6 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study that will collect information about patient neurotoxicity outcomes after treatment with cisplatin, oxaliplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy, for correlation with biological variables measured in blood samples collected at baseline or during the initial course of treatment. 
The study population will include adult patients with any cancer type, who will have standard chemotherapy with cisplatin, oxaliplatin or paclitaxel, who are able to give informed consent, who are over 18 years old and who are expected to survive for more than six months. The patient neurotoxicity outcomes to be measured in this study include the change between baseline and three months after treatment in the Total Neuropathy Score Clinical, which is a clinical test,  the neurotoxicity quality of life score, which is a questionnaire, the severity grade for hearing toxicity, measured by an audiogram and the occurrence of treatment-limiting neurotoxicity. Samples of blood will be collected at baseline, on cycle 1 day 1 and at the end of cycle 1 for preparation of plasma RNA and DNA biomarker samples. There will be 300 patients in total and in each group at least 100 patients.</summary>
