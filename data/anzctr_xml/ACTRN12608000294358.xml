  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of the Funhaler instead of a conventional spacer.  The Funhaler is commercialy available small volume spacer with a spinning disk and whistle on the exhalatory arm.  The study group will be asked to use the Funhaler instead of their conventional spacer for administering their daily inhaled steroids (they have to be on regular inhaled steroids as part of the inclusion criteria).  Each participant will be followed up for one year.  If any study participant should be weaned off their inhaled steroids during the course of the study( by the study doctor or by their GP), because their asthma is well controlled, they will still be followed up.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional spacer (Aerochamber Plus)
The Aerochamber is a commonly used, commercially available small volume spacer device.  As part of the inclusion criteria the study participants will be using inhaled steroids.  In the preschool age group inhaled steroids are mostly prescribed for daily use and administered with puffers and spacers.  All subjects will be followed up for one year after randomisation.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
