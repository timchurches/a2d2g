    <summary>This is a observational, multi-center study to assess progression of clinical features,
      imaging and biologic biomarkers in Parkinson disease (PD) patients compared to healthy
      controls (HC) and in PD patient subtypes.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify clinical, imaging and biologic markers of
      PD progression for use in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies.</summary>
