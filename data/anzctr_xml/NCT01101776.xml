  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This observational multicentric study is planned to assess the tolerability of Rebif New
      Formulation in an Australian clinical setting by the incidence of injection site reactions
      (ISRs). The study will allow the comparison of tolerability data with historical data for
      both Rebif New and classic formulations, and will do so by using the same pre- specified
      preferred terms of treatment emergent adverse events as done in historical studies. In
      addition, the study will analyse whether interaction(s) with a nurse impacts tolerability and
      the impact of Rebif New Formulation on the patient's Quality of Life.</summary>
