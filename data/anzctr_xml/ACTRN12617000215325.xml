  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients  who have advanced cardiac amyloidosis  who have received a heart transplant after  completing Bortezomib-based or Thalidomide based chemotherapy, are eligible to  enro  in this study.  The study involves eligible patients  who are well enough  as assessed by their treating physicians to  undergo Autologous Stem Cell Transplant  within 3-6 months after heart transplant.  
Enrolled patients will receive melphalan 200mg/m2 for one dose intravenously the day before stem cells are infused.  Prophylactic medication to prevent infection will commence as determined by treating physician. - Subcutaneous Filgrastim 5 ug/kg  given daily could  be considered if  transplant engraftment is delayed beyond 28 days. The ASCT  will follow standard guidelines by the BMT Network . Patients will be followed up clinically weekly in the first month, then every 3 months for the first year, then 6 monthly for 5 years by their treating physician after stem cell transplant using  physical assessments and  pathology tests - After the stem cell  transplant, medical reviews will also be customised be for each patient if patient need more regular follow up. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of autologous stem cell transplantation  in AL amyloid patients with advanced cardiac disease. 
after a orthotopic heart transplantation. 
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18-65 years and have been diagnosed with cardiac AL amyloidosis. 

Study details
All participants in this study are required to  have previously received chemotherapy and a orthotopic heart transplantation before being enrolled in the study to  received an autologous stem cell transplantation.  Patients will  undergo autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) within 3-6 months after OHT. 

patient will have an Autologous stem cell transplant using Melphalan 200mg/m2 on day -1 with stem cell collected given on day 0 previously from the patient before the study. 

All participants will be followed up every 3 to 6 months for a period of 5 years, in order to assess survival, and safety and efficacy of treatment.

This pilot study will determine if treating patient with a stem cell transplant  with cardiac amyloid after receiving  a heart transplant will increase disease free survival </summary>
