  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>(a) any person who is experiencing current levels of depressive symptoms (score at least 17 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II); and (b) who is also consuming alcohol at harmful levels.  Harmful consumption of alcohol will be defined as consumption above recommended NHMRC guidelines for males and females (i.e. in excess of 2-4 standard drinks per day for males and 1-2 standard drinks for females, with fewer than 2 alcohol-free days).  </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>(a) any participant who screens positive for psychotic illness ); (b) people who are not using alcohol above recommended levels.  NOTE: People may be using drugs in addition to alcohol and still be eligible for participation; (c) any participants requiring medical detoxification for their alcohol use will initially be referred to the appropriate service in the community.  However, once the physical symptoms of withdrawal are managed, it is important to follow up with some form of further treatment, so at this time these participants will be recruited to the study; (d) any participants who exhibit significant learning difficulties; (e) non-English speakers; (f) people with organic brain diseases.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>A randomisation list generated by the Research Manager was linked to a unique participant identification code. Treatment allocations are transferred from this list by an Administrative Assistant and concealed in individual envelopes labelled with the relevant participant code. Neither the Research Manager nor the Administrative Assistant are involved with the assessment or treatment phases of the study. Prior to the brief intervention session for each participant, the research clinicians are issued with a new randomisation envelope by the Administrative Assistant, which displayed the participant number on the outside of the envelope, with the treatment allocation sealed inside. This envelope is opened by the research participant at the conclusion of the brief intervention session.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The DAISI project is investigating treatments for comorbid depression
and alcohol use disorders. Specifically, this project aims to directly
compare the effectiveness of four approaches to psychological treatment
with varying emphasis on depression and alcohol use.  

Four programs of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing will be delivered, and outcomes compared over a 3-year
period: 
(i)	10-sessions of CBT that targets depression only (CBT-Dep); 
(ii)	10-sessions of CBT that targets alcohol use only (CBT-Alc); 
(iii)	10-sessions of CBT that targets depression and alcohol use
concurrently (CBT-Int); and 
(iv)	Brief intervention that targets depression and alcohol use
concurrently (BI - control). 

It is hypothesised that this research will result in the development of
an effective treatment program for people with comorbid alcohol and
depressive disorders. We further hypothesise that the integrated CBT
(CBT-Int) will produce greater, more sustainable reductions in both
depressive and alcohol use outcomes relative to the other treatment
conditions at the post-treatment follow-up assessments.

The knowledge obtained through this research would assist counsellors in
the field of alcohol and other drug treatment and mental health
professionals to choose the most appropriate treatment for their clients
who present with this comorbidity.</summary>
