    <studytitle>An Open-label, Randomized Cross-over, Pharmacokinetic Study to Determine the Bioavailability, Safety, and Tolerability of Two Consecutive Daily Doses of Oraxol in Cancer Patients Treated With Intravenous Paclitaxel Amendment 1</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Patients with cancer for whom IV paclitaxel (at a dose of 80 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour) is indicated will be treated with intravenous paclitaxel and Oraxol (Paclitaxel + HM30181AK-US) to evaluate bioavailability, safety and tolerability of Oraxol.  </scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Crossover Design:

Study treatments will be administered on consecutive weeks with 1 week between each treatment administration. 

There are two sequences; IV paclitaxel followed by 15 mg oral HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate plus 270 mg oral paclitaxel and,
 HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate plus 270 mg oral paclitaxel followed by IV paclitaxel.   

Treatment details:
 80 mg/m2 IV paclitaxel (as Taxol registered trademark or generic) infused over 1 hour (Day 1 or Day 8) plus premedication per standard local practice, or

  15 mg oral HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate plus 270 mg oral paclitaxel (Days 1 and 2 or Days 8 and 9). HM30181AK-US tablet will be administered 1 hour before oral paclitaxel; no premedication is allowed during this treatment sequence.

Qualified staff will administer IV paclitaxel treatment and monitor the subject for safety. Subjects will remain at the study site for at least the first 24 hours after dosing of IV paclitaxel for PK blood sample collection.  

Qualified staff will administer HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate plus 270 mg oral paclitaxel.  Subjects will remain at the study site for the first 48 hours after dosing of Oraxol for PK blood sample collection.  

Subjects may leave the site and return for PK blood sample collections after 24 hours for IV paclitaxel or 48 hours of Oraxol PK blood collections have been completed and will return to the study site for the remaining PK blood collections.  If more convenient, at the discretion of the investigator, the subjects may be discharged to a local motel or remain housed at the study site for the entirety of the PK blood collection periods for both IV paclitaxel and Oraxol.

The second week of randomized treatment may be delayed for up to 2 weeks, if needed, to allow the subject to recover to less than or equal to Grade 1 CTCAE toxicity from the prior study treatment.

    <comparator>The bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of 15 mg oral HM30181 methanesulfonate monohydrate plus 548mg mg oral paclitaxel over two days will be compared with 80 mg/m2 IV paclitaxel (as Taxol registered trademark or generic) infused over 1 hour </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oraxol  is  a  combination  of  an  oral  tablet,  HM30181 
methanesulfonate,  and  capsules  that  contain paclitaxel.  HM30181 is a drug that helps the body absorb paclitaxel, a drug used to treat cancer. The purpose of this study is to measure the levels of paclitaxel in your blood at different times when given by intravenous (IV) drip (through a vein in the arm) compared to the levels of paclitaxel at different 
times in the blood when given by mouth (as Oraxol). This is called pharmacokinetic or PK testing
