    <interventions>Experimental conditions
This is a three armed trial. A brief multi-strategic intervention will be provided to parents during their clinic visit in each of two treatment conditions by existing clinic staff as part of routine care. 

Treatment condition 1
Computer delivered care: prior to the clinic consultation parent/carers will complete a touch screen survey (approximately 20 minutes duration) in the clinic waiting room and will receive tailored on-screen and printed feedback regarding their infants risk of secondhand smoke(SHS) exposure, and tips on implementing household smoking bans. Parent/carers who are smokers will be provided advice to quit and contact details for the Quitline counselling service. 

Child health nurse delivered care: during the consultation, nurses will provide a brief SHS intervention (approximately 15 minutes duration) modelled on the 5 As framework. Specifically nurses will Ask about parental smoking and infant SHS exposure, Advise on strategies to protect the infant from SHS exposure and the benefits of quitting smoking, Assess willingness to change and arrange Assistance to do so. Parent/carers interested in quitting smoking will be advised to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and provided with the Quitline contact details.  

Treatment Condition 2
Treatment condition 2 will include the same strategies as Treatment condition 1 plus two additional components. During the consultation a urine sample will be obtained from all infants by a cotton wool pad placed in the diaper of each infant. Results will be mailed to the parent/carer, the child health nurse and the parent/carers general practitioner. 

Parents will also receive a booklet "Clearing the air for your baby". This guide provides information about preventing infant SHS exposure and strategies for quitting smoking . 

Clinical practice change strategies
The following strategies will be implemented to support intervention delivery by nurses in treatment conditions 1 and 2 clinics.

Training: nurses will attend a training session that addresses the health risks associated with infant exposure to SHS and skills in supporting parent/carers to quit smoking and implement household smoking bans.

Prompts: the computer will generate a tailored checklist to support intervention delivery by the nurses. In addition medical record labels will be provided to facilitate recording of infant SHS exposure and parental smoking status and to prompt follow up care. 

Resources: nurses will be provided with resource packs including SHS fact sheets, a 5 As flip chart, pamphlets and quit smoking fact sheets.

Cotinine feedback (Treatment condition 2): cotinine results of each infant, a results interpretation guide, and tips for discussion with parents will be provided to nurses.

    <sequence>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Clinics are the unit of randomisation. All 39 child health clinics in the region stratified according to annual number of client appointments and then randomly allocated to experimental group ( Treatment 1, Treatment 2, Control) using SAS statistical software.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on research suggesting that 40% of infants attending child health clinics live in households with smokers, and an assumed 25% loss to follow up at 12 months, it was determined that a final sample of 1200 infants (400 per group) would be attainable at 12 month follow up. Forty per cent of infants are estimated to be exposed to SHS in the past three days (n=160 per group) and 50% of parent/carers are estimated to be smokers at baseline (n=200 per group). Fifty per cent of homes are estimated to not have complete smoking bans (n=200 per group). Allowing for a 5% decrease in prevalence for each outcome measure in the control group, the samples are estimated to enable a difference of 9% between groups for infant SHS exposure, and 8% for parent/carers smoking, and existence of smoking bans (80% power; a =0.05). 

The impact of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes will be examined using repeated measures logistic regression in a Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) framework (three models). All models will include adjustment for clustering and covariates hypothesised to be related to the outcome measures (parent/carer smoking status, household smoking bans, parent/carer marital status, parent/carer educational attainment). The interaction of time and treatment group will be used to determine the significance of differences in outcomes over time between groups. All outcomes will be analysed on an intention to treat basis.</statisticalmethods>
