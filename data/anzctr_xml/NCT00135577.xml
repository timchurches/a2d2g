  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study SB-767905/008 was a multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      multiple dosage regimens of an investigational drug for the treatment of constipation due to
      prescription pain medication in participants with cancer pain.

      Study ABD101684 will serve as an extension to Study SB-767905/008 and offer continued access
      to blinded investigational product to participants who have completed the original study. The
      purpose of Study ABD101684 is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alvimopan compared to
      placebo in subjects who completed Study SB-767905/008 and elected to participate in this
      extension study.</summary>
