  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot trial looking at the safety and feasability of running a local anaesthetic infusion to improve the post-operative pain relief of patients who have had abdominal surgery. The local anaesthetic, called ropivacaine, will be run via a transversus abdominis plane catheter. This will be placed in both sides of the abdomen between two muscle layers. The study will look at the effect of the infusion on how much morphine the patient requires after their surgery. The study will also look at the levels of ropivacaine in the blood during the infusion, which will run for three days.</summary>
