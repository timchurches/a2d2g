  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety of an experimental malaria challenge using naturally occurring parasites. This outcome will be assessed by measuring clinical and laboratory safety parameters.Clinical safety will be assessed by soliciting symptoms and signs of malaria and of adverse effects of the inoculum. Laboratory safety parameters will include standard haematologic and biochemical tests as well as serologic evidnece of seroconversion to adventitious agents.Solicited adverse events will include immediate allergic/hypersensitivity reactions to the inoculum as well as evidence of unexpected infection with adventitious agents</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the in vivo infectivity of P. vivax isolate HMPBS-Pv in healthy volunteers following infection with blood stage parasites.

3) Has evidence of increased cardiovascular disease risk (defined as greater than 10 percent, 5 year risk) as determined by the method of Gaziano et al. Risk factors include sex, age, systolic blood pressure (mm Hg), smoking status, body mass index (BMI, kg/mm2), reported diabetes status and blood pressure 
4) History of splenectomy. 
5) Pregnant or breast feeding (all women will have a negative pregnancy test result prior to each study product administered).

7)Presence of current or suspected serious chronic diseases such as cardiac or autoimmune disease (HIV or other immunodeficiencies), insulin dependent diabetes, progressive neurological disease, severe malnutrition, acute or progressive hepatic disease, acute or progressive renal disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, epilepsy or obsessive compulsive disorder, skin carcinoma excluding non-spreadable skin cancers such as basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. 
8) Known inherited genetic anomaly (known as cytogenetic disorders) e.g., Downs syndrome 
9) Volunteers unwilling to defer blood donations to the ARCBS for 6 months. 
10) The volunteer has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, severe depression, bi-polar disease, or other severe (disabling) chronic psychiatric diagnosis.Participants who are receiving a single antidepressant drug and are stable for at least 3 months prior to enrolment without decompensating may be allowed to enrol in the study at the investigators discretion. 
11) Presence of acute infectious disease or fever (e.g., sub-lingual temperature greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees Celcius) within the five days prior to study product administration). 
12) Evidence of acute illness within the four weeks before trial prior to screening. 
13) Significant intercurrent disease of any type, in particular liver, renal, cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, rheumatologic, or autoimmune disease by history, physical examination, and/or laboratory studies including urinalysis. 
14) Have ever received a blood transfusion. 
15) Evidence of any condition that, in the opinion of the clinical investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives or pose excessive risks to participants.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study of safety and infectivity in 2 healthy volunteers of a new Plasmodium vivax Malaria bank obtained from a malaria infected patient under HREC approval from both Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital and Queensland Institute of Medical Research. The Malaria bank was prepared under highly controlled conditions using protocols developed in conjunction with the Red Cross the US FDA and QGen. The clinical protocol is based on prior studies using the 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum isolate. The malaria bank has had full serological and PCR evaluations over 6 months meeting the criteria of ARCBS blood donation requirements. The antimalarial agent used to treat the malaria is the TGA approved Riamet, which was also used to eradicated the malaria infection in the patient donor.</summary>
