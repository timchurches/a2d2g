  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the intervention arm will start on the lower dose of the drug under investigation with the option to move to the higher dose if blood pressure is not controlled to the responsible clinician's satisfaction. Each dose version is taken as one tablet once a day for a total period of 6 months. 
Components of each dose version are as follows:
Low Dose: Telmisartan 20mg, Amlodipine 2.5mg, Chlorthalidone 12.5mg
High Dose: Telmisartan 40mg, Amlodipine 5mg, Chlorthalidone 25mg</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients achieving target blood pressure (BP) at the end of 6 months follow-up: systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt; 90 mmHg (SBP &lt; 130 mmHg and DBP &lt; 85 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease).
BP will be measured using automated BP machines (Omron) during the trial visit using standardised BP measurement protocols (e.g. sitting, 2 measurements taken 5 minutes apart)</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients reaching target BP: SBP &lt; 140 mmHg and DBP &lt; 90 mmHg (SBP &lt; 130 mmHg and DBP &lt; 85 mmHg for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease).
BP will be measured using automated BP machines (Omron) during the trial visit using standardised BP measurement protocols (e.g. sitting, 2 measurements taken 5 minutes apart)</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean change in SBP and DBP

      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerance to treatment will be assessed by comparing the rates of medication discontinuation, due to side effects, in both arms of the trial.
No increased side effects are expected beyond those expected for the individual medications taken either as components of the Triple Pill or the individual medications taken in the usual care arm. Cessation of medication due to side effects will be assessed by asking the patient why (if relevant) they have stopped taking their medication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use of health care services (hospitalisations, medical consultations, tests).
Use of such services will be assessed by patient recall of relevant health service utilisation during the trial period. This data will be collected by the study nurse during the trial visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported BP lowering medication use (7-day recall) - adherence defined as taking the drug for at least 4 out of the previous 7 days.
Medication use will be ascertained during the study visit by patient recall of how many times they took their medication over the last 7 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life will be assessed using the EQ5D health assessment questionnaire.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a prospective, open, randomised controlled clinical trial (n=700) of a combination blood pressure lowering pill (Triple Pill)-based strategy compared to usual care among individuals with newly diagnosed hypertension on no or minimal drug therapy, augmented by a cost-effectiveness analysis and a formal process evaluation.
The key hypothesis tested is that there is no difference in the proportion of patients reaching their target blood pressure at 6 months compared to usual care.</summary>
