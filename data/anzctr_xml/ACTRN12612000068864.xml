  <interventions>
    <interventions>METHODOLOGY:  Experimental, longitudinal and mixed (prospective-retrospective) design (retrospective information on the number of episodes last year, obtained by patient questionnaire). Convenience sampling. All the cases that come for manipulative treatment of diagnosed tonsillitis are included, once the criteria of inclusion and exclusion have been applied. Independiently, they also receive pharmacological treatment prescribed by your blinded doctor. After filling in the questionnaire (age, sex, number of episodes the previous year, etc)
and signing the informed agreement, they are randomized in two groups: Experimental Group (receive one osteopathic manipulation of the vertebrae T9-T10, thrust with sitting patient's arms across chest, by a trained physiotherapist-osteopath, professor of Osteopathic Methodology) or Control Group (receive one very soft streching in the same position, by the same trained physiotherapist-osteopath, to the Placebo Group).  In both groups, only one manipulation or stretching in a single session (of one minute of duration). All the changes in the symptomatology of tonsillitis are recorded in the first week and each month in the following year, recording also the recurrences (by phone call of blinded collaborator).</interventions>

Results in the short term (number of days for the total resolution of the symptoms of tonsillitis after our intervention) will be assessed by collaborative nurse blinded by phone call to each patient to know their evolution (as register and sign) and an collaborator physician blinded review each clinical story and sign. 

Results in the long term (number of recurrences of tonsillitis in the following year) will be assessed by collaborative nurse blinded by phone call to each patient to know their evolution (as register and sign) and an collaborator physician blinded review each clinical story and sign. 

The controlled variables are measured by the initial questionnaire to the patient and the initial clinical examination.</outcome>

    <concealment>The blinded doctor refers the patient to a physiotherapist-osteopath interventor. In this consultation, the physiotherapist-osteopath interventor randomly assigns each patient to the Control Group (CG) or the Experimental Group (EG), using a list of random numbers (0=CG  and 1=EG), thus ensuring that patients are distributed randomly between control and experimental groups. In this way both the referring physician the case, as the nurse co-worker who performed the telephone calls(the week of the intervention and monthly for recording recurrences during the following year),  the physician to review the clinical histories and patient are blinded to the membership thereof to the CG or EG.</concealment>

    <summary>OBJECTIVES OF THE DOCTORAL THESIS:
 1) To determine whether osteopathic manipulation (G. Experimental) of the vertebrae T9-T10, during an episode of tonsillitis, corresponds to the total disappearance of symptoms in a significantly lower number of days that the manipulation patients with placebo (G. Control).
 2) To determine whether osteopathic manipulation (G. Experimental) of the vertebrae T9-T10, during an episode of tonsillitis, corresponds to a decrease in the number of recurrences during the following year, significantly higher than in patients with placebo manipulation (G . Control).3)  3) To determine if there is any association between the treatment results and any of the variables controlled in this study (sex, age, number of previous episodes in last year).

HYPOTHESIS: 
 1 st) The osteopathic manipulation (G. Experimental) of the vertebrae T9-T10, during an episode of tonsillitis, corresponds to the total disappearance of symptoms in a significantly lower number of days that patients with placebo manipulation (G . Control).
 2nd) The osteopathic manipulation (G. Experimental) of the vertebrae T9-T10, during an episode of tonsillitis, corresponds to a decrease in the number of recurrences during the following year, significantly higher than in patients with placebo manipulation (G. Control ).
 3 rd) relationship exists between the results of osteopathic treatment of tonsillitis and some of the additional variables considered in this study.</summary>
