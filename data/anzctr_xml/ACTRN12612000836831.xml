  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Compared with the general population, dialysis patients have a 100-fold increased risk of dying from heart disease which has remained unchanged over the last decade. The main factor which predicts this risk in dialysis patients is abnormal heart muscle structure and function. Excess body fluid and high blood pressure are critical risk factors leading to these heart abnormalities. Current tests to identify dialysis patients at high risk are quite inaccurate and optimum blood pressure/fluid targets remain undefined. There is an urgent need for a blood test that accurately detects the early stages of heart injury to enable effective treatments. NT-proBNP is a heart hormone released during heart stress and early studies suggest it can predict which dialysis patients do poorly. The aim of our research is to develop a monitoring guideline based on regular testing of NT-proBNP to identify high-risk dialysis patients early. This would enable treatment before a serious medical complication occurs, potentially improving patient outcomes on dialysis. We will achieve this by testing NT-proBNP monthly in a group of 150 dialysis patients for 2-years, and correlating changes in the hormone levels with changes in patient symptoms, their health, body fluid state, and heart structure and function.</summary>
