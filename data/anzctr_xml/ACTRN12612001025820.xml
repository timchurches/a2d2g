  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intrauterine insemination with stimulation. Women randomised to intrauterine insemination will undergo three cycles of stimulated intrauterine insemination (0.5ml of sperm suspension) Clomiphene citrate ovarian stimulation protocols will be used. Clomiphene citrate will be started orally on day 2 of the menstrual cycle for 5 days. The dose of clomiphene will be determined by the clinicians based on the woman's clinical indications. On day 12 an estradiol level and ultrasound scan (USS) will be performed. If there are more than 3 follicles present the IUI will not proceed and the patient will be informed not to be sexually active. If there are less than three follicles IUI will proceed when the blood tests indicate ovulation is about to occur (usually between day 12 and 16 of the cycle). A Tomcat catheter will be used for the IUI procedure. The inseminate will be prepared using a density gradient and spermatozoa will be re-suspended in 0.5 ml of human tubal fluid. The catheter will be passed through the cervical canal high up into the uterus and the specimen slowly injected. No luteal phase support will be given.</interventions>
    <comparator>Expectant management. Couples assigned expectant management will be followed for three menstrual cycles from the time of randomisation. No additional treatment would occur during this time.</comparator>

    <concealment>Women with unexplained infertility and a prediction score of &lt;30% attending Fertility PLUS, Repromed of Fertility Associates and who wish to have IUI will be advised of the study and encouraged to take part. Power calculations were done based on Fertility PLUS clinical data. Those wishing to take part will be randomly allocated to either three cycles of IUI with stimulation or three cycles of expectant management. Randomisation will be done online, once the patients have been allocated there will be no blinding.</concealment>
    <sequence>When a patient decides to participate in the study her fertility provider will contact the co-investigator who will randomly allocate the patient to either the intervention or control group using a random number generator.</sequence>
