  <interventions>
    <interventions>Tai Chi Group:
Participants, in a group of 4-6, will join 2 supervised sessions of Tai Chi (Sun-Style Tai Chi) per week supervised by a research personnel with experience of practicing Sun-Style Tai Chi in an outpatient setting. Each session will last for 60 minutes including warm up, Tai chi and cool down. 
All participants are advised to practice daily at home following what they have practiced in the supervised session with practice duration similar to supervised session. All participants will have an accelerometer (to be worn at wrist) to record their level of physical activities and an exercise logbook for recording.The whole program will last for 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>1) Exercise group
Participants, in a group of 4-6, will join 2 supervised exercise sessions per week supervised by a research personnel in an outpatient setting. Each session will last for 60 minutes including warm up, exercise (ergometer at the moderate intensity of exercise, i.e.  about 3-4 out of 10 of modified Borg Scale), and cool down

All participants will have an accelerometer (to be worn at wrist) to record their level of physical activities and an exercise logbook for recording. The whole program will last for 12 weeks.

2) Routine care group - participants are advised to continue their usual activities
All participants will have an accelerometer (to be worn at wrist) to record their level of physical activities and an exercise logbook for recording. The whole program will last for 12 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effect of a 12-week Tai Chi programme on people with COPD. We hypothesize that after 12-week programme, participants receiving Tai Chi training will have better cognitive and physical performance when compared with control groups. </summary>
