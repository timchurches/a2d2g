  <interventions>
    <interventions>The implementation of a 'rest and sleep guideline' using interventions suggested by the entire healthcare team including: a daytime rest period (in the afternoon for 1.5 hours instigated by bedside nurses), ear plugs, eye masks, clustered care and noise reduction. The guideline has been implemented using a multifaceted approach (e.g. group sessions, one to one academic detailing, auditing with feedback in the intensive care unit (ICU) newsletter, e mail and posters) and designed to be sustained over the long-term (until further evidence becomes available to improve sleep further).</interventions>
    <comparator>A pre-post design. A group of patients will have their sleep monitored before the introduction of the intervention and another group will have their sleep monitored after the introduction of the guideline.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of microarousals defined using the American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria and assessed by an accredited experienced sleep technologist.
Criteria: ' an abrupt shift in electroencephalograph frequency including alpha, theta and/or frequencies &gt;16Hertz (not spindles) that lasts at least 3 seconds, with at least 10 seconds of stable sleep preceding the change. Scoring of arousal during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep requires a concurrent increase in submental electromyography (EMG) lasting at least 1 second.'

    <designfeatures>Preintervention-postintervention study design. Thirty intensive care unit (ICU) patients were enrolled in the preintervention phase and had their sleep monitored continuously for one 24 hour period. These patients received standard care. The intervention (a 'rest and sleep guideline') has been implemented. In the postintervention phase another 30 (different) patients will be enrolled and have their sleep monitored continuously for one 24 hour period.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intensive care units (ICU) provide treatment and care to critically ill patients. Frequently, invasive monitoring and intrusive treatments delivered via artificial airways are required, which limit the ability to communicate. These factors, symptoms of illness and the busy environment may lead to discomfort, in particular the inability to sleep. The adverse health effects of poor quality sleep are understood and ICU patients are in greater need of sleep. 

Therefore, the aim of this study is to minimise sleep disruptions and improve the quality and quantity of ICU patients sleep. Thirty intensive care patients sleep has been measured using a portable sleep monitor. Simultaneous records were made of interruptions to the patients sleep and sound and light levels. The results from the first group have been discussed with ICU health care personnel who have decided which sleep promoting practices to implement, i.e. organisational and behavioural changes, such as blocks of uninterrupted time and noise reduction. Sleep data will be collected on a further thirty patients to assess the effectiveness of these interventions.

No studies of this type have been conducted in Australian ICUs and few published studies have been performed with the purpose of improving sleep for ICU patients. This study is a unique opportunity to obtain data on ICU patients sleep in Australia using the most objective measure available, polysomnograph. It also has the potential to provide data on the effectiveness of sleep promoting activities.</summary>
