  <interventions>
    <interventions>Music therapy.  45 minuted session weekly over 16 weeks.  This is a one on one session with a registered music therapist and the child participant's primary carer.  Techniques used include live music making such as singing, instrument playing and movement to music.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment.  Participants are enrolled in a government-run early childhood intervention centre providing a family centred philosophy of care.  Participants received an average weekly contact time with a multidisciplinary team of 1hr 42 minutes.  Children were monitored to ensure they did not begin music therapy sessions, or change their therapy significantly by participating in Applied Behavioural Analysis therapies (intensive, daily one to one therapies).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Young children with autism vary greatly in their social and communication skills, from non-verbal and difficult to engage, to using sentences and showing some interest in other people.  For those children who are non-verbal and difficult to engage, there is minimal evidence to determine which interventions will successfully foster the social and communication development of these young children.  Music therapists are trained to use music (which is by nature a non-verbal medium) to motivate, evoke and elicit responses and interactions from children with social and communication impairments such as autism.  While the use of music therapy with children who have social and communication impairments has been widely described, the evidence has primarily taken the form of case studies.  Within the Early Childhood sector generally, there is increasing awareness of the importance of a strong parent-child relationship in the successful development of early social and communication skills in both typically developing children and children with autism.  Interventions that involve the parent and support the parent-child relationship have reported significant gains in the social and communication skills of children with autism.  This project aims to determine to what degree the early social and communication skills of children with autism aged between 3 and 5 years are effected by participating in music therapy sessions with their parent (primary carer).</summary>
