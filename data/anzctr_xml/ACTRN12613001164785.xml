  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchiectasis is an abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the bronchi or breathing tubes, leading to chronic cough, chest infections and breathing difficulties. It is common and severe in New Zealand with a prevalence of 1/3000 overall, but 1/1200 Maori and 1/650 Pacifica children. The cause is unknown in the majority of cases. Our clinical suspicion is that there is more than just social determinants placing these children at risk. The innate immune system provides the first line of defence against infection. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are part of the innate immune system that recognise pathogens, and it is possible to screen for problems with TLR by measuring the shedding of a protein called CD62 Ligand from cells. 

Our hypothesis is that defects in the Toll-like Receptor pathway of the innate immune system contribute to high rates of bronchiectasis in Maori and Pacifica children.

Identification of a genetic predisposition to defects in the innate immune system would enable us to identify children at risk of bronchiectasis and intensify early prevention and treatment measures in order to reduce health inequalities.</summary>
