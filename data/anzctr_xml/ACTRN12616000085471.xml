  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised cross over study design will be employed.  20 healthy volunteers will participate in two daytime anaesthesia studies during which they will receive light or deep sedation with intravenous dexmedetomidine or propofol in randomized order on two separate days.  Study days are separated by at least 1 week.  Airway collapsibility (pharyngeal critical pressure; Pcrit and pharyngeal closing pressure; Pclose), neuromuscular responsiveness derived from genioglossus EMG (EMGgg), and sedation depth (Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) and processed EEG/EMG (Bispectral Index Score; BIS)) will be assessed at light and deep levels of sedation.  Pclose will also be assessed at 2 minute intervals following cessation of drug infusion. EEG (O1,C3,F3,M2), End-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), transcutaneous CO2 (TcCO2) and oesophageal pressure (Pes) will be monitored continuously.

Drug dosing involves a bolus dose (10 minutes at 0,6 microg/kg (DEX) or 4,5 mg/kg/h (= 75 microg/kg/min)(Propofol)) followed by a maintenance infusion aiming for light sedation (DEX: 0,5 microg/kg/h; Propofol 2,5 mg/kg/h (= 42 microg/kg/min)) then deep sedation (DEX: 1,5 microg/kg/h; Propofol 5 mg/kg/h (= 83 microg/kg/min)).  At each level of sedation 20 mins is allowed for attainment of steady state prior to beginning measurements. Venous blood samples will be collected at baseline and completion of measurements at light and deep sedation levels for determining drug plasma concentrations.  The first measurement will be made at completion of the 30min bolus/steady state period and sedation will not extend beyond 75 mins from the time of the start of the first measurement. </interventions>

      <outcome>Airway collapsibility
1.  pharyngeal critical pressure technique (Pcrit) where applied nasal pressure is lowered during early expiration for 5 breaths to a pressure eliciting flow limitation and then returned to the holding pressure.  Following a recovery period to allow all physiological measurements to stabilise nasal pressure is again lowered to induce a different degree of flow limitation.  A minimum of three pressure reductions inducing variable degrees of flow limitation (identified from no further increase in flow despite 3cmH2O increase in negative pressure as assessed by Pes) are required to produce a single Pcrit measurement from the relationship between airflow and pressure.  Pcrit is the pressure at which flow would be zero.  Any breaths associated with arousal or variations in sleep stage are excluded.
2.  airway collapsing pressure (Pclose) technique where airflow is abruptly occluded with a pneumatic balloon valve for a maximum of 5 inspiratory efforts.  The mask pressure (Pmask) at which the point of divergence between Pmask and Pes the Pclose.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used for procedural and intensive care unit sedation. This growing popularity is based on the belief that it has relatively little impact on both ventilatory drive and upper airway collapsibility, in contrast to benzodiazepines and propofol, which are known to depress ventilation and predispose to upper airway obstruction.  However, we have preliminary data demonstrating that, at similar levels of sedation, the degree of upper airway collapsibility observed with dexmedetomidine is similar to that with propofol.  Formal evaluation is now required.  This study will compare the effects of dexmedetomidine and propofol on upper airway function in healthy people.  Information gained from this study will improve our understanding of the effects of dexmedetomidine and its safe use for procedural and intensive care unit sedation

Aim:
To compare the degree of upper airway collapsibility and mechanisms underlying it during light and deep levels of dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation in healthy individuals 

Hypothesis:
Upper airway collapsibility will increase with increasing depth of sedation but will be similar at comparable depths of dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation.
