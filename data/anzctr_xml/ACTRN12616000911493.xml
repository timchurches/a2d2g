  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will identify patients with an adrenergic component of pain by assessing their response to phenylephrine injected intradermally (0.05 mg injected once only into the affected limb, and 0.05 mg injected simultaneously into the opposite unaffected limb). Phenylephrine will be administered by a pain specialist or by qualified personnel under medical supervision. Phenylephrine may induce pain at the site of injection for 10-40 minutes in symptomatic skin of patients with an adrenergic component of pain but is not expected to induce pain in nonsymptomatic skin. Sensitivity to pinprick stimulation will be investigated at and around the site of injection before and every 10 minutes after the injection for 40 minutes. 
At the end of the study, a skin biopsy will be obtained from the affected limb and contralateral limb for comparison, and the distribution of a biomarker (the alpha-1 adrenoceptor) will be examined using immunohistochemistry.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Phenylephrine is the active treatment and clonidine is the control treatment. Phenylephrine visibly constricts blood vessels. Therefore, to ensure that participants and observers remain double-blind, the vasoconstrictor clonidine will be injected intradermally in a double-blind crossover trial. Specifically, 10 micrograms of clonidine will be injected once only into the affected limb and 10 micrograms will be injected simultaneously into the opposite unaffected limb . Clonidine is not expected to induce pain. The crossover injections of phenylephrine and clonidine will be administered at least 1 day apart. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary sample will consist of 60 patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). When compared with the 95% confidence interval of scores in healthy controls, heightened expression of cutaneous alpha-1 adrenoceptors appears to be characteristic of at least 50% of patients with CRPS [Finch et al. Pain Medicine 2014;15:1945-1956]. Based on this preliminary data and on previous reports, we expect that intradermal injection of phenylephrine will increase pain in approximately one-third of patients with CRPS, and hypothesize that cutaneous alpha-1 adrenoceptors will be up-regulated in the majority of this subgroup. To test this hypothesis with power = 0.8 and p&lt;0.05, we estimate that a sample of ~60 CRPS patients will be required. For exploratory purposes, we will collect similar data on smaller, convenience samples of patients with other forms of neuropathic pain.
The mean pain score at the site of injection during minutes 10-40 after the injection of phenylephrine will be used to classify patients into pain responders (with a positive score) and nonresponders (with a score of 0). Differences in the distribution of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor in cutaneous cells will be investigated in Group (responders versus nonresponders) x Side (affected versus contralateral) repeated measures analysis of variance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A major early component of neuropathic pain is infiltration of immune cells into the injured tissue that release inflammatory mediators. These mediators could either directly, or through the induction of neurotrophic factors, trigger increased alpha-1 adrenoceptor expression on neurons and other cells around the site of injury. In turn, activation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors on fibroblasts and keratinocytes may trigger further release of growth factors and inflammatory mediators. Thus, an upward spiral of alpha-1 adrenoceptor expression on these cells and on regenerating neurons could engender an adrenergic component of inflammation and pain. The aim of this project is to investigate this hypothesis in a large sample of patients with complex regional pain syndrome and in other forms of painful neuropathy. An adrenergic component of pain in the skin will be assessed in response to intradermal injection of the adrenergic agonists phenylephrine and clonidine. In addition, we will investigate the expression of alpha-1 adrenoceptors and inflammatory mediators in skin biopsies of hyperalgesic and control skin. This project may have significant treatment implications, as blocking up-regulation of the alpha-1 adrenoceptor could ultimately prove to be a useful therapeutic strategy for patients with an adrenergic component of pain.</summary>
