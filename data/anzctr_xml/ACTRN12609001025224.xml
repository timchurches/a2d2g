  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being conducted to see the sub-chronic effects of various coffee beverages on cognition, cardiovascular function and mood in healthy older adults. The study will compare the effect of different types of instant coffee beverages. Participants will consume one of four types of coffee beverages daily for 3 months. We will measure performance on different cognitive tasks, mood and cardiovascular measures before the consumption of the coffee beverage (baseline), 1-month after consumption of the coffee beverage and 3-months after consumption of the coffee beverage.</summary>
