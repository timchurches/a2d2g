  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial will examine the safety and efficacy of intranasal oxytocin for the treatment of alcohol dependence. It is hypothesised that participants randomised to the oxytocin condition, compared to participants randomised to the placebo condition will have a higher rate of treatment completion, experience reduced number, severity, and duration of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and will report fewer days of alcohol use at one month follow-up.</summary>
