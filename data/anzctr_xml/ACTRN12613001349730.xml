  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be asked to take either one or two 800 mg Manuka Cyclopower chewable tablets three times per day for 4 weeks.  Dosing is randomised per participant against the allocated participant number and adherence is monitored by investigators who administer the tablets on site on the testing days.  Participants are required to return all unused tablets at the end of the study and note and report when they have missed doses either by text, phone call or at the time of tablet return.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess gastrointestinal tolerability of the chewable tablets.  Participants are required to report any adverse events, evidently gastro-intestinal or otherwise - each reported adverse effect is assessed by a registered medical practitioner who then decides whether further follow-up is required.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four weeks and at a two week mid-point clinic visit.  Participants will also receive a phone call each week from research staff and will be seen at any time they wish contact.  The four week period is for participants who experience gastro-intestinal discomfort that is not severe, passes quickly and does not require follow-up (as per registered medical doctor's decision) and who choose to continue with the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of the chewable tablet on oral microflora.  This is by way of analysing growth on agar plates taken from oral swabs at a NZ registered testing facility.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect on gut micro flora - to be tested using faecal sampling</outcome>

    <concealment>Subjects are enrolled in the study provided they meet the inclusion criteria, do not meet the exclusion criteria and give informed consent following a meeting with a member of the research team and are fully informed about being involved in this research (e.g. that there may be some gastro-intestinal upset; requirement for attendance at clinics).  They are then allocated a participant number and all information gathered from them is only identifiable with that number.  The investigator is not aware of what treatment the participant is being given as the product being tested is pre-packaged at a location in a different city, by a separate company, who are solely aware of what is in each package.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a third study to evaluate this product. Participants will this time be asked to consume either 1 or 2 Manuka Cyclopower chewable tablets (800 mg) up to 3 times per day for 4 weeks (maximum intake of 4800 mg). This study will again follow a randomised, placebo-control design and will be run under the supervision of a medical practitioner. Participants will be asked to provide saliva and faecal samples on day 1 and day 28 to allow assessment of changes to oral and gut microflora. These samples will be processed by Plant and Food Research.  The study interval for each group has been extended to 4 weeks as this is the period of time required for there to be observable changes in oral flora and it allows for a longer tolerability assessment of the product.
