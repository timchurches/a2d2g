  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim was to investigate the effect of high dose oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on pancreatic beta-cell function and glycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes. The hypothesis was that vitamin D would improve beta-cell function and glycemia.

 Beta-cell function was assessed by measuring  glucagon stimulated C-peptide. Insulin resistance was measured by calculating a HOMA-IR index from plasma insulin and glucose levels. Glycemia was assessed by measuring fasting plasma glucose, post-prandial capillary glucose and serum glycosylated haemaglobin.</summary>
