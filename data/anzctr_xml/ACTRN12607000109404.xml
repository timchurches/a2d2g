  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) Hydrochlorothiazide (single tablet orally taken twice daily, 12.5 or 25 milligrams) based combinations with Atenolol (single tablet, orally, 12.5 or 25 milligrams, twice daily);
2) Nifedipine Sustained Release (single tablet, orally taken, 20 or 40 milligrams, twice daily)   based combinations with Captopril (single tablet, orally, 25 or 50 milligrams, twice daily); 
Check the compliance for antihypertensive drugs once a month. 

All interventions were for two years. Patients were first treated with lower dosage; if their blood pressure was still above 140/90 mmHg after two weeks, the dosage was increased to the second higher dosage; if their blood pressure was still above 140/90 mmHg after four weeks, Hydrochlorothiazide based group combined with Atenolol while the Nifedipine Sustained Release based group combined with Captopril.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypertension is an important public health problem. Despite the availability of a variety of effective antihypertensive drugs, there is a large variation in response to these drugs. Most marketed antihypertensive drugs are expensive, and most people in China rural area can not afford them for long-term treatment. This study was aimed to select better cost/effect combinations of antihypertensive drugs for economically less favorite hypertensive patients in developing countries like China. All study medications were identical in appearance. The code was used to conceal drug name. The drugs were distributed to four groups according to predetermined number of each block.</summary>
