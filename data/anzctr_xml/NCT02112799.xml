  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase 1 trial will assess the dose-related safety and PK profile of different doses of
      NVR 3-778, first in healthy volunteer subjects (part I) and subsequently in patients with
      chronic hepatitis B (part II). Additionally, in Part II, changes in patients' serum HBV DNA
      levels and other virologic efficacy parameters will be assessed.</summary>
