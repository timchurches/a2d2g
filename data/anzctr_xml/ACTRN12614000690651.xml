  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial investigating the comparative effectiveness of two video interventions designed to increase registration on the Australian Organ Donor Register versus a control. 

Brief video intervention: Classes allocated to the brief video intervention will be invited to complete a baseline survey investigating knowledge and attitudes towards organ donation as well as current organ donor registration status. Following this, organ donor registration forms will be distributed and a brief, 5-minute video delivering the Discover, Decide, Discuss message about organ donation will be screened. Students will then be invited to consider registering their organ donation decision by completing the registration form. 
Enhanced video intervention: Classes allocated to the enhanced video intervention will follow the same procedure as the brief video intervention, but this intervention will screen an enhanced informative video about organ donation (10 minutes) which includes an interview with an organ donation recipient and a relative, in addition to the "Discover, Decide, Discuss" message. 

One month after completion of the baseline survey (and intervention delivery where applicable), the research team will return to all classes involved to administer a brief follow-up questionnaire investigating changes in knowledge and attitudes as well as self-reported registration status.

    <comparator>Control: Classes allocated to the control condition will be invited to complete a baseline survey during class time only and will receive no active intervention. They will also be invited to complete the follow-up survey.</comparator>

    <concealment>Class recruitment will be carried out by a TAFE representative who will approach class teachers, and ask permission for inclusion of their class in the study.
All eligible students in class on the day of the baseline survey will be invited to complete the survey. Return of a completed survey will be taken as implied consent.
Classes will be randomly allocated into one of three conditions via a computer random number generator and will be done by an independent statistician off-site to ensure adequate allocation concealment procedures.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Assuming the baseline prevalence of students on organ donor registration is 12%, and that there are between 10 and 25 students available per class, with 30 classes recruited per arm the study will have 80% power to detect a difference of between 9-10% in the proportion of students on the organ donor registry at follow-up between any two arms of the study with 2.5% significance. This effect was calculated for intraclass correlations between 0.01 and 0.03.
 
Statistical Methods: Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control groups will be compared using proportions for categorical variables and means/standard deviations for continuous variables. Since the intervention is targeted at increasing individual donor rates the unit of analysis will be the individual. Primary outcome:  Differences between the proportion that students who have signed up on the Australian Organ Donor Register at follow-up between either treatment arm and control will be assessed using a mixed effects logistic regression model. The model will include fixed effects for treatment (control, Intervention 1 or Intervention 2) and the cluster specific mean baseline proportion that are already registered. A random effect term for each class will be included to account for the clustering of students from the same class. The control arm will be used as the reference group and the p-value associated with either intervention arm will be used to determine the statistical significance. Either intervention will be considered statistically significantly better than the control if the p-value is less than 0.025. The primary analysis will be a complete case analysis, with sensitivity analysis undertaken to include all participants under an appropriate model for missing data. Agreement between self-reported registration and assessment of completed registration forms will be reported with the kappa statistic.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite recent increases in organ donation rates thanks to dedicated efforts from the National Organ and Tissue Authority, Australia continues to have one of the lowest organ donation rates of developed countries. The vast majority of people publicly support organ donation, but many do not make their wishes known by either registering their wishes on the national register (the Australian Organ Donor Register, or AODR) and/or communicating their wishes to their families. Very few studies have examined strategies to increase the likelihood of these behaviours, especially amongst young people.

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of two interventions (brief and enhanced video) with a non-intervention control condition designed to increase the proportion of TAFE students registered on the Australian Organ Donor Register (AODR). 

Design: A 3 arm cluster randomised controlled trial. 

Method: TAFE classes in the Newcastle area will be randomised to one of three conditions (brief video, enhanced video, control). Students will be invited to complete a baseline and one-month follow-up survey to measure registration status as well as knowledge and attitudes towards organ donation. Classes in the intervention arms will view a video-based intervention: either a) a brief informative video about organ donation or b) an enhanced informative video with an interview with an organ donation recipient and relative. Students in both intervention conditions will also be given the opportunity to complete an organ donor registration form. The intervention will be carried out in class immediately following the completion of the baseline survey. 

Outcomes: The primary outcome will be AODR registrations. Self-reported family discussions regarding registration will also be examined, as well as changes in knowledge and attitudes. 

Significance: This study has the potential to increase registrations on the AODR and consequently save lives. If shown to be effective, the interventions could to be widely implemented throughout the TAFE system, and Universities.
