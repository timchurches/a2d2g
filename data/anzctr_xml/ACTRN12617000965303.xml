  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of the study is to assess whether treatment with simvastatin during docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can reverse a poor prognostic plasma lipid signature.
Participants will be treated with simvastatin 40mg daily (oral tablet) for 12 weeks, at the same time as starting docetaxel chemotherapy.
Adherence to simvastatin will be assessed by investigators through regular clinic visits during treatment (every 3 weeks, at the same time as the pre-chemotherapy review).</interventions>

      <outcome>Presence of a poor prognostic plasma lipid signature
- A previous study measured the global lipidomic profile in the plasma of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer starting docetaxel chemotherapy, using liquid chromatography and electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (1)
- A three-lipid signature was derived which was prognostic for worse overall survival (1)
- This study will assess for the presence of this poor prognostic plasma lipid signature at baseline and after 12 weeks of simvastatin

    <statisticalmethods>This is a single arm, pilot study.  Assuming 25% of patients have the poor prognostic lipid signature at baseline (as was found in our initial exploratory study), a total sample size of 60 participants provides over 90% power with a 1-sided type 1 error of 10% (with an allowance of 10% for inevaluable participants and missing data), to detect conversion to the good prognostic signature in 50% of patients.

A patients lipid signature will be analysed and classified as either good prognostic or poor prognostic as per our three-lipid signature model derived by logistic regression (as per our initial exploratory study).  Rates of conversion from a poor prognostic signature to good prognostic will be analysed.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to aims to test whether treatment with simvastatin during docetaxel chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can reverse a poor prognostic plasma lipid signature.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a man aged 18 years or above diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and starting docetaxel chemotherapy shortly.

Study details
All study participants will be treated with simvastatin 40mg daily (oral tablet) for 12 weeks, at the same time as starting docetaxel chemotherapy. All participants will be followed up for 12 weeks to monitor safety and to assess the lipid profile using plasma samples. 

It is hoped that this study will help answer the question of whether a 12 week course of a lipid-lowering drug called simvastatin (commonly used to treat high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes) will lower the specific circulating lipids in blood that are associated with a worse prognosis in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.</summary>
