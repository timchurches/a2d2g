  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Joint Rank (Combination of Time to Death (for Subjects Who Died) and Change in Total Functional Capacity Score (TFC) From Baseline to Month 60 (for Subjects Who Survived)) - The primary outcome variable at the start of the trial was the change in TFC score from baseline to Month 60. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended to the trial leadership that they reconsider how they accommodate missing data from subjects who die in their primary analysis of the change in TFC score. Based on these recommendations, the trial leadership changed the primary analysis to that of a joint rank approach. TFC consists of five ordinally scaled items assessing a person's capacity with: (1) occupation; (2) financial affairs; (3) domestic responsibilities; (4) activities of daily living; and (5) independent living. Total score ranges from zero (worst) to 13 (best).</outcome>
      <timepoint>5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Total Functional Capacity (TFC) Score From Baseline to Month 60 - TFC consists of five ordinally scaled items assessing a person's capacity with: (1) occupation; (2) financial affairs; (3) domestic responsibilities; (4) activities of daily living; and (5) independent living. Total score ranges from zero (worst) to 13 (best).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Functional Checklist Score From Baseline to Month 60 - The functional assessment checklist includes 25 questions about common daily tasks. A score of 1 is given for each "yes" reply and a score of 0 is given for each "no" reply (scale range is 0-25). Higher scores indicate better functioning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Independence Scale Score From Baseline to Month 60 - The independence scale assesses independence on a 0 to 100 scale with higher scores indicating better functioning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Total Motor Score From Baseline to Month 60 - The motor section of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) assesses motor features of Huntington disease with standardized ratings of oculomotor function, dysarthria, chorea, dystonia, gait, and postural stability. The total motor score is the sum of all the individual motor ratings, with higher scores (124) indicating more severe motor impairment than lower scores. The score ranges from 0 to 124.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Behavioral Frequency Score From Baseline to Month 60 - The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) behavioral subscale assesses frequency and severity of psychiatric-related symptoms, including depressed mood, apathy, low self-esteem/guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, irritable behavior, aggressive behavior, obsessional thinking, compulsive behavior, delusions, and hallucinations. A total score was calculated by summing up all the individual behavioral frequency items (range 0-56) with higher scores representing more severe behavioral impairment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Behavioral Frequency x Severity Score From Baseline to Month 60 - The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) behavioral subscale assesses frequency and severity of psychiatric-related symptoms, including depressed mood, apathy, low self-esteem/guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, irritable behavior, aggressive behavior, obsessional thinking, compulsive behavior, delusions, and hallucinations. The total score is the sum of the product of the individual behavioral frequency and severity items (range 0-176) with higher scores representing more severe behavioral impairment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) From Baseline to Month 60 - The SDMT assesses attention, visuoperceptual processing, working memory, and cognitive/psychomotor speed. The score is the number of correctly paired abstract symbols and specific numbers in 90 seconds with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Month 60</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Verbal Fluency Test From Baseline to Month 60 - The verbal fluency test is typically considered a measure of executive function. The score is the number of correct words produced across three 1-minute trials.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    <summary>The goals of this trial are to determine if coenzyme Q10 is effective in slowing the
      worsening symptoms of Huntington's disease and to learn about the safety and acceptability of
      long-term coenzyme Q10 use by determining its effects on people with Huntington's disease.</summary>
