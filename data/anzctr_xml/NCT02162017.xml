  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - The lying flat (0°) head position for 24 hours
Other interventions - The sitting-up (=30°) head position for 24 hours

Experimental: The lying flat intervention - Patients in lying flat intervention to be nursed lying flat (0°) immediately after diagnosis of acute stroke is made and to remain in this position for 24 hours

Active Comparator: The sitting-up intervention - Patients in the sitting up intervention to be nursed with their head elevated (=30°) by raising the head of the bed (or with extra pillows or wedge) immediately after the diagnosis of acute stroke is made, and to remain in this position for the next 24 hours


Other interventions: The lying flat (0°) head position for 24 hours
The patients should have strict bed rest for the first 24 hours after admission to hospital. They can be nursed in the side-lying position and feeding should be avoided or only given in the =30° position to reduce the risk of aspiration, and after a standard swallowing screening. Patients should have no more than 3 breaks of 30 minutes in a 30°head position in the first 24 hours, and none of the breaks are to be grouped together (i.e. no back-to back breaks are permitted).

Other interventions: The sitting-up (=30°) head position for 24 hours
For sites that have been randomised to this position, the usual nursing care will be to have patients positioned to sitting-up with the head elevated at 30° or more by raising the head of the bed or use of extra pillows, whatever is the most appropriate, immediately upon presentation to the ED and to remain in that position for 24 hours. Patients should have no more than 3 breaks of 30 minutes in a lying flat head position in the first 24 hours, and none of the breaks are to be grouped together (i.e. no back-to back breaks are permitted).

          -  Significant medical condition that takes priority in care and where adherence to the
             randomised head position is not possible on another ward/department of the hospital.

          -  Immediate transfer from the Emergency Department (ED) or admission, to another ward
             for medical treatment (e.g. for haemodialysis) or surgery (e.g. carotid

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an investigator-initiated and conducted, international collaborative,
      regionally organised, multicentre, prospective, cluster randomised, crossover, blinded
      outcome assessment study to compare the effectiveness of the lying flat (0°) head position
      with the sitting up (=30°) head position, in the first 24 hours of admission to hospital for
      patients with acute stroke, on the poor outcome of death or disability over the subsequent 90
      days.</summary>
