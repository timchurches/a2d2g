  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a sub-study of an existing trial examining the influence of long term administration of curcumin (500mg 3 times daily) in an older population (ACTRN 12613000681752). 

Participants within the existing curcumin study will be eligible to participate in this sub-study investigating the acute influence of curcumin, on those already consuming a chronic dose. 

In the early morning, prior to taking their prescribed investigational product (IP) curcumin, the participants will undertake cognitive testing using a computerised battery and complete a questionnaire to evaluate their working memory, attention and mood. They will then be provided a standardised breakfast and administered their usual investigational product, (oral Curcumin 500mg or placebo), as previously randomised in the main ACTRN 12613000681752 study.  
Exactly 1 hour post the investigational product participants will repeat the cognitive battery to examine the influence of curcumin or placebo on working memory, attention and mood.  A standardised morning tea will then be provided at a designated time. 
Exactly 3 hours post the IP dose the participants will repeat the cognitive battery and questionnaire to examine the influence of curcumin or placebo on working memory, attention and mood as compared with baseline.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examinie the acute administration effects of curcumin, on a cohort already taking long-term curcumin. In an earlier study within another investigator team a report of a  significant effect was observed one hour after administration of curcumin within sustained attention and working memory tasks of the intervention group as compared to placebo group. Given that the KARVIAH study design provides an opportunity to re-test this hypothesis, using a different formulation of curcumin, we would like to undertake the following as a sub-study with those participants who have completed their final assessment time-point within the curcumin study.</summary>
