  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the first stage of the study optimised curcumin (400mg) will be taken by 30 individuals (20 cognitively healthy 10 with evidence of cognitive decline) and placebo will be taken for 30 individuals (20 cognitively healthy 10 with evidence of cognitive decline), for a four week period (28 days).  A total of 4 treatment groups (cognitive status x treatment) will be included. All treatments are to be taken as one oral capsule per day, with the first treatment administered during baseline testing session and final treatment administered during four-week follow-up testing session.

A subset of 16 participants, with apparent cognitive decline, will also take part in Stage Two of the study in which treatment dose and duration will be increased (800mg curcumin once daily, for eight weeks) and effect of supplementation on cerebral blood flow will be examined.

Stages One and Two will be separated by a wash out period of a minimum  of one month.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will respond to advertisements and pass a telephone screening interview before coming in for their screening and enrollment session.  Participants will be allocated the next available sequential identification number which will correspond to a treatment number. Treatment numbers will be randomly allocated to curcumin or placebo using a computerised random number generator.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the acute and chronic effects of LONGVIDA® Optimized Curcumin on cognitive function, mood and potential biomarkers of action in older individuals who are either cognitively healthy or show evidence of cognitive decline. 
Participants will attend Swinburne University Hawthorn for one screening and practice visit, during which informed consent will be obtained, eligibility will be confirmed and participants will be familiarised with study measures.  
In Stage One of the study participants will attend two testing sessions at baseline and four-weeks. During these sessions a fasting blood sample will be collected and participants will complete cognitive and mood assessments prior to treatment administration, one hour post administration and three hours post administration.  Between testing sessions participants will be required to take one capsule (curcumin or placebo) every day between breakfast and lunch. 
At the conclusion of Stage One a subset of participants will be invited to complete Stage Two of the study. In stage Two participants will complete two testing sessions at baseline and eight weeks. During these sessions a fasting blood sample will be collected and participants will complete cognitive and mood assessments prior to treatment administration and one hour post administration. At three hours post administration particiapnts will complete cognitive assessment tasks while undergoing an fMRI scan.</summary>
