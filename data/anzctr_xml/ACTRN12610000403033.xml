  <interventions>
    <interventions>Survey to be administered to dietitians registered with the Dietitian's Association of Australia to gain an understanding of their attitudes and practices in regards to diagnosis and management of malnutrition in adults. Study participants will be alerted to the survey via the weekly email to all members of the Dietitian's Association of Australia. The link will be provided and members will be requested to participate in the survey, via that link to Survey Monkey. It is expected that the survey will take 15-20 minutes to complete. The link will be available for approximately 3 months from initial notification to members.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is much controversy in the literature around the identification and treatment of malnutrition. There has been little previous work done in this field. Recent local research has quantified potential misidentification of categories of malnutrition which is relevant as all malnourished individuals are currently treated as if they are starving. This is inappropriate as some wasting conditions are not reversed by refeeding. This project will survey members of the Dietitians Association of Australia to provide information on professional opinions and current dietetic practice with reference to malnutrition as a whole, and to different categories of wasting syndrome. The perspective of the dietetic profession in Australia is vital to the production of well rounded, and locally relevant, research.</summary>
