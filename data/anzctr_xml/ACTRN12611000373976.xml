  <interventions>
    <interventions>PART A:  The treatment groups have been completed and subjects received a single dose of either 10 mg, 30 mg, and 100 mg of BMS-919373 or placebo.
Based on exposures from these subjects, the following doses are selected for the remainder of Part A of this study:
Treatment Group 4: Subjects will receive a single 30 mg oral dose of BMS-919373 or placebo (suspension), in Period 1, followed by a single 30 mg dose of BMS-919373 or placebo following the administration of 40 mg famotidine in Period 2, followed by a single 30 mg dose of BMS-919373 or placebo following the administration of a high fat breakfast in Period  3.  There will be at least 5 days between each dose. 
Treatment Groups 5: Subjects will receive a single 1 mg oral dose of BMS-919373 or placebo (solution).
Treatment Group 6:  Subjects  will receive a single 10 mg oral dose of BMS-919373 or placebo (solution) in Period 1 followed by a single 10 mg oral dose of BMS-919373 or placebo (suspension) in Period 2.
Treatment Group 7: Subjects will receive a single 100 mg oral dose (repeat of Panel 3, with extended sampling) of BMS-919373 or placebo (suspension formulation).
PART B:  Eight healthy subjects will be assigned to each of up to 4 sequential dose treatment groups in the MAD. Each subject will be administered a daily oral dose of BMS-919373 or placebo for 14 days.  The following doses will be studied:
Treatment Group 1: 3 mg loading dose (LD) on Day 1, followed by 1mg QD of BMS-919373 or placebo on Days 2-14 (solution). 
Treatment Group 2: 30 mg LD on Day 1, followed by 10 mg QD of BMS-919373 or placebo on Days 2-14 (suspension). 
Treatment Group 3: 90 mg LD on Day 1, followed by 30 mg QD of BMS-919373 or placebo on Days 2-14 (suspension). In this panel, 2 mg midazolam will be administered 2 days prior to the initial dose of BMS-919373and again on Day 15, within 5 minutes after receiving BMS-919373 or placebo. 
Treatment Group 4:  elderly subjects will be administered a 90mg LD + 30 mg MD of BMS-919373 or placebo (suspension).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the Safety and Tolerability of BMS-919373 following singel and multiple doses</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed by safety laboratory assessment at Screening, the day prior to treatment (Day -1), Day 2 and Day 21 in Part A and Screening, Day -1, Day 2,5,14 and 34 in Part B.  Vital Signs will be taken at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours following initial dosing and 4 and 12 hours following subsequent doses in part B. Subjects will also be monitored via telemetry for 24 hours following dosing on Day 1 for Part A and Days 1, 5 and 14 in Part B</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the Pharmacokinetics of BMS-919373.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In Part A, PK samplese will be taken at 0.25 hr, 0.5hr, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, 216, 288, 384 and 480 hours post dose.  In Part B, PK samples will be collected at 0.25 hr, 0.5hr, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24hrs following the initial dose on Day 1; pre-dose samples will be collected on days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12; and following final dosing on Day 14, samples will be collected at 0.25 hr, 0.5hr, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, 288 and 480 hours post dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of BMS-919373.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured in Panel 2 of the food effect/famotidine panel.  Subjects will undergo pharmacokinetic assessments at the same time points as in the fasted panels, following administration of a high fat meal.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the effect of famotidine on the pharmacokinetics of BMS-919373</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured during Panel 3 of the food effect/famotidine panel.  Subjects will undergo pharmacokinetic assessments at the same time points as in the fasted panels, following administration of a single oral dose of 40mg famotidine.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the effect of BMS-919373 on CYP3A4 enzyme activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured during the Part B panel 3following a single dose of 2mg midazolam in addition to BMS-919373/placebo. Pharmacokinetics will be taken at the same time points as for other Part B dose panels.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the effect of BMS-919373 on ECG intervals.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In Part A, ECGs will be taken at screening, at Day -1, 1, 2, 4, 6 hours post dose, Day 5, Day 7 and prior to discharge on Day 21.
