  <interventions>
    <interventions>Heart failure patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices will be investigated in a 2 stage trial investigating whether no optimization or echocardiographic CRT optimization, either at rest or on exercise, is advantageous.
Optimization will occur by adjusting both the atrioventricular (AV) and ventriculo-ventricular (VV) delay of the CRT device.
Stage 1 - individuals will either  be randomized to no optimization or resting optimization. For this we will use the iterative method for the AV delay and the Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Velocity Time Integral (LVOT VTI) method for the VV delay. 
Stage 2  - individuals will either  be randomized to resting  optimization (as in stage 1) or  optimization just on completion of a 6 minute walk test (exercise optimization). Resting optimization will be as in stage 1. On exercise (6 minute walk) we will only adjust the VV delay using the difference in  time to systolic peak contraction  between opposing LV segments at rest and then on exercise.
Individuals will thus be optimized twice in total. 
At each visit they will undergo a resting echocardiogram, blood testing and measures of functional capacity such as treadmill walking and 6 minute walk test distance.
Once at the start of stage 1 (month 1) and then at the start of stage 2 (month 7). Each optimization takes roughly 90 mins once per 6 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional improvement assessed using standard heart failure mechanisms - 6 minute walk distance, treadmill time,  peak oxygen consumption on exercise (VO2 max), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Echocardiographic improvement in terms of ventricular function and ventricular synchrony. We will measure Simpsons biplane ejection fraction as a measure of left ventricular function and compare change from the start of each stage to the end. we will use the standard deviation fo the time to peak systolic contraction as a measure of left ventricular dyssychrony. Again we will compare change from the start of each stage to the end.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker devices are now an established therapy for heart failure patients. However the optimal method to set up these devices is as yet uncertain. We aim to use echocardiography to optimize these devices on a patient specific basis. We will examine no optimization vs. resting optimization vs exercise optimization in a systematic manor to determine the superior method in terms of functional and cardiac improvment.</summary>
