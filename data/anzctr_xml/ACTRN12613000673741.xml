    <interventions>This observational trial was conducted in the maternity of a public hospital in Sao Paulo/Brasil.
We evaluated the strength of respiratory muscles, using manovacuometry technique, through maximal respiratory pressures on two occasions, twenty-four and forty-eight hours after delivery. 
Women in vaginal postpartum period were compared with women in post-cesarean section. In addition, we performed the calculation of the predicted volue for maximal respiratory pressures of all women who participated in the study to compare the expected with the achieved values. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Semicontinuous and continuous variables were initially confronted with the Gaussian curve, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and classified into parametric and non-parametric. Categorical data were represented by absolute and relative frequency, semicontinuous and continuous variables were described as mean and standard deviation, and prevalence rates were analyzed by chi-square test.
Manuvacuometria variables were compared using the t-test of paired and unpaired.
The significance level for for the p value was less than 5%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To evaluate and compare the strength of respiratory muscles in women in the immediate postpartum vaginal and cesarean delivery. Methods: This study was conducted in a public maternity the coast of Sao Paulo, with a population of women in immediate postpartum period, the same were separated into two groups: vaginal delivery (VDG) and cesarean delivery (CDG), and evaluated by a form of data collection on the current pregnancy, childbirth and the data manuvacuometria held 24 and 48 hours postpartum. Results: The sample comprised 29 women and 30 VDG in the CDG. The average age was 24.75 (+/- 4.95) in VDG and 24.10 (+/- 4.72) in PDG. In both groups there was a decrease in inspiratory muscle strength (IMS) and expiratory (EMS) in relation to the predicted value in the 1st PP and 2nd PP (VDG / IMS - 1 PP: -44.07 +/- 12.72; 2nd PP: -56.79 +/- 15.54; PDG / IMS - 1 PP: -37.03 +/- 9.54; 2nd PP: -49.13 +/- 14.69 / VDG / EMS - 1st PP: 41.45 +/- 16.52; 2nd PP: 50.35 +/- 21.83; PDG / EMS - 1st PP: 32.93 +/- 5.05; 2nd PP: 37.63 +/- 8.93). When the groups were compared inspiratory muscle strength (IMS) and expiratory (EMS), the VDG maintained higher the CDG, the 1st and 2nd PP PP (PP 1: -44.07 +/- 12.72 vs. -37.03 +/- 9.5; 2nd PP: -56.79 +/- 15.54 vs. -49.13 +/- 14.69 / 1 PP: 41.45 +/- 16.52 versus 32.93 +/- 5.05; 2nd PP: 50.35 +/- 21.83 versus 37.63 +/- 8.93.) Conclusion: Regardless of the type of delivery was significantly lower in respiratory muscle strength in the immediate postpartum period. However, women in post-cesarean delivery had higher drop in inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength compared in women after vaginal delivery.</summary>
