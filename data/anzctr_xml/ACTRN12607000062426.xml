    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial of the Laerdal infant resuscitator (control) to provide positive pressure ventilation (in line with the Australian Resuscitation Council guidelines) during resuscitation of infants born at less than 29 weeks gestation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is always used during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), there are no current recommendations about the use of PEEP or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during neonatal resusciation.

The Neopuff is a manual ventilation device which delivers PEEP or CPAP. The Laerdal bag is the commonest manual ventilation device in use worldwide and does not deliver PEEP.

Our hypothesis is that the delivery of PEEP or CPAP to very premature infants at birth may lead to a more rapid improvement in lung volume and therefore oxygenation.</summary>
