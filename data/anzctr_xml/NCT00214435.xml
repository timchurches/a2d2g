  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Poor compliance is thought to be a major cause of treatment failure. The TEddI study is a
      randomised, multi-centre, open-label study in well-controlled treatment-experienced
      HIV-infected patients to assess compliance with a once-daily regimen of antiretroviral
      therapy versus continuation of current anti-retroviral regimen delivered at least twice
      daily.</summary>
