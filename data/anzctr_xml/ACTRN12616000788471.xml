    <interventions>Non-operative management group (NOM) Children in the NOM group will receive intravenous Piperacillin with Tazobactam (Tazocin) 100mg/kg/ dose every 8 hours for at least 24 hours, and they will be observed and reassessed within 24 hours after randomisation. A further 24 hours of intravenous Piperacillin with Tazobactam therapy will be offered to children in invariable condition. A clinical decision will be made by the attending surgeon to offer operative management if a patients condition deteriorates at any time, or if a patient has failed to improve after 48 hours of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Once the patient is clinically improving and tolerating oral intake, the antibiotic regimen will be changed to oral Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 22.5mg/kg/dose twice per day to complete a total seven day course of antibiotics. Oral Ciprofloxacin 15mg/kg/dose twice daily and oral Metronidazole 10mg/kg/dose twice daily will be offered to children who are known to have an intolerance or allergy to Amoxicillin or Clavulanic acid.</interventions>
    <comparator>Appendectomy group (Operative management, OM). Children allocated to OM may receive preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis as clinically indicated. Appendicectomy will be performed laparoscopically, or via open surgery according to the surgeons standard practice. Postoperative antibiotic treatment will be determined on the basis of intraoperative findings in accordance with the institutional practice. The appendix specimen will be examined by a paediatric pathologist, and the formal histopathology report will be recorded.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment-related complications i.e. complications that are attributed to the intervention received. For those in the non-operative management group, this could include reactions to antibiotic received e.g. hypersensitivity reaction, nausea, vomiting. For those in the operative management group this would include surgical site infection(s), and/or wound dehiscence.

These complications are assessed by clinical examination, tests, review of medical records, and at post-discharge telephone interviews.</outcome>

      <outcome>Cost of treatment in Australian Dollars (AUD). It will be based on fees registered in Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and institution standard pre-determined admission costing. It is calculated as a fee per day of in-hospital care, a fee for use of the operating room, the cost of a course of intravenous and oral antibiotics, and the cost for total analgesic use. Cost for any additional admission will be calculated the same way when it is applicable.

    <statisticalmethods>The main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle, but both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed. The intention-to-treat population will include all randomised participants who commence on a treatment, excluding consent withdrawals. The per-protocol population will include all participants who complete the study at 1year follow-up. Subgroup analysis will be performed to compare outcomes of children enrolled on the study  after clinically diagnosed appendicitis to those enrolled after appendicitis diagnosed on medical imaging using the same outcome measures. A non-inferiority analysis will be performed to compare both the primary and secondary outcomes. Based on current adult literature, the treatment efficacy difference between operative and non-operative treatment is about 25-35%. The most recent randomised controlled trial in adults used 25% as its non-inferiority margin. In children, a 10% failure rate of NOM has been noted in the pilot study. Thus, a non-inferiority margin of 15% will be used in this study.

Sample size based on the reported post-appendicectomy complication rate of 1.9-8.8% and negative appendicectomy rate of 6-15% we would expect a treatment efficacy of 90% in the control OM group. Based on the reported treatment efficacy of 63-73% in adults treated with NOM and 87.5-98.7% in children ], we would expect a possible difference of treatment efficacy between control and treatment group to be between 15-25%. Thus the failure rate in the OM group is assumed to be 10% and a failure rate of 25% or more in the antibiotic group would be considered unacceptably high. For the non-inferiority study, the null hypothesis is that the antibiotic treatment is inferior and we wish to have an 80% power at 5% significance to rule out inferiority if the failure rate difference is 15% or lower (assuming the stated estimate of 10% failure rate in the surgery group). This requires a sample size of approximately 80 per group, however we plan to recruit 110 patients per group to allow for up to 25% loss to follow up. Each study site treats approximately 300 cases of appendicitis each year (600 in total) of which approximately 60% will be uncomplicated, resulting in a total of 360 eligible cases. Assuming a recruitment rate of 30%, we would recruit 110 per annum, thus aiming to recruit over a period of 2-3 years.

Categorical variables will be characterised using frequencies and percentages. Statistical significance for categorical data will be tested using the Pearson X2 test. Continuous variables will be characterised as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile range for non-parametric data. Differences between groups for normally distributed variables will be tested using the independent sample t test. The Mann-Whitney test will be used for variables not normally distributed. Non-inferiority for NOM will be tested using the 1-sided Wald tests with an alpha level of 0.05. Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS Statistics Program.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of non-operative antibiotic management of clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children. Enrolled patients will be randomised and an allocation ratio of 1:1 will be made
via weighted minimisation, where half of the patients will receive non-operative management with intravenous Piperacillin with Tazobactam, while the other half will have an appendicectomy.</summary>
