  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is divided into three phases. The first two phases are being conducted in healthy volunteers. The third phase will be conducted in patients who have been diagnosed with Hepatitis C genotype 1.

The first phase of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of four single doses of ACH 0143422 or placebo (50mg, 150mg, 300mg or 500mg).  This first part will also examine the different absorption rates between fed and fasted groups and these results will inform how patients are dosed in the rest of the trial.

The second phase will evaluate the safety ,tolerability and pharmacokinetics of four different dosing regiments of ACH0143422 or placebo (50mg, 150mg, 300mg or 500mg) taken once a day for 14 days.  

The third phase of the study will be conducted in HCV positive patients and will evaluate safety ,tolerability and pharmacokinetics of four different dosing regimens of ACH0143422 or placebo (50mg, 150mg, 300mg or 500mg) taken once a day for 7 days. It will also examine the effect the study drug/placebo has on the HCV viral load.
