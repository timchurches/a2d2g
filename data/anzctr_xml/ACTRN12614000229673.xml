  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Quality of Life at the End of Life (QUAL-E) instrument is a survey to measure quality of life at end of life from the patient's perspective. Originally a 25-item self-report tool, the instrument investigates 4 domains: a) life completion; b) relationship with health providers, c) preparation for end of life; and d) symptom impact. The QUAL-E was validated in 2011 as a reduced 17-item version. Piloting the tool with Australian hospital palliative care patients in 2009 revealed its potential utility as aid from clinical care when administered as an interview by research assistant.
This current trial will further pilot the QUAL-E to evaluate its feasibility and clinical utility when administered as an interview. The QUAL-E interviews will be conducted by a research assistant with nursing and research experience. Each interview will be conducted face-to-face and audio-recorded. The research assistant will document patient participants' responses to each item on a hard copy instrument. Audio-recording of the QUAL-E interview will also be audio-recorded to faciltate the capture, transcription and content analysis of patients' qualitative responses. Each patient will be interviewed once; there will be no follow-up. It is envisaged that each interview will last approximately 30 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>This study aims to explore the utility of the QUAL-E as an aid for clinical care and whether it is feasible to use in inpatient and outpatient settings. This is a single group study where the intervention will be applied to all participants.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Recruitment will continue until saturation of the qualitative data is reached in each of the inpatient and outpatient groups. It is envisaged that the total sample size willl be 50.
1. Demographic characteristics will be summarised using descriptive statistics to provide a profile of the sample. 
2. Qualitative analysis:
Audio recorded interviews will be transcribed verbatim and transcripts subjected to thematic analysis. Coding of the data will be managed using N-vivo software. 
3.Quantitative analysis
The duration in minutes taken to complete the QUAL-E instruments and participants responses to the five feasibility questions analysed to produce descriptive statistics, including means, range, and frequencies.  
Patients QUAL-E domain scores will be compared to Distress Thermomter scale ratings to determine potential relationships for future examination.  Summary statistics including means and standard deviations for symmetric data, and medians and quartiles for asymmetric data will be provided for all quantitative variables (i.e. the 4 domains of life completion, relationship with healthcare provider, preparation for end of life and symptom impact from the QUAL-E instrument as well as DT scores). Frequency tables will be provided for the dichotomous variables listed in the problem list on the DT survey. Relationships between patients QUAL-E domain scores and DT scores will be investigated using correlation and regression analyses and graphical displays.  All analyses will be conducted using the R environment for statistical computing (R 2013).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the feasibility and utility of the Quality of Life at the End of Life (QUAL-E) instrument in helping staff care for and understand the concerns of people with advanced cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, have a diagnosis of advanced cancer and receiving inpatient palliative care or outpatient cancer care at the study hospital. Trial details All participants in this study will complete an interview with the QUAL-E used as an interview tool. The QUAL-E instrument explores four domains: symptom impact, relationship with healthcare providers, life completion and preparation for end of life, which have been found to influence patients quality of life. This study will use mixed methods to conduct a qualitative content analysis of patients responses to the QUAL-E when administered by a research nurse, and a quantitative assessment of feasibility and the possible association between QUAL-E and Distress Thermometer scores.
