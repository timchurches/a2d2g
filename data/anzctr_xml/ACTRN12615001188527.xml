  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this project we will observe the effect of alkylglycerol (Alkyrol) supplementation (in the form of a capsule) on overweight/obese males. The study will involve a cross-over design, where participants will take a supplement of Alkyrol (shark liver oil capsule) or placebo (dummy capsule) for three weeks, a wash out (no supplementation) period of three weeks and cross over to Alkyrol or placebo for three weeks. Over this time blood will be collected at certain points and then analysed to observe the effect of alkylglycerol on plasmalogens and the effect of inflammation.

Alkyrol will be administered 2g twice daily, the maximum recommended dose (4g daily). Any unused capsules will be asked to be returned between treatments. Blood tests will be done before and after each treatment arm to monitor participants.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations are based on the primary endpoint of circulating plasmalogen concentrations. To our knowledge the current proposal will be the first to use alkrol to specifically increase circulating molecular species of plasmalogen.  
We have performed lipid profiling on several human cohorts (plasma) and the variation in lipid concentrations is typically in the order of 20%.  Sample sizes of 10 will allow us to detect a mean 20% change in the plasmalogen levels with a significance of 0.05 at a power of 0.80. To detect a difference in circulating plasmalogens between the active and placebo arms of the study, 10 participants would provide a power of 80% at an a=0.05 to detect a 20% difference  in specific plasmalogen species. 
The change in plasma lipids and other parameters measured will be compared between active and placebo treatments using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Comparisons between treatments will include treatment order as a between-subject variable. Individual mean comparisons will be made using appropriate post-hoc testing performed where ANOVAs are significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In previous studies, we and others have observed that the levels of plasmalogens (a class of phospholipid (blood fat)) are lower in obese people and people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular (heart) disease. In one of our studies we have shown that dietary supplementation of alkylglycerol (fats found in the liver of most animals and fish) can increase levels of plasmalogens. This increase is associated with a reduction of athersosclerosis (artery blockage) in mice. In separate experiments, after treating mice on a high fat diet with alkylglycerols, we observed a reduction in the inflammation caused by obesity.

In this project we will observe the effect of alkylglycerol (Alkyrol) supplementation (in the form of a capsule) on overweight/obese males. The study will involve a cross-over design, where participants will take a supplement of Alkyrol (shark liver oil capsule) or placebo (dummy capsule) for three weeks, a wash out (no supplementation) period of three weeks and cross over to Alkyrol or placebo for three weeks. Over this time blood will be collected at certain points and then analysed to observe the effect of alkylglycerol on plasmalogens and the effect of inflammation.

We will recruit 10 overweight/obese men (Body Mass Index (BMI  a measure of body fat based in relation to your height) of 28-35kg/m2), not being treated for hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes or cardiovascular (heart) disease or taking any fish oil supplements. 

This study represents the first proof of concept (demonstration) human trial that alkylglycerols can modify circulating plasmalogen levels and influence inflammation. If positive, this randomised clinical trial will support therapeutic approaches targeting plasmalogen modification for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
