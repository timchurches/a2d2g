    <concealment>Allocation will be concealed. Eligible women will be offered participation in GEMS when considering their options for testing for GDM midpregnancy. They will be  provided with the study information by their lead maternity carer (LMC) or the research personnel, counselled about the study and with their consent can be provisionally enrolled in the trial prior to testing for GDM. All consenting women will have a 75g OGTT arranged by their LMC with plasma glucose concentrations determined on fasting, and at 1 and 2 hours. After their OGTT, elible women will be randomised, at a ratio 1:1, using a central computerised system, into two study groups: either the IADPSG Diagnostic Criteria Group or the Current Diagnostic Group.</concealment>
    <sequence>The central randomisation service will use a randomisation schedule with balanced variable blocks, prepared by an investigator  not involved with recruitment or clinical care, using a randomisation table created by computer software. Stratification will be by BMI (&lt;25 and &gt;/=25) and by planned birthing institution. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>For the primary outcome of LGA, a trial of 9,624 women will be able to show an 18.0% reduction in risk from 12.2% with current New Zealand criteria to 10.0% using the IADPSG criteria (International Association of Diabetes Pregnancy Study Groups Consensus Panel 2010), ('alpha' = 5%, two-tailed, 90% power, 10% loss to follow up), based on HAPO (HAPO Study Cooperative Research Group 2008) and LGA rates from unpublished information in ACHOIS. 
The analyses will follow several key steps. Baseline characteristics of all randomised women will be summarised descriptively by study groups. treatment evaluations will use intention-to-treat principle. Statistical tests will be two-sided and maintained at 5% level of significance. Imputation method will be applied to the primary outcome with any missing data. the risks estimates and 95% CIs will be reported using log binomial regression for binary outcomes. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a significant health problem affecting one in every 12 pregnant women or over 5,200 women in New Zealand annually. GDM has a major, negative impact on maternal and perinatal health with lifelong consequences. There is no consensus as to the degree of high blood glucose needed for the diagnosis of GDM or when treatment will be beneficial, due to a lack of high quality evidence.  
Our randomised trial compares important health outcomes for mothers and babies of treating women with GDM by the current criteria used in New Zealand with newly proposed criteria, that use a lower threshold and will diagnose more women as having GDM. Our results will show which diagnostic criteria is best for the health of mothers and babies, which is more cost-effective, and so provide the necessary information to guide clinical practice and policy in New Zealand, with global relevance.
