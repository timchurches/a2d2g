  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at time of Screening.

          2. Screening laboratory result indicating HCV GT1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-infection.

          3. Subject has positive anti-HCV Ab and plasma HCV RNA viral load greater than or equal
             to 1000 IU/mL at Screening visit.

          4. Subjects must be HCV treatment-naïve (i.e., subject has never received a single dose
             of any approved or investigational anti-HCV medication) or HCV treatment-experienced
             (subject who has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV, or SOF plus RBV with
             or without pegIFN). GT3 subjects must be HCV treatment-naïve. Previous HCV treatment
             must have been completed greater than or equal to 2 months prior to Screening.

          5. Subjects naïve to ART must have CD4+ count great than or equal to 500 cells/mm^3 (or
             CD4+ % greater than or equal to 29%) at Screening; or Subjects on a stable ART regimen
             must have

               -  CD4+ count greater than or equal to 200 cells/mm^3 (or CD4+ % greater than or
                  equal to 14%) at Screening; and

               -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA below LLOQ at Screening and at least once during the 12 months
                  prior to Screening.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol
             abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          2. Positive test result at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

          3. Positive Human Immunodeficiency virus, type 2 (HIV-2) Ab at Screening.

          4. Receipt of any other investigational or commercially available direct acting anti-HCV
             agents other than sofosbuvir (e.g., telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, paritaprevir,
             grazoprevir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, ombitasvir, elbasvir or dasabuvir).

          5. Consideration by the investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable
             candidate to receive ABT-493/ABT-530.</exclusivecriteria>
