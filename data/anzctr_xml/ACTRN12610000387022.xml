  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individual tailored program performed in group
setting which aims to improve deficit functioning
in three areas of social cognition; Theory of
Mind, Attribution Style and Emotion Processing.

Participants complete both group based activities
and learning interspersed with individual
computer training based on the three social
cognitive constructs.

The intervention is run in small groups of 6 
Participants per group by a provisional 
psychologist. The program will be delivered
over 13 weeks and each of these 13 weekly 
session is 1 hour in duration. The sessions 
are comprised of a mixture of group activities 
and computer based training tasks.

Computer based tasks: Training in 3 areas of 
social cognition:

a) Theory of Mind
 Computerised tasks which
require participants to consider the actions and
intentions of people in the format of video 
vignettes of various social scenarios.

Written vignettes of social situations presented 
whereby participant has to explain (by 
choosing multiple choice answer) what the faux
pas is/ why someone said this.., etc. 

Perspective taking task - False beliefs are presented
 in written form and user must interpret situations 
appropriately, e.g. If this happened...... then what
 would A think about B (focusing on second-order 
beliefs).

b) Emotion Recognition
 Baron-Cohen 'Mind
reading-Interactive guide to
emotion' consists of facial expressions and
vocalisations in a story for 412
emotions (24 groups).

c) Attribution Style
Situations presented in form
 of a statement and four interpretations to choose
 from  then Decision made and/or plausibility rating
 given for each interpretation. Further information is
 then given and a second decision is made and/or a
 change in plausibility ratings (i.e. if they want to change)
 
25 scenarios  in addition to an initial statement 
 followed by two successive statements, each providing
 additional information that further disambiguates
 the scenario. Participant asked to change
 decision/plausibility rating if desire.	

Paintings presented (on computer in power-point
 show) and four possible titles to choose from according
 to plausibility.

Group Based Activities:

Emotion Processing-'' Learning how to observe
emotion''

a) Confusing Emotions- Each participant asked to
briefly dot point a time in their own lives when
they confused the emotion of someone else
(pen/paper). This will be introduced with a brief
antidote by clinician to illustrate (5mins)

b) Knowing Emotion- Each participant asked to
list as many emotions possible (pen/paper)
(5mins). These individual lists are then
combined to form a group list of emotions
(whiteboard) (5 mins)

c) Linking emotions to facial expressions- Group
uses knowledge from part b (knowing emotions)
to identify emotions in Elkman's Photo's
(slideshow/ group generated whiteboard list) (15
mins). Participants then pair up for a quiz which
requires them to identify the emotion depicted in
a series of other photos, cartoons, paintings
showing facial emotion (20 items) (20 mins)

Attribution Style- 'Social Investigators'

a) Causal Explanations- Group brainstorms list of
possible explanations for positive and negative
events (slide show) 10 items-5
positive/5negative) (15 mins).

B) Using facts (situation variables or statements)
rather than inferences to draw conclusions-
Illustrated with a game of '20 questions'
conducted in pairs. Each participant gets a
printed scenario of an ambiguous event and
partner must ask questions to obtain information
about the cause (answer also included on sheet)
(40 mins).

Theory of Mind- 'Recognising the beliefs of
other people'

a) Video-based training- Group views 10 scenes
(showing 2 or more people) from popular cinema
which requires identification of character mental
states. Each participants dot points a general
description of the scene (who involved/what
were they doing/what happened). Participants
must then dot point what the characters might
think/feel/want (can be further prompted with
questions: why do you think they did that?)
(pen/paper) (40 mins)

b) False Belief Picture sequence- Quiz which
requires participants to order short cartoon
sequence in order to tell a story (4 items per
sequence/4 sequences) presented on slideshow
(15 mins)</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual- existing pharmacotherapy
regimens and weekly case manager meeting.
Researchers will not alter existing managment of
participants randomly assigned to the control
group. Consequently, both meetings and
pharmacotherapy are likely to vary according to
individual presentations, needs and
preferences/abilities of their case worker and
prescribing physicians. Researchers expect the
majority of the these individuals will be currently
taking some form of anti-psychotic medications.
Atypical Antipsychotics may include; risperidone,
olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine, aripiprazole
and paliperidone. Typical antipsychotic
medications include the following classes;
chlorpromazine, thioridazine, trifluperazine,
haloperidol, flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol. It is
also possible that participants may be on other
classes of medications such as mood stabilisers.
Untill recruitment it is not possible to stipulate
this information. In regards to case managment,
determined by individual needs, these will be
structured around mental state, containment
around any presenting crisis, medication
concerns or other presenting problems. It will
not involve use of other psychological
interventions. Duration should be no longer that
1 hour (except in case of deterioration of mental
state).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Theory of Mind Ability- Will be assessed using
Steffan Moritz/ Robyn Langdon computerised
sequencing task. The cartoon version of this task
is a common neuropsychological measure of Theory of Mind (ToM) ability- Morritz and collegues in Germany are the
first to have computerised this measure to allow
for a more standardised tool which will promote
psychometric comparison.</outcome>
      <timepoint>13 weeks and 6 month follow-up are timed from
the point of pre assessment (following referral
and diagnostic interview)</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attribution Style- will be measured using the
Internal, Personal, Situational Attribution
Questionnaire( IPSAQ) (Kinderman &amp; Bentall,
1996) - 32 social scenarios (16 positive
outcomes/16 negative outcomes) which require
respondent to write down most likely cause of
each. Answers are categorised as
internal/external and personal/situational locus.</outcome>

      <outcome>Emotion Processing Ability a) Emotion
Recognition will be measured using the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy Scale (DANVA)
(Nowicki) - computerised exercise of
photographs depicting facial expression and
audio recordings of vocal tones which requires a
judgment about the emotion content of each (8
mins). Most commonly used in
neuropsychological research. Training using the
Baron-Cohen ' mind-reading' program will also
be used which trains individuals in recognising
emotions in facial expression and through vocal
prosody.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a
social cognitive remediation program for adult
individuals with schizophrenia. The program is
tailored to individual ability discerned from
baseline assessment but conducted in a group
setting for increased peer support and
interaction. It is hypothesised that completion of
the program will result in improved social
cognitive ability in three primary domains. It is
also hypothesised that such improvements will
extend to social functioning in the community
and overall symptomatology.</summary>
