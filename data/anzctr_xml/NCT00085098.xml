  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - filgrastim
Treatment: drugs - carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Regimen A (radiotherapy only) - Within 52 days of surgery, patients will undergo standard-dose radiation therapy 5 days a week for approximately 5-6 weeks.

Experimental: Regimen B (chemotherapy plus radiotherapy) - Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2 and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses.
Within 3 weeks of completing chemotherapy, patients with CR undergo low-dose radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Patients with MRD, a PR, or SD receive chemotherapy courses 3 and 4 as outlined below.
Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 3, and filgrastim (G-CSF), subcutaneous (SC) or IV beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.
Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses. Patients achieving a CR or MRD proceed to reduced-dose radiotherapy. Patients with a PR, SD, or progressive disease (PD) are restaged and may undergo standard radiation therapy as in regimen A. Reduced-dose radiation therapy: Within 6 weeks of starting course 4, patients undergo lower-dose radiation therapy once daily on days 1-5 for 5 weeks

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free Survival - Data will be summarized as number of patients in the following categories at the time of data cutoff for analyses of 3-year EFS: 1)Experienced a qualifying event (QE) (see below);2)Event-free through 3 years of follow-up;3)Event-free until data cutoff (if less than 3 years of follow-up);4)Withdrew from study;5)Lost to follow-up.
QEs: 1)disease progression, defined as increase &gt;= 40% in tumor volume or &gt;= 25% in tumor area of target lesions;2)development of new lesions;3)occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm, defined as a malignancy with different histological type from trial-qualifying diagnosis;4)death from any cause.
Stat. analyses will be based on time from enrollment to the earliest of: 1)occurrence of any of the QEs;2)withdrawal from study or lost to follow-up;3)completion of three years of follow-up event-free;4)data cutoff for completion of the statistical analyses for the protocol's primary objective.
NOTE: Reported data are through May 2009 (see Caveats section).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study enrollment until date of earliest qualifying event (QE), date last known to be QE-free if the patient is followed for less than three years and is QE-free at the time of analysis, or 3 years if the patient is QE-free at 3 years</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity and Safety as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 - The analysis of toxicity will focus on estimating the rates of key acute and subacute toxicity occurring during the first induction chemotherapy. Estimates will be obtained using life-table methods with an event defined as the first occurrence of a key acute or sub-acute toxicity. Patients who have progression or recurrence of disease will be censored in these analyses. The precision of the estimates of toxicity rate can be approximated by an analysis of binomial proportions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the beginning of treatment, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life (QOL) and Neurocognitive Assessment (NP) - The primary endpoints for QOL and NP assessments will be the global scale value from each of these instruments at the two-year time point. Analyses of subscales (if they exist) and of assessments at other times will be of secondary interest. It is assumed that scale values are standardized to a reference normal population. Comparisons of each treatment group with the standard population mean, using a two-sided test with Type I error 0.025 (an adjustment for multiple comparison) will be able to detect differences from the standard mean that are 20% smaller.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy alone is as effective as chemotherapy plus
      radiation therapy in treating germ cell tumor.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy alone to see how well
      it works compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed primary CNS germ cell tumor.</summary>
