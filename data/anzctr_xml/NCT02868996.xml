    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age (inclusive);

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Any significant past or current cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal or other medical
             condition which in the opinion of the investigator would make participation of the

             safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of the study;

          2. Subjects who have abnormal safety labs outside the local lab ranges will be excluded
             at PI's discretion based on his/her assessment of clinical significance (can be
             repeated once at screening at PI's discretion);

             pressure and 50 mm Hg - 90 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (both inclusive) at
             screening (can be repeated once at screening as per PI's discretion);

             infections in the last 4 weeks prior to screening;

          7. Clinical or laboratory evidence of an active infection at the time of screening;

          8. Known alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (a1-antitrypsin deficiency);

          9. Serological evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), or anti-hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV) at screening;

         10. Vaccination within 3 months of screening for the study or requiring vaccination during
             the study or within 3 months after completion of the study;

         11. Females who are pregnant or nursing;

         12. Females of childbearing potential (i.e., any woman who is not surgically sterile e.g.,
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or &gt;1-year postmenopause status confirmed by
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels as defined by established lab ranges) and
             all men who, if participating in heterosexual sexual activity that could lead to
             pregnancy are unable or unwilling to practice medically effective contraception during
             the study. They should agree to use two reliable methods of contraception (e.g.,
             double-barrier condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus a stable dose of
             hormonal contraception) throughout the study period and until 3 months after receiving
             study drug. Women of childbearing potential will require compulsory pregnancy testing.
             A negative pregnancy test (serum and urine) will be documented during screening and at
             Day -1 respectively;

         13. Participation in any other drug study within 8 weeks or 5 half-lives of the study
             drug, whichever is longer;

         14. Unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol requirements for study visits and
             procedures;

         15. Subjects who do not have good venous access for infusion of study drug or for blood
             sampling;</exclusivecriteria>
