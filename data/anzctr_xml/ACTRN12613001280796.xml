Sample size (100 subjects per group) was based on detecting a 10% change in dietary score  (25 to 23) with a standard deviation of 5% (80% power and 5% significance level). Assuming 25 students in each class and an ICC of 0.01, a design effect of 25% was added giving a target of 125 subjects per group (250 in total).  These estimates were derived from the findings from a pilot Assuming a 10% drop study conducted to determine study feasibility (Chellappha, 2012).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background Dietary choice habits are known to influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, which even in childhood are a predictor of future morbidity. Our objective was determining the impact of a school-based intervention of providing fruit daily in the classroom and its effects on risk factors for CVD, and dietary behavior. 
Methods The study was a randomized controlled trial involving two public and two private schools, one of each in an intervention and control group. Measurement at both the start and end of eight weeks aimed to identify any changes in physiological measures, child and parental attitudes and food choices.
Results The intervention had minimal impact on physiological variables, but was effective in improving the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed and attitudes towards fruit intake. Parent lifestyle and dietary choices were poor at baseline, but significantly improved in parents of children in the intervention group compared to the control group.
Conclusion This intervention was effective in improving the amount of fruit consumed and attitudes towards fruit intake over just 2 months. It has also shown the importance of not just the school environment but also suggests the home environment can influence children developing good dietary choice habits and lifestyle.

    <publicnotes>The final number of participants was greater than the estimated sample size requirements as all participants in participating classes were included and the class size was essentially the determinant of final numbers. </publicnotes>
