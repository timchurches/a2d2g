    <statisticalmethods>The percentage of patients who have complete exclusion of the left atrial appendage after the Atriclip will be obtained using intra-operative and post-operative transoesophageal echocardiogram. 
All continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. All categorical variables will be summarized using the number and percent of subjects within each category. The variables that will be described are: Age, Sex, ease of application, aortic cross clamp time, Cardiopulmonary bypass time, complications (CVA, TIA, Bleeding from atrial appendage, thromboembolism), length of stay, presence of atrial fibrillation.
A one proportion test will be used to assess our closure rate compared to previous studies.

We hypothesised a percentage of 90% of complete exclusion of the left atrial appendage using the AtriClip , and previous studies showed rates of approximately 60% with the various other techniques. With 20 patients we could detect a significant difference of 27% with 80% power and a 5% level of significance, which is sufficient to determine effectiveness of the AtriClip. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the most common source of thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Such thrombus has the potential to embolise to the brain, causing stroke. 
Ligation of the appendage is a commonly performed concomitant procedure in patients with AF undergoing heart surgery for other reasons . Current literature suggests that complete exclusion of the left atrial appendage occurs in only 40% of patients undergoing ligation and intra-atrial closure.  A small amount of data suggests better long term exclusion of the LAA with the Atriclip device. In addition there is little risk of bleeding compare to excision and oversewing.  We would like to collect data on patients undergoing left atrial appendage ligation using the Atriclip device
