Experimental: Arm I - Patients receive oral cediranib maleate once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin repeats every 21 days for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Active Comparator: Arm II - Patients receive oral placebo once daily in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I.

    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving paclitaxel and
      carboplatin together with AZD2171 may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether
      giving paclitaxel and carboplatin together with AZD2171 is more effective than giving
      paclitaxel and carboplatin together with a placebo in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel and
      carboplatin together with cediranib maleate works and compares it to giving paclitaxel and
      carboplatin together with placebo in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small
      cell lung cancer.</summary>
