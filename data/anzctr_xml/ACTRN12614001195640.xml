  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A: Resection of colorectal liver metastases without routine hilar lymphadenectomy. However, patients with macroscopically enlarged lymph nodes undergo lymphadenectomy in accordance with current guidelines at the Department of Visceral, Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden. These patients will be analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. 

Group B: Routine hilar lymphadenectomy
First, exploration of the abdomen and intraoperative ultrasound are performed to assess the extent of intrahepatic and potential extrahepatic disease and to confirm resectability. Hilar lymphadenectomy is performed before actual resection of the colorectal liver metastases. Following cholecystectomy in a fundus-first fashion, hilar lymphadenectomy is carried out including defined groups of lymph nodes (nomenclature of the lymph nodes according to the Japanese classification of gastric cancer).  The groups of lymph nodes at the following sites will be resected : Common hepatic artery, Coeliac trunk, duodenal ligament, hepatic artery,  Hepatoduodenal ligament, portal vein/bile duct.
The duration of each procedure is approximately 200 minutes

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Statistical methods are used to assess the quality of data, homogeneity of treatment groups, endpoints and safety of the two intervention groups. The confirmatory analysis is performed on the basis of an intention-to-treat (ITT) population and with respect to ITT principles.
Categorical data are summarized by means of absolute and relative frequencies (count and percent). Continuous data are presented by means of the following summary statistics: the number of observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum. Wherever appropriate, data are visualized by box-whisker plots or histograms. The primary efficacy endpoint is amount of intraoperative blood loss. A confirmatory intention to treat analysis (2-sided test), including all patients as randomized, is performed on the disease recurrence rates between the two groups. Binary logistic regression analysis is used to detect possible treatment differences with disease recurrence as dependent variable, age at surgery, MSKCC score and adjuvant chemotherapy as covariates. The sample size calculation is based on a two-sided test, and it can be assumed that evaluation with logistic regression analysis has the same or even higher power.
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed in an exploratory way, using appropriate statistical methods based on the underlying distribution of the data. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted including per-protocol population and center as additional covariates in the logistic regression model.  
Sample size calculation
The sample size is based on the primary outcome parameter and the primary analysis. Clinical studies on patients undergoing resection of colorectal liver metastases showed recurrence rates of 50% at two years. To detect a clinically relevant absolute difference in reduction of disease recurrence of 20% with significance =5% and a power of 1=80% n=186 patients have to be randomized in the study (n=93 patients per group). Considering a drop-out rate of 20% (perioperative mortality, unresectable disease, loss to follow-up) mortality within 2 years due to underlying disease the total sample size accounts for n=224 patients
