    <interventions>Regulation of the factors that control food intake, the function of the stomach and small intestine and release of gut hormones is complex, and our understanding of this field is far from complete. There is increasing evidence that nutrient stimuli in the gut, especially in the small intestine, induce changes in gut motor and hormonal functions that play a central role in the control of energy intake and blood glucose. In particular high-protien diets have been found to be very effective for weight loss and for improving blood glucose in obese with and without type 2 diabetes. 
This study aims to investigate the effects of amino acids, L-glutamate and L-glutamine on gut motility, gut hormone release, blood glucose control and energy intake in humans. We hypothesise that L-glutamate and L-glutamine, as building blocks of protiens, may substantially contribute to the benefical effects of whole protien on gut functions and energy intake regulation. 
A total of 20 Caucasian male and female (BMI 18-25 kg/m2) subjects, aged between 18 - 50 years, will be included in the study. Each subject will be studied on four occasions. On each occasion, they will recieve, in randomised, double-blind fashion, a 90-min intraduodenal infusion of (i) L-glutamate at 0.2 kcal/min (4.4 g/90 min), (ii), L-glutamine at 0.2 kcal/min (4.4 g/90 min), (iii) L-glutamine at 0.4 kcal/min (8.8 g/90 min) or (iv) saline (negative control). Gut motility, blood glucose, gut hormone release, insulin concentrations, appetite perceptions and energy intake during a buffet meal , as well as vital signs, will be measured. The buffet meal will be provided at the end of each of the four infusions and the participant has 30mins to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices of white bread, 4 slices of brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions mayonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and 14g milkyway chocolate bar. Each volunteer will recieve one of each infusion solutions on each of the four study days. Each study day will be seperated by no less than three days.</interventions>

      <timepoint>VAS questionnaires are taken at = -10, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 minutes, at each of the four sessions.

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A questionnaire is answered by the volunteer, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and eligibility is determined.  A signed informed consent is obtained and study dates are established. Eligable volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised treatment for each study visit, using a randomised table which was created on an excel spread sheet. Randomisation involved contacting the holder (study assistant) of the randomisation table to inform them of the next subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocationg a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution on each study day.</concealment>
