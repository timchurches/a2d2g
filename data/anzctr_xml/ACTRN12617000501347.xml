  <interventions>
    <interventions>The av-Guardian device is a small medical grade titanium implant, which will be implanted in the subcutaneous space above the fistula and under the skin by a vascular surgeon. [Procedure phase] Implantation of the device will be performed using the deployment tool, a spoon-like instrument on which the av-Guardian device sits  and is used to deliver the device into the subcutaneous space through a small incision. Two devices will be implanted per patient, one at the arterio side of the fistula (A site for suction of blood into the dialysis machine), and the other at the venous side (V site for return of blood from the dialysis machine). The procedure is minimally invasive, will take about 10 min. It will be done in the operating theatre. 
[Healing Phase] 2-4 weeks post-implantation, the implanting vascular surgeon will check the implant for sufficient fibrosis and stability, to determine device readiness for cannulation. 
[Cannulation Phase] After determination of device readiness by the vascular surgeon, the device will be used by trained cannulators such as renal nurses, nephrologist, interventionalist to guide the fistula needle for access to the AVF for hemodialysis, using a method that is similar to the buttonhole cannulation technique. Patients will be observed for cannulation through the device 3x a week, for 3 months from the first cannulation through the device. (total of 36 cannulations). Cannulation will be done at the designated trial dialysis centre. 
The device can remain in situ for the lifetime of the fistula. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Each subject will receive 2 devices and undergo 3 cannulations per week for 3 months with each device, resulting in a total of 36 cannulations per device, and 72 cannulations per subject.  Assuming a 100% (12/12) procedural success rate, it is estimated (using the Wilson method) that the 95% confidence interval on the rate will be 75.7% - 100.0%.  There will also be 432 (6x2x36) cannulations available for analysis.  Assuming a 75% cannulation success rate (324/432), the 95% confidence interval on the cannulation success rate will be 70.7% - 78.9%. These estimates are considered to be sufficiently precise.

The endpoints will by evaluated by subject and by device. Specific to the endpoint being analysed, the subject and/or the device will be included as a repeated effect in the analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and performance of the av-Guardian
Vascular Access System, The av-Guardian is designed to aid in a repeatable and reliable vascular access to the AVF for patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis, using a constant site method of needle insertion.
Current techniques for cannulation to access an AVF for dialysis are:
1. rope ladder technique: involves cannulation of the whole access length, alternate cannulation points spaced 3cm apart; however, if 3cm spacing is not available, cannulator tends to space cannulation points within millimeters apart, resulting in area cannulation
2. Area technique: involves cannulation in the same small vessel area, which may lead to vessel damage and the development of stenosis and aneurysm
3. Buttonhole technique: involves constant cannulation on the same spot for all dialysis sessions (which requires the same skilled nurse to cannulate the patient at the exact same spot, at the exact same angle, at the exact same depth, for 10-20 sessions). A sharp needle is first used in the access, but as a scar tissue tract develops, a blunt needle can be used to access the AVF, which may be less painful for the patient.
Despite the advantage in delaying interventions and reducing the number of common complications associated with AVF, the Buttonhole technique is not widely used due to the high skill barrier. Participants in the study will be cannulated using a method that is similar to the buttonhole technique- predicating on the buttonhole technique, the av-Guardian guides the cannulation, lowering the skill variability required in the creation and maintenance of a quality needle tract, so that the benefits of the buttonhole technique can be achieved.</summary>
