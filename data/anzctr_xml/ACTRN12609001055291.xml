  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 different conditions of inspired air (treatments) will be supplied to the volunteers ranging from dry air at room temperature to saturated air at 40 degC. Each participant will receive all the treatments in a randomised order.

Different conditions are:
1. 25 degC and 0% Relative Humidity (RH)
2. 25 degC and 100% RH
3. 28 degC and 100% RH
4. 32 degC and 0% RH
5. 32 degC and 100% RH
6. 37 degC and 0% RH
7. 37 degC and 50% RH
8. 37 degC and 100% RH
9. 40 degC and 0% RH
10. 40 degC and 50% RH
11. 40 degC and 100% RH

For each of the gas condition, the volunteers are asked to breathe with three different rates that are controlled by a digital blinker written in LabVIEW and a stop watch. Humidity output between oral and nasal breathing will also be studied. Each treatment will last 30 minutes and includes all 3 respiratory rates on both oral and nasal breathing. 24 hours recovering period are given between each treatment. 

The study will run for 2 months and there will be no follow-up on the participants.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gas temperature, humidity and flow-rate will be continously monitored at 10 Hz. Using in-house developed laser hygrometer, K-type thermocouples and ndd Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) utrasonic flow-meter.

The thermodynamic response of the airway under different condition of inspired gas could potentially lead to determine the optimal level of heat and humidification</outcome>
