  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed research aims to complete a comprehensive assessment of the physical health of Vietnam Veterans with and without posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to improve the understanding of the illnesses associated with PTSD. Assessment of organ function in each group will be carried out to provide information regarding which conditions are associated with PTSD and how these relate and are inter-related. Mechanisms by which these proposed associations may be explained will be explored. This will include investigation of mechanisms which have been proposed as causing physical health damage in PTSD. These include dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA), chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system and chronic inflammation. In addition, neurogenetic and epigenetic studies will be included to identify the genes and their genetic and epigenetic variants that contribute to the susceptibility to either PTSD or to physical damage associated with PTSD.</summary>
