    <studytitle>Looking for better treatments for impetigo in Aboriginal children</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>An open label randomised controlled trial to determine if 5 days of once-daily oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or three days of twice-daily oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole will lead to non-inferior cure rates of impetigo compared to a single dose of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (the current gold standard treatment) in children living in remote Aboriginal communities between the age of 12 weeks to less than 13 years.</scientifictitle>

    <concealment>We will approach households with a local community health worker and request to screen children for skin sores. Children will also be identified by school and pre-school screening programs. For eligible children with impetigo, further explanation and consent will be requested to enter the trial and be randomised.
Eligible children will be randomised by the use of sealed, sequentially marked, opaque envelopes. Randomisation will be stratified by community and sore severity, to ensure an even distribution of community representation and severe or mild sores in each group. Sore severity will be classified as “mild” (&lt;5 sores, of which no more than one is purulent) or “severe” (=5 sores or =2 purulent sores). In each community two sets of randomisation envelopes will be provided – one for mild and one for severe sores.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be stratified by sore severity, to ensure an even distribution of severe or mild sores in each group. We will use a permuted block design. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size calculation
This will be a non-inferiority study, designed to demonstrate that the alternative treatment arms give non-inferior cure rates to the  current standard treatment (BPG) arm. We have defined noninferiority as a cure rate no more than 10% less than that of the current standard treatment arm, and have assumed a cure rate of 80% in the current standard treatment arm. Based on our expectation that the true difference between the alternative and the current standard treatment arms is zero, a sample size of 198 per group will allow us to demonstrate non-inferiority, with 80% power and a one-sided alpha of 0.05.

Target enrolment will be 660 subjects to provide 594 evaluable subjects (198 per group) assuming 10% withdrawal and/or loss to follow-up over the total study period.

Participant groups for analysis
All participants randomised will be analysed in the groups to which they were assigned.

Demographic analyses
Demographic data will be tabulated and expressed as proportions and/or means of the selected characteristics by study group with the corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). Differences between groups will be assessed by the normal test for comparison of means and chi2 tests for comparison of proportions. 

Primary endpoint analysis
The primary outcome is binomial; therefore the test for two proportions will be used. Confidence intervals will be calculated using the normal distribution.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to conduct a randomised controlled trial to determine the efficacy of two oral regimens of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to benzathine penicillin (BPG), for the treatment of skin sores (also known as impetigo) in Aboriginal children living in remote communities. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may be a much more acceptable oral alternative compared to the uncomfortable and poorly received intramuscular benzathine penicillin which is the current standard of care.</summary>
