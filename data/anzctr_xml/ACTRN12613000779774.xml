  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CARE4STROKE programme consists of 8 weeks of complementary exercise therapy done with a caregiver, next to the usual therapy. Thirty-one standardized exercises are available, that can be customized per patient and caregiver to the individual situation. The exercises can be presented in a book version with photos and text or in a smartphone/ tablet app with video's and voiceover. The exercises are aimed at improving skills related to walking ability like sitting, standing and making transfers, or are supporting exercises to improve mobility, strength and balance. The patient and their caregiver are asked to do the exercises for the length of 8 weeks, minimally 5 times a week for 30 minutes. Additionally, participants in the intervention group will wear the fitbit for the length of 8 weeks after randomization. The fitbit activity monitor is a portable lightweight clip-on device which aims to empower and encourage activity by provided real-time feedback on e.g. number of steps taken, distance covered and number of calories burned. During the 8-week intervention period patients and their caregiver will have a weekly session (approximately 30 min) with a trained therapist. In this session, the participating couple will be instructed as to which exercises should be performed safely during the next week and evaluate the exercises done last week. The programme starts when the patient is admitted to hospital. When the discharge date of the patient is earlier than the finishing of the programme, the programme continues at home (up to 8 weeks from randomisation). Tele-rehabilitation services will allow for instructions of the physical therapists including monitoring progress of patients by e-Health services including telephone conferencing based counselling (frequency as required) and weekly visits by a coordinating physical therapist from the setting of discharge.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics: Participation rate, compliance, satisfaction with the intervention and safety of the intervention will be reported as nominal variables to assess the feasibility. This will include frequencies, means and standard deviations. Most of the patient and caregiver characteristics will be considered as qualitative, categorical variables.

Univariate analysis: Baseline characteristics will be presented and between group differences will be studied to determine whether groups are comparable at baseline. When these data are not normally distributed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank sum test will be used. When the data are normally distributed student t-test will be used. Alpha will be set at 0.05.

Multivariate analysis: The main outcomes will be compared between the intervention and control group at the different timepoints T0, T1, T2 using repeated measures Analysis Of Variance with factors group (2 levels) and time (3 levels) when the data are normally distributed. The Kruskal-Wallis test will be used when the data is not normally distributed. Alpha will be set at 0.05. SPSS version 20 will be used for all analyses.

We expect a significant reduction of 11% (5 points) in the self-reported mobility domain of the SIS version 3.0 (van de Port 2012) in favour of those patients who are allocated to the experimental group. ICC is known to be about 0.9. We expect minimally 28 patients are required per arm of the trial. Expecting a drop-out rate of 10%, we suppose that a minimum of 62 stroke patients are required to achieve a sufficient statistical power of 80%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Several systematic reviews have indicated that additional exercise therapy and repetitive task training have a significant effect on functional outcome after stroke.  Guidelines therefore conclude that patients in a rehabilitation setting should have the opportunity to get an increase of intensity of therapy.  A new method to meet these recommendations could be to involve caregivers (partner, family, friends) in exercise training. Previous studies suggest that this form of exercises done with a caregiver can lead to a better functional outcome for the patient and less strain for the caregiver. 
This feasibility study will test the proof of concept of caregiver mediated exercises when combined with innovative ICT techniques (CARE4STROKE package) aimed at improving gait, ADL independency and allowing early discharge to patients own home setting after stroke.
We hypothesize that patients allocated to the CARE4STROKE programme will show better outcomes in terms of gait, gait-related activities and ADL with a reduced length of stay (LOS) when compared to usual care alone. In addition we hypothesize that this programme leads to increased levels of self-efficacy for patient and caregiver and a reduced caregiver burden.
This study is related to the CARE4STROKE trial registered on NTR with ID: NTR3739. </summary>
