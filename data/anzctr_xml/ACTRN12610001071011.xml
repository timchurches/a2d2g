    <interventions>Transcranial Magentic Stimulation (TMS). 

Magnetic stimulation is a non invasive technique for stimulating neural tissue.  A rapid change in magnetic field induces a current in the neural tissue.  If the current is of sufficient amplitude and duration it will excite nerve tissues.

Patients will receive left sided high frequncy TMS intially, if they do not respond after three weeks they will be randomised to either; continue left sided high frequnecy treatment, crossover over to right sided low frequency TMS or sequential bilateral TMS (i.e. right sided low frequency followed by left sided high frequency).  

Daily treatment (Mon-Fri) at 110% of motor threshold, for between 5 and 8 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be a group of healthy controls who will undergo the predictor measures at baseline for comparison.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Predictors of Response to TMS.

Specifically, we will test the potential predictive capacity of several electrophysiological techniques:

1. Resting and task related frontal alpha electroencephalography (EEG) activity: Extensive research has demonstrated a relationship between resting frontal alpha activity in depression.  More recent research has indicated a substantive functional role of alpha in tasks such as cognitive inhibition. This active alpha activity may provide a more functionally useful measure of alpha as it could potentially relate to response to treatment.

2. TMS-EEG measures of cortical inhibition: We have recently pioneered a technique combining single and paired pulse TMS stimulation with EEG to measure the activity of inhibitory GABAergic activity in cortical regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). GABA activity has previously been shown to be reduced in patients with depression and to increase with successful treatment although no methods have been available to evaluate functional GABA activity and its relationship to treatment response before now. 
3. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technique for non invasively measuring cortical blood flow by assaying changes in absorption and diffraction of near infrared light produced by changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin. We have successfully recorded blood flow changes with NIRS during prefrontal TMS and will explore whether the immediate reduction in oxygenated haemoglobin seen in local cortical regions during TMS treatment is associated with treatment response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The predictors will be measured at baseline weeks, 1, 4 and 7 weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, associated with considerable disability and high morbidity and often resistant to treatment with standard approaches (~30% of patients meet standard definitions for treatment resistant depression (TRD)). There is currently an overwhelming need in the community for the development of better and novel treatments for depression.  Despite the demand, there are relatively few treatment options available to patients with TRD. One of the only substantially new treatments developed in recent years has been repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).  Despite the considerable bulk of evidence demonstrating that rTMS can be effective in the treatment of depression, a major issue that limits its wider use is that only between 40-50% of patients respond to rTMS treatment.  While this is a good response rate in a group of patients with significant depression who have failed to respond to other treatments, participation in rTMS treatment involves a considerable commitment of time and resources (stimulation is usually provided five days per week to outpatients who attend for up to six weeks). It is therefore essential to be able to identify patients who are more or less likely to respond to treatment. This research aims to provide a practical and clinically useful approach to predicting antidepressant response to rTMS treatment.  In addition, by providing greater information about the underlying causes of depression and how these interact with treatments, this research may ultimately assist in developing more effective therapies for TRD.  This would have a significant impact on the considerable numbers of Australians with depression who have tried standard therapies and yet remain significantly unwell. Therefore the current project aims to use both novel and more established neuroscience methodologies (namely electroencephalogy (EEG), TMS and near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS)) to investigate whether such techniques can be used to predict response to rTMS treatment in depression.</summary>
