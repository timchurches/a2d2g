  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is no direct intervention to patients standard treatment.
During the course radiotherapy, participants will receive MRI scans at specified time points to identify changes during the course of treatment,
A total of 6 MRI scans to be performed. 
Scan 1 is performed at least 1 week prior to the start of treatment.
Scan 2 is performed on Day 1 of treatment.
Subsequent scans are performed on day 11 and 21 during treatment. 
Follow up MRI scans at 3months and 6 months post treatment. 
Participants PET and CT scans acquired as part standard radiotherapy planning will be utilised as well. 
MRI images acquired for this study will not impact of change treatment intent for participants. All images will be utilised retrospectively.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite Primary outcome to correlate functional changes seen on diffusion weighted MRI ( change in tumour diffusion) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI ( change in tumour perfusion) during course of treatment to clinical data collected as part of standard clinical follow-up. e.g. toxicity as per CTCAE v4, ECOG status</outcome>

      <outcome>A composite secondary outcome to evaluate the changes seen in normal lung tissue on CT and MRI scans taken during radiotherapy treatment and correlate this with clinical toxicity outcomes based on common terminology criteria (CTCAE) V4 .</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to quantify clinical benefit of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during lung cancer radiotherapy. 
Who is it for? Participants aged 18 years or over and have histological or cytological confirmed lung cancer scheduled to be treated with 12 or more fractions of treatment. 
Study details:  All participants in this study will undergo MRI scans in addition to standard scans used during radiotherapy treatment (CT and PET). Participant of this trial will undergo a total of six MRI scans which will be performed before radiotherapy treatment starts, and at treatment day 1, day 11 and day 21 (where applicable), and three and six months post treatment completion. MRI scans acquired will not alter or impact participants treatment intent.This study will not impact on the participants standard treatment.
