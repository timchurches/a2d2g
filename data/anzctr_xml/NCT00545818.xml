  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if OsseoSpeed implant 6 mm long is effective for
      rehabilitation of edentulism and if so, how it compares with OsseoSpeed implant 11 mm long.
      The primary hypothesis is that the alteration in bone level is equal in patients randomized
      to 6 mm as to patients randomized to 11 mm implants.</summary>
