    <interventions>Study Drug: Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) at 4pmol.kg.min

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if exogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) will lower fasting and nutrient stimulated glycaemia</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood glucose will be measured at 30min intervals between t=0-360min</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate in the critically ill patient, the effects of exogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) on gastric emptying</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Scintigraphy - Measurement of gastric emptying following administration of a test meal labelled with 20MBq 99mTC calcium phytate.  Test meal will be given 60mins into the study. Stomach content will be measured at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and 200 minutes after the meal
2. Octanoate acid breath test - Octanoic acid will be mixed with the test meal and breath samples will be taken initially every 5mins for the first hour, then every 15mins for the remaining 4 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate in the critically ill patient, the effects of exogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) on glucose absorption</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-O-methyl-glucose (3-OMG) measurement - 3grams of 3-O-methyl-glucose will be incorporated into the test meal.  Blood samples will be taken at time 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240 and 300mins after the meal is administered</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate in the critically ill patient, the effects of exogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) on insulin and glucagon secretion</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Insulin will be measured via blood samples taken at time 0, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300 and 360min after study commencement
2. Glucagon will be measured via blood samples taken at time 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360min after study commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate in the critically ill patient, the effects of exogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) on endogenous glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion</outcome>
      <timepoint>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) will be measured via blood samples taken at time 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360min after study commencement</timepoint>

    <concealment>Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Royal Adelaide Hospital will be screened. Next of kin will be approached for informed consent. Study drug ,synthetic glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and placebo 0.9% saline will be reconstituted by the Royal Adelaide Hospital Department of Pharmacy, as a solution in 4% albumin. Randomisation will be performed by the Department of Pharmacy, so that on each study day the investigators receive the study drug in a glass bottle coved by black plastic, therefore allocation concealment is maintained</concealment>
