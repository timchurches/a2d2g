  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention (Arm 2): The HPV test will be the primary test performed on a cervical smear sample that is taken in the usual manner and stored in the Thin-Prep liquid-based storage fluid.  If the participant tests positive for oncogenic HPV other than types 16/18, a cytology test is the triage. (The HPV test will be undertaken only once in each patient and the test duration is around 15 minutes) 

Intervention (Arm 3): HPV screening with types 16/18 genotyping and dual-stained (DS) cytology triage of intermediate risk women with other oncogenic HPV infection. The HPV test will be the primary test performed on a cervical smear sample that is taken in the usual manner and stored in the Thin-Prep liquid-based storage fluid. The triage for other oncogenic HPV positive women is a dual-stained cytology sample for the detection of more advanced HPV infection. (The HPV test will be undertaken only once in each patient and the test duration is around 15 minutes) 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 1: Three-yearly image read cytology screening with reflex HPV triage testing for low grade smears (ASCUS/LSIL), as in the existing National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) screening process. The sample collected from participants in Arm 1 will be a Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) Pap test and collection should take 15 minutes/single occasion only. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Practitioners will approach patients during regular cervical screening visits, confirm eligibility and seek consent from women.  

Prior to performing the cervical screening examination, the practitioner will assess patient eligibility and, where appropriate, seek consent for participation in the study. The practitioner will be provided with study information sheets to provide to participants.  A separate consent form will be presented to the patient for perusal and signature. The randomization procedures will be carried out using an appropriate software.

Women who provide consent will have a cervical smear collected using a ThinPrepPreservCyt vial which is routinely used for cervical smears reported by Diagnostic Medlab. The LBC sample vial will be labelled with the womanâ€™s name and date of birth, placed in a sample bag, along with the consent form, and submitted to Diagnostic Medlab via the usual courier system.

National Cervical Screening Program policies and standards for smear takers, colposcopists and laboratories will be followed throughout this service evaluation project. This means that women who fail to attend their appointment will be followed up by the clinician responsible for their care. In addition the study co-ordinator will assist clinicians in the follow up of women. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Upon receipt and logging of the sample at the Diagnostic Medlab, individual subject allocation to one of the study arms will be performed using a computer-generated randomisation sequence in a 1:2:2 ratio; stratified by age at recruitment (&lt;30 years; 30+ years). 

Neither the participant nor the practitioner will be aware of subject allocation at the time of the cervical screening visit and LBC sampling. Allocation will not be concealed in the laboratory (for reasons of practicality).

    <statisticalmethods>Objectives 1, 2 and 3
Focus groups will be used to collect information from trial participants and provider groups about the womens understanding and acceptance of HPV testing as the primary screening test and the providers understanding of this new screening process. It is anticipated that there will be four focus groups (Maori women, Pacific women, women of other ethnicities and provider groups). A sample of 7  12 people will be drawn for each group from study participants and providers. The facilitator will brainstorm and discuss questions with participants. Primarily open ended questions related to objectives 1,2 and 3 will be used as well as prompts to explore questions in more depth. The participants responses from each group session will be transcribed and content analysis will be performed.

Objective 4
Total laboratory processing start time will be defined as time and date a sample is received and logged at specimen reception to the time when the final report is entered into the laboratory electronic database. Total sample processing time (TPT) will be defined as the time from specimen load to HPV result being available on the manufacturers output. For hands-on time (HOT), record the start and stop of the hands-on processing times. The main outcome measure will be the TPT per sample. The mean and 95% confidence interval for TPT and median TPT will be calculated across all samples for HPV processing.

Objective 5
The Dual Stain test positivity results in HPV 16/18 and in other oncogenic HPV positive women will be calculated across all available samples. These positivity rates will be compared with, and potentially pooled with similar data from Compass Australia.

Objective 6
An IT specification will be developed as a secondary outcome (no statistical plan appropriate for this objective) 

Objective 7
Test positivity rates will be pooled with Round one screening test results from the Compass Australia pilot study to estimate the test positivity rates by age (overall, &lt;30 and 30+) for the primary screening tests (LBC and HPV).

This is largely a qualitative research process examining for the introduction of primary HPV screening. Data will be pooled with co-investigators in Australia as well as will be analysed for New Zealand.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women enrolled in the National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP) present for regular cervical smears (cytology) to screen for early cervical abnormalities (precancer). Nearly all cervical cancers are now known to be caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (high risk human papillomavirus, hrHPV).

In 2009 New Zealand introduced an HPV immunisation program for young women against the 2 most common HPV types. Cervical screening is currently a cost effective intervention in New Zealand, but this will become progressively less so as HPV immunisation uptake increases. Changes to the NCSP will be required to improve cost effectiveness in the context of HPV immunisation, but any such changes cannot be made without evaluation of new technologies and processes.

Overseas studies have shown that primary HPV screening is more sensitive in detecting precancerous lesions than cytology, can be performed less frequently, is more costeffective in countries with an HPV immunization program, such as NZ and may require fewer colposcopy referrals.

Several developed countries are moving to implement or pilot hrHPV testing,. This project will examine the use of HPV as a primary screening test over a one year period with respect to:

1. Acceptability of the change to women

2. Changes to the NZ Cervical Screening Guidelines

3. Education of colposcopists, GPs and nurses about HPV testing in respect to interpretation of results, referral and management of women with abnormal results

4. Laboratory processing of specimens including time and motion studies

5. Requirements for associated information technology changes including to the NCSP register

The study has some similarities to a larger Australian study, conducted by the University of New South Wales and Victorian Cytology Service, which will test 5000 women. For some analyses, results will be pooled with the Australian study</summary>
