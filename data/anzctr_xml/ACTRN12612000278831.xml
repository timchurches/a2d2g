  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 12-week experimental study of 1 hour twice-weekly resistance training sessions with a wait-list control group will be conducted with adolescent rugby union players. The project will compare the effect of linear periodised resistance training program to that of a undulating periodised resistance training program. Recruited participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. A comparison group will be used as an intervention control. All participants will undergo physical and performance assessments.

Further resistance training details:
a) sessions will be 1 hour duration
b) Each resistance training session will include: 1 core strength lower body exercise, 1 core strength upper body exercise, 2 assistant strength upper body exercises, 2 assistant strength lower body exercises, 3 abdominal exercises and 1 plyometric/jumping exercise. All using free weights and/or own bodyweight. 
c) Please see (e) for the intensity and volume of the core strength exercises. The assistant strength lower and upper body exercises will be performed for 4 sets of 6-10 repetitions. The percentage of 1RM intensity for the assistant strength exercises is not predetermined. The abdominal exercises are performed for 4 sets of 8-12 repetitions. The plyometric exercise is performed for 2-5 sets of 2-4 repetitions. 
d) Sessions are administered  in small group sessions of 6-14 athletes by a qualified strength &amp; conditioning coach with extensive experience working with adolescent athletes. 
e) The linear and undulating programs only differ in the progression of load (intensity &amp; volume) in the core strength exercises (Squat and Bench Press). Please see below:

Week 6
Session A          6x3reps@90%1RM    -     6x3reps@90%1RM
Session B          5x6reps@83%1RM    -     6x3reps@90%1RM

At the 6-week assessment estimated 1RM will be reevaluated. The first 6 week progression of load in the core strength exercises will be replicated in the last 6 weeks using the new estimated 1RM.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will perform no resistance training for the initial 12 weeks. They will complete pre and post physical and performance testing. At the completion of the initial 12 weeks the comparison group will undertake 12 weeks of a 1 hour twice 
weekly resistance training program.

The resistance training program that the comparison group will undertake is dependent upon the outcome of the intervention. The most effective resistance training program will be implemented in the comparison group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate the effectiveness of two different types of resistance training programs and the influence of stage of maturation on responsiveness in adolescent (14-18 year old) male rugby union players. There is no debate about that resistance training is a safe approach to health and fitness in adolescents, but there is debate about the particular pattern of resistance training that is used. Therefore this project will compare the effects of two different training patterns that are similar in training load to determine whether training pattern influences outcomes in this age group. 

As a result of participating in either of the two RT programs the participants will experience improvements in their strength, power, speed, and body composition assessment. It is hypothesized that there will be no difference in the magnitude of change between the two different RT programs.</summary>
