  <interventions>
    <interventions>On each testing day, participants consume four capsules containing an inert placebo, 320mg of KeenMind(Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) Bacopa Monnieri (BM) extract or 640mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) BM extract. KeenMind (Registered Trademark) (CDRI 08) is standardized for no less than 55% of total bacosides. Each capsule contains 160 mg BM extract (25:1) equivalent to 4 g of dried herb. 

Each participant is required to attend a total of 4 sessions (1 practice visit and 3 study visits) that will be conducted one week apart to ensure sufficient washout between each acute condition. Total amount of testing days is 4 weeks (inclusive of practice visit).

There will be three separate testing days where either the placebo, 320 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) or 640 mg of KeenMind (Registered Trademark) will be taken exclusively each day.</interventions>

      <outcome>Stress measure using cortisol testing; salivary samples using salivettes are employed to measure cortisol levels. Participants will be asked to place a cotton dental roll in their mouth and chew for approximately 30 seconds. Salivettes are then immediately frozen and then defrosted prior to testing. Testing will be carried out using luminescence immunoassay.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants responded to advertisements. After successfully completing a telephone screen, they completed a practice session where they were introduced to the computerised test, passed a brief medical test and informed consent was obtained. They were then given a numerical identification number and was randomly allocated to a treatment series. Participants then returned for 3 testing sessions, receiving a different treatment each visit. The person who determined if a participant was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the participant would be allocated. Allocation was concealed by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to ascertain whether a standard clinical dose of 320 mg or a 640 mg dose of a specific extract of Bacopa Monnieri [KeenMind (Registered Trademark) - CDRI 08] would acutely affect cognition, mood, anxiety and stress at an earlier timepoint than previous Bacopa Monnieri supplementation studies.

This study will investigate the cognitive and stress effects of a two doses of bacopa compared to placebo.

Participants will be required to consume one of three treatments on each testing day, and will consume the other treatments on the other two days of testing. There will be a seven day washout period and the process will be repeated again.
(1) Bacopa  320mg 
(2) Bacopa  640mg
(3) Placebo</summary>
