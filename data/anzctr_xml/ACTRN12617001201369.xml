  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prostate artery embolisation procedures are performed by interventional radiologists experienced in prostate artery embolisation. The procedure takes approximately 120 minutes. Procedures will be performed with a right femoral or left brachial artery approach, using 4- or 5- French sheaths. 5-Fr 125 cm Impulse (Merit Medical, Utah, USA) and 4-Fr 120 cm Cobra Glidecath (Terumo, New Jersey, USA) catheters are combined with 150 cm standard Glidewires (Terumo, New Jersey, USA) to access the internal iliac arteries. Microcatheters 2.0Fr Progreat (Terumo, New Jersey, USA) or 1.7Fr SL-10 (Stryker, Michigan, USA) are used to selectively catheterise the prostate arteries over microwires, either 0.016 Radifocus Guidewire GT (Terumo, New Jersey, USA) or 0.014 Synchro Standard (Stryker, Michigan, USA). Following selective catheterisation of the prostate arteries and positioning of the microcatheter tip within the distal prostate artery, an on-table Dyna CT scan using hand-injected 1-2 ml contrast (Ultravist 300, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) in a 3 ml Medallion syringe (Merit Medical, Utah, USA) is performed and reviewed in three planes to assess for non-prostatic enhancement. Once the operators are confident that no off-target enhancement is evident, a single unit syringe of 250 micron Embozene (Celenova Biosciences, Texas, USA) is prepared by diluting the Embozene particles with full contrast to 1/16 (6.25%) of the original concentration. Embolisation is then performed by slowly injecting the diluted particles until complete stasis of the prostate artery has been achieved.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of bladder function following a PAE as assessed by urodynamic studies. A urodynamic study (or bladder pressure study) is performed by a urologist using a computer which monitors the pressure in the bladder via a pressure transducer inserted in the rectum. There a two phases to the test; during the filling phase a sterile liquid is trickled into the bladder by a catheter; in the second phase, the liquid is voided by the patient. Throughout the process the pressure within the bladder is measured, in addition to sensation felt by the patient, flow rate of void and residual volume following void. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prostate artery embolisation (PAE) is an emerging, minimally invasive treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostate enlargement. The first prospective trial of PAE in Australia was performed at The Wesley Hospital, and this project builds on those successful results. Whilst PAE was shown to be very effective at shrinking the prostate and relieving urinary tract symptoms during short-term follow-up, its impact on urodynamics, and the complex interplay between prostate obstruction and bladder function, is yet to be studied. 

This project aims to be the first study to comprehensively assess the impact of PAE on bladder function (urodynamics), as well as improvements in urinary symptoms and quality of life. The study will also compare the responses of patients with differing severity of prostate enlargement, and those with recurrent symptoms after a surgical resection. This information will be used to hopefully predict which patients are likely to best respond to a PAE, and can therefore be considered as an alternative to medical therapy or as an effective medium term precursor to more invasive surgical resection.</summary>
