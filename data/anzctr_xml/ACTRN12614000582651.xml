  <interventions>
    <interventions>Tranexamic acid.
Patients will be assigned to one of 2 treatment groups:
1. Group 1 (Intra-articular TXA group) will receive 100 ml of Saline intravenously, 5 minutes before incision, 3000mg (30ml) of TXA injected in to the knee joint after wound closure and two doses of 100 ml of Saline intra-venously at 8 hourly intervals post-operatively. 
2. Group 2 (Intravenous  TXA group) will receive 1000mg of TXA in 100ml Saline intravenously 5 minutes before incision and 30ml of Saline injected in to the knee joint after wound closure to make the group comparative with Group 1 and also provide a tamponade effect. Another 1000mg dose of TXA (in 100ml Normal Saline over 15 minutes) will be repeated at 8 hourly intervals post-operatively for another two doses.

Patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty will be invited to take part in the study and informed written consent will be obtained from willing participants. Patients undergoing bilateral TKA, those with history of thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or cerebrovascular accident), renal dysfunction (plasma Creatinine level &gt;130 mmol/L) or coagulopathy (INR &gt; 1.4) will be excluded. Also patients with pre-operative anemia (Hb &lt; 120 for females and Hb &lt; 130 for males) will be excluded.</interventions>

The operating team, patients and data collection team will be blinded to the group to which the patients have been randomized. Only the anaesthesiologist who will prepare the treatment solution will be aware of the allocation and will not be involved in data collection or analysis. Post-operatively only the administering nurse will know the drug being administered. Patients and the operative and data collection team will be blinded.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>This trial is designed as non-inferiority trial to show that intra-articular tranexamic acid (TXA) is not inferior to intravenous TXA in its effect on the pre-operative post-operative haemoglobin difference. The standard deviation in the pre-post haemoglobin difference from previous published trials was consistently less than 1.1, therefore we have conservatively assumed a standard deviation of 1.1 for our sample size calculation. Our margin of non-inferiority is 0.5g/dL, based on various literature studies. A sample size of 83 participants per group (166 in total) is required for a non-inferiority trial with power of 90%, significance level of 5%.
An intention-to-treat analysis will be used to compare the study groups. A supplementary as-treated analysis will also be used. Both the groups will be statistically analysed for homogeneity and ANOVA will be used for continuous variables, Chi square test for categorical variables.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to analyze the effects of topical tranexamic acid in total knee arthroplasty and to compare it with intravenous tranexamic acid. The study is based on the hypothesis that toipical/intrarticular tranexamic acid is more not inferior in reducing blood loss in total knee arthroplasty and is safer as compared to intravenous total knee arthroplasty.</summary>
