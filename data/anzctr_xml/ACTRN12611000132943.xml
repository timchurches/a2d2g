  <interventions>
    <interventions>VitroGro ECM is a product that is designed to improve healing of chronic wounds by replacing a degraded extracellular matrix. 

VitroGro ECM is a sterile,  non-invasive treatment that is biological in origin and applied topically.  Participants are allocated based on enrollment number to one of two cohorts on the basis of treatment either once or twice per week for up to 12 weeks or until healed, whichever occurs first.

When applied to the wound bed VitroGro ECM (0.014ug) provides a temporary scaffold to which the patients wound cells can attach and migrate upon.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants referred to this single arm study will have received and not responded to current best practice wound care. The control aspect of the study is that the only change to the treatment regime is the addition of the test article.

The basis for evaluating treatment once versus twice per week is to establish preliminary cost effectiveness data as well as pilot data which will then inform further study design and numbers needed to show a statistically significant difference.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in wound size or complete healing (wound closure 100% epithelialisation of target ulcer)

Clinical improvement will be measured through computer planimetry assessments of ulcer size of wound tracings on gradated acetate sheets and digital photography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At entry to study, each planned study visit (once per week for Cohort 1 or twice per week for Cohort 2) and at 12 weeks or complete healing, which ever happens sooner.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerance is assessed by Investigator analysis of the products adverse reactions.

There is a theoretical risk of allergy to VitroGro ECM which is very rare and if you develop an allergy you will have to leave the study and be treated for the allergy which, if it occurs, may present as itching or a mild rash.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants last visit e.g. at 12 weeks or complete healing, which ever happens sooner.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction of pain is rated by the subject using a visual analogue scale. Zero (no pain) to 100 (Worst pain).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At entry to study, each planned study visit (once per week for Cohort 1 or twice per week for Cohort 2) and at 12 weeks or complete healing, which ever happens sooner.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smell is assessed by clinician opinion of wound malodour</outcome>
      <timepoint>At entry to study, each planned study visit (once per week for Cohort 1 or twice per week for Cohort 2) and at 12 weeks or complete healing, which ever happens sooner.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The level of wound exudate is assessed by clinician opinion and recorded as either none, minimal, moderate, heavy or copious.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At entry to study, each planned study visit(once per week for Cohort 1 or twice per week for Cohort 2) and at 12 weeks or complete healing, which ever happens sooner.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The condition of the wound bed is evaluated by clinical assessment taking into account the degree of eschar, slough/necrosis, granulation tissue and islands of epithelium.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At entry to study, each planned study visit (once per week for Cohort 1 or twice per week for Cohort 2) and at 12 weeks or complete healing, which ever happens sooner.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-centre, clinical trial. A sample size of 40 participants is sought. Up to 58 participants will be recruited to account for an estimated drop out rate of 30%. The study will include patients who have chronic, hard-to-heal, venous leg ulcers and use the following treatment procedure:

1) Cleansing the wound bed using local practices, at dressing change, then topically applying VitroGro ECM  and covering with a non-adherent wound dressing.

2) Securing the dressing to the wound with tubifast and compression bandaging


Dressings will be changed and the treatment procedure will be repeated once per week for Cohort 1 and twice per week for Cohort 2 when clinical, planimetry and photographic assessments will be made. 

The effectiveness of the treatment procedure will be evaluated on the basis of a 12 week treatment period. In the case of a wound that has healed before the 12 week end point, the treatment period will be shortened. Additional dressing or bandage changes, outside of the scheduled clinic visits, will be also be documented.

The primary end point will be the reduction of ulcer size, or numbers healed at the 12 week point.

Secondary end points are; reduction of pain, exudate and smell, condition of wound bed and surrounding skin and patient tolerance to the treatment provided and cost effectiveness.</summary>
