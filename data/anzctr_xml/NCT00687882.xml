    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bivariate endpoint. - Primary efficacy endpoint is the risk of symptomatic, radiologically-confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Kids-DOTT trial is a randomized controlled clinical trial whose primary objective is to
      evaluate non-inferiority of shortened-duration (6 weeks) versus conventional-duration (3
      months) anticoagulation in children with first-episode acute venous thrombosis. The first
      stage of the trial has consisted of a pilot/feasibility component, which then continues as
      the definitively-powered trial.</summary>
