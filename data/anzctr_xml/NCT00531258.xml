    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria:

          1. Be aged 18-60 and have capacity to consent

          2. Currently meet DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (expect
             for the exclusion of causality by a general medical condition referring to the TBI)
             and have the persistence of depressive symptoms for at least one month at sufficient
             severity to warrant the diagnosis.

          3. Have experienced a closed head injury of mild to moderate severity (Glasgow coma scale
             score (GCS) of greater than 8), preceding their depression, and are at least 3 months
             post injury. The injury must not have involved specific direct damage to either
             frontal lobe.

          4. Have a Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale Score of &gt; 20 (moderate - severe depression).
             Including only a more severely ill group of subjects limits the placebo response rate.

          5. Have had no increase or initiation of new antidepressant (or other psychoactive)
             therapy in the 4 weeks prior to enrolment.</inclusivecriteria>

          2. Patients who have experienced clear structural damage to the left or right
             dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as documented on MRI scan

          3. Have a current DSM IV diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence disorder.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is very common in people who have experienced a traumatic brain injury. Few
      treatments have been found to be effective in treating depression in this situation. We
      intend to investigate the effectiveness of a form of brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic
      stimulation, which has been found to be effective in treating depression in people who have
      not undergone a brain injury. By evaluating new methods of treating depression in this
      population, we hope to increase the options available for treating people in this difficult
      situation. Furthermore, problems with aspects of thinking are also commonly present post
      brain injury, as in some individuals with depression. Various brain stimulation techniques,
      including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been shown to have a positive effect
      on cognition. We also intend to investigate whether a therapeutic effect on cognitive
      deficits is present following TMS, in addition to any effects on depression. New treatment
      protocols will be developed, and understanding of the pathology and treatment of post
      traumatic brain injury depression will be enhanced.</summary>
