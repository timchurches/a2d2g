  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves metacognitive skills training (0.5 hours) embedded in compensatory strategy training (1.5 hour sessions) each week, for 6 weeks.  Compensatory strategy training involves teaching participants how to habitually use external memory aids (e.g. diaries, mobile phones, alarms) and strategies (e.g. note-taking skills, organisational skills) to prevent prospective memory problems.  Metacognitive skills training is designed to facilitate the development of self-awareness of impairments, and is combined with compensatory training to ensure the uptake and use of strategies and generalisation of strategy use in everyday life.  Metacognitive training techniques include self-evaluation and self-prediction, provision of education, role modelling, and experiential, verbal and video feedback.

Treatment manuals have been developed outlining the procedures for compensatory training (COMP) and compensatory plus metacognitive skills training (COMP-MST), based on pilot research.  The COMP treatment manual, which was piloted in an earlier study (Shum et al., 2011) has been amended for use in this treatment program to incorporate electronic devices used as compensatory aides (i.e. mobile phones).  The MST component of the COMP-MST treatment manual has been developed by the research team. 
 
Qualified occupational therapists who are experienced with working with people with brain injury will deliver the  intervention program by one-to-one consultation in an outpatient clinic setting.

    <comparator>The COMP-MST intervention will be compared to the COMP treatment and a waitlist control condition.  The group receiving compensatory training only (6 x 1.5 hour sessions) will receive an additional 30 minutes of cognitive activities as an active control for the COMP-MST group.  The waitlist control group who will receive their usual care only (6 weeks duration) followed by the COMP-MST program.  Usual care is the rehabilitation outpatient activities that the participant would usually be participating in whilst they are completing the research intervention.  The types of usual rehabilitation activities (i.e. physiotherapy treatment) and the frequency (i.e. number of hours per week) will be documented for all participants.

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by treating therapists or case managers providing rehabilitation to people with brain injury in a specialist brain injury rehabilitation unit at a large metropolitan hospital in Queensland and a Queensland Statewide brain injury outreach service.  Flyers advertising the project will also be provided to private brain injury rehabilitation practices in Brisbane, Australia and interested participants will be invited to contact the project manager.  The treating therapist or case manager will briefly explain the study to prospective participants and asked if they would like to be contacted by a researcher for more information.  Upon consenting to be contacted, a researcher will contact the participant to explain the project and provide them with an information and consent form.  

Treating therapists and case managers will refer people with moderate to severe TBI who exhibit prospective memory deficits.  Suitability for the study will be confirmed during pre-intervention assessments, where a blinded assessor will administer a neuropsychological battery of assessments testing executive function and premorbid IQ, as well as tests of prospective memory function and administration of questionnaires illiciting informaton about everyday prospective memory performance. Participant's will be classified as either 'severely impaired' (&lt;10th percentile) or 'less severely impaired' (=or&lt; 10th percentile) in prospective memory function defined by the CAMPROMPT normative tables based on age and premorbid IQ.  
Participants in both categories will be randomly allocated  to one of the three groups using sequentially numbered and sealed opaque envelopes. </concealment>
    <sequence>Random assignment will be conducted independent of the project staff involved in the interventions and the blind assessor. Participants will be randomly allocated to groups using stratified sampling.  The CAMPROMPT will be used to classify participants as being 'severely' or 'less severely' impaired in prospective memory function.  Participants in both categories will be randomly allocated  to one of the three groups using sequentially numbered and sealed opaque envelopes. The envelopes will contain group allocation on a written insert, based on a predetermined random computer generated sequence.

    <statisticalmethods>To determine required sample size, a power calculation was conducted using the primary outcome variable with the most conservative effect size from our previous RCT (i.e. the change score between pre and post SPRS score). Using G-Power and setting alpha to.05, power to .80 and an effect size of 0.70, the required sample size for each group is 26 (G*Power version 3.1.7). Sample size has been inflated to 30 participants per group to allow for an estimated dropout rate of approximately 10%. Therefore, it is calculated that a sample size of 90 participants is required for the study to be adequately powered to detect significant differences between groups.

Between-group differences will be calculated, accounting for baseline scores for all three groups on all outcomes. To address the primary aim, unstructured linear mixed regression will be used to test for group differences on the primary outcomes, with group allocation as the between subject factor and time (baseline, post-intervention, follow-up) as the within-subject or repeated variable. Any demographic or neuropsychological variables that are significantly associated with the primary outcome and unevenly distributed between the groups will be included as covariates. The same approach will be used with secondary outcome variables to address the secondary aim. Missing data will be handled using intention-to-treat analysis (i.e. most recent available data will be imputed).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to look at the effectiveness of rehabilitation for improving prospective memory in everyday life.  Prospective memory refers to remembering to carry out things you intend to do in the future, like remembering to attend an appointment or to take medication.  Previous research has shown that people with traumatic brain injury often have prospective memory difficulties which can impact on their independent living, social participation and work.  Compensatory rehabilitation approaches which involve training people to use a range of strategies to circumvent the problem (i.e. diaries, note-taking, alarms) are successful in improving prospective memory function.  However, research has also shown that strategy use and everyday memory performance can be enhanced by using a 'metacognitive' treatment approach designed to improve self-awareness of changes post injury.  This study will compare two treatment approaches: a compensatory rehabilitation approach and a compensatory plus metacognitive rehabilitation approach designed to develop self-awareness of prospective memory problems and train strategy use to improve everyday prospective memory function.  The study will also explore whether improvements are maintained (3 months and 6 months) after the rehabilitation is finished.</summary>
