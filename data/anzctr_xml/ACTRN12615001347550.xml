  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supervised multi-domain computerised cognitive training using Captain's Log MindPower Builder. There will be small group training sessions with a maximum of 8 participants per session and two supervisors. One of the supervisors has a background in conducting clinical trials with Computerised Cognitive Training and the other supervisor will be a clinical neuropsychologist.

There will be an attendance log kept by the supervisor and there is also a computer login date and time recorded per participant.

In months 1-3, participants undergo 24 training sessions (2 sessions per week, 60 minutes per session for 12 weeks).
In months 4-18, participants will be asked to complete a 60-minute booster session every month. Participants whose within-session performance on one or more cognitive exercises falls to below 15% of their post-training maxima will be invited to attend three additional 60-minute booster sessions the following week.</interventions>
    <comparator>In months 1-3, participants undergo supervised, intensity matched, general activity didactic viewing and
listening exercises over 24 sessions (2 sessions per week, 60 minutes per session for 12 weeks).
In months 4-6, participants receive supervised multi-domain computerised cognitive training using the Captain's Log MindPower Builder over 24 training sessions (2 sessions per week, 60 minutes per session for 12 weeks). 
There will be no additional intervention between months 7-18. 

The didactic viewing and listening exercises are administered by the computer and can be repeated on request.

    <statisticalmethods>Aim 1 (efficacy of high intensity centre-based CCT) will be tested using an intention-to-treat approach using recommended Linear Mixed Modelling. We will evaluate a model including main effects for Group, Time and the main interaction term of interest: Group (Arm A vs Arm B) X Time (FU1 to FU2). Covariates will only be added if baseline differences are noted between groups. 

Aim 2 (efficacy of maintenance dose CCT) will be addressed using an intention-to-treat approach using Linear Measures Mixed Modelling. We will test a model including main effects for Group, Time and the main interaction term of interest: Group (Arm A vs Arm B) X TIME (FU3 to FU4). Covariates will only be added if baseline differences are noted between groups. 

Aim 3 (efficacy on secondary outcomes) will be addressed as per Aims 1 and 2 for each secondary outcome separately. 

Aim 4 (clinical response prediction): will be addressed by multiple regression examining relationships between baseline predictor variables (i.e., cognitive phenotype, or hippocampal measures or genotype) and cognitive change scores. 

This study is powered on the basis of a relative effect size (RES) on Global Cognition of 0.44 at the end of the Phase I RCT (based on average from our Timecourse Trial results and our NHMRC SMART trial). Designate power of 0.90 controlling a at 0.05 translates to a required sample size of N=68 (calculated using G*Power 3.1 based on ANOVA repeated measures within-between interaction test, 2 groups, 2 time-points, within subject autocorrelation =0.4, equivalent effect size of [v]=0.22). A sample of N=86 (rounded up from 85) will be recruited to allow for 20% overall attrition (as per Timecourse Trial extrapolated to 15-months). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Supervised, group-based computerised cognitive training (CCT) is a safe and effective intervention to maintain cognition in healthy older adults. This study will examine the extent to which CCT can attenuate or even reverse the rate of decline in older people with previously documented cognitive decline, as well as strategies to maintain CCT effects in the long term.
