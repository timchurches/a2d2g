  <interventions>
    <interventions>water based exercises for approx 45 minutes twice a week for 8 weeks; patients standing in chest deep warm water with option of holding on to handrail; exercises directed by trained physiotherapist; stretching exercises for calf, hamstrings, hip flexors; flexibility exercises for spine; range of motion and strengthening exercises for upper and lower limbs; core stability exercises; balance exercises;</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be offered the intervention after 8 weeks following  their second assessment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self reported severity of Parkinson's Disease via Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre random allocation and 8 weeks later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Timed Up and Go Test to measure gait quality and function</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre random Allocation and 8 weeks later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Reach Test to measure functional balance in standing as leaning forward with outstretched arm at 90 degrees forward flexion alongside a tape measure fixed to wall at appropriate height for patient; distance patient can reach forward without shifting feet or falling  measured in centimetres. Assesor standing close by for safety and to record measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre random allocation and 8 weeks later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Axial Rotation - this is measured by the assessor with the patient seated in a backless chair placed in the centre of a supported, circular hoop at eyelevel of the patient, patient's feet firmly on floor, arms folded on chest, pelvis lightly fastened to chair by elastic belt to reduce pelvic movement, a headpiece fitted with a "pointer" is fitted to patients head (like you would wear a cap) and patient is asked to turn to look as far around to the right as possible and identify a symbol that they can see on the inside of the hoop. The patient is then asked to do the same to the left. The hoop is marked off at 5 degree intervals for the 360 degree range around the inside of the hoop and thus a measure of functional axial rotation is gained.</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre random allocation and 8 weeks later</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Six Minute walk test to measure walking distance/speed /quality and fitness</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre random allocation and 8 weeks later</timepoint>
