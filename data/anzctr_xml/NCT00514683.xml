  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The general purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4 dose
      strategies of BIBF 1120 treatment for 12 months, compared to placebo in patients with
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate whether at least one dose strategy is
      superior to placebo in patients with IPF, in modifying the rate of decline of Forced Vital
      Capacity (FVC).

      As a secondary objective, additional parameters will be assessed in order to differentiate
      between dose strategies on the basis of safety and efficacy</summary>
