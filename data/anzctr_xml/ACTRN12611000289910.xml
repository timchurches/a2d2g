  <interventions>
    <interventions>Phase 1  Part A compares the pre-cut heights and post-cut widths of the distal femur from patients of five different ethnicities to the known implant dimensions of the Genesis II and the modified Genesis II Slim femoral components across the available size range. Phase 1 - Part B evaluates the clinical outcome for a subset of patients from Phase 1 - Part A (Caucasian Australian, Chinese and Korean ethnicities). Following the acquisition of the measurements required to complete Part A of Phase 1 of the study, the Genesis II femoral component will be applied to the distal femur of these patients, and the amount of over/under hang measured. The amount of over/under hang will be compared with functional outcome over two years. Phase 2  This phase evaluates the clinical outcome for the Genesis II Slim femoral component. Phase 1 will take 3 years, and Phase 2 will take another 3 years, for the total trial duration of 6 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 1, part A: Anthropometric dimensions of the pre- and post-cut knee joint will be measured using measurement calipers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Operative.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 1, part B: The amount overhang or underhang at the will be measured using mesurement calipers following insertion of the distal femoral component of the Genesis II Total Knee System for patients of Caucasian Australian, Chinese and Korean ethnicity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Operative.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Knee Society Score (KSS) and levels of patient satisfaction will be recorded for each patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Knee Society Score (KSS) will be recorded for each patient: preoperatively, and at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively.
Levels of patient satisfaction will be recorded for each patient at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiographs taken will be scored according to the radiographic evaluation form to provide a measure of patellar tracking and adverse radiographic findings such as periprosthetic radiolucency, osteolysis or heterotopic ossification.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Preoperatively, at discharge and at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years postoperatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For the second phase of the study, the amount of over/under hang will be measured following insertion of the femoral component of the Genesis II Slim Total Knee System.</outcome>
