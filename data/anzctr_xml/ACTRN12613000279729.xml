  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare radiation treatment combined with either cetuximab or cisplatin in patients with locoregionally advanced HPV positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (located at the base of tongue or tonsil)

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, and have been diagnosed with locoregionally advanced HPV positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). You should not have received any prior treatment for this cancer.

Trial details;
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive radiation treatment 5 days a week over 7 weeks, in conjunction with weekly doses of a drug called cetuximab. This drug is administered intravenously, i.e. directly into the vein. 

Participants in the other group will receive radiation treatment 5 days a week over 7 weeks in combination with the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, which is also administered intravenously.

Participants will be assessed weekly during treatment, then at 1, 3, 5, 9, 13 weeks post-treatment and at months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 28, 32, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 post-completion of treatment. Assessments will involve blood tests, questionnaires, clinical examination, hearing tests, swallowing tests, and radiological examination. The main research question being answered is whether those treated with weekly cetuximab and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy will experience less acute symptom severity than patients receiving weekly cisplatin and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy.
