  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety of sebelipase alfa in a more broad population of patients with LALD than have been previously studied. - Incidence of adverse events (AEs), SAEs, and infusion-related reactions (IRRs);
Changes from Baseline in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and clinical laboratory tests;
Changes in vital signs during and after infusion, relative to pre-infusion values;
Physical examination findings;
Use of concomitant medications/therapies;
Characterization of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs);
Functional and overall development in patients = 6 years of age will be assessed, as determined by Denver II scores.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after last study drug infusion (up to 144 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of sebelipase alfa on lipid metabolism. - Decrease in LDL-C;
Decrease in non-HDL-C;
Decrease in triglycerides;
Increase in HDL-C</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to end of treatment period (up to 144 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of sebelipase alfa on growth parameters in pediatric patients presenting with evidence of growth delay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to end of treatment period (up to 144 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of sebelipase alfa on PK parameters. - PK parameters include: Cmax, time to maximum concentration, area under the serum concentration vs. time curve from time zero to the last measurable time point, area under the serum concentration vs. time curve from time zero to infinity, terminal elimination half-life, serum clearance, and apparent volume of distribution.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 24, Week 48</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of sebelipase alfa on liver function (including histopathology). - Decrease in Child-Pugh status for patients with Child-Pugh class C or B at Baseline;
Decreased United Kingdom Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (UK-ELD) score;
Improvement in liver histopathology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to end of treatment period (up to 144 weeks)</timepoint>
