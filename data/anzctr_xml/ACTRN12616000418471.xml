    <studytitle>Pharmacokinetic study of four orally formulated combinations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A single dose, four-way, open-label study to determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of an oral suspension of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen, a powder sachet of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen for oral solution and two tablet formulations of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen in 28 healthy volunteers under fasting conditions. </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be randomly allocated to receive a single dose of each of the following treatments in a four-way cross-over sequence:
- Treatment A: oral suspension containing 1000 mg acetaminophen + 300 mg ibuprofen in 31.25 mL 
- Treatment B: powder sachet containing 1000 mg acetaminophen + 300 mg ibuprofen for oral solution
- Treatment C: tablets providing total dose of 1000 mg acetaminophen + 300 mg ibuprofen 
- Treatment D: tablets providing total dose of 975 mg acetaminophen + 292.5 mg ibuprofen 

The administration of doses will be supervised on site. 
All treatments will be administered under fasting conditions. Participants will be fasted for at least 10 hours overnight before dosing and for 3 hours after dosing. Water will be restricted for 1 hour pre-dose and 1 hour post-dose (with the exception of water administered as part of dosing). 

Administration 
- Oral Suspension formulation: 31.25 mL of the oral suspension will be dispensed for consumption. Any residue remaining after initial administration will be resuspended with 240 mL of water and consumed. 
- Powder Sachet formulation: contents of the sachet will be dissolved in 240 mL hot water and consumed once cold.
- Tablet Formulations: will be administered with 240 mL of water.

Dose-frequency is single doses of four different formulations separated by a washout period of 3 days. 
All participants will complete the four periods in cross-over fashion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC(0-t), AUC(0-inf), Tmax, Kel, t1/2) of acetaminophen and ibuprofen and compare between four treatment groups, under fasting conditions.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Single-dose study measuring plasma concentration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen pre-dose and at 5, 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00 and 12.00 hours after study drug administration. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An acute safety evaluation will be performed during each study period by recording spontaneously reported adverse events and by clinical assessments. 
Known NSAID adverse effects (i.e. GI ulceration, indigestion/stomach pain, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, water retention, renal failure, skin reactions and thromboembolic events), and known adverse effects of acetaminophen (i.e. clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity) will be compared between groups.
Adverse events will continue to be assessed up to 7 days after the last dose of the study medication by spontaneous reporting and at a final follow-up phone call.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be evaluated during each study period (from administration to 12 hours post administration for each formulation), and for 7 days following study drug administration. </timepoint>
