  <interventions>
    <interventions>prospective controlled trial comparing partially coated cementless stem to fully hydroxyapatite (HA) coated cementless stem.

cementless stems utilise a fixation surface to optimise the fixation to bone.  In this design the proximal end of the stem has a macro texture with a titanium coating.  Hydroxyapatite is applied to the proximal coating or the full length of the stem to enhance initial fixation.

Patients enrolled in this study will have their surgery during a 12 month 
recruitment period.  The operation takes approximately 1 hour. Patients will be studied for two years following their surgery and will return for routine follow-up thereafter.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>femoral component migration.

Initial migrations of femoral component has been shown to be a reliable predictor of long-term performance.  Radiostereometric analysis (RSA)  is a validated and and precise method to determine implant performance.  It is recommended that new implants or design changes be analysed by RSA to predict their long-term outcome.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>clinical outcomes patient assessment scores including Oxford hip scores and the Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS score).  These are validated self-assessment call for the use of hip osteoarthritis.  Patients will complete self-assessment before the surgery, at one year and two years following surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will have clinical scores collected preoperatively, one year,and two years following surgery.  Radigraphs will be taken in the first post-operative week, six weeks, three months, one year and two years following the surgery.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the predicted long-term safety and effectiveness of the anthology cementless femoral stem using an RSA technique to yield early results in small numbers of patients. The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of fully coating this stem with hydroxyapatite (HA) compared to a proximally-HA coated stem.</summary>
