  <interventions>
    <interventions>The ankle was kept in plantargrade with an ankle-foot orthotic (AFO). The knee was held in full extension with the hips and pelvis unsupported. The leg was then raised in the passive straight leg raise (SLR) position until the first onset of pain (P1) was reached and, at this point, the hip was oscillated using a small amplitude at end of range (Grade IV+). Treatments lasted for either 3x1 or 3x2 minutes, with each oscillation standardized using a metronome (1.5Hz) and each set separated by 1-minute rest intervals. Participants were then required to attend the laboratory for a second session in order to receive the second experimental condition. Laboratory sessions were separated by at least 48 hours to control for carryover effects. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Intra-class correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the examiners reliability in detecting range of hip flexion at first onset of pain. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then used to test each hypothesis (correcting for violation of spherity using Greenhouse Geiser). A probability level of p = &lt;0.05 was used to test for statistically significant differences. No power analysis was conducted. A comparable sample size was used in 'similar' studies. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To compare the differences between 3x1 and 3x2 minutes of passive oscillating grade IV+ neurodynamic SLR treatment on measures of EMG magnitude of semitendinosus and range of hip flexion at first onset of pain.

The first hypothesis was that EMG magnitude of semimembranosus would be significantly reduced post-treatment, with a greater reduction in the 3x2 minutes group.

The second hypothesis was that range of hip flexion would be significantly increased post-treatment, with a greater increase in the 3x2 minutes group.</summary>
