    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Pramlintide acetate
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - A clear, colorless, sterile solution for SC injection manufactured by Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Placebo solution is the same, sterile preserved formulation, except the active ingredient, pramlintide, is omitted.

Active Comparator: Pramlintide - Pramlintide acetate (AC137) injection is a clear, colorless, sterile solution for SC injection manufactured by Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. It consists of pramlintide (AC137) 0.6 mg/mL in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 43 mg/mL mannitol as an iso-osmolality modifier and 2.25 mg/mL metacresol as a preservative.


Treatment: drugs: Pramlintide acetate
Pramlintide injection will be supplied in 5-mL multidose glass vials with rubber stoppers.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in satiety of participants on Pramlintide - To assess the acute effect of pramlintide administered subcutaneously (SC) on satiety in normal-weight and obese non-diabetic subjects and in insulin-treated subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. To be measured by Total caloric intake, macronutrient intake (carbohydrate, fat, protein, and other), duration of buffet meal, aand satiety data measured via a satiety assessment at Period 1 (Visit 2) and Period 2 (Visit 3).</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in food intake of participants on Pramlintide - To assess the acute effect of pramlintide administered SC on food intake in normal-weight and obese non-diabetic subjects and in insulin-treated subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. To be measured by Total caloric intake, macronutrient intake (carbohydrate, fat, protein, and other), duration of buffet meal, aand satiety data measured via a satiety assessment at Period 1 (Visit 2) and Period 2 (Visit 3).</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effect of pramlintide on postprandial metabolic and hormonal responses - To assess the acute effect of pramlintide administered SC on postprandial metabolic and hormonal responses [glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, insulin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1)] in normal-weight and obese non-diabetic subjects and in insulin-treated subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. To be measured by the calculation of both absolute and incremental plasma analyte concentration profiles.</outcome>
