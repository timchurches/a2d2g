    <interventions>In this observational study, consecutive critically ill children (n = 149) admitted to the PICU of a tertiary university hospital as well as a reference group of healthy children (n=60) were included. Plasma glutamine concentration and the pediatric logistic organ dysfunction score (PELOD) were determined at admission and at day 5 for patients still in the PICU. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Normality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Data normally distributed are given as means and S.D. Nonparametric data values are given as median (IQR). Student´s t-test, Wilson matched pair test, ANOVA followed by Tukey post-hoc test, Fisher`s exact test and Pearson´s linear regression analysis were used when applicable. (Statistica Statsoft, Tulsa, Okla, USA).
Estimation of patients needed to achieve the objectives of the study: plasma glutamine concentration as a marker of morbidity in PICU patients has not been investigated before. The variability is not known. However, in a study investigating adult ICU patients (n=80) a reduction by 50 % in mortality has been shown if the concentration of plasma glutamine is &gt; 430 micromol/L. In the present study, one objective is to longitudinally investigate patients who stay &gt; 5 days in the PICU. In Scandinavian PICU:s it is known that approximately 30 % of the patients will have a PICU-stay &gt; 5 days. Therefore, the aim is to include 150 patients which will result in approximately 45 patients staying &gt; 5 days in the PICU which would be sufficient to discover a difference in mortalty. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low plasma glutamine concentration (&lt; 420 micromol/L) is an independent risk factor for mortality in critically ill adult patients. Glutamine metabolism in children is less well characterized. However, the PICU mortality is low and therefore mortality is difficult to use as an endpoint. Here we evaluated if plasma glutamine concentration at admission to the PICU relates to the development of multiple organ failure, using PELOD-score as a surrogate marker of mortality. In this observational study, consecutive critically ill children (n = 149) admitted to the PICU of a tertiary university hospital as well as a reference group of healthy children (n=60) were included. Plasma glutamine concentration and the pediatric logistic organ dysfunction score (PELOD) were determined at admission and at day 5 for patients still in the PICU. </summary>
