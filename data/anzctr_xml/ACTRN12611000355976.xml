  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants were randomly assigned to either an active treatment (two or four sessions of CBT in addition to a self-help booklet) or control condition (self-help booklet alone). The self-help booklet was developed by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC, 2001).

Sessions were delivered in person at central research or local health clinics on a once weekly basis. Session 1 occurred immediately following the initial assessment and randomization, with participants returning for a further one or three sessions on a weekly basis depending on whether allocation was to the 2- or 4-session treatment.
Four-session cognitive behaviour therapy condition
A therapist manual (Baker, Lee, Kay-Lambkin, Claire &amp; Jenner, 2003), revised and expanded from that used in the pilot study (Baker et al., 2001) and a self-help booklet (NDARC, 2001) guided treatment sessions, which focused on developing skills to reduce amphetamine use. Sessions were conducted individually and lasted 45-60 minutes. Session content included role-plays and take home exercises for practising skills. The first session involved a motivational interview (Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002; Miller, Zweben, DiClemente &amp; Rychtarik, 1992) to increase motivation to reduce amphetamine use. The following sessions focused on cognitive-behavioural coping strategies and relapse prevention, using techniques developed by Marlatt and Gordon (1985). The second session focused on identifying high-risk situations for amphetamine use. In the third session, participants were taught how to reduce craving with progressive muscular relaxation and coping self-talk. The fourth session focused on coping with lapses and developing a coping drill to use in high-risk situations following any future lapses.

Two-session cognitive behaviour therapy condition
The procedure and content of the first two sessions was the same as described above for the longer intervention. Participants were also given the same self-help booklet as the intervention group (NDARC, 2001) which details amphetamine related harms and suggestions for reducing amphetamine use.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were recruited by means of notices placed within various agencies and treatment centres, media releases and via word of mouth in Newcastle, New South Wales and Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Notices stated that university researchers were conducting a project to help people regularly using amphetamines to reduce their use. Referral sources included alcohol and other drug services (including needle and syringe programs), word of mouth, media advertisements, general practitioners, a youth service, and other community agencies. 

Initial screening of referred potential participants occurred via telephone, and included a brief assessment of current mehtamphetamine use levels and an explanation of the study design.  Information sheets and consent forms were posted to all eligible clients, with an appointment made for an in-person assessment for the following week.  Participants were assured that all information was strictly confidential to the research team who were independent of any treatment agency and that refusal to participate would not affect their relationship with the agency in any way. Participants were asked to provide written consent to take part in the study and if aged under 18 years, consent was sought from their parent/guardian.

All participants were reimbursed $20 for each assessment interview they completed.  Initial interviews took place either in the location from which they were recruited or participants were asked to attend research centres or other local health facilities. 

Participants were interviewed for their initial assessment, and then randomly assigned to a study condition. 

Interviews took approximately one hour to complete. 

The interviewer then undertook the first session if the participant was allocated to a treatment condition, or gave them a self help booklet and made a time for follow-up if allocated to the control condition.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was by an independent researcher using random permutations of the numbers 1-4 and 1-8 and a free online randomisation program.  The use of two permutation lengths was used to reduce potential for guessing.  The randomisation procedure will stratified for gender and pharmacotherapy for heroin dependence.  The allocator kept an electronic record of allocations to independently verify correct treatment receipt, and placed written advice of the allocation to the baseline assessor in a sealed and numbered envelope, which the assessor only opened at the conclusion of the initial assessment session. 
This procedure ensured that assessment of eligibility and baseline measures are not affected by knowledge of the allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was the first to examine the efficacy of a psychological treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy, was in reducing methamphetamine use and depression among a group of people who were regular users of methamphetamines.  It was hypothesised that people who recieved four sessions of treatment would make superior reductions in methamphetamine use and depression relative to those who received two treatment sessions, and that those who receive the four- and two-session treatments would report superior improvements in depression and reducation in methamphetamine use relative to the control.</summary>
