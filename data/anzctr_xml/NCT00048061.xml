  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relative Change From Baseline at One Year (12 Months) in Mean Lumbar Spine (L2 - L4) Bone Mineral Density - Relative change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is the percentage change from baseline of BMD of vertebrae L2 - L4 that are not fractured and not affected by an osteoarthritic process to such a degree that accurate measurement of BMD would be considered jeopardized by the central reading center after 12 months of treatment. It is calculated as the sum of bone mineral content divided by the sum of area of all lumbar vertebrae L2 - L4 that are not fractured and not affected by an osteoarthritic process at Month 12. Participants available at particular time point for assessment were included in the analysis.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event - An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</outcome>
