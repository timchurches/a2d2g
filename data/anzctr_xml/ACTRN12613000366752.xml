  <interventions>
    <interventions>Education intervention: Participants in this group will receive an advice/education package that has been designed to improve their knowledge and understanding about the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting and to change their behaviour in relation to sitting habits. The education package includes a single twenty-minute multimedia presentation. Participants in this group will set personal physical activity goals and monitor their own daily step counts for one month. 

Sit-stand desk intervention: Participants in this group will receive the same education package as the education intervention group. Participants in this group will be also be provided with a Workfit (Registered Trademark) adjustable sit-stand workstation for a period of four weeks. 
Participants will receive a single five minute one-on-one demonstration in the use and adjustment of the workstation with. Participants will set individual goals for the time that they will spend working in a standing position. Participants will be free to adjust the work station at their own discretion. Participants will be given the general advice to alternate regularly between work in a sitting and standing position and discouraged from trying to only work in a standing position.</interventions>
    <comparator>No intervention: Participants in this group will receive no information or advice about postural change and no modification to their office desk set up. Participants in the control group will be offered the education intervention once they have completed final data collection and they have been discharged from their involvement in the study.  </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by advertisement from academic and administrative staff at The University of Sydney. Posters will be placed in staff tearooms and common areas, inviting staff to participate in “The Healthier Office Study”. The advertisements will contain the general information informing participants that we are testing simple occupational health interventions and that participants will be provided with an ergonomic device or advice about improving healthy work practices. The advertisements will not contain specific detail about the interventions in order to keep the participants blinded to the interventions that they do not receive.  

A researcher who is blinded to subject allocation will collect baseline and outcome data. Baseline data will be collected from participants at the initial assessment to obtain a profile of the participant’s demographic, work and general health characteristics. 

A researcher who is not involved in participant recruitment or data collection will produce a randomly generated sequence for allocating participants to one of the three groups. This will be done prior to commencement of the trial. This researcher will prepare consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes that contain the group allocation for each individual participant. The envelope for each participant will be opened after the participant has enrolled in the study and after baseline data is collected. The randomisation sequence will contain equal numbers of subjects in each group but will be otherwise unrestricted.

A researcher who is blinded to the participant allocation will perform data entry and analysis.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Data collection will take place away from the participants office and data collectors will be instructed not to enter the office areas of participants. This will ensure blinding of the data collectors to allocation of participants to the sit-stand desk intervention group. The office set-up in the workplace setting for this trial is predominantly private, single occupier offices with few work centres using open plan office design. This feature of the study setting will assist with maintaining blinding of participants and data collectors.

Participants in the control group will be kept naïve as to the main aim of the study i.e. reduction of unhealthy sitting behaviours. This is because it is believed by the research team that participants being aware that the primary outcome is to reduce sitting behaviour, might actually change this behaviour.  It is therefore also necessary that participants be blinded as to the intervention groups to which they are not allocated. Knowledge of the other intervention being tested, both being clearly interventions designed to reduce sitting behaviour might also impact on the sitting behaviour of participants. Participants will therefore be informed that they are participating in a trial of general workplace health interventions and remain blinded to the other intervention groups.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Repeated measures of ANOVA will be used to determine within group and between group differences in the recorded outcome measures.

We did not conduct a formal power analysis to determine sample size; this is because the threshold for defining harmful levels of sitting is unknown.  The proposed sample size of this study is similar to previous pilot studies of workplace sitting and sedentary time. Our sample of 60 participants (three groups of 20 participants) should be sufficient for assessing the direction of intervention effects while taking into account possible missing data and participation attrition.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prolonged sitting at work has been identified as a significant occupational health concern, and there is a need for effective interventions that reduce potentially unhealthy sitting behaviour in particular occupational groups such as office workers.  This study will compare the effectiveness of two simple occupational health interventions in reducing these potentially unhealthy sitting behaviour in office workers. This study will determine whether providing office workers with an adjustable sit-stand desk and individually targeted education is more effective in decreasing sitting behaviours than education alone or providing no intervention.
