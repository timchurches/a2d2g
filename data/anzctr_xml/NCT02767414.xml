    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Respirio Flu Test
Treatment: devices - eLab Flu Test
Treatment: devices - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)

Experimental: Respirio Flu Test and eLab Flu Test - Upper respiratory tract samples from participants will be tested with:
Respirio Flu Test; eLab Flu Test; and Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)


Treatment: devices: Respirio Flu Test
The Respirio Flu Test is a rapid in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of influenza A or influenza B in nasal secretions. The Respirio Flu Test is designed to be simple to use and generates a result within 20 minutes.

Treatment: devices: eLab Flu Test
The eLab Flu Test is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to be used at point-of-care for the detection of influenza A or influenza B in nasopharyngeal swab samples. The eLab Flu Test generates a result within 10 minutes.

Treatment: devices: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a molecular diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of influenza viruses, both for clinical samples and isolates. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows template viral RNA to be reverse transcribed producing complementary DNA (cDNA) which can then be amplified and detected.

    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the
      Respirio Flu Test and the eLab Flu Test in detecting Influenza A as compared to the gold
      standard for detection, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

      The secondary aims are to:

      Validate the sensitivity and specificity of the Respirio Flu Test and the eLab Flu Test in
      detecting Influenza B as compared to the gold standard for detection, Reverse Transcriptase
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR); Evaluate the correct interpretation of the Respirio Flu
      Test by subjects with influenza-like symptoms; Evaluate the subjects' satisfaction with the
      convenience, comfort and ease of use of the Respirio Flu Test.</summary>
