    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive a new drug, BBI608,
      or better to receive no further treatment for colon or rectal cancer. To do this, half of the
      patients in this study will get BBI608 and the other half will receive a placebo (a substance
      that is designed not to do anything).</summary>
