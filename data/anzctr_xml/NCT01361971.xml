Treatment: surgery: Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment
Participants will undergo 4 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen. Each treatment consists of 90 minutes compression at 2 atmospheres of pressure, with 30 minutes decompression back to 1 atmosphere, during this time, patients will be treated with 100% Oxygen delivered via a hood system.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is an epidemic in Western society and is the biggest risk factor for insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes. The investigators have preliminary evidence showing that
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy rapidly increases insulin sensitivity in humans. This requires
      confirmation in a larger population, and with this study the investigators will also test for
      mechanisms how this occurs. The investigators suspect that modulation of hypoxia and stress
      response proteins following changes in tissue oxygenation may contribute to these
      improvements. This study has the potential to yield new and important insights into the
      insulin resistance in obesity.</summary>
