  <interventions>
    <interventions>Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS is a non-invasive procedure that involves the administration of magnetic pulses to the scalp, which are able to stimulate the underlying brain tissue (i.e., cause brain cells to become active). rTMS can be used to either increase or decrease activity in a certain part of the brain.
The application of TMS involves 15 minutes of 1 Hz rTMS (i.e., 1 pulse per second for 15 minutes) to (a) primary motor cortex and (b) supplementary motor area. These are done in separate sessions. All participants will receive both arms, plus the control treatment (Sham rTMS). The order of the three conditions (i.e., rTMS to primary motor cortex, rTMS to supplementary motor area, Sham rTMS) will be randomised. There is one week between each of the three conditions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. This involves the administration of rTMS as described in the intervention, but the TMS coil is angled away from the scalp; thus, no magnetic pulses are delivered to the brain.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Impairments in motor functioning are well documented in autism and Asperger's disorder, and are associated with specific brain processes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be used to improve motor function in autism and Asperger's disorder. rTMS involves the administration of magnetic pulses to the scalp, and can be used to alter brain activity. Participants will complete 3 separate sessions (one week apart) in which a different type of rTMS will be administered. They will complete motor tasks before and after each rTMS application, and brain activity will be recorded via electrodes placed on the scalp. It is expected that stimulation of a brain region called the "supplementary motor area," which is involved in preparing movement, will result in an improvement of motor function.</summary>
