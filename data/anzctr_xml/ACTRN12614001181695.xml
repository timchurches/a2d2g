    <interventions>Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. Standard radiotherapy treatment is usually delivered in small doses over many treatments (usually 5 to 20 treatments). SABR treatment is different as it uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1 or 2 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages with the aim of destroying all cancer cells at the site of treatment. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses. SABR treatment appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, kidney and the liver. We aim to test the ability of this new technique to control the cancer spots that have spread from the breast to the bones and lymph nodes and that are being treated with SABR. 

The investigational drug (MK-3475) is a type of monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. A monoclonal antibody is a laboratory-produced antibody that is carefully engineered to attach to your cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies mimic the antibodies your body naturally produces as part of your immune system's response to germs, vaccines, and other invaders. There are now several approved monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer or other diseases.

MK-3475 is a monoclonal antibody that works against a protein called PD-1 on the surface of the cancer cells. It is thought that cancer cells with increased levels of PD-1 avoid detection by the bodys immune system. The study drug (MK-3475) is being tested to see if it can decrease the level of PD-1 in your cancer and allow the bodys immune system to identify and work against the tumour cells.


1) Screening Assessments:

Initially you will be assessed to check that you are eligible to join the study. This screening period may last for a number of weeks and will involve the following procedures. 

A) Physical Assessment: Including height, weight, pulse rate and blood pressure assessment. You will also be asked questions about your medical history and the medicines you currently take. Finally, your doctor will assess your performance status (by asking questions about your general well-being).

B) Disease Assessment: Your breast cancer will be assessed by: 
* Radiology scans such as a CT (computed tomography) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
* Whole body bone scan 
* Nuclear medicine scans such as a FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) - PET (positron emission tomography)/computed tomography (CT). 
* X-rays (if necessary) 

* Tumour Tissue: If you decide to participate in this study, your doctor will be required to send a sample of your tumour to a central laboratory, which was previously collected when you were diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. This sample (which has already been taken from you) is currently stored in a pathology laboratory and we will request this sample to be sent to our central laboratory with your permission.

If your tumour starts to grow again at a location where it is readily accessible, your doctor may propose to take a biopsy again. We would like to collect a sample of this biopsy as well to determine in which way the tumour has changed. 

C) Routine Blood Samples: Before entering the study, blood will be taken (approximately 15-30mls or approximately 2 tablespoons) to check for; blood cell counts, liver, pancreas, kidney and thyroid function, HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, a breast cancer tumour marker called cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), as well as a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. Blood samples will be taken at every 3 weeks while treatment is continuing to monitor your haematology and serum chemistry levels. 


2) STUDY TREATMENT:

If you decide to participate in the study and meet the criteria to take part in the study, you will be treated according to the following schema:

A) SABR TREATMENT

Prior to your SABR treatment, you will be required to fill out a pain rating scale, which may take up to 2 minutes of your time. You will have either a single session of SABR treatment (20Gy in 1 fraction per area to be treated) or in some cases where there is not enough time available or for technical reasons you may be required to return for two or three sessions (i.e. You may receive 28Gy in 2 fractions).

In order to deliver this treatment, you may need to attend a planning CT scan session, where you will receive a CT scan and your body measurements are taken in the position that you will be lying in for your radiotherapy. This visit takes approximately one hour. Once the radiotherapy treatment has been planned, a further mock-up visit may be required to ensure that the radiotherapy plan can be smoothly delivered when it comes to the time of treatment. This session will take between 45 minutes and 90 minutes.  When the treatment starts, the total time required to deliver the treatment will be approximately one hour. 

B) MK-3475 TREATMENT

MK-3475 (200mg) will be given to you by a needle in your vein (called venous infusion) over a period of 30mins, with the first dose starting a maximum of 5 days after completing SABR treatment, and delivered once every three weeks for a total of 8 cycles (i.e. 1 cycle every 3 weeks for a total of 8 cycles).

Treatment with MK-3475 will continue until you have completed 6 months of treatment, or until your cancer spreads further to other parts of your body, or you experience intolerable side effects. If you stop treatment for any reason prior to completing the 6 months of MK-3475 treatment, you will be offered alternative treatment options by your study doctor.

During the 6 months of MK-3475 treatment, you will be required to have a doctors visit every 3 weeks. Overnight stay in the hospital is not anticipated, but may become necessary. Routine blood tests, including liver, thyroid and kidney function, will be carried out during treatment at each visit before you receive MK-3475. If you develop side effects, more frequent examinations may be necessary.

Your physician will document your general condition and all hospital stays during the clinical trial. He/she will similarly ask you about all side effects which you experienced and about all medications or treatments which you received since your last visit.

Your doctor may suggest other tests, such as a CT scan if appropriate. The regular doctors visits are part of your standard medical care and are handled the same way as if you did not take part in the study.

If you complete the 6 months of MK-3475 treatment and your cancer has responded, but sometime in the future your cancer returns or grows (should this happen), you will be given the option to receive a further course of MK-3475 treatment by your study doctor.


3) CLINIC VISITS/FOLLOW-UP: 

After your SABR treatment is completed, you will be asked to attend the hospital for a check-up at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until two years from the date that SABR treatment was completed. Some of these visits may coincide with the 3-weekly visits required during the MK-3475 treatment, and if so, you wont be required to come to the hospital twice.

At each visit, a doctor will review your general health and whether anything new has happened to you since the last study visit (including any bad reactions or injuries), any side effects you may be experiencing, an assessment of how well you can perform daily activities and a review of any further anti-cancer treatments you may have undergone.

At every follow-up visit, you will be expected to fill out a questionnaire to nominate your current pain rating, which will take about 2 minutes of your time. 


A) RADIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS:

The following radiological investigations will be undertaken during and after your treatment on this study:

* CT Scan and Whole Body Bone Scan: You will a CT scan and whole body bone scan at 6, 12 and 24 months post end of SABR treatment unless there is evidence that your disease has progressed, in which case the scans may be done earlier.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to determine the safety profile of stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery (SABR) in combination with MK-3475 treatment in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be evaluated using CTCAE version 4.0 in all patients who have received at least one SABR treatment and one dose of MK-3475. Acute AE are defined as AEs occurring from the time from 1st SABR treatment to 30 days post end of MK-3475 treatment and long term AE are defined as AEs occurring after 30 days post end of MK-3475 treatment.  AE assessments will be conducted from time of study consent, during treatment, at 1 month post end of treatment, and at every 3 months until 2 years from the date that SABR was completed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate changes in immunological markers in tumor tissue, and immune subsets in peripheral blood from patients over serial time-points, including at time of progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected (50ml) at baseline (prior to first SABR), prior to the first dose of MK-3475, prior to cycle 2 of MK-3475, at disease progression (if this occurs) and then every 3 months up to two years post end of SABR treatment. These will be analysed for the following (this is a non-exhaustive list):
i. Absolute lymphocyte counts using a blood analyser.
ii. The presence of CD8+ T cells by flow cytometric analysis.
iii. Change in frequency of tumor reactive T cells. These may include markers for HLA-DR, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, PD-1, TIM-3 signifying antigen presentation and experience.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate effectiveness of the treatment combination as assessed by pain ratings as well as tumor response in the irradiated lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Effectiveness of treatment will be evaluated using two methods; a) Numerical Rating Pain Scale and B) Local and distant progression free survival (LPFS and DPFS). 
a. Pain will be evaluated pre and post using the Numerical Rating Pain Scale at the following time points: pre-SABR treatment, at approx. 1 month (around cycle 2 of Pembrolizumab), 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, 21 months and at 24 months after the end of treatment. 
b. Treatment efficacy will also be assessed by the local progression disease free survival (LPFS) and distant progression free survival (DPFS). LPFS and DPFS will be measured from date of commencement of treatment to the date of first local progression or date of death for patients without local/distant progression. Time to progression in other sites will also be recorded.  LPFS and DPFS will be assessed by clinical (i.e. physical examinations) and radiological assessments (via a CT scan, WBBS and/or FDG PET/CT scans) at 3, 9, 15, 18 and 21 months post SABR treatment unless evidence  of progression earlier or clinically inappropriate.  Re-staging will also occur using CT scan and WBBS scan at 6, 12 and 24 Months post end of SABR treatment if no evidence of progression has occurred earlier.  </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a single arm pilot study to determine safety profile of SABR in combination with MK-3475 in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer. 

A) The Primary Endpoint is Safety of the Combination:
Safety will be assessed using CTCAE v4.0 and the maximum acute toxicity grade will be derived. The proportion of patients who suffer from grade 3 or higher acute toxicities will be provided along with its exact 95% CI.

A summary table (overall, acute and long term) will be evaluated using CTCAE version 4.0. Adverse events (worst grade per patient) will be tabulated for all patients who have received at least one dose of MK-3475 and completed at least one SABR treatment. If patients are retreated with MK-3475, toxicities occurring during or after second treatment with MK-3475 will be reported separately from the long term toxicities.

B) Secondary Endpoints are to Examine the Biological Effects of the Combination: 
The chief secondary endpoints are descriptive and are to evaluate immune responses and efficacy of the treatment (local and distant tumor responses). We will be looking for consistent changes in immunity and reporting efficacy as stated below. This data will provide the scientific rationale for moving to a larger, appropriately powered trial to look specifically at efficacy.

C) Anti-Tumor Immunity:
Host anti-tumor immunity measured at the designated time points (baseline, prior to first dose MK-3475, on treatment, post treatment and at 24 months or at time of progression if that comes before the 24 month time period) will be described as change over time using linear mixed models. The linear mixed model will include time as fixed effect and patients as random effect. Mean and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each time point and the data will be displayed graphically. Variable transformation may be required for some of the collected variables. If the assumptions of the model do not hold, simple descriptive statistics will be provided for each variable at each time point.

D) Efficacy:
The efficacy of the treatment will be evaluated by:
i) Pain will be described as change over time using linear mixed models. The linear mixed model will include time as fixed effect and patients as random effect. Mean and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each time point and the data will be displayed graphically. Variable transformation may be required for some of the collected variables. If strong floor effect is observed or if the assumptions of the model do not hold, simple descriptive statistics will be provided for each variable at each time point
ii) Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to describe LPFS and DPFS at 1 and 2 years. This will be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve, along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the combined use of stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery (SABR) treatment followed by an investigational drug, called MK-3475, as treatment for metastatic breast cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, diagnosed with breast cancer that has metastasised to the bones, lungs, or isolated nodes. 

Study details: 
The study aims to describe the safety profile and biological effects of combining SABR treatment with MK-3475 in patients with oligometastatic breast cancer. All participants will receive SABR treatment (one or more sessions, as required) followed by 8 cycles of MK-3475 (venous infusion, one cycle every three weeks). During each cycle, the doctor will review your general health and conduct a physical assessment as well as blood tests and a quality of life questionnaire. Radiological assessments may also be performed as necessary during and after treatment. Participants will be followed up for up to 2 years from the completion of the SABR treatment.</summary>
