  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will consist of 3 groups. The first group will have 5 participants, the other groups 4 participants each undergoing cochlear implantation. Both the placebo and FX-322 will be administered by intratympanic injection in the ear to be implanted. All participants will be injected once with an identical volume (0.2 mL)
into the middle ear. This injection will be performed by a specialist and qualified cochlear implant surgeon. The participants will differ in obtaining Placebo (12-24 hours prior to implantation) or FX-322 (18mg) and the time window for the injection
(either 12-24 hours prior to the surgery, 3-5 hours prior to surgery or 0.5-2 hours prior to the surgery). The exact time of injection is based   on hospital logistics. Group 1 will have the first two participants allocated to placebo and three FX-322. .participants. Group 2 and Group 3 each will have one placebo participant and three FX-322 participants.  The participants in each group is based on hospital logistics. There is no dose change
 The reason for forming 3 groups is to have a safety review after each group
. The participants will all be followed 1-4 weeks after the cochlear implantation.  Participants
must be adult and audiometric threshold of 80 decibel [dB] hearing loss [HL] or poorer at 500 Hertz [Hz])

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess diffusion of FX-322 from the middle ear, across the oval and round window membranes, and into the cochlear fluid (perilymph). The concentration of FX-322 will be analysed from the perilymph fluid and blood plasma by standard laboratory methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Perilymph fluid is taken in surgery only. Blood plasma is taken at baseline and screening (to prove no FX-322 is present) and 1,2,4,6, 24h and 72h post injection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the tolerability of intratympanic injection of FX-322. This is evaluated via treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs); physical examination; Visual Analog Scale for pain, Tinnitus Visual Analog Scale (TVAS) and the Tinnitus Handicap Index (THI): to assess potential to cause, exacerbate or ameliorate tinnitus, and Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS) Questionnaire and Dizziness Handicap Index (DHI)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The tolerability will be assessed by comparing baseline assessments to the to the same assessments completed just prior to surgery (ie 12-24 hours, 3-5 hours or 0.5-2 hours post injection depending on when the FX-322 or Placebo injection was given).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess safety by the evaluation of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). No adverse events are known as of today.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluating of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be completed by evaluating results from at the day of injection, surgery, 24h post injection, 72h post injection and 1-4 weeks after implantation depending on the hospital logistics to baseline values.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase 1 safety study performed in male or female adult participants with an established diagnosis of severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss that meets the criteria for cochlear implantation and the participant has already chosen to undergo cochlear implant surgery. Approximately 13 participants will be enrolled in the study in one of three groups and will obtain either IP (investigational Product - FX-322)  or placebo (in total 5 participants in group 1 - 3 active and 2 placebo - and  4 participants in group 2 and group 3 -3 active and 1 placebo). Assessed will be the diffusion of FX-322 from the middle ear, across the oval and round window membranes, and into the cochlear fluid (perilymph) as well as the tolerability of intratympanic injection of FX-322. In addition the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of FX-322 will be assessed to determine the systemic exposure to FX-322. 

To assess safety by the evaluation of treatment-emergent adverse events
(TEAEs); physical examination; Visual Analog Scale for pain, Tinnitus Visual Analog Scale (TVAS) and the Tinnitus Handicap Index (THI): to assess potential to cause, exacerbate or ameliorate tinnitus, and   Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS) Questionnaire and Dizziness Handicap Index (DHI): to assess effects on the vestibular system. Blood samples for determination of plasma FX-322 concentrations will be drawn pre-dose and post-dose at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours on Day 1. Subjects will have the ~24 hour blood draw prior   to discharge from the hospital. On post injection Day 3, the subjects will have their ~72 hour blood draw taken at their home. The duration of the study is 10 months.
