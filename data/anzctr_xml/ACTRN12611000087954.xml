  <interventions>
    <interventions>Inhalation of continuous flow nitrous oxide using blender and scavenger for the provision of procedural analgesia.
Flow will be 5l/min, 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen, for minimum of 3 minutes prior to procedure and ceased after catheter is removed.
The procedure will be bladder catheterisation for the purpose of diagnostic urine collection. The total procedure duration is approximately 5 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital (UWCH) pain scale will be used to evaluate procedural pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A pain score will be determined from video footage by blinded observer, one minute before the N2O delivery starts, just before the procedure starts and when the catheter has been inserted.
Blinding will be achieved by using nurses who have not been involved in any of the procedures to assess the pain scores from edited video footage. In order to blind these pain score observers both controls and treatment arm participants will have the nitrous blender and scavenger running (creating the same background noise) and will have a mask and circuit on the bed. The videos provided to the pain assessors will be edited to only include the relevant pain assessment periods (prior to mask application, immediately prior to procedure starting the procedure and after catheter insertion). The treatment group will have the mask removed from their face for approximately 5 seconds during the assessment periods noted above.</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>The study population will consist of children presenting to Starship CED who are
1/ Aged between three months and two years of age, and
2/ Require bladder catheterisation to obtain a diagnostic urine sample.
A convenience sample will be enrolled that coincides with the presence of the research nurse.
Children &lt;3 months of age have not been included in this study as they are often provided with a dose of oral sucrose prior to any painful procedures. Children &gt;2 years of age are not included as these children are usually able to provide a urine sample without catheterisation (Bray &amp; Sanders, 2006).</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The study population will consist of children presenting to Starship CED who are aged between three months and two years of age, and require bladder catheterisation to obtain a diagnostic urine sample. A convenience sample will be enrolled that coincides with the presence of the research nurse. The study will be explained to the caregivers of patients meeting the inclusion criteria and informed consent sought.  After consent is gained children will then be randomly allocated to the control or intervention group by envelope containing a 1:1 ratio of allocation into each group (see below)</concealment>
    <sequence>One hundred and ten sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes will be placed in the CED pharmacy room, which has key pad access only.  Study numbers will be assigned sequentially, and randomization will be achieved by generating numerical codes in random permuted blocks. Each envelope will contain the words Nitrous Oxide or Control (with a 50% probability of each).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study explores the use of a continuous-flow nitrous oxide system to alleviate the pain and anxiety young children experience with a commonly performed procedure in a paediatric emergency department.   
The study will look specifically at the use of nitrous oxide in children older than 3 months and younger than 2 years of age who require bladder catheterisation for the purposes of obtaining a diagnostic urine sample.
Bladder catheterisation is known to be painful and distressing and currently we do not have a method of reducing this pain and distress in children of this age.
The study will be conducted in the Childrens Emergency Department (CED) at Starship Childrens hospital. Children will be randomised to either receive standard treatment (no analgesia or procedural sedation) or nitrous oxide. We will measure how much distress each child experiences and how much sedation is achieved during the procedure using standardised scoring systems. Children will also be monitored carefully to ensure they remain safe during the procedure.
We will then be able to determine whether the nitrous oxide is effective at reducing pain and distress for these types of procedure. 
We hope this will allow us to develop a better way of caring for young children undergoing other painful and distressing procedures in the Emergency Department. We also hope this information will be useful to other emergency departments and providers in other settings where young children have procedures.</summary>
