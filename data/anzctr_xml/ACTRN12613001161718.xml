  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an 18-month randomised controlled trial involving 6-months of supervised dual task functional power training, a 6-month 'step-down' maintenance program, and a 6-month follow-up. Men and women at increased risk of falling will be randomised to: 1) Dual task functional power training plus a 6-month step-down program or 2) a usual care control group. 

The dual task functional power training is an individually tailored high speed progressive resistance training program. The community based program will be supervised by accredited exercise trainers and conducted twice a week. Each session will last 45-60 minutes and consist of high velocity functional and resistance training with the goal to increase lower limb muscle power, including gait speed, movement speed and force, and mobility. Participants will be instructed to perform all repetitions for each concentric (shortening) phase of the exercise as quickly as possible, while the eccentric (lengthening) phase of the exercise action will be controlled over 3-4 seconds. The exercises will become progressively more challenging by increasing the difficulty or changing the exercise to another more complex task and adding a secondary task (such as counting backwards, or performing the exercise to the beat of the music). As a guide, participants will perform 2 sets of 10-20 repetitions progressing to 50 reps for the stepping exercises. For the resistance exercises, participants will perform 2 sets of 10-15 repetitions at an intensity of 4 to 6 (moderate to hard) on the 10 point Borgs Rating of Perceived Exertion scale (RPE). Resistance will be increased as tolerated using this scale. Compliance to the exercise program will be monitored with exercise cards and session attendance records. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the comparator group will receive their usual care (eg medication review, vision assessment) from their medical practitioner as required. They will also receive standardised falls prevention advice in the form of a booklet (Department of Health: Dont fall for it  falls can be prevented) along with generic project newsletters that contain project updates to help minimise attrition over the 18-month study duration. There is no evidence that the provision of written falls prevention information alone reduces falls risk. We chose not to use a sham exercise control group as a secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the dual task functional power training.

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be invited from each retirement village to take part in the study. Participants may be referred to the study from a friend or by responding to local advertisements about the study within their retirement village or community centre. Eligible participants will then be screened further to ensure they fulfill the inclusion criteria for this study. All participants must receive approval from their local physician prior to participating in the program. Randomisation will be performed by cluster (village) stratified by village size, using a computer-generated random number sequence by an independent researcher not involved in the study. The assignment will be masked so that the investigators assessing outcomes will not be aware of the group assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed by cluster (village) to avoid any potential contamination and facilitate logistical arrangement. Each village will be given an ID number and group assignment by blocks, stratified by village size (&lt;75 or =75 residents). Randomisation will be performed by an independent researcher not involved in the study using computer-generated random numbers (Microsoft Excel).  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Analysis will be conducted on an ITT basis using Stata. Where possible, we will obtain endpoint measures from all withdrawals and include all randomised subjects in the final analysis. The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome variables will be analysed using negative binomial models allowing for overdispersion. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses for potential covariates (and clustering) assessed at baseline will be conducted. The secondary outcome measures will be examined using General Linear Models allowing for the effects of clustering. Analysis of QoL (SF-36v2, AQoL6D) will utilize published weightings most relevant to this population.


Sample Size Calculations: Based on data from Sanders et al and others,(Burnett et al 2003, Fitzharris et al 2010) we expect that ~45% of the usual care control group will experience a fall. We estimate that we will require 118 participants per group to detect a 40% lower rate of falls (eg. from 45% to 27%) in the dual task functional power training group with a two-tailed P value of 0.05 and power of 0.8. This allows for a 15% loss to follow-up due to death or withdrawal from the study based on our previous work. To account for cluster randomisation, we assumed a conservative intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, giving a design effect of 1.19, assuming 20 participants are recruited per village. This gives a sample size of 140 per group (280 participants from ~15 villages). This sample size will also provide sufficient power (0.9, two tailed, P&lt;0.05) to detect significant and clinically meaningful differences in many of the secondary outcome measures. 

The participant recruitment goal was increased from 280 to 310 to allow for an additional  10% dropout immediately following baseline testing and prior to the start of the intervention. However, only 300 participants were recruited within the defined timeframe.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls are a major public health concern because they are associated with injury, pain, impaired function, loss of independence and even death. Reduced muscle power, or the ability to produce a rapid movement such as a quick step to recover from a loss in balance, is a strong predictor of disability and falls in older adults. In this population, the requirements to produce rapid movements often occurs whilst simultaneously performing other attention demanding cognitive-motor tasks such as walking while talking or negotiating obstacles. This study will evaluate whether a community-based, dual task functional power training (DT-FPT) program can reduce the rate of falls and improve risk factors for falls in elderly women at increased risk of falling. Secondary aims are to: 1) evaluate the efficacy of a 'step-down' maintenance program on fall rates; 2) assess the cost-effectiveness of the program; 3) evaluate the effects of the program on neural and cognitive health and function. This is an 18-month randomised controlled trial involving 6-months of supervised DT-FPT, a 6-month 'step-down' maintenance program, and a 6-month follow-up. Elderly women (n=300) at increased risk of falling will be randomised to: 1) DT-FPT plus a 6-month step-down program or 2) a usual care group. The primary outcome measure will be the number of falls throughout the study. Secondary outcomes will include: lower limb muscle power, gait, reaction time and balance under single and dual task conditions; falls related self efficacy, cognitive function and quality of life. All measures will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. We expect that the results from this trial will guide the development and implementation of future community-based falls prevention programs that specifically focus on optimising muscle power, gait and function and reducing falls risk in the elderly under real-life conditions. We also expect that the step-down program will provide new information about the efficacy of a less intensive maintenance program for reducing the risk of falls over an extended period. </summary>
