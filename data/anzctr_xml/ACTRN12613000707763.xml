  <interventions>
    <interventions>Saphenous vein harvesting will be uniformly performed using a standardised vein harvesting procedure. Harvested vein segments will be flushed and immersed in SOMVC001. After being stored in SOMVC001, vein segments will be grafted using standard surgical techniques.

SOMVC001 is a physiological salt solution containing Glutathione, Ascorbic Acid, and L-Arginine. SOMVC001 has nutrients for the cells as well as protective ingredients that can help the cells resist the damaging effects of prolonged storage. 

Components of SOMVC001 solution:
i.	Calcium chloride
ii.	Potassium chloride
iii.	Potassium phosphate (monobasic)
iv.	Magnesium chloride (hexahydrate)
v.	Magnesium sulfate (heptahydrate)
vi.	Sodium chloride
vii.	Sodium bicarbonate
viii.	Sodium phosphate (dibasic; hepatahydrate)
ix.	D-Dextrose
x.	Glutathione (reduced)
xi.	Ascorbic acid
xii.	L-Arginine
xiii.	Distilled water

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The composite primary objective is to evaluate the short-term (30-day) outcomes of death or complications, perioperative myocardial infarction, perioperative cardiogenic shock, re-operation, ICU admission and hospital length of stay, re-admission occurring within 30 days after surgery or before discharge, whichever is later in patients undergoing first time CABG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objective is to assess all adverse events through 30 days and evaluate them in respect to their relationship with the study product.
There are no current known adverse events associated with GALA. AEs are reported by the investigator via an electronic data capture system. AEs will be tabulated in the final report and narratives included where relevant.
Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 hours of awareness to the Medical Monitor who will adjudicate the event for required regulatory reporting.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants are invited to take part in this research project if they are undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). During the surgery, blood vessels from other parts of the body will be used to bypass blocked blood vessels in the heart which will improve the blood flow to the heart muscle. When blood vessels are removed from the body they must be immersed in a solution (salts in water) to keep them healthy before until they are replaced onto the heart. This research project is testing a new solution known as SOMVC001 (also known as GALA), which is intended to improve the preservation of the blood vessels, which are removed during the operation until they are placed on the heart.</summary>
