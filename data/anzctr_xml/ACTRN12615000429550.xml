  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients receive a 1 hour education session delivered by the primary researchers, as an outpatient. This includes a powerpoint presentation and a worksheet covering the basics of warfarin - how it works, indications, its purpose, practicalities for taking warfarin and testing INR, frequency of INR testing, interactions with drugs and diet, and major side of effects of warfarin (including when to seek help). The session occurs within 2 weeks of the patient leaving hospital. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients receive standard inpatient warfarin education, which is usually delivered by a ward pharmacist and normally takes 15-20 minutes. This involves the basics of warfarin including why the patient is on warfarin, checking their INR, dietary interactions and when to seek help. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the impact of extra education on patients' warfarin knowledge and anticoagulation control. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above who has been admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and newly commenced on warfarin. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive the standard hospital warfarin education, delivered by pharmacists. Participants in the other group, in addition to the hospital education, will receive an extra hour of warfarin education once they have left hospital. This will be delivered by the primary investigators. 

All participants will be asked to complete a 20 question multiple choice test to assess their knowledge of warfarin 6 weeks after they have left hospital. 

We also ask participants for permission to collect their INR data to check their warfarin control. 

It is hoped that this project will provide guidance as to whether we need to do more to educate patients about their warfarin therapy, or whether the education system we have in place currently is sufficient. </summary>
