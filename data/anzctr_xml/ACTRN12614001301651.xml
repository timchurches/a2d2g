  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two intra-oral osteopathic techniques applied by a final year supervised Master of Osteopathy student during each of 6, 15-minute weekly treatment sessions.  The first technique is a release of the masseter, temporalis and lateral and medial pterygoid muscles using inhibition.  The second technique will distract the mandible from the temporal bone and articulate the joint. The aims of this treatment is to improve mobility, and create joint space and blood flow to and from the tightly compacted joint, that may facilitate cartilage repair.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 10 was calculated prior to the study using G*Power 3 (Faul and Erdfelder, 2007), as required to detect an effect size of 0.9 (assuming power of 0.8 and alpha level of 0.05). This effect size was the most conservative effect size noted for a similar previous study (Kalamir et al, 2010).

    <summary>The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of effect on pain, mandibular range of motion, and disability of two intra-oral osteopathic techniques applied weekly for 6 weeks to patients with temporomandibular joint disorder. The aims of the treatment are to improve mobility, and create joint space and blood flow to and from the tightly compacted joint, that may facilitate cartilage repair and thus reduce pain and improve mouth opening.</summary>
