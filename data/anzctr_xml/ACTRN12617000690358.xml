    <interventions>DuchenneConnect Australia is an online patient/caregiver self-report registry collecting data about Australians with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Longitudinal data including demographics, disease manifestations, healthcare utilisation, and quality of life of individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD) and carriers of these conditions are collected, curated, and maintained in accordance with Australian Privacy Laws and Guidelines. 
Participants explicitly permit the collection and use of their data through an online consent or parental permission process and form. Patients anonymised data are used to facilitate research, speed the development of and recruitment for clinical trials, and generate potential research hypotheses. In addition, registrants are informed about clinical trials, clinical research, and social/behavioural research studies that may be of interest; they then choose whether to seek additional information and/or to participate.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Genetic mutation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Registrants are requested to update their medical history every 6-12 months, and they will be followed throughout their lifetime. Genetic mutation data is collected by patient report and verified by curation/review of genetic test report when provided.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ambulation status. Ambulation status is assessed from several questions about mobility in home and away from home, ability to sit and stand, use of assistive devices, and age at full time wheelchair use.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Registrants are requested to update their medical history every 6-12 months, and they will be followed throughout their lifetime.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Corticosteroid use. Data collected includes whether or not corticosteroids are used, and if so, name of corticosteroid, age started/stopped, dose and dosing regimen.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Registrants are requested to update their medical history every 6-12 months, and they will be followed throughout their lifetime.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular status. Multiple questions regarding cardiovascular symptoms, age at diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, use of cardiac medications, date of most recent echocardiogram and/or cardiac MRI, and the LVEF and/or LVSF value.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Registrants are requested to update their medical history every 6-12 months, and they will be followed throughout their lifetime.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Respiratory status. Assessed from questions about use of breathing devices, age at which breathing devices were started, date of most recent pulmonary function test (spirometry), and the FVC value (% predicted and raw FVC in liters).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Registrants are requested to update their medical history every 6-12 months, and they will be followed throughout their lifetime.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>There are no accurate figures on the number of individuals in Australia with DBMD, but we estimate that there is between 600 and 900 and we will encourage all of them to register. Female carriers will also be encouraged to register. Registrants will be requested to update their accounts at least annually and will continue to enrol participants indefinitely, to facilitate better characterisation of DBMD and provide individuals with the benefits of registration.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>DuchenneConnect Australia is an online, patient-report registry for individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and carrier females. The purpose of DuchenneConnect Australia is to connect Duchenne and Becker patients with actively recruiting clinical trials and research studies, and to educate patients and families about Duchenne and Becker care and research. At the same time, DuchenneConnect is a valuable resource for clinicians and researchers in academia and industry, allowing access to a de-identified, aggregate dataset provided by patients and their familiesinformation that is vital to advances in the care and treatment of Duchenne.</summary>
