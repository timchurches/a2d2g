  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment condition has three levels: manual therapy, a placebo and a control condition. Participants will experience each treatment condition in a random order over three separate sessions. Participants will attend at approximately the same time of day on three occasions, each separated by at least 24 hours in order to control for carry-over effects.
'Mobilisation with Movement' manual therapy technique: This will consist of a passive glide (MWM) to the affected knee with a superimposed active movement in partial weight-bearing. The participant will be positioned in standing with the foot of the affected side resting on a 10 cm block. The therapist will stand beside the participant on the affected side. The therapists hands will hold around the distal femur and proximal lower leg region (fibula and tibia and surrounding soft tissues). The therapist will apply a sustained, passive mobilisation glide to the tibia relative to the femur, whilst the participant is asked to actively move the affected knee into flexion until the point of stiffness or onset of pain, with care by the therapist to avoid any skin areas that are hyperalgesic to touch. The direction of the glide (medial/lateral, anterior/posterior or rotary) will be decided pragmatically by the treating therapist as the one giving greatest pain relief and/or improvement in range of motion. Three sets of 10 repetitions will be applied with a rest interval of one minute between each set. The participant will be instructed that the MWM procedure, including knee flexion, is to be pain free, and must be ceased immediately if any pain is experienced during the application. If a pain-free technique cannot be achieved in weight-bearing, then the same technique will be applied with the participant lying supine (non-weight-bearing) on the treatment bed.</interventions>
    <comparator>placebo manual therapy technique and control (no-treatment):
The placebo condition will replicate the treatment condition except for the hand positioning. The participant and therapist will stand in the same position as the treatment condition, with the therapists hands placed comfortably around the distal thigh. A simulated glide will be performed through minimal compressive pressure applied to the thigh. No joint glide will be achieved in the placebo condition. The participant will be asked to bend the affected knee through half of their available pain-free range to minimise the likelihood of pain provocation. The number of repetitions and sets will be as per the treatment group. 
Control: The participant will be standing for the same length of time as the other two interventions, but no manual contact between the therapist and the participant will take place.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>pain severity on weight bearing knee flexion:
Participants will be asked to indicate the level of pain experienced on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the lunge task on the affected side. This VAS is anchored with ?no pain? at 0 mm and ?worst pain imaginable? at 100 mm and the distance in millimetres along the line will be manually recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>weight bearing knee flexion range of movement to onset of pain:
A previously validated technique using a digital camera will be used to measure ROM of the knee. Adhesive markers will be placed on the skin overlying the following bony landmarks: (1) the lateral femoral epicondyle; (2) the greater trochanter; and (3) the lateral malleolus. The lens of the digital camera will be aligned with the joint line of the knee using a spirit level, and at a set distance of 150cm from the knee joint. A digital photograph will then be taken of the leg at the limit of pain-free knee ROM. The digital images will be downloaded onto a desktop computer and the mean calculation of knee angle in the sagittal plane will be obtained using a validated software program (Software Posture Analysis v1.0.17).
The participant will be positioned in standing with the foot of the tested side placed on a 10 cm block directly in front. The participant will be asked to lunge forward onto a bent knee, transferring their body weight onto the front leg on the block until the first onset of discomfort. The starting distance between their feet will be self-selected by each individual participant, and this distance will be measured and used for repeated assessments to ensure a standardised starting position. A digital photograph will be taken at the limit of knee flexion ROM. The process will be repeated three times with an intervening 30-second rest interval, for both the affected and unaffected sides.</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>pressure pain threshold:
Pressure pain threshold will be measured using a pressure algometer. Pressure will be applied to the medial knee joint line via a digital pressure algometer. The pressure algometer utilises a load cell (XTRAN S1W - 250 N; Applied Measurement, Australia) and a hand switch connected to a portable computer via a Data Acquisition Card (USB6009 DAQ; National Instruments, Texas USA). The processing software is LabView 7.1 (National Instruments, Texas USA). Load will be applied at a rate of 40 kPa/s through a rubber-tipped probe (area 1 cm2). The patient will be asked to activate a button as soon as a change in sensation from one of pressure to one of pain is experienced (threshold of pain). This process will be repeated three times with a 30-second rest period between each measurement, for both the affected and unaffected sides.</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Non-weight bearing knee flexion/extension range of movement to onset of pain:
With the participant lying supine on a treatment bed, the lens of the digital camera will be aligned with the joint line of the knee using a spirit level, and at a set distance of 150cm from the knee joint. A digital photograph will then be taken of the leg at the limit of pain-free knee flexion ROM and extension ROM. The process will be repeated three times in each position with an intervening 30-second rest interval. This process will then be repeated for the opposite side.</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Manual therapy techniques are commonly used by physiotherapists to improve pain and function in patients affected by osteoarthritis. The aim of this study is to determine if a specific manual therapy technique immediately decreases pain and improves function in people with knee osteoarthritis. It is hypothesised that the manual therapy technique will reduce pain and increase knee range of movement significantly more than either a placebo technique or control(no treatment).</summary>
