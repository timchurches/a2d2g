Acceptable methods that may be used are abstinence, birth control pills or patch, diaphragm with spermicide, intra uterine device (coil), condom and foam, surgical sterilization or progestin implant or injection, and vasectomized partners.
Active guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis at the time of the screening visit.
Evidence of skin conditions, or severe extremely psoriasis, or significant flair of psoriasis, at the time of the screening visit or between the screening visit and study drug initiation that would interfere with evaluations of the effect of Investigational Product on psoriasis.

Clinically significant condition, infection or laboratory toxicity, at the time of the screening visit or between the screening visit and the administration of the Investigational Product that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the study.
Evidence of clinically significant infection within 30 days of the screening visit that in the opinion of the Investigator would preclude participation in the study including hepatitis and tuberculosis.  Subjects will be screened for HIV, Hepatitis B &amp; C and tuberculosis.
Any other known infections that would in the Investigators discretion, interfere with the subjects ability to participate in the study.
History or any evidence of squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma and/or current cutaneous basal cell carcinoma.
History or evidence of other malignancy.
Current or history of psychiatric disease that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol or give informed consent.
History or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse that would interfere with the ability to comply with the study protocol.  
Inability to restrict alcohol consumption to 2 standard drinks per day for males and 1 standard drink per day for females, for the duration of the study.
Prior use of any anti-TNF agent or other investigational biologic agent for psoriasis (including but not limited to etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab alefacept and  efalizumab). 
Receipt of any Investigational Product(s) within 28 days of the first dose of Investigational Product in this study.

Receipt of any systemic psoriasis therapy within 28 days of the first dose of Investigational Product (including but not limited to oral or parenteral steroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), retinoids (e.g. acitretin) calcineurin inhibitors etc).
Topical medication within 14 days of the first dose of Investigational Product other than medicated shampoos and low potency steroids.  (Excluded medications include, but are not limited to, high potency steroids, topical vitamin A or D analog preparations, anthralin or topical cyclosporine or calcineurin inhibitors).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous injections of ART621 given every 2 weeks for 6 doses as assessed by adverse events and clinical laboratory data. Assessments of efficacy will include the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Physician Global Assessment (PGA), photographs and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

Each subject will be on-study for 18-20 weeks, consisting of a 2-4 week screening period, followed by a 12 week treatment period and then a 4 week follow up. Each subject will receive their designated dose of ART621 on 6 occasions over the 12 week treatment period and will be monitored closely throughout.</summary>
