  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clinician-level intervention: A one day training program for participating nurses, the integration of standard screening tools and prompts for SNAP risk factors into the  service specific standard assessment process used by the nurses, the development and dissemination of resources including a local service referral directory for lifestyle risk factors, a written guide for nurses, written action plans for use with clients, tape measures for measuring waist circumference, and pedometers to loan out to clients to promote self monitoring.

Client level intervention: Brief lifestyle counselling based on the 5As model tailored to the clients readiness change. The 5As model consists of assessing risk factors, advising on recommendations, agreeing goals for change, assisting with strategies for change and arranging referral to support services for more intensive intervention where appropriate</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care provided by generalist community nurses. This consists of a comprehensive assessment (including asking about lifestyle risk factors) and clinical service provision (eg wound management). As part of usual care nurses may refer clients with lifestyle risk factors to support services but do not typically provide intervention themselves</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the impact of a brief intervention delivered by community nurses in routine practice on the change in clients lifestyle risk factors.The trial will use a quasi experimental design involving four generalist community nursing sites in NSW Australia.  Sites will be randomly allocated to early intervention group or late intervention (comparison) group. Early intervention sites will be provided with training and support for nurses in identifying and offering brief lifestyle intervention for clients during routine consultations.  Late intervention sites will provide usual care and be offered the study intervention following the final data collection point.   A total of 720 eligible generalist community nursing clients will be recruited at the time of referral from both early and late intervention sites. Data collection consists of 1) telephone surveys with clients at baseline, three months and six months to examine change in SNAP risk factors and readiness change 2) nurse survey at baseline, six and 12 months to examine changes in SNAP risk factor confidence, attitudes and practices 3) semi-structured interviews/focus with nurses, managers and clients in early intervention sites to explore the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the intervention. 

The study will provide evidence about the effectiveness and feasibility of brief lifestyle interventions delivered by generalist community nurses as part of routine practice. This will inform future community nursing practice and Primary health care (PHC) policy.</summary>
