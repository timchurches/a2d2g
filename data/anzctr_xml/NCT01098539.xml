      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at Week 26 - HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over a 2- to 3-month period. The Baseline HbA1c value is defined as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in HbA1c was calculated as the value at Week 26 minus the value at Baseline. The analysis was performed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, region, history of prior myocardial infarction (yes versus no), and age category (&lt;65 years versus &gt;=65 years) as factors and Baseline HbA1c as a continuous covariate. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 26 - The FPG test measures blood sugar levels after the participant has not eaten (fasted) for 12 to 14 hours. The Baseline FPG value is define as the last non-missing value before the start of treatment. Change from Baseline in FBG was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The LOCF method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement was used to impute the missing measurement. If a participant had missing observation(s) immediately after Baseline, the Baseline observation was not carried forward and was left as missing. Participants were analyzed in a particular treatment week if they had received at least one dose in that treatment week.

      <outcome>Plasma Concentrations (Conc.) of Albiglutide at Week 8 and Week 16 - Sparse population pharmacokinetic (PK) data were collected for population PK and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses. Participants (par.) who received albiglutide were initiated on a 30 mg weekly dosing regimen. Beginning at Week 4, uptitration of albiglutide was allowed based on glycemic parameters. As such, albiglutide plasma conc. achieved at each sampling time represent a mixed population of par. who received either 30 mg or 50 mg weekly for various durations. The PK and PK/PD of albiglutide were characterized using a population modeling approach. Mean albiglutide plasma conc. observed at Weeks 8 and 16 are presented. Par. came to the clinic at Weeks 8 and 16 without taking albiglutide/matching placebo. The pre-dose PK sample was taken immediately prior to dosing. The Week 8 post-dose sample was taken between Weeks 8 and 10, &gt;=2 days after a dose of medication. The Week 16 post-dose PK sample was taken any time between Weeks 16 and 20, &gt;=2 days after the previous dose of albiglutide.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8 Pre-dose (immediately prior to dose), Week 8 Post-dose (at least 2 days after a dose of medication), Week 16 Pre-dose (immediately prior to dose), and Week 16 Post-dose (at least 2 days after previous dose of albiglutide)</timepoint>

    <summary>This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a
      weekly dose of albiglutide as compared with sitagliptin. Subjects who are renally impaired
      with a historical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus and whose glycemia is inadequately
      controlled on their current regimen of diet and exercise or their antidiabetic therapy of
      metformin, thiazolidinedione, sulfonylurea, or any combination of these oral antidiabetic
      medications will be recruited into the study.</summary>
