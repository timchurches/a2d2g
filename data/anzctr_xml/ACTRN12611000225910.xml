  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mental Health Workers are at high risk of experiencing aggression from their patients or clients. A previous survey found an association between communication style and experiencing aggression.
We aim to develop a communication skills package for community mental health workers, and then test this against usual team support to see if the rate of patient aggression decreases.</summary>
