    <scientifictitle>For patients with liver disease, is HepaFat Scan as accurate (ie has equal or better sensitivity and specificity) as liver biopsy for measuring liver fat?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>HepaFat Scan is a magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis product to facilitate the non invasive quantification of fat within the liver. 

The technology is based on gradient recalled echo imaging using the technique of Dixon et al. However, several novel changes have been made to this established method to enable HepaFat Scan to provide greater degrees of sensitivity and specificity in measuring liver fat than other available methods.

This will be a retrospective study using existing demographic, clinical and MRI image data (obtained between March 2009 and December 2011 and available in institutional databases) from 10 subjects without liver disease (healthy controls) and up to eighty (80) patients with liver disease. Neither patients nor healthy control subjects are required to undergo any additional procedures or MRI scans.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each study participant will have undergone an MRI scan to acquire the image data required for HepaFat Scan as well as a liver biopsy as part of a previous study. The amount of fat that is shown to be present in the liver using the results from HepaFat Scan will be compared to the results of the liver biopsy.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure the diagnostic performance of HepaFat Scan to grade liver fat when a reference standard based on quantitative computer assisted morphometric image analysis of histological sections is used instead of a histopathologist's visual assessment.</outcome>
