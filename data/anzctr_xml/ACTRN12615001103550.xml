  <interventions>
    <interventions>Daily probiotic Supplementation for 8 weeks. The supplement is in the form of a powder (2g twice daily) to be mixed with water and consumed orally. 

The supplement composition is as follows: Maize starch, Maltodextrins, Bacterial strains (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Lactobacillus acidophilus W55, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus salivarius W57 and Lactococcus lactis W58 - &gt;1x10^9 cfu/g) Vitamin B2 and Biotin. 

Compliance will be encouraged with a daily checklist and monitored by supplementation return at the end of the intervention period. </interventions>

      <outcome>Change in degree of nasal congestion. This will be measured with through Nasal Rhinomanometry. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The symptoms of Allergic rhinitis, such as nasal congestion and itching, are a burden for an estimated 3.2 million Australians and its prevalence is increasing. There is growing evidence to suggest that probiotic supplementation elicits beneficial health effects on the host through modulation of the immune system and thereby can improve symptoms associated with Allergic rhinitis. The aim of this research is to examine the effect of probiotic supplementation on symptoms and quality of life in individuals suffering from Allergic rhinitis</summary>
