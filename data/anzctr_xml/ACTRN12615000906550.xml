  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will consume 210mL of inorganic beetroot juice per day:
-Two 70mL bottles of inorganic beetroot juice
-One 70mL bottle of sport inorganic beetroot juice) 
Beetroot juice is sourced from :BEET IT shot, James White Drinks, Ipswich, UK

Participants will consume the the sport shot in the morning, and  one of each of the other two bottles midday and at night. The sport shot contains approximately 6.4mmol of nitrate and each organic shot contains approximately 4.8mmol of nitrate per bottle, with a total daily dosing of 16mmol nitrate.

Participants will be required to have at least 7 days of supplementation with the beetroot juice, but depending on subject availability, the total days dosing could vary between subjects. One subject might have availability to complete all round 1 testing visits within a week, whereas another subject could require a week and a half to complete all visits. Previous research does not indicate any further benefits of nitrate dosing beyond 6 days, so we do not expect the total days dosing to affect the study outcome providing all subjects meet the minimum of 7 days supplementation.

Following supplementation, subjects will undergo a minimum of two week wash-out period.

Adherence will be managed by reminder phone calls to subjects during the supplementation period. They will also be asked to keep a record of when they consumed the supplement. and return the empty bottles to the research team.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will consume 140mL (two 70mL bottles) of the placebo beetroot juice twice per day for 7-10 days.
 
The placebo has been specifically manufactured  by James White Drinks, Ipswich, UK, to be identical to the active drink, with the only difference between the two being that the placebo has been made inactive by removing the nitrate. 

The study employs a  cross-over design so all participants will supplement with both the beetroot juice and the placebo, with the order of supplementation randomized, and the dosing remaining double-blinded.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The project will be double-blind, with the only un-blinded person being someone who is not directly involved in the collection of data. This individual will color code the placebo and beetroot juice bottles so that only he/she is aware of the color link to the active verse inactive treatment. In this way both the subjects and the research team involved in testing will be blinded to the treatment order.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer generated coding software will be used to randomly allocate participants to group one or group two.

This study is a double-blind crossover design, so all participants will undergo both the treatment and placebo intervention, but in a randomized order. Group 1 will supplement with placebo (PL) for the first week followed by a washout and then beetroot (BTR) juice supplementation. Group 2 will begin with BTR supplementation followed by a washout period and then placebo supplementation. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods> The primary endpoint is exercise capacity during the maximal CPX. A repeated measure ANOVA will be used to determine the time × group effect and paired t-tests will be used to determine whether time to exhaustion is greater compared to baseline within each group.  Similar analyses will be performed on the secondary endpoints/variables listed in the Specific Aims.  Post-hoc comparisons of change scores for relevant variables between HFpEF and HFrEF will be performed.

This is a pilot study, and the results will be used to develop power calculations for a large double blind randomized controlled trial. An important goal of the pilot study is to examine feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention. A samples size of 15 patients in each group, or 30 in total, was determined as this is a realistic number of patients that can be recruited from a single site within the time frame of the study.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate if 7 days of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation (beetroot juice) versus placebo in a randomized, double blind, cross-over design, can improve exercise tolerance in heart failure (HF) patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, n=15) and with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, n=15). 

The testing protocols are designed to investigate the oxygen consumption system at multiple levels that may mediate exercise performance. These include assessments during exercise of gas exchange, cardiac function, VO2kinetics, skeletal tissue oxygen extraction and nitric oxide metabolism. 

Additional resting measures of vascular function and stiffness, tissue perfusion and mitochondrial function (biopsy) will be performed. 

The hypothesis of this proposal is that in subjects with HFpEF and HFrEF, regular consumption of beetroot juice for 7-10 days will produce a clinical benefit in exercise tolerance (increase in VO2peak and time to exhaustion) versus a placebo.
