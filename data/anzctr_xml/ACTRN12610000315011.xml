  <interventions>
    <interventions>Four preloads will be administered in a single-blind, randomised fashion. All will comprise of varying quantities of conventional pasta, or high-protein pasta ( for the High Protein preload), with a tomato-based (Leggos (Registered Trademark), neopolitana pasta sauce and yoghurt (Yoplait (Registered Trademark) french vanilla dessert. Whey protein isolate (Pure Nutrition Australia) will be used to increase the protein, cream to increase the fat, and sugar and cornflour to increase the carbohydrate content of the different test meals. 
The high protein preload will contain 89g of protein, 22g of fat and 55g of carbohydrate, the medium protein will contain 55g of protein, 33g of fat and 37g of carbohydrate, the high carbohydrate/low protein meal with contain 12g of protein, 28g of fat and 60g of carbohydrate and the high fat meal will contain 16g of protein, 55g of fat and 30g of carbohydrate.
Each subject will consume each of the of the four preloads, once, on four seperate study days (at t=0). They will remain in the department for a further 180 minutes at which point they will be presented with a cold buffet meal (used to determine energy intake). Each study visit will be separated by 3-7days.
The buffet meal, used to determine energy intake, will consist of:
4 slices of wholemeal bread (Sunblest (Registered Trademark))
4 slices of white bread (Sunblest (Registered Trademark))
100g of deli leg ham (Woolworths)
100g of chicken roll shaved (Woolworths)
4 slices of Coon Tasty (Registered Trademark) cheese slices 
100g of tomato
100g continental cucumber
100g iceberg lettuce
600ml of water
300ml of Daily Juice (Registered Trademark) unsweetened orange juice
375ml of Farmers Union (Registered Trademark) iced coffee
200g of Yogo (Registered Trademark) chocolate custard
200g of Yoplait (Registered Trademark) strawberry yoghurt
150g Goulburn Valley (Registered Trademark) fruit salad
1 medium red delicious apple
1 medium banana
25g Flora (Registered Trademark) margarine

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After a phone interview subjects will be invited to visit the Discipline of Medicine, University of Adelaide for a screening visit. Potential subject's height and weight will be measured and they will be required to complete a Three Factor Eating questionnaire to assess for the degree of eating restraint. Subjects will provide written informed consent prior to inclusion. As this is a within subjects design (i.e a crossover study) each subject is required to receive each of the treatments. Subjects will recieve each treatment in a randomised order which was generated by primary investigator. This same investigator prepared the meals and provided them to the subjects. Therefore allocation was not concealed to the investigator. Subjects were blinded to which meal they were receiving.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomisation table was generated, using www.randomization.com,  to determine the order in which subjects received the four different preload treatments.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are a number of dietary approaches, including restriction of total energy or fat, or increasing dietary protein and reducing carbohydrate to try and induce weight loss. Protein is commonly believed to be the most satiating macronutrient, however no studies have investigated the effects of protein in an oral preload on satiety and energy intake, taking into consideration the daily energy requirements of individual subjects. Therefore the purpose of the study is to compare the effects of high-fat, high-carbohydrate and high-protein oral preloads and the effects of increasing amounts of protein in an oral preload on gastrointestinal hormone secretion, appetite and energy intake in lean and overweight subjects.</summary>
