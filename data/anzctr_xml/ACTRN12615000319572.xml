    <concealment>Pregnant women at term (37-42 weeks) will be recruited from the Pregnancy Assessment and Observation Unit, Antenatal clinic or Antenatal Wards at the Mater Mothers’ Hospital, Raymond Terrace, Brisbane, QLD, Australia. 
Women with singleton pregnancies who are admitted in early labour (&lt;4cm dilated) with regular uterine contractions OR women prior to induction of labour will be approached to participate in this study. The aim is to recruit women who have had apparently “normal” low risk pregnancies who will deliver within 72 hours of recruitment. 
Participants will be given the Participant Information sheet  and encouraged to ask question. Participants will then be required to sign a consent form. 
Information about the maternal age, ethnicity, parity, booking blood pressure, gestation at onset of labour, body mass index, history of smoking, pre-existing maternal medical disorders, history of previous fetal growth restriction, stillbirth or neonatal death will be recorded on a pro-forma sheet.
At recruitment, all participants will have an ultrasound scan to measured fetal biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length thereby allowing an estimated fetal weight to be calculated. Doppler assessment of several fetal vessels and cardiac function as well as maternal uterine Doppler indices and vessel diameters (Pulsatility index, Resistance index and maximum velocity) will be recorded. The amniotic fluid index will also be measured. The entire ultrasound assessment should not take longer than 30-40 mins. In addition these women will have a blood sample (10ml) taken for measurement of placental growth factor (PlGF) levels. 
After the ultrasound, the participant will be computer randomised to either Sildenafil or placebo. The first dose of sildenafil or placebo will be administered when the woman is transferred to the Birth Suite for management of labour. The dose of Sildenafil will be 50mg taken orally every 8 hours for a maximum of 24 hours (total dose 150mg. ie 3 doses only). Both the active drug and the placebo will be provided by the Pharmacy department at the Mater Mothers’ Hospital in sealed opaque envelopes in sequential order of computer generated randomisation. Allocation will be concealed. Following the first dose of either Sildenafil or placebo a repeat ultrasound scan will be performed within 2-4 hours to assess fetal cardiac function and blood flow in various fetal vessels (umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery and ductus venosus) as well as the maternal uterine arteries. The second scan should not take longer than 20 mins to perform.  
Clinicians managing the pregnancy will be blinded as to the results of the ultrasound scan and the blood tests to ensure that the care these women receive is not influenced by the results. After delivery, case notes for all participants will be reviewed, and intra-partum and neonatal outcomes collected.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation was based on our previous data which showed that the incidence of emergency caesarean section for fetal compromise in the cohort of fetuses with a CU ratio &lt;10th centile was approximately 36% (Prior et al 2013). If sildenafil was successful in halving the rate of caesarean section in this cohort to 18%, a total sample size of 910 women (80% power, alpha of 0.05) would be required. Assuming a 10% drop out rate, a sample of 1000 woman should be sufficient to adequately address the research objectives.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Labour is perhaps the most hazardous time in pregnancy for the fetus. Uterine contractions can contribute to more than a halving of blood flow to the uterus and placenta and this in turn may lead to fetal distress. In most pregnancies, the placental blood supply and function is adequate but it may not be sufficient to tolerate the extra demands of labour. Up to 63% of babies who become distressed and suffer oxygen deprivation in labour have no prior risk factors. Furthermore, events in labour account for as many as 20% of cases of cerebral palsy in term infants. Recent research demonstrates that the changes in blood flow to the fetus can be detected by ultrasound and that these changes are highly predictive of identifying fetuses at risk of becoming distressed in labour, as well as reliably excluding those that were not at risk.
With this in mind, investigating ways to preserve and promote the blood supply and in turn, the oxygenation to the fetus has the potential to significantly change intrapartum care. Sildenafil is a vasodilator (opens blood vessels) and based on previous research may play a role in enhancing blood flow to the fetus.
This clinical trial will investigate if having sildenafil in labour improves the blood flow to the fetus and reduces the need for caesarean for fetal distress. </summary>
