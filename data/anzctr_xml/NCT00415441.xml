  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a physiotherapy program reduces pain and
      improves disability and quality-of-life in people with chronic shoulder pain.

      The main study hypotheses are that (i) A 10-week physiotherapy treatment will result in
      significantly greater reductions in pain and disability than placebo treatment in individuals
      with chronic shoulder pain (ii) Improvements in pain and disability following a 10-week
      physiotherapy treatment will be maintained at a 3-month follow-up.</summary>
