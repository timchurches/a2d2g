    <interventions>This project aimed to identify the validity of the diagnosis of dementia via Videoconference (VC). 
All patients were assessed independently by two specialist physicians.  They were allocated one face-to-face (FTF) assessment (Standard Clinical Practice) and an additional assessment (a VC assessment) on the same day.  The order of assessment, both doctor and format, was randomized.  Each physician had access to the patient chart and the results of a battery of standardised cognitive assessments administered FTF by the clinic nurse.  
For VC assessment, the patient was shown to a clinic room by the nurse and introduced to the specialist physician via video.  All paired assessments occurred on the same day.  The protocol excluded any physical examination for both study arms, other than observation of gait and other evident physical features.
Patients cognitive function was defined in accordance with the DSM-IV diagnosis of dementia (290.0-294.8), by the following three mutually exclusive options: Normal cognitive function (No evidence of impairment meeting any  of the criteria related to DSM-IV cognitive disorder); Cognitive impairment no dementia (Evidence of impairment meeting some, but not all, DSM-IV criteria for dementia, including amnestic disorder and cognitive impairment not otherwise specified ); or Dementia meeting DSM-IV criteria (all criteria meet).
No specific time limit is stipulated for the assessments, but the assessment process is to be carried out during usual clinic days so in general the assessment (eithe face-to-face or via video conference), should be approimately 60 minutes.  
All assessments are to occur on the same day (with no minimum, maximum number of hours between assessments). If the second assessment can not be completed on the same day the patient is then excluded.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The outcome of interest was the difference in percentage agreement (Po) between paired assessments of the video arm (VC thenFTF (VF)/FTF then VC (FV)) and the standard clinical practice arm (FTF then FTF (FF)), for the question: Does the patient have dementia? scored as -Normal Cognition(0); Cognitive Impairment not meeting DSMIV Criteria for dementia(1); and Yes, Meeting DSM-IV Criteria for dementia(2).  A non-inferiority study tests whether the percentage agreement between clinicians in an intervention arm (FV/VF) does not lie beyond the lower limit of an acceptable range (a one-tailed area of clinical indifference) when compared with the standard clinical practice arm (FF).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Agreement of classification of diagnostic sub-type.  After the doctor has identified the presence or absence of dementia, they are asked to identify the sub-type of dementia, if dementia was present. For example, was it Alzheimer's Dementia, or vascular dementia, etc.  This is especially challenging at a first assessment as more information may be required before a formal diagnosis including diagnositic sub-type can be made.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of further investigative or management options (such as additional investigations, medication recommendations or allied health referral).  This information was identified through the recommendations or referrals indicated as necessary on the data colleciton sheet by each doctor at the conclusion of the assessment.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The contribution of physical examination to the diagnosis of dementia via VC.  following the initial assessment and the completion of the data collection form, one doctor was asked to complete a physical examination of the patient. this occurred in person. the doctor was then asked to complete a second data collection form answering the same questions as previously (diagnosis, type). They were also asked to indicate if there were any changes to the diagnosis, investigations or management of the patient in relation to matters of cognition, and non-cognitive issues.</outcome>

    <concealment>The activities for the day at the memory clinic were described to the patient and the carer. They were provided with a verbal explanation of the study and given written material.  Patient and carer were given time to talk privately about the study. They were then asked if they would like to participate. Written consent was obtained from the patient or the carer. They were advised that they could withdraw at any time during the day.
After consent, a numbered sealed opaque envelope was opened and the patient was allocated to format of interview and which doctor would see the patient based on the random number allocation in the envelope. Doctors were then informed who they were to assess and the format of interview.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was carried out using a balanced block randomisation code which was generated by a qualified statistician (EB) using an electronic random number generator, stratified according to study arm (Standard Clinical Practice; Video), order of interview format (FTF or VC first), order of physician assessment (Physician 1, Physician 2 for first or second interview) and blocked (N=8) according to clinic site; assignments were concealed in opaque, sealed envelopes that were numbered consecutively within each stratum.</sequence>

    <summary>BACKGROUND:  The suitability of video conferencing (VC) technology for clinical purposes relevant to geriatric medicine is still being established.  
OBJECTIVES:  This project aimed to identify the validity of the diagnosis of dementia via VC. 
DESIGN: This was a multi-site, non-inferiority, prospective cohort study.   All patients were assessed independently by two specialist physicians.  They were allocated one FTF assessment (Standard Clinical Practice) and an additional assessment (either standard FTF assessment or a VC assessment) on the same day.  The order of assessment, both doctor and format, was randomized.  Each physician had access to the patient chart and the results of a battery of standardised cognitive assessments administered FTF by the clinic nurse.  
SETTING:  Four Memory Disorders Clinics.
PATIENTS:  Patients, aged 50 years and over, referred by their GP for cognitive assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Percentage agreement (P0) and the weighted kappa statistic with linear weight (Kw) were used to assess interrater reliability across the two study arms on the diagnosis of dementia (cognition normal, impaired or demented). 
RESULTS: Of 270 eligible patients, 210 underwent randomisation, with a final sample of 205 available for analysis: Videoconference Group (n=100) or Control Group (n=105).  106 were male.  The average age was 76 (SD9, 51-95) and the average Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination Score was 23.9 (SD4.7, 9-30).  Agreement for the Videoconference Group (PO= 0.71; kw = 0.52; p&lt;0.0001) and agreement for the Control Group (PO= 0.70; kW = 0.50; p&lt;0.0001) were both statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).  The summary kappa statistic of 0.51 (p=0.84) indicated that VC was not inferior to FTF assessment.
LIMITATIONS: This study included a range of experienced and relatively newly qualified specialist physicians for the paired assessments. 
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of dementia was reliable when assessed by VC.</summary>
