  <interventions>
    <interventions>In partnership with CSIRO, a mobile-based disease monitoring system (MDMS) has been developed for people with diabetes (MDMS- Diabetes). This system was modelled on a highly successful CSIRO platform that supports in-home cardiac rehabilitation which resulted in improvements in adherence and clinical outcomes .   This platform has been modified to enable real time monitoring of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes, and support patient care. The system comprises an app for iOS (Apple) and Android based smartphones, and a web-based clinical portal. The mobile app enables participants to use a Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter (AVIVA Connect, Roche) to automatically upload their BGL readings to the clinical portal. The mobile app also provides an insulin diary that allows participants to manually enter their insulin injections dose and time, along with free text comment for each dose (e.g. "before dinner"). These data are subsequently transmitted and uploaded to the clinical portal via a mobile internet connection such as Wi-Fi, 3G or 4G. The clinical portal presents the uploaded data in graphical and tabular formats, for the DNEs and endocrinologists to monitor and manage a patient's condition. Integrated alerts, which can be customised by clinicians, highlight out of range measures. Patients receive individual, computer generated alerts based on the frequency of BGL testing and BGL values.  Individual patient screens enable a review of progress in advance of conventional outpatient encounters or in the course of telephone consultations. Through the portal, the clinicians can review the participants BGL data, insulin dosages, and send messages to the participants mobile phones. A summary of their diabetes care is also displayed based on the clinical information entered. 

Using the MRMS platform, an alternative model of outpatient service delivery has been designed at Princess Alexandra Hospital , which incorporates the following elements: 
1. Short or long-term monitoring of BGL, insulin dosage using the MRMS. 
2. Targeting of intensive MRMS use to patients with suboptimal control. 
3. Computer generated alerts sent to patient via text message. 
4. Patient input before each clinic visit via online survey
5. Substitution of conventional in-person follow-up consultations with telephone or video-consultations

The participants will be followed up for 12 months. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will have routine care provided by the endocrinology staff. The control group will be provided with standard glucose meters if their current glucose meter is more than 2 years old and followed up as per current model of care. 

The current model of diabetes care at a tertiary hospital, the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH), entails regular outpatient clinic visits to access a multidisciplinary team led by an endocrinologist. The interval between patient visits is determined by an endocrinologist - based on glycaemic control and comorbidities. This can vary between 4 weeks to 6 months. Typically, a person with an HbA1c over 8% would be reviewed within 3 months. Visits may involve patients travelling for long distances; prolonged wait times at the clinic and absence from their workplace. Access to BGL data is often mediated through patient provided paper records, or data dumps from a variety of commercial glucose meters. This process can be unreliable and inefficient.     Patients with sub-optimal glycaemic control often require insulin dose adjustment.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>It is a pilot pragmatic RCT. A sample size estimation to show a mean difference of HbA1c of 0.5% between the two arms with a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05 using the Students t test revealed that we would require 124 participants in each arm (SD of 1.4). Recruitment of this number of patients was considered unfeasible. We will recruit 44 patients with 20 patients in each arm ( allowing for an attrition rate of 10%). This sample size of 20 was selected on the basis of previous studies. 

Statistical analysis will be done using Stata 15 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). Primary analyses will be based on intention to treat . A per protocol analysis will also be done. Differences between groups at baseline and the endpoint will be compared using either the Students t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate.  Differences in repeated measurements will be compared using Mixed-effects Model,  adjusting for any significant explanatory variables.  A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 

A subgroup analysis of the participants new to the service and on insulin shall be carried out. Participants who are on insulin might require dose adjustments and thus might use the MRMS to interact with health care providers more often.  Participants being referred to the specialist diabetes service might have different characteristics to the diabetes patients, already known to the service, with sub-optimal control despite specialist input.

An economic analysis will be undertaken from the perspective of the healthcare system and patient perspective. The research costs will be excluded from this analysis so that the intervention group can be compared to a usual care group. This enables results to be generalised beyond a research setting. We will collect data to accurately record costs at the patient and health care provider levels. Cost data will include time required to train patients by the staff regarding the glucose meter and software. The outcome data as outlined above will enable both cost-efficacy and cost-utility analyses to be performed.  Sensitivity analyses will enable these estimates to be adjusted for expected cost reductions associated with increased use and price reduction as the technology improves. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current service model for specialist diabetes care is based in a tertiary setting and involves care by a multidisciplinary team led by the endocrinologist. Continuation of conventional approaches with unchanged outcomes will require dramatic and potentially unaffordable expansion of current services to meet the increasing demand.

The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the clinical efficacy of a new model of care employing mHealth (mobile Health) intervention in diabetes patients with suboptimal
glycaemic control attending an outpatient specialist clinic as compared to usual care. This study follows on from a proof of concept and feasibility of mobile-based remote monitoring for stabilisation of insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes.

Mobilehealth (Use of mobile technology like smartphone in health care management) create an opportunity to redesign outpatient services and meet unmet demands of existing healthcare. Collaboration between Diabetes and Endocrinology Department at Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH), the UQ Centre for Online Health and the CSIRO has led to the development of a mobile-based remote monitoring system to support the management of complex outpatient diabetes patients. This system utilises a Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter to automatically transfer blood glucose levels to a clinician dashboard via an application installed on the patients smartphone. This will enable the endocrinologist/diabetes nurse to remotely monitor blood glucose levels and communicate with the patient in real time. The clinical data shall only be reviewed at set times decided by the clinician or on patient request and will not be continuously monitored. Patients receive individual alerts based on the frequency of BGL testing and BGL values. Individual patient screens enable a review of progress in advance of conventional outpatient encounters or during telephone consultations. 

Type 2 diabetes patients attending the outpatient diabetes clinic at the PAH shall be invited to attend. They shall be randomised to the intervention or control group with both groups followed up for a year. Control group shall receive routine care. The intervention group shall use the mobile-based remote monitoring system. Based on the data received in the intervention group, the endocrinologist in liaison with the patient shall decide to substitute scheduled face to face clinic consultation with virtual clinics ( via videoconference
or telephone at home) if required. They will be required to get recommended pathology tests before their consultation as per routine practice. The patients have the option to enter via an online survey, relevant details before their intended clinic appointment.  

The participants will be followed for 12 months. We expect the new model of care will improve diabetes-related clinical outcomes, with improvement in patient and health care provider satisfaction at similar or lower costs. </summary>
