  <interventions>
    <interventions>Family day care educators and the coordinating staff (the latter refered to as field workers) will both receive the Thrive 
program. The Thrive program includes 3 workshops for field workers and family day care educators (2 hours each; delivered over a one month period), monthly activity exchanges with other educators (1-2 hours) and focused discussion on social and emotional wellbeing during field worker monthy visits (1 hour). The intervention group will also receive resources associated with the workshops on promoting childrens social and emotional wellbeing.  The intervention will be delivered over a 12 month period.</interventions>
    <comparator>The intervention group will receive the Thrive Program over a 12-month period, during which time the control group will continue to deliver care as per standard practice (ie continue to provide regulated care for children and to attend professional development as per requirements). The intervention program will be delivered to the intervention group and then to the control group after a delay of 15 months from start of the intervention in the active group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is family day care educators' knowledge about children's social and emotional wellbeing. In the absence of any existing relevant items, new items have had to be developed to measure this construct, including general questions of "How would you rate your knowledge about children's social and emotional wellbeing", and "How would you rate your knowledge of who to contact if you are worried about the social and emotional wellbeing of a child in your care?" (Scale 0-10 with 0= almost no knowledge, 10=very knowledgeable). More specific questions about risk and protective factors of mental health are asked in open-ended format and are specific to child age (under 5 years, primary school age).</outcome>
      <timepoint>A baseline survey assessing knowledge about childrens social and emotional wellbeing will be conducted with all consenting educators and field workers (n=~70). The survey will also be administered at one-month, six-months and 12-months post-intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes include educator confidence and skills in promoting children's social and emotional wellbeing. In the absence of pre-existing and relevant survey items on confidence in promoting children's social and emotional wellbeing, new items have been developed to measure this construct. Confidence is measured by four self-report questions "Overall how confident are you in your ability to promote children's social and emotional wellbeing?", "How confident are you in your ability to identify children's social and emotional problems?", "How confident are you in talking with parents about promoting their children's social and emotional wellbeing?" and "How confident are you in talking with parents about potential problems with their children's social and emotional wellbeing?" (Scale 0-10 with 0= not confident, 10= very confident).</outcome>
      <timepoint>A baseline survey will be conducted with all consenting educators and field workers (n=~70). The survey will also be administered at one-months, six-months and 12-months post-intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skills in promoting children's social and emotional wellbeing are measured in the survey by asking about the participant's daily activities (using items from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children) and by asking for a description of their FDC practice: "Please tell us about the ways you promote the social and emotional wellbeing of children in your care?" 

Skills in promoting social and emotional wellbeing are also assessed by objectively measuring quality of care. Quality of the FDC environment will be assessed through observations carried out at baseline and one month, six month and 12-months post-intervention by a trained  researcher using the Family Child Care Environment Rating Scale Revised Edition (FCCERS-R) and the Caregiver Interaction Scale (CIS). The FCCERS-R has 38 items in 7 subscales. Four subscales (24 items) will be used in this study specific to mental health: personal care routines; listening and talking; activities; and interactions. Each item is scored from 1 (inadequate) to 7 (excellent). The FCCERS-R has high inter-observer reliability (0.83-0.90) and moderate to high internal consistency for the subscales (0.70-0.93). 

The CIS has 26 items divided into four subscales that measure sensitivity, harshness, detachment and permissiveness of caregivers in the childhood care/education environment. Items are scored from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (very much true). It has a moderate to high inter-observer reliability (0.75-0.97) and high internal  subscale consistency (0.81-0.91). In this study, we expect to see improvements in the four subscales of the FCCERS-R and in the CIS, reductions in harshness and detachment and improvements in the sensitivity subscales. The total time commitment for the observation is ~ two hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A baseline survey will be conducted with all consenting educators and field workers (n=~70). The survey will also be administered at one-months, six-months and 12-months post-intervention commencement. All educators will also have an in-home quality-of-care assessment at baseline, one month, six month and 12-months post-intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Organisational mental health promotion will be assessed using a mental health promotion audit. This audit, which assesses organisational structure, workforce development, resource allocation and leadership will be completed by the scheme manager. The interview is expected to take around 30-45 minutes.  Example items include How is promoting childrens social and emotional wellbeing incorporated in to your fieldwork and management roles? Have fieldworkers, educators undertaken any professional development specific to promoting childrens social and emotional wellbeing? How available and easy to access is information about promoting childrens social and emotional wellbeing?"</outcome>
      <timepoint>The audit will be completed at baseline, and 6 month and 12 month post-intervention commencement.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Childhood mental health problems are highly prevalent, experienced by one in five children living in low socioeconomic families. Although childcare settings, including family day care are ideal to promote childrens social and emotional wellbeing at a population level in a sustainable way, family day care educators receive limited training in promoting childrens mental health. This study is an exploratory wait-list control cluster randomised controlled trial to test the appropriateness, acceptability, cost, and effectiveness of Thrive, an intervention program to build the capacity of Family Day Care educators to promote childrens social and emotional wellbeing.  Thrive aims to increase educators knowledge, confidence and skills in promoting childrens social and emotional wellbeing. 

A capacity building intervention in child mental health promotion for Family Day Care is an essential contribution to research, policy and practice. This initiative is the first internationally, and essential in building an evidence base of interventions in this extremely policy-timely setting.</summary>
