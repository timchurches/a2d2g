  <interventions>
    <interventions>Endodermal injection (Dermal scarification) of 1ml normal saline at the area of the pain reflection. The injection is administered in participants once only at 8-10 different points intradermally (between the layers of dermis).</interventions>
    <comparator>A single intramuscular injection of 75ml of diclofenac sodium

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intramuscular injection of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is the conventional treatment for renal colic. The most com-monly used NSAID for this purpose is diclofenac sodium. In this study we attempt to investigate the effectiveness of an alternative method in the treatment of renal colic, the endodermal injection (Dermal Scarification) of 1ml normal saline at the area of the pain reflection. This technique is not strictly defined and seems to be based on the principles of acupuncture. The method of application and the success of this treatment were orally transferred from older to younger urologists.</summary>
