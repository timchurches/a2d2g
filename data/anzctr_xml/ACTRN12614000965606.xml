  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two types of central venous access devices (CVADs) are central venous catheters (CVCs) which are inserted centrally into the veins on the neck and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) which are inserted via veins in the arms. Both CVC and PICC lines have been developed that are coated with antiseptics or antibiotics, referred to as anti-infective lines.
The frequency and duration of the intervention device is from catheter insertion (time zero), until catheter removal or as no longer needed or patient death or catheter failure. Catheter failure is a composite endpoint including any line complication resulting in removal or exchange of the line.  Failure then may include failure as a result of infection (CLABSI), catheter blockage necessitating removal or exchange, catheter associated venous thromboembolism , catheter dislodgement, and phlebitis. 


All participants recruited will be randomised to one of three arms:

* group 1 (Anti-infective CVC) The Cook 'Registered Trademark'Spectrum 'Registered Trademark'Minocycline+Rifampin Impregnated CVC
* group 2 (Anti-infective PICC) The Cook Spectrum'Registered Trademark' Minocycline+Rifampin Impregnated PICC
* group 3 (Standard PICC) The Cook 'Registered Trademark'PICC
</interventions>
    <comparator>(Anti-infective CVC) The Cook'Registered Trademark' Spectrum 'Registered Trademark' Minocycline+Rifampin Impregnated CVC.

* group 1 (Anti-infective CVC) The Cook 'Registered Trademark'Spectrum 'Registered Trademark'Minocycline+Rifampin Impregnated CVC
* * group 3 (Standard PICC) The Cook 'Registered Trademark'PICC

Group 1, is the anti-infective central venous catheter (CVC), the difference to the intervention is that it is inserted via the veins in the neck. 
Group 3, is the standard peripherally inserted central catheter is inserted  the veins in the arm (which is different to group 1 but the same as the intervention), and the difference to the intervention  is that this catheter is not coated with anti-infective agents.

The frequency and duration of the intervention device is from catheter insertion (time zero), until catheter removal or as no longer needed or patient death or catheter failure. Catheter failure is a composite endpoint including any line complication resulting in removal or exchange of the line.  Failure then may include failure as a result of infection (CLABSI), catheter blockage necessitating removal or exchange, catheter associated venous thromboembolism , catheter dislodgement, and phlebitis.

    <statisticalmethods>Power analysis has not been performed as this study is pilot study to obtain preliminary results to inform a larger funded study. We aim to recruit 30 patients per group as recommended for pilot studies (Hertzog, 2011).
Data will be analysed using SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS Inc., 2008, Chicago, IL; www.spss.com), Intention-to-treat analysis will be applied. Baseline characteristics of the continuous variables will be expressed as mean +/- standard deviation or median and inter-quartile range, and categorical data will be expressed as percentages.  Continuous variables will be compared using t-tests, whilst categorical variables will be compared using Pearson chi-square tests or Fischers exact tests. Kaplan Meier and Cox regression will be used to compare the failure rates of the anti-infective CVC, anti-infective PICC, and the standard PICC. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will address a significant problem in healthcare which is to provide safe, effective and reliable vascular access when commencing a patient on Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). TPN is used in patients where the gastro-intestinal tract cannot be used for the ingestion, digestion and absorption of essential nutrition. 

Two types of central venous access devices (CVADs) are central venous catheters (CVCs) which are inserted centrally into the veins on the neck and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) which are inserted via veins in the arms.

Both CVCs and PICCs can be associated with central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI), thrombotic complications (thrombosis) and mechanical complications (catheter occlusion, phlebitis). These complications impact on the cost of care, and have the potential to be a life-threatening adverse event. To help combat this problem both CVC and PICC lines have been developed that are coated with antiseptics or antibiotics, referred to as anti-infective lines. 

There are few comparison studies that have analysed the safety and costs of the lines by comparing anti-infective CVCs against anti-infective PICCs in patients that receive TPN. Despite this gap in research, there is an increased use of the PICC line based on perceived time benefit, lower cost and fewer mechanical complications, where there is a lack of scientific evidence to support this choice. 
The main aim of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the failure rates and costs between the patients who receive TPN via an anti-infective CVC line, an anti-infective PICC line, and a standard PICC line.

This feasibility pilot study will be a carried out a single centre. Participants will be patients requiring the insertion of a CVAD for delivery of TPN during the study period that meet the inclusion criteria and sign consent. 
They will be randomised into one of three groups, we aim to recruit 30 patients per group:
* group 1 (Anti-infective CVC) 
* group 2 (Anti-infective PICC) 
* group 3 (Standard PICC) 

The findings will provide a foundation for a larger study to help close the gap in current research by comparing the failure rates and economic costs of anti-infective CVCs with PICCs and anti-infective PICCs and will ultimately lead to the development of a set of criteria to assist the clinician with a choice of CVAD for a patient receiving TPN
