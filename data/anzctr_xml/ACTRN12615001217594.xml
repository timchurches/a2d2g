  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group: Will receive the surgical standard of care for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, consisting of endoscopic iliotibial band release and trochanteric bursectomy

This will be performed under general anaesthesia by the principal investigator, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and will take approximately 30 minutes. There is no need to monitor adherence to this intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group: Participants in this group will only receive advice to continue along their daily lives. They will not receive any other specific treatment. They will be free to seek treatment outside of the trial and this will be recorded on the satisfaction questionnaire. If this treatment outside of the trial consists of surgery, they will be excluded from the trial.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Our hypothesis is that surgical intervention consisting of ITB release and trochanteric bursectomy for recalcitrant GTPS will result in a clinically important improvement in patients pain and function.

We have selected a sample size that will be viable for recruiting from a single surgeon while being powered enough to detect a minimally important difference between groups on the primary outcome measures (Cohens d = 0.6) with an alpha value of 0.05 and a beta value of 0.2. We have assumed a difference of 1.5/10 on VAS, 6/48 on OHS and 15/100 on iHOT33 as being clinically important for these groups and have used this to generate a Cohen's d of 0.6 to get a sample size of 90.

Continuous data such as VAS, OHS, iHOT33 score, age and BMI will be reported in terms of the mean and 95% confidence interval. The means of continuous data between intervention arms will be compared using the t-test.

Dichotomous data such as gender, diabetes and smoking will be compared using the Chi2 test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a parallel randomised controlled trial comparing operative versus nonoperative management for recalcitrant greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). While the majority of cases of GTPS improve significantly or resolve with nonoperative management, there is no evidence that compares operative to nonoperative management when the condition is deemed recalcitrant (after 6 months of symptoms). 

We are looking to investigate the natural history of the condition (what occurs when no treatment is given over a period of time). To do this, we are comparing nonoperative management consisting only of advice to continue your normal daily life with surgical treatment for the condition. Current surgical standard of care for recalcitrant GTPS consists of endoscopic iliotibial band release and trochanteric bursectomy. The study aims to investigate whether surgical intervention leads to reduced pain and improved function compared with continued nonoperative management in the treatment of recalcitrant greater trochanteric pain syndrome.

This study will be conducted as a randomised controlled trial with the control arm receiving advice to continue along their daily life for the period of the trial. The intervention arm will receive the current surgical standard of care, consisting of endoscopic iliotibial band release and trochanteric bursectomy.

Our hypothesis is there will be an improvement in the pain and function in the intervention group receiving the surgery compared to the control group. We are hoping this will result in a change in standard practice for this group of patients, whereby patients with severe recalcitrant GTPS symptoms undergo an appropriate intervention for their pain.

At the end of the trial, any patients with ongoing pain despite the continued non-operative treatment will be offered the surgical treatment if they desire. </summary>
