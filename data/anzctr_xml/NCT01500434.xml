    <interventions>Treatment: devices - PROMUS Element Coronary Stent System
Treatment: drugs - Aspirin
Treatment: drugs - Thienopyridine

Experimental: PROMUS Element - Patients who received the PROMUS Element Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent


Treatment: devices: PROMUS Element Coronary Stent System
PROMUS Element is a device/drug combination product composed of two components, a device (coronary stent system including a platinum chromium stent platform) and a drug product (a formulation of everolimus contained in a polymer coating).

Treatment: drugs: Aspirin
Patients are required to take aspirin indefinitely after stent implant. It is recommended that aspirin 162-325 mg daily be given for at least 6 months after stent placement and that aspirin 75-162 mg daily be given indefinitely thereafter.

Treatment: drugs: Thienopyridine
Patients must be treated with one of the following thienopyridines for at least 6 months following the index procedure: clopidogrel 75 mg daily; or ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily; or prasugrel (outside the United States and if approved at the time of the procedure). If used, the prescribed dose should be in accordance with approved country-specific labeling. In patients not at high risk of bleeding, thienopyridine treatment should continue for at least 12 months after stent implant.

          -  Patient has protected left main coronary artery disease and a target lesion in the LAD
             or LCX

          -  Patient has an additional clinically significant lesion(s) in target vessel for which
             an intervention within 12 months after the index procedure is likely to be required

          -  Patient has 2 target lesions in the same vessel that are separated by less than 15 mm
             (by visual estimate) Note: Multiple focal stenoses will be considered as a single
             lesion if they can be completely covered with 1 stent.</exclusivecriteria>
