  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an encapsulated kiwifruit extract, extracted via a water extraction process from Actinidia deliciosa (from both the skin and flesh).  It contains an excipient maltodextrin.  The daily dosage will be 1,000mg (2 x 500mg; morning and evening) taken orally with food.  This will be taken for a period of 21 days. 
A washout period will take place inbetween the intervention (21day) blocks.  The washout period will be a minimum of 3 weeks and a maximum of 9 weeks.  The washout period will be determined by the participant and when they are able to complete each leg of the study over the study.   Capsule count for complience assessment will conducted after 21days.  Telephone follow up at 1week and 2week of treatment.  Daily assessment of bowel habits by participant self report diary.  
Capsules will be labelled A or B (treatment or placebo) by NZ Extracts Ltd.

Arm One - Treatment A or Treatment B
Arm Two - Washout period (break) minimum of 3 weeks and maximum of 9 weeks
Arm Three - Treatment A or Treatment B (crossover)</interventions>
    <comparator>Inert placebo capsules, matched in size and appearance with active capsules.  Placebo contains micro crystalline cellulose.  These will be taken orally with food. This will be taken for a period of 21 days.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis on bowel habit diary to determine increased frequency.  Further statistical analysis of improvment to bowel motion including ease, consistency and volume of passing stools.

We will use estimated power tests for change in number of bowel habits over 3/4 weeks, using a 2 treatment, placebo controlled, cross-over design; based on between group and within group variance and modelling published data from Rush et al 2002, Chan et al 2007, Chang et al 2010;  95% significance with 80% power; ITT analyses of outcomes; estimated to require between 30 to 40 participants to be randomised.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the effect of encapsulated kiwifruit extract on bowel habits, gut comfort, change in faecal microbiota, and quality of life in men and women with self-reported constipation, but otherwise healthy. 
This will be a 2 treatment, double blind, randomised, crossover trial, comparing the active treatment, NZ Extracts encapsulated kiwifruit extract, with a matched placebo.  Each treatment will be administered for a 3 week period, separated by a minimum 3 week washout period. The total trial length will be between 9-15 weeks; allowing for a maximum washout period of 9 weeks.
