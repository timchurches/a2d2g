    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients from renal transplant clincs are approached to participate in the study. A full informed consent process is performed before the subjects give written consent to participate in the study. The person consenting the patient is not aware of the group the participant will be allocated to. The allocation is done by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule at a central administration site in a different department of the hospital.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation and concealment is done by the Pharmacy Department at the Launceston General Hospital according to established protocols. A blocked randomisation is used by using a randomisation table created by a computer software. A stratified allocation is used according to the immunosupressant type the participants are taking.</sequence>
