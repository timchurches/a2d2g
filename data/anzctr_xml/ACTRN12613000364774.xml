They must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and must not have a child two years or under. They must not have sleep apnoea. They will be asked to not take any other products for assisting with sleep during the course of the trial. </exclusivecriteria>

    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation to the three different baseline groups is randomised.
The randomisation was done using a computer program, and a research assistant other than the researcher placed each participant's baseline allocation number into a sealed envelope to conceal it from the researcher and participant until confirmation of study participation. A tthis point, the envelopw is opened such tha tthe individual and investigator are aware which baseline period that individual was randomized to. </concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software www.randomization.com.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Other</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Multiple baseline design</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The results of each case will be looked at using modified Brinley plots to examine each participants baseline measures and then response as the supplement is introduced. Two tailed t- tests will be used to check for significant change across time comparing baseline scores with treatment scores.
The sample size of 15 participants was determined from previous pilot studies using micronutrients, whereby 15 participants was an adequate number to show significant change from pre to post measurements. Our experience with these micronutrients is that they usually have a large effect size, and so 15 is an adequate number to show this change in a pilot study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to look at the effect that a micronutrient formula (vitamins and minerals) has on symptoms of insomnia. Previous research has shown that these nutrients can lower levels of anxiety, stress and intrusive thoughts in participants. Since these symptoms are often reported by insomniacs, it is hypothesised that a reduction in these symptoms may also lead to reduction in symptoms of insomnia.</summary>
