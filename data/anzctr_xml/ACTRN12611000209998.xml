    <interventions>GIRTH: Get Involved Reach Top Health is a healthy lifestyle peer education community based program for men. 

The 12-week program focuses on reducing waist circumference (GIRTH) by encouraging healthy eating, increased physical activity, improved sleep habits and stress management.  Booklets containing straightforward guidelines and recommendations were developed to affect improvements in each of these four principal lifestyle areas. A self-monitoring tool and explanatory booklet are also included to reinforce the messages and recommendations contained in each of the GIRTH lifestyle booklets.

The GIRTH program was delivered to participants by Mens Health Co-ordinators (MHCs) trained as peer-educators. In addition to leading groups through a structured 12-week program of peer-support, the MHCs were also responsible for collecting baseline and follow-up data. The peer educators were trained to collect the data measures.  

The program was trialled in South Australia, Northern Territory and Victoria between August and December 2010. Participants (men aged 18 years and older) were recruited for the program (and study) at free-to-public seminars held by the MHCs.  Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: intervention and control.

The intervention group participants received all the GIRTH education materials and took part in a 12-week structured program of peer-support.  They were asked to meet once a week for approximately an hour to discuss topics on the four principal components of the program - physical activity, healthy eating, good sleep habits and stress management. Other topics specific to mens health such as prostate cancer and testicular cancer were also included. The MHCs used strategies such as brainstorming, group problem solving and goal setting to encourage group interaction and to foster self-discovery on health issues.
 
Pre-and-post test measures were collected at the Enrolment session and during the final program session to enable changes in the parameters measured over the course of the program to be quantified.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group participants received all the GIRTH education materials but did not take part in the 12-week structured program of peer support.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased health self-efficacy.

      <outcome>Change in other chronic disease risk measures - specifically:

1. Change in cholesterol, triglyceride and blood glucose 

The CardioChek PA Analyzer (Polymer Technology Systems, Inc., Indiana USA) testing kit will be used for the blood cholesterol and triglyceride tests.  The Optium Xceed Diabetes Monitoring System (Abbott Diabetes Care, Vic. Aust.) will be used to measure blood glucose levels.

Data will be calculated using the Quetelet index (weight in kilograms and height in meters).

4. Change in Hand Grip Strength

Maximal hand grip strength of both hands will be measured using the  hydraulic handgrip dynamometer Jamar Grip Dynamometer (JAMAR, Model 5030J1; Sammons Preston Roylan, Bolingbrook, IL).

5. Change in Prostate Symptom

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) will be used to assess symptoms of the lower urinary tract. 

6. Change in Erectile Function

The short form of the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIED 5) will be used to evaluate symptoms for erectile dysfunction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 11 weeks</timepoint>

    <sequence>Participants were  then invited to attend an Enrolment Session the following week. On arrival (at the Enrolment Session), the name of each participant was recorded on an Attendance Sheet. Each line on the attendance sheet had a pre-assigned unique code number. As such, once the code number had been allocated to a participant, it became that participant's code number for the duration of the program. A duplicate of each assigned code number was placed in a box and then numbers were drawn to allocate participants into intervention and control groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a significant body of clinical evidence to support the assertion that if men adopt a healthier lifestyle, they experience improvements in health outcomes including: reduced chronic
disease risks (i.e. reduced: waist circumference, weight, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose); reduced urological symptoms (i.e. erectile dysfunction, urinary symptoms); and
improved psycho-social welfare (i.e. reduced depression/anxiety, improved sleep and perceived
quality of life). 

There is less evidence, however, about how to engage and support men in a community setting to adopt and sustain the necessary lifestyle changes  this is our central
focus.

The theoretical basis for the GIRTH program is the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and its construct of self-efficacy. The peer-support program has been constructed around a chronic disease self-management (CDSM) framework to promote participants self-efficacy in relation to physical activity, nutrition, sleep habits and stress management.  Self-management skills are infused at every step of the program to ensure that positive changes are sustainable.</summary>
