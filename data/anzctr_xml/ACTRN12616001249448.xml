  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this project is to characterise how cardiovascular risk factors are currently managed in a cohort of patients who have presented to an emergency department with symptomatic AF. Participants will be recruited from an existing research study (the Home Based Education and Learning Program in Atrial Fibrillation - HELP-AF - ACTRN12611000607976). The HELP-AF study is examining the impact of home based education package delivered by a nurse or pharmacist to participants who have presented to the emergency department, primarily due to atrial fibrillation.  On completion of the HELP-AF study, participants will be invited to participate in this study. Participants will undergo a series of investigations including physical assessment, echocardiogram, holter monitor, blood sampling and exercise stress testing on one occasion. Each assessment is expected to take approximately 2 hours. Participants will also complete a number of questionnaires to evaluate quality of life, AF symptom burden and knowledge of their condition.These questionnaires will be completed at baseline, six and twelve months post the risk factor assessment. At six and twelve months post baseline risk factor assessment, participants will be contacted by telephone to determine how many occasions they have visited their GP, Cardiologist or been admitted to hospital. Reasons for hospital admission will be ascertained by patient self report (AF related, cardiac related, all cause) and confirmed by an electronic health record where possible.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients meeting cardiovascular risk factor targets as outlined in the 'Australian absolute cardiovascular risk guidelines'. This will be assessed via a questionnaire designed for this study and by blood sampling. Recommended risk factor targets for blood pressure, lipid profile, smoking status, physical activity, HbA1c (in diabetic patients) and glucose levels will be compared against participant results. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine factors associated with a good overall cardiovascular risk factor status. Factors to be examined include age, postcode, level of education, knowledge score (as assessed by the Atrial Fibrillation Knowledge Scale which participants complete on exit from the HELP-AF study), co-existent ischaemic heart disease or heart failure, education received during the HELP-AF study vs usual care participants and regular Cardiologist reviews. This information will be collected by a questionnaire designed for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following baseline assessment of all participants</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if there is any association between cardiovascular risk factor status and health care resource utilisation. Risk factor status will be assessed by a questionnaire designed for this study and by investigations including blood sampling, echocardiography to examine cardiac structure and exercise stress testing to determine exercise capacity. Health care resource utilisation will be examined by patient self report at telephone follow up at six and 12 months post study enrolment. Participants will be asked how many occasions they have visited their General Practitioner (GP), Cardiologist and reasons for admission to hospital (this will be cross checked by electronic health record where possible).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, six and twelve months post study enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine any association between participant knowledge of their condition and health care resource utilisation. Participant knowledge be assessed by a knowledge questionnaire which has been developed for the HELP-AF study and health care resource utilisation will be assessed by patient self report at six and twelve months post enrolment in to the study, cross checked with an electronic health record where possible.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, six and twelve months post study enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if any association exists between AF disease burden and health care resource utilisation. Disease burden will be assessed by a holter monitor undertaken at study entry. Health care resource utilisation will be assessed by telephone call at six and twelve months post study enrolment where participants will be asked how many times they have visited their GP and Cardiologist. They will also be asked how many times they have been admitted to hospital and reasons for admission. This will be cross checked by electronic health record where possible.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed as proportion of participants meeting guideline recommendation for cardiovascular risk factor targets. The impact of education received as part of the HELP-AF study on cardiovascular risk factor status will be examined. Additionally, associations between patient knowledge of their condition, cardiovascular risk factor status and health care resource utilisation will also be examined. As this is not an interventional study, sample size calculations have not been performed. The aim of this study is to characterise how cardiovascular risk factors are currently managed in a contemporary cohort of participants with AF with a proposed recruitment number of 300 identified as the number of participants in the HELP-AF study who may be willing to participate in this study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this research is to determine how cardiovascular risk factors are
managed in patients with atrial fibrillation. Recent research suggests that optimal
cardiovascular risk factor management leads to reduced atrial fibrillation burden and
better quality of life yet little is known about how well cardiovascular risk factors are
currently managed in South Australians with atrial fibrillation.
Secondary aims include:
- determining factors associated with an optimal cardiovascular risk factor status
-determining associations between cardiovascular risk factor status and health care
burden
- determining associations between patient knowledge of their condition and health care
burden

The hypothesis is that cardiovascular risk factor management in patients with atrial
fibrillation is sub optimal and opportunities to improve outcomes in this population exist.</summary>
