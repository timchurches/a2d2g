    <comparator>This study is a single-group, pretest-posttest study design to assess the effect of clinical pilates treatment intervention on pain and function outcomes in patients with chronic low back pain. Twelve treatments were administered to patients over six weeks, followed by six weeks of self-managed home exercises. Outcome assessments were measured at baseline (0 weeks), post treatment (6 weeks) and after a period of self managed home exercises (12 weeks).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial  is a before and after study design on one group of patients to assess the effects of Clinical Pilates intervention.  Patients presenting to the Physiotherapy Department either through self-referral or referral from a MO or Specialist will be assessed for suitability for inclusion in the trial and will be given the appropriate information and informed consent will then be sought.
The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Clinical Pilates on pain and function in patients with Chronic Low Back Pain. The hypothesis is that there will be clinically and statistically significant positive outcomes based on current clinical practice in the physiotherapy department at HMAS Kuttabul.</summary>
