  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this interventional study, we will study patients with type 1 diabetes. They will be wearing a closed loop or 'artificial pancreas' system, which consists of an insulin pump with a mathematical algorithm that adjusts insulin according to real time continuous glucose monitoring from a glucose sensor. We will use the Minimed 670g insulin pump containing the algorithm, and enlite III glucose sensor.
 The closed loop system will be fitted by the research team (research nurse, and doctor). The insulin pump and glucose sensor is worn as usual (external hardware, with subcutaneous infusion, and glucose sensor). 
The observational period will be four consecutive days and three nights and will occur in-clinic, during whcih the closed loop system is used continuously.
 On day 1 the participants will wear the closed loop system, and learn how to use it. 
 On day 2 we will calibrate the glucose sensor so that it over reads the glucose value by 30%
 On day 3, we will continue to have the glucose sensor over read by 30% and participants will be asked to exercise by cycling on a stationary ergometer at moderate intensity (50 - 60% of VO2 max) for 45 minutes.
On day 4 the glucose sensor will be changed just like in normal clinical practice, and will be recalibrated to read normally.

As this study is conducted in clinic, all of the study protocol will be monitored and adhered to.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hypoglycaemic events, defined by plasma glucose &lt;3.5mmol/L. This will tested by taking blood from an IV cannula and testing on YSI laboratory equipment at the bedside. This is the gold standard for blood glucose measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>YSI plasma glucose will be measured hourly during waking hours and 2 hourly during sleep, throughout the 4 days and 3 nights. If plasma glucose is &lt;4mmol/L, samples will be taken every 20 minutes. If plasma glucose is &lt;3.5mmol/l, participants will be given hypoglycaemia treatment. If plasma glucose is &lt;4.0 but &gt;3.5mmol/L and the participant is symptomatic for hypoglycaemia, they will be given hypo treatment. If plasma glucose is &lt;2.8mmol/L and the system is delivering closed loop, the system will be closed down, participants given hypo treatment, and only restarted when YSI plasma glucose is &gt;4mmol/L</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>time spent in in euglycaemic range of 4 - 10mmol/L of plasma blood glucose. This will tested by taking blood from an IV cannula and testing on YSI laboratory equipment at the bedside. This is the gold standard for blood glucose measurement. </outcome>
      <timepoint>YSI plasma glucose will be measured hourly during waking hours and 2 hourly during sleep, throughout the 4 days and 3 nights.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will let us explore the safety of a closed loop for the management  system that is designed for unmonitored home use. It is possible that if the system is stressed, that hypoglycaemia can still happen. For example during and after exercise, or if the glucose sensor is over reading. We will simulate these possibilites while participants are in a hospital system and are closely monitored. This will help us learn and improve the system, and educate participants in the future, when the device is used in the community.</summary>
