  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 weeks of Nintendo Wii-Fit exercises at home performed using the Wii console and the Wii-Fit software and balance board. The exercises will be selected from the Wii-Fit software and prescribed in increasing difficulty through the phases - 6-8 weeks, 8-12 weeks and 12-18 weeks.
Prescribed at least three times a week for 30 minutes per session. 
The subjects in both groups will maintain an exercise diary of all exercises performed and physiotherapy attendances. The Wii also records all exercises performed.
Any physiotherapy attendance will be at the recommendation of the rehabilitation staff on discharge from in-patient rehabilitation or at the request of the treating surgeon. 
Both groups will receive a phone call in the first week of the 12 week intervention period to answer questions and check progress. Further phone-calls will be scheduled as necessary.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective randomized controlled trial looking to compare two groups of patients having total knee replacements. One group will follow a standard rehabilitation protocol following the operation and the other will have a supplementary program of exercises using the Wii-Fit from week 6 to week 18. We will compare a number of outcomes including self-reported functional scores, strength and balance at 18 weeks and 1 year after the operation.</summary>
