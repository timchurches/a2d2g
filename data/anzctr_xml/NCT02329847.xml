    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - An AE was any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and to establish the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) for the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in participants with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), follicular cell lymphoma (FL)
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Once the dose is optimized, the combination will
      be assessed for Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy, further safety
      in participants with CLL/SLL, FL or DLBCL and in participants with Richter syndrome.</summary>
