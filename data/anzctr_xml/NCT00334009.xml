    <summary>Although clinical risk factors for postoperative development of vasodilatory shock and acute
      renal failure have been identified; there is a considerable proportion of patients undergoing
      cardiac surgery where this syndrome cannot be predicted.

      We sought to investigate the impact of Catecholamine-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) polymorphism
      on the duration of vasodilatory shock and other important clinical outcomes in cardiac
      surgery patients.

      COMT is a key enzyme in the degradation of catechols eg. catecholamines. 25% of the
      population have a low activity (L/L) of this enzyme. Sustained low COMT activity is
      associated with an altered metabolic profile of catecholamines and their degradation
      products.

      The process of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)over-activates some of the same mechanisms the
      body uses to defend itself against severe infection. One of the main overactive defence
      mechanisms is the release of highly toxic compounds derived from oxygen - a process called
      'oxidative-stress'. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can lead to
      inactivation of biologic mediators, including catecholamines. It is well established that
      some radicals autoxidizes catecholamines, including DA, NE, and epinephrine and contribute
      significantly to vasoplegia.

      As part of this study, we will take six 2.7mL samples of blood, collected before, and after
      the operation, from the arterial catheter routinely inserted in every patient. This blood
      will be used to measure COMT genotype, the concentration of plasma-catecholamines as well as
      marker of oxidative stress.

      Our plan is to enrol patients undergoing cardiac surgery if the use of the CPB is planned.</summary>
