  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), which is measured as the % change in the brachial artery diameter, compared to baseline, following ischaemia. This is measured as the peak response, within five minutes of ischaemia cuff release. Endothelial function measurements will be performed via brachial artery ultrasound by a trained ultrasonographer, blinded to the study treatments. Brachial artery endothelial function will be performed (at the same time of the morning after a 12-hour overnight fast) in a quiet, air-conditioned room with a stable temperature of 220C. Subjects will be requested to refrain from taking their usual medications and from undertaking strenuous exercise on the morning of the visits. The brachial artery will be imaged using high resolution vascular ultrasonography. A pneumatic cuff will be placed around the forearm, distal to the insonated artery. Baseline brachial diameters and blood velocities will be recorded for one minute. The occluding cuff will then be rapidly (1-2 seconds) inflated to a pressure of approximately 50 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure for five minutes. Diameter and blood velocity recordings will be resumed 30 seconds before cuff deflation and continued for 2.5 minutes following cuff release. Ultrasound images will be stored digitally for subsequent analysis using a semiautomated edge-detection software system. Responses will be calculated as percentage change in brachial artery diameter compared with baseline.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed with the advice of a biostatistician. There will be no interim analysis, and all results will be analysed as comparison of treatment to placebo. As FMD is a repeated measurement taken over a 5min post-ischaemic period, repeated measurement analysis will be performed on each participant. Comparison in FMD response following treatment between groups will be analysed using ANOVA (analysis of variance), following adjustment for baseline. Further adjustment for age, gender and weight may also be considered.
Previous studies within our department, selecting specifically for a reduced FMD response, have indicated that a standard deviation of approximately 2% is expected. It is not unreasonable to expect this will also be the case in the present study, as we are specifically selecting a population of FH patients, at increased risk of CVD, and therefore with an expected reduced FMD response. With a SD of 2%, alpha = 0.05, 10 patients per group will give us more than 80% power to detect a 2% change in FMD response following treatment. We have previously shown that a 2% increase in FMD can be achieved through supplementation with flavonoid rich foods/beverages in adults. A 2% improvement in FMD is also associated with an approximate 25% reduction in CVD risk.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate the potential beneficial effect of a natural plant food compound (quercetin), on blood vessel function in adolescents with Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH). FH is a common genetic disorder affecting many thousands of children and adolescents throughout Australia, that elevates blood cholesterol from the time of birth, predisposing them to heart disease in early adult life. Untreated, 50% of men and 20% of women will have suffered a fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular event (ie heart attack) by the age of 50. 
Children with FH have highly compromised blood vessel function. Whilst medications like statins will lower cholesterol levels and can help improve blood vessel function, there is general reluctance among physicians and parents to commence children with FH on statins before the age of 18 years, because of a lack of long-term follow up studies on the use of these medications in younger patients. 
Thus, a nutrition-based supplement that could improve blood vessel function in children and adolescents with FH prior to them going on long term statin therapy would be of benefit. Using non-invasive ultrasound, we will investigate the effect of consuming a drink containing the natural plant food compound quercetin on how the blood vessel functions in 10 adolescents with FH aged 13-18 years. This will be compared to a placebo drink that contains a harmless sugar compound. We expect that the plant food compound will have a beneficial effect on blood vessel function in this population and lead to a potential new treatment option.
