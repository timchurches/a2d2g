  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of a weekly tummy time group exercise class which will be administered by a Physiotherapist. In addition, the early childhood nurse who conducts the mother's groups will provide assistance as required throughout the duration of the class. This program starts with beginner level tummy time exercises (prone on a parents chest, being held in prone) and will gradually be upgraded to advanced level tummy time exercises (playing on the floor on their tummy) for increased periods of time. Parents will also be informally educated about the benefits tummy time, positions, setting aside time and equipment during these sessions using current research. The class will run for 20 minutes as the end of their local mothers group sessions which is held at the mother's local early childhood centre. The program will run for 4 weeks and participants will attend once per week. Attendance to the groups will be noted. In addition, to provide encouragement to attend, build relationships and enhance the learning in the group exercise class, a closed Facebook or WhatsApp group will also be created so mothers can contact each other and share tips and strategies they have found helpful during the week.</interventions>
    <comparator>The wait-list control group will be given usual care which is their usual early childhood mothers group sessions. Upon completion of the study, the participants allocated to the wait-list control group will also be offered the tummy time exercise group program. They will be offered. this program 4 weeks after the completion of their mother's groups.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Linear mixed models will be used to determine differences between intervention and control groups in changes between baseline and post intervention outcome measures. All available data will be used and missing data will not be imputed. Intention-to-treat principles will be followed, with all participants analyzed in the group in which they are randomised. To calculate group mean estimates, the direct likelihood estimation method will be used to deal with any missing data (assuming that data are missing at random). If data for an infant is not obtained at one of the data collection time points, baseline data will be used for the purpose of calculating group means. Covariates will include sex, age, socioeconomic status, baseline tummy time, motor development and accelerometer wear time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking to see if group tummy time exercise classes can be an effective way to promote tummy time. It will also see if there are any positive health effects by infants who engage in tummy time. Approximately 40 first time mothers and their healthy infants aged from birth to 8 weeks will be recruited from the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Participants will be recruited from their home visit with their child and family health nurse. Those who would like to be involved in the study will be randomly assigned to either an intervention (group tummy time exercise class) or a wait-list control group (usual care). The measurements to assess the effectiveness of the classes will be the amount of time spent in tummy time by the infants, the infants ability to move, their head shape, the amount of sleep and screen time they have and the accuracy of the parents to recall the amount of tummy time the baby has been given. A measurement device that the infant wears around their waist will be used to determine the amount of tummy time the infant receives. They will wear this device for at least 3, 24-hour periods over 1 week. The parents will also be asked to complete a questionnaire which will have questions about their education, where they live, how much knowledge they have about tummy time etc. The group tummy time exercise class will run for about 20 minutes, once per week, for 4 weeks. They will be run by a Physiotherapist. To provide encouragement to attend, build relationships and enhance the learning in the group exercise class, a closed Facebook or WhatsApp group will also be created so mothers can contact each other and share tips and strategies they have found helpful during the week.</summary>
