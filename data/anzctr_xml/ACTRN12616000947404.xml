  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a preliminary randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study comparing the time course of changes in mood, cognitive health and metabolic function after a single dose of 250ml tulsi tea (hot to warm) and 250ml filtered water (room temperature). 

The interventions will be either Tulsi herbal tea 2g standardized commercial grade tea bag steeped in 250ml filtered warm-hot water or Placebo filtered room temp water 250ml.

Participants will receive the two interventions as a beverage on two separate occasions in a randomized crossover sequence with a minimum of 48 hours washout. 
Doses will be administered by healthcare professionals at the study site.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tulsi or Holy Basil is an Indian herb used for centuries for coping with stress as well as for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other metabolic disorders. Tulsi tea is widely available throughout the world as a caffeine free herbal tea with no reported side effects in literature associated with regular consumption of tulsi tea. 
Considerable evidence in animal models shows that tulsi improves cognition, immunity, stress and metabolic disorders. Also accumulating evidence from human trials indicate that long-term tulsi ingestion improves mood, cognition and metabolic function. However, there are no published reports on short term effects of tulsi on these pathways in humans. With the advancement in whole genome mRNA sequencing platform (transcriptome sequencing) a snapshot of RNA transcripts in a given sample can reveal much information on the regulation of different transcripts involved in metabolic pathways.
 
Therefore, next generation sequencing will provide an assessment of overall metabolic function at different time points in this study. This includes known gene transcripts that have been previously associated with metabolism and cognition, along with previously unknown gene transcripts that may be identified in our study. 

While it likely that consumption of an herbal tea such as tulsi, which has previously been shown to influence metabolic function, will result in short term transcriptome changes and specifically cognitive function, the time course of these changes is uncertain. 

This project aims to explore time course of transcriptome and cognitive function changes after the consumption of a single cup of tulsi tea in healthy individuals. This research is expected to provide preliminary evidence on the time course of any short-term effects of consuming a single cup of tulsi tea with possible insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic and cognitive pathways.</summary>
