  <interventions>
    <interventions>Active pilocarpine 4% (40 mg/ml) drops; Pilcoarpine (po) 2-3 drops 3 times daily (4-6 mg three times daily) with meals in raspberry water delivered as a mouth dropper. 

Rasberry water is combined with the active treatment in order to simulate the taste of the placebo, rasberry water. This is to ensure the patient remains blind to the treatment.

The active treatment will be administered in a cycle pair. A cycle pair is a  course of treatment over 6 days. For 3 consecutive days, the patient will take the active treatment followed by 3 days on placebo. The duration of the trial will consist of 3 cycle pairs taking place over 18 days. A follow-up on day 19 by the patients physician will then take place.

A washout period will be instigated on the first day of each cycle. On that day, no measurements will be taken.</interventions>

      <timepoint>The oral health related quality of life questionnaire will be taken at the end of each treatment period. Therefore, the questionnaire will be taken every 3 days over an 18 day period.</timepoint>

4.	other comorbidity where there is a risk of worsening co-existing medical problems during the trial period and/or active treatment is contemplated eg severe or uncontrolled asthma or pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypo-or hypertension, hyperthyroidism, uncontrolled seizures or cardiac arrythmias, (especially bradycardias) and Parkinson's disease;
5.	a poor understanding of written or spoken English that would preclude completion of all trial requirements

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potentially eligible patients (NRS &gt;=3/10) or clinical diagnosis of dry mouth will be identified and screened by research personnel. Those interested in participating in the study will undergo a formal interview in which the purpose and requirements of the trial are fully explained. Fully informed patients will be asked to sign a written consent. Eligibility can then be confirmed and baseline investigations undertaken. Alternate management strategies are discussed with patients who are ineligible to join the study. The pilocarpine/placebo prescription will be written and sent to the hospital pharmacy. The hospital pharmacy will release drug and placebo bottles to the patient according to the randomisation schedule. Participants will be given 6 bottles of liquid medication, numbered 1-6, 3 of which will contain placebo and 3 of which will contain active drug. They will be given daily diaries and written instructions on how to take the medication and from which bottle every day. Participants will be contacted every 3 days, (or daily if there are any concerns) to ensure diary completion and to assess any adverse events.  In-patients will be visited daily, preferably at the same time each day. Any adverse event will trigger a formal patient review.</concealment>
    <sequence>The subjects medication will be randomised based on a randomly generated computer sequence produced by the pharmacy</sequence>

    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>In a Single Patient trial, the patient typically undergoes 3 pairs of treatment periods. As Pilocarpine has a short half life (0.76 hours (5 mg tabs), or 1.35 hours (10 mg tabs) (21), the clinical effect is rapidly evident. Therefore, an appropriate duration of each treatment period is 3 days (thus each treatment pair is 6 days), making a total of 18 days for patients who complete the full trial. Patients who fail to complete the full trial will contribute completed cycles to the final analysis. In order to account for medication or placebo wash out, no measure of efficacy is taken on the first day of each 3-day period. The order of drugs in each cycle will be determined by random allocation, blinded to both clinician and patient. Patients complete a daily diary recording symptom scores using validated measures for dry mouth and related symptoms, the presence of any side effects, which treatment they prefer, and their estimate of which drug they believe they are taking at the time. At the end of the trial, the order of medications within each of the three cycles is unmasked, and compared with the patients observations. Repeated results in the same direction favouring the treatment can be reported in terms of a probability that the result is true. The clinical importance of the result is described by comparing the result to a predetermined clinically important change. 

To produce a population estimate of a treatment effect, the results of all succeeding patient cycles are added to the cycles of all preceding patients. An effect size can be calculated between the active medication and placebo cycles, thus providing a population measure of the treatment effect.</designfeatures>
