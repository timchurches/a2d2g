    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>An allocation schedule was produced prior to testing. It was delivered to the testing site on the day of testing. A person not involved with either the intervention or control administration or in the measurement of outcome variables directed participants to receive the correct condition allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>A block randomisation schedule was produced for 2 orders of condition (upper and lower body OMT) for the target sample size, using the website http://www.randomization.org, and held by an investigator not involved in the recruitment process.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The conditions are applied one week apart on the same day of the week and time of the day.

The control condition is designed to deliberately obscure the true aims of the study. Participants are not made aware that one of the conditions (the upper body OMT treatment) is designed as the active treatment whilst the other (the lower body OMT treatment) is designed as the control. Therefore, participants are effectively blinded to the existence of a control condition. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 20 male and 20 female basketball players is ideally sought. A minimum sample size of 15 men and 15 women would be required to detect change effect sizes of 0.8, assuming a level of significance of 0.05 and statistical power of 0.8. An effect size of 0.8 equates to a change of between 1  3 cm, according to variability reported in a range of previous studies (Sheppard et al., 2011; Tricoli, Lamas, Carnevale, &amp; Ugrinowitsch, 2005; Woolstenhulme, Griffiths, Woolstenhulme, &amp; Parcell, 2006). The additional 5 subjects allows slightly more statistical power and also allows for the possibility of withdrawal from the study.

Two-way ANOVAs will be used to assess difference between conditions for each of the outcome measures. Correlational analysis will be used to determine relationships between changes in jump and reach height and both initial levels and changes in ROM.

Results from the ground reaction force plate will be applied as a covariate in the analysis to control for differences in power generation between participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the effects of a single upper body osteopathic manual therapy intervention on vertical jump and reach height in elite basketball players who have some degree of shoulder restriction, compared to a control condition of lower body osteopathic manual therapy. A cross-over design randomises participants to the order in which they receive each of the two conditions, which are administered one week apart at the same time of day and on the same day of the week.</summary>
