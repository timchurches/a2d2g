    <interventions>The effect of adding simethicone to the rinse solution used during routine colonoscopies was studied in a cohort study. Simethicone (approx 50 mg/100 cc) was added to the rinse solution. The rinse solution consists of pharmaceutical grade sterile water and is used to clean the lense of the endoscope and flush material from the surface of mucosa. Medical record review of procedures was performed for a 5 day period from 29 May 2017 to 2 June 2017 when Simethicone was discontinued. Medical record review of procedures was also performed from 28 May 2016 to 28 May 2017 (12 months prior to discontinuation) and from 3 June 2017 to 8 July 2017 (5 weeks following re-introduction). </interventions>
    <comparator>polyp detection rates were continuously measured and the effects of discontinued use and reintroduction of simethicone use studied.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effects of simethicone added to the rinse solution during colonoscopies as antifoaming agent with regard to polyp detection rates is poorly studied. We thus aim to quantitate the effects of simethicone during a cohort study when for a defined time period the practice to routinely add simethicone to the rinse solution was discontinued and later re-introduced. Since this change was not communicated to endoscopists they were blinded with regard to this change.    </summary>
