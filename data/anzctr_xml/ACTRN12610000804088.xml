  <interventions>
    <interventions>Music Therapy is a treatment that the patient uses music, sounds, voice and musical instruments in a therapeutic process to develop his capacities and his difficulties. The treatment is focused in the relation between participant- music therapist. Thus, music, sounds, voice and musical instruments are the way to promote health benefits for the participant. In this study, each participant will receive 21 sessions (6 evaluation sessions and 15 treatment sessions). Each session lasts 30 minutes and happens twice a week. Before starting the consultations, all patients will be assessed by the scale Children's Communication Checklist 2 (CCC-2), video analysis and analysis of gene expression in the receptors of serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin and vasopressin. In the next moment, it will be executed the randomization and division of participants into two groups (experimental group and control group). After, participants in the experimental group will receive the treatment. Then, the participants in the experimental group and control group will be evaluated again by the scale Children's Communication Checklist 2 (CCC-2), video analysis and analysis of gene expression in the receptors of serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin and vasopressin. Finally, the control group will receive treatment the same way that the experimental group. The overall duration of this intervention will be 10 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be play sessions with toys. In 21 meetings of 30 minutes, each participant will have their disposal at a range of toys and an entertainer to perform activities of free play.The free play sessions will occur twice a week. The control group will be offered the intervention on completion of these 21 meetings at 10 weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>The research subjects are members of the population of children with autistic disorder in the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Program(PROTID) in Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Subjects will be chosen by the simple random sampling criteria, using a table of random numbers. Thus, only 20 subjects will be selected among all the subjects of the population who are framed in the inclusion criteria.The randomization will be implemented by a health professional who is not involved in the research. This person organizing the names of patients in alphabetical order. In the next moment, he will provide a number for each patient. The numbers are from 1 to 20. After, the health professional will put these 20 issues in the Pepi 4.0, making the randomization of the 20 participants into two groups(both with 10 participants). Then, he will organize a list of patients in the experimental group and a list for patients in the control group. The list of 10 participants in the experimental group will be delivered to the one music therapist that will make the attendances.</concealment>
