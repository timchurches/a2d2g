  <interventions>
    <interventions>The ENRICH program will involve education and information for participants to set up their own home-based walking program with pedometer, their own resistance training program with Gymstick (exercise stick with elastic tubing), and healthy diet information provided via 6 face-to-face, 2 hour sessions, over 8 week period. During the session, participants will be provided with a pedometer, and given information/resources on how to start a walking program (ie. start slowly, plan walking routes, etc), and how to increase their number of steps.  Participants will vary in their health status, ability, and current levels of physical activity, so the program is not prescriptive in advising all participants to meet a certain level/goal/duration.  Participants will be able to set their own walking goals, &amp; walking program, dependent on their ability.  The goal for participants is simply to increase their number of daily steps, regardless of their baseline level of activity. For resistance training, during the ENRICH program sessions, participants will be shown two exercises (at each of 4 sessions) using the Gymstick (exercise stick with elastic tubing). Participants will have the opportunity to practice these during the session, have their technique corrected (if required), or modified (if health difficulties prevent certain exercises). Participants will be provided with information on how to perform these exercises at home, along with the number of repetitians &amp; sets appropriate to their own ability and health. Participants are encouraged to perform resistance training on 3 occasions per week, although intensity &amp; duration of resistance training exercises will vary depending on the health and ability of the participant.  The home-based program components are unstructured, and up to the participant. These components are discussed during the program session and participants are encouraged to set and review weekly goals for their physical activity &amp; diet behaviours. The Sessions will be delivered by two facilitators: an accredited Dietitian, and Exercise Physiologist, who will be able to tailor the program to the ability &amp; needs of participants.  The program aims to help people make life-long positive behaviour change, so participants will be encouraged to set their own activity &amp; diet goals to work towards.  The intervention aims for participants to increase their daily step count, perform resistance training at 3 sessions per week, and increase fruit and vegetable consumption.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants who are interested and contact the Project Co-ordinator, will be asked a brief series of questions to ascertain their eligibility to participate. Potential participants will also be asked whether they are a cancer survivor or carer, and if cancer survivor, whether they have an interested partner or caregiver.  Eligible participants will be asked to provide their name, address, and telephone number, so that they can be mailed a pre-program information pack containing: an information statement, informed consent form, and medical clearance form. Participants will receive one pack for each potentially interested person they nominate. Participants will be asked to complete the consent form and return these to the Project Co-ordinator.  Participants who do not return these forms will receive one telephone reminder call two weeks after being sent this pack.Once the completed consent and medical clearance form have been returned, participants will be randomised to either the intervention or control group via random number table. Participants will be stratified by age and gender of the cancer survivor. If there is both a cancer survivor and partner/caregiver, they will be randomised together.  The Project Co-ordinator will phone participants via telephone to enrol them in a program (intervention participants will participate in one of 3 concurrent programs available in the first half of 2010; control participants will participate in one of 3 concurrent programs running the second half of 2010). Participants will be randomly allocated to an intervention or control group, only after they have been screened for eligibility and returned a completed consent form. The allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be stratified by age and gender. For each combination of age category (&lt;50; 50-65, 65+) and gender, a separately generated random sequence will be generated. Excel will be used to generate random combinations of 4 (intervention &amp; control: 2 per group). Each combination of 4 will be assigned a random number using an excel random number function. These will be sorted via excel, and each randomly generated sequence of 4 will be added to the stratified tables.</sequence>

    <summary>The study will determine the efficacy of an 8 week (x 6 session) face-to-face education and skill development program targeting the self-management of nutrition, physical activity and healthy weight management for cancer survivors who have finished active cancer treatment, and their partners/caregivers.</summary>
