  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will receive standard medical care and stroke rehabilitation in a comprehensive stroke unit. This includes multidisciplinary allied health assessment and rehabilitation and medical and stroke rehabilitation specialist treatment and management.
Participants in the intervention group will also listen to preferred music via an MP3 player at least one hour a day for at least 6 days a week for at least 12 weeks (Equals 70 hours). To measure compliance to the intervention, they will be required to maintain a log of the dates and times they listen to music via the MP3 player.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>With assistance from a statistician, it is planned group differences in baseline characteristics and the amount of therapy received will be analysed with one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, chi-square tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Group differences in mood and global function 3 and 6 months post-stroke will be analysed by one-way ANOVAs. Recovery in the domains of mood, cognition, communication, quality of life, and global function will be analysed using a mixed-model ANOVA with a within-subjects factor of time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months), and between-subjects factors of group (music group and control group). Post hoc tests will be performed on change scores from baseline to the 3-month and baseline to 6-month stages. The level of statistical significance will be set for P less then 0.05. All statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preliminary research shows listening to music in early stroke rehabilitation can improve mood and cognition. This pilot project aims to test if participants who listen to 70 hours of preferred music in the first 12 weeks post stroke will have better outcomes in their mood, cognition, quality of life, communication and function.</summary>
