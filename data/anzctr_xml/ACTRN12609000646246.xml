  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is believed that tea became a part of human culture around 5,000 years ago. Although health benefits have been attributed to tea consumption since the beginning of its history, scientific investigations of this beverage and its constituents have been underway for less than three decades (Pan et al., 2003).  
Recent attention has focused on the potential neuroprotective effects of flavonoids (also known as catechins) which constitute approximately 30 to 40% of green tea. Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant catechin found in green tea, and has proven to have a variety of physiological functions that accounts for its beneficial health effects. More specifically, EGCG has been implicated in the prevention and treatment of various cancers, treatment of skin cancers, and a reduction in heart disease as well as diabetes. The majority of research has also investigated green tea in relation to oral health, stress and anxiety management, weight management and various cardiovascular diseases. In addition, EGCG has been found to play a preventative role in neurodegenerative memory disorders such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease.
Teavigo 'Registered Trademark' is a natural, caffeine-free, standardized extract from the leaves of the tea plant Camelia sinensis providing 94% ECGC. It is currently sold over the counter for its benefits in providing antioxidants, improving cardio-vascular and oral health, and assisting with weight management. However, to date, no study has investigated the acute biobehavioural effects of Teavigo 'Registered Trademark' as proposed in the current study. 

The objective of the present study is to assess the acute affects of Teavigo 'Registered Trademark', on cognition, mood, cerebral blood flow and arterial stiffness, brain electrical activity and stress reactivity. This will be a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design involving a cohort of 32 healthy adult volunteers.

Participants will first come for a practice day where they will undergo a general health assessment  followed by a practice session of the CDR Computerised Assessment Battery. One week later, participants will return for their testing day where they will undergo a series of assessments. These assessments will take place under two conditions: before treatment, then two hours after treatment. The assessments include: The CDR Computerised Assessment Battery, the SUCCAB and the Rapid Visual Information Processor (RVIP). Participants stress levels will be assessed by the Defined Intensity Stressor Simulation (DISS) computerised battery. Brain electrical activity will be recorded by EEG. Blood flow velocity will be measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and aortic blood pressure and arterial stiffness will be assessed using the SphygmoCor. Participants mood will be measured via the Bond-Lader, stress visual analogue scales (VAS) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants will then return for a third day where they will complete the exact same assessments as the first day except they will receive a different treatment.    
The current study will provide a platform for further research on Teavigo 'Registered Trademark' and will allow a conclusion regarding the effects of acute consumption of Teavigo 'Registered Trademark' on the cognitive abilities, cardiovascular effects, brain electrical activity, mood and stress levels of healthy individuals.</summary>
