  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study is aimed at comparing the block characteristics of ultrasound guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block in 3 groups of patients. One group receiving plain ropivacaine (a local anaesthetic) without any additive, second group receiving ropivacaine with dexmedetomidine as additive and third group receiving ropivacaine with midazolam as additive. Previous studies suggest that additives prolong the duration of blockade. Our study is comparing two different additives.</summary>
