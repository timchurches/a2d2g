  <interventions>
    <interventions>All subjects will perform once: (1) cardiopulmonary exercise testing by a doctor and (2) 6-minute walk test by a physiotherapist. The interval of these two tests will not exceed 3 weeks.
The cardiopulmonary exercise test is performed on a stationary bicycle with modified Bruce protocol, During the test various pieces of equipment will be used to monitor your bodys response. This equipment includes: face mask, EKG monitor, blood pressure cuff, and pulse oximeter. A Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test may take 45 to 60 minutes to complete. The rest, exercise, and recovery lasts for a total of about 15-25 minutes, To get the most accurate results, subjects will be request to give their best effort for as long as they possibly can. 

The 6-minute walk test is conducted on a straight 20 meter track, Subjects will be asked to walk back and forth in this track for 6 minutes. When the test finished, we will measure the total distance an individual is able to walk, heart rate change, blood pressure change during the test.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>6-minute is a simple, reliable and popular field test for fitness assessment and prognostic prediction, however, its application for exercise prescription remains limited and unsatisfied. So, this study purpose is to identify the optimal individualized exercise prescription by using the results of 6-minute walk test among patients with cardiopulmonary diseases. A comprehensive model will be made to meet the individual's needs for training effect and will be an alternative method to prescribe training dosage, especially when cardiopulmonary exercise testing is not available. </summary>
