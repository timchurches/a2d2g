               1. Subject = 18 years of age.

               2. Documented clinical diagnosis of a fibrotic lung disease supported by at least
                  one of the following:

                    1. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern based on high-resolution computed

                    4. A documented UIP pattern on surgical lung biopsy. The underlying etiology of
                       the fibrotic lung disease may be of any cause, including, but NOT LIMITED TO
                       any of the following: Connective tissue disease associated interstitial lung
                       disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), environmental or
                       chemical-related pulmonary fibrosis, other forms of interstitial pulmonary
                       fibrosis, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome.

               3. Must understand and voluntarily sign a written Informed Consent Form prior to any
                  study-related procedures being performed.

               4. Must be able to communicate with the Investigator, understand and comply with the
                  requirements of the study, and agree to adhere to restrictions and examination
                  schedules.

               5. Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase within
                  limits of normal.

               8. No clinically significant laboratory test results as determined by the
                  Investigator.

               9. Male subjects agree to use barrier contraception NOT made of natural (animal)
                  membrane (eg, latex or polyurethane condoms are acceptable) when engaging in
                  sexual activity with a female of childbearing potential (FCBP) while on CC 90001
                  and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study medication. A FCBP is
                  defined as a sexually mature female who has not undergone a hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy or who has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least
                  24 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
                  consecutive months).

              10. All FCBPs must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1. Any FCBP
                  who engages in activity in which conception is possible must use two forms of
                  contraception simultaneously while on CC-90001 and for at least 28 days after
                  taking the last dose of CC-90001: one highly effective form (ie, hormonal,
                  intrauterine device, tubal ligation, vasectomized partner) and one additional
                  form (latex condom or any nonlatex condom NOT made of natural [animal] membrane
                  [eg, polyurethane], diaphragm, sponge). If one highly effective form of
                  contraception cannot be used, then two forms of barrier contraception must be
                  used, ie, latex condom or any nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural (animal)
                  membrane [eg, polyurethane] with either of the following: sponge with spermicide
                  or diaphragm with spermicide.

              11. Female subjects that are postmenopausal (defined as 24 months without menses
                  before Screening, with an estradiol level of &lt; 30 pg/mL and FSH level of &gt; 40
                  IU/L at Screening).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Potential subjects will be excluded from enrollment if any of the following occur:

               1. Exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding
                  the first dose of CC-90001 administration, or five half-lives of that
                  investigational drug, if known (whichever is longer).

               2. Subjects who are part of the clinical staff personnel or family members of the
                  study site staff.

               3. Screening forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 40% predicted.

                  other serious concomitant respiratory disorder other than pulmonary fibrosis, as
                  determined by the Investigator. Subjects with reactive airway disease, chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma may be included as long as, in the
                  opinion of the Investigator, fibrosis is the major contributing factor to the
                  subject's respiratory disorder.

                  substrate digoxin).

              13. Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) at a dosage &gt; 3 grams per day within 2 weeks

                  that would prevent the subject from participating in the study.

              16. History of recurrent bacterial infections (at least three major infections

                  Virus (HCV). Subjects treated for HCV who have a sustained virologic response of
                  6 months following final HCV treatment can be included.
