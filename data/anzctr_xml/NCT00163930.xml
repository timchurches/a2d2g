  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a new post-operative pain relief program
      for women who have undergone uterine artery embolisation (UAE).

      UAE is performed by an interventional radiologist as a treatment of uterine fibroids
      (non-cancerous growths of the uterus.) UAE can be associated with a high level of
      post-procedural pain and it is the purpose of this study to evaluate a new relief regimen for
      dealing with this acute pain.

      There will be two treatment groups into which patients will be randomly assigned. One will
      receive the current post-operative therapy (dose-on-demand) and the other will receive the
      new therapy (pre-emptive dosing). Otherwise patients will receive standard management
      protocol for this procedure. Only patients that are scheduled for UAE will be enrolled (up to
      40 patients).

      The new treatment involves giving the patient their morphine dose orally and sixty minutes
      before the procedure begins (pre-emptive dosing) as opposed to current standard treatment
      which involves giving the patient a dose of morphine intravenously once they feel pain.

      Information to be collected directly from patients includes pain and nausea levels, indicated
      on a visual scale (a 10 centimetre line showing a spectrum of no pain to worst pain
      imaginable) as well as their opinions of the effectiveness of the pain relief program and the
      procedure itself. This information is to be collected immediately post-procedure and at 2, 4,
      6 and 24 hours post procedure. Each VAS will take the patient approximately 20 seconds to
      complete. Information about concurrent medication and procedure complications, post-operative
      vomiting and respiratory depression will be collected from the patients history.</summary>
