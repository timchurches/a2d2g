Experimental: transcatheter aortic valve replacement - In this study, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) will be performed using the JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System, which is intended to help treat severe aortic stenosis. The JenaValve replacement valve is placed inside the aortic valve by using the JenaValve delivery system.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to collect information about a new treatment for severe
      aortic stenosis, which affects the aortic valve in the heart. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing
      of the aortic valve opening, which decreases blood flow from the heart and causes symptoms
      such as chest pain, fainting and shortness of breath. The preferred treatment for severe
      aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement surgery.</summary>
