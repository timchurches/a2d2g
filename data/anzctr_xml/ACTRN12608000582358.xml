  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element) is a metal tube coated with the drug Everolimus. Up to two stents will be permanently implanted in the patient via use of a catheter inserted into the vasculature. The drug dosage depends on the size of the stent and varies from 57 micrograms (2.25x12mm stent) to 242 micrograms (4.0x38mm stent) and this drug is gradually eluted into the bloodstream following implantation of the stent. Stent size is selected by the investigator based on vessel diameter and length.  Typically stent diameter is selected to be slightly larger than the vessel diameter (ie a 3.0mm stent would be used to treat a 2.8mm vessel).  Typically stent length is selected so that the stent is 2-4mm longer than the lesion length (ie a 28mm stent would be used to treat a 22mm lesion)</interventions>
    <comparator>The PROMUS Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System will be used as a control device. This device contains the same drug as the PROMUS Element device but a different stent and is already approved on the Australian market. This device will be implanted in exactly the same way as the test device.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>12-month target lesion failure (TLF) rate, defined as any ischaemia-driven revascularisation of the target lesion (TLR), MI (Q-wave and non-Q-wave) related to the target vessel, or cardiac death related to the target vessel</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 month after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Target lesion revascularization (TLR) is any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to improve blood flow, of the successfully treated target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel with a graft distally to the successfully treated target lesion. A TLR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is 50% by QCA and there is presence of clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be explained by other coronary or graft lesions. Clinical or functional ischemia is any of the following:

* The patient has a positive functional study corresponding to the area served by the target lesion
* The patient has ischemic ECG changes at rest in a distribution consistent with the target vessel
* The patient has ischemic symptoms referable to the target lesion
A TLR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the lesion diameter stenosis is 70% by QCA even in the absence of clinical or functional ischemia. 

Any events must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours.  Source data regarding the event will be collected and sent to the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) for adjudication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years &amp; 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Target vessel revascularization (TVR) is defined as a TLR or a TVR remote.  Target lesion revascularization is any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to improve blood flow, of the successfully treated target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel with a graft distally to the successfully treated target lesion. A TLR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is 50% by QCA and there is presence of clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be explained by other coronary or graft lesions. Clinical or functional ischemia is any of the following:
* The patient has a positive functional study corresponding to the area served by the target lesion 
* The patient has ischemic ECG changes at rest in a distribution consistent with the target vessel
* The patient has ischemic symptoms referable to the target lesion
A TLR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the lesion diameter stenosis is 70% by QCA even in the absence of clinical or functional ischemia

 

Target vessel revascularization remote is any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to improve blood flow, or bypass surgery of not previously existing lesions diameter stenosis 50% by QCA in the target vessel, excluding the target lesion. A TVR will be considered ischemia-driven if the target vessel diameter stenosis is 50% by QCA and any of the following are present:  

* The patient has a positive functional study corresponding to the area served by the target lesion

* The patient has ischemic ECG changes at rest in a distribution consistent with the target vessel
* The patient has ischemic symptoms referable to the target lesion
A TVR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the lesion diameter stenosis is 70% by QCA even in the absence of clinical or functional ischemia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The PROMUS Element clinical trial  PLATINUM, is a prospective, multi-centre trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PROMUS Element Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System compared with the PROMUS Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System. Treatment will be in participants with up to 2 de novo (new or untreated) atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions. A separate coronary artery (de novo) narrowing is able to be treated with a commercial treatment (eg: stent such as PROMUS, balloon angioplasty, excluding brachytherapy) during the initial procedure. Up to 160 sites enrolling up to 1,532 patients. Follow up at hospital clinics 30 days, 6 and 12 months. 
Participants enrolled who did not receive the PROMUS Element or the PROMUS stent will complete follow up at this point. The Primary Endpoint is Target Lesion Failure at 12 months defined as ischaemia-driven Target Lesion Revascularisation (repeat treatment of narrowing), Myocardial Infarction (heart attack) related to the target vessel, or Cardiac Death (participant death) related to the target vessel.</summary>
