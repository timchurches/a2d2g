  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients receiving Lee Silverman Voice Therapy will be studied with pre-treatment and post-treatment videofluoroscopic swallowing studies to assess effect on swallowing.  Exposure is three videofluoroscopic swallowing studies at time 0, one week post therapy and six months post therapy
Lee Silverman Voice Therapy will be conducted as per standardized protocol. 
*Criteria for Lee Silverman Voice Therapy
a)	Motivated and able to commit to intensive therapy
b)	Adequate hearing
c)	Adequate cognition and memory
d)	Able to access a community clinic close to their home
e)	Positive results on stimulability testing suggesting likely response to treatment (is the patient able to improve loudness and quality? Can they achieve sustained vowel phonation, high and low pitch slide on ah and functional phrases?)
f)	Socially active and keen to increase participation
g)	ORL assessment indicates that there are no contraindications for intensive voice treatment
*Measures recorded for Lee Silverman Voice Therapy
a)	Average dB duration ah (sustained phonation)
b)	Average length of maximum duration ah
c)	Average dB of functional phrases
d)	Average dB of conversational speech
e)	Complete Voice Handicap Index pre- and post-therapy
Subjects then undergo Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (registered trademark) consisting of 2 assessment sessions and 16 treatment sessions over six weeks (three sessions per week).   At each session the subject participates in instructed vocal exercises consisting of prolonged vowel phonation with increasing volumes, functional words and phrases with increasing volumes, measured and modified by a sound meter.  Biofeedback is provided during sessions by listening to recorded personal phonation and subjects rate their own voice. Sessions are approximately 45 minutes long.
This is a designated treatment regimen for voice problems in Parkinson's Disease.  No deviations are permitted.
VFS studies are approximately 10-15 minutes in length.  
LSVT is administered as a single block of treatment.  This will occur once over 3 weeks.  VFSS will be performed on three occasions ie. pre-therapy, one week post completion of therapy and six months post completion of therapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>No therapy, Parkinson's Disease patients that have not received Lee Silverman Voice Treatment and normal elderly swallowing data.  Normative data is available from published sources.  Historical swallow studies from patients with Parkinson's Disease will be evaluated from a database at Waitemata District Healthboard.  Studies performed between 2010-2012 will be reviewed.  During this time period a standard VFSS protocol was used but no patients received LSVT. </comparator>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients presenting to WDHB with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and vocal deterioration that meet the inclusion criteria for Lee Silverman Voice Treatment will be invited to participate in the study.  After written consent is obtained all enrolled subjects will undergo a videofluoroscopic swallow study prior to commencing LSVT.  Patients will also complete a validated, self-assessment questionnaire regarding their swallow ability, the Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10) before and after LSVT.  At one week and six months following completion of LSVT subjects will complete a further VFSS and EAT-10 questionnaire.  Enrollment will occur by face-to-face invitation from patients referred to the Speech Language Therapy department at North Shore Hospital for voice therapy to assist Parkinson's hypophonia.</concealment>
    <sequence>Non randomized.  Sequential recruitment of first 20 eligible subjects.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Single group</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The principle investigator and co investigator will not perform LSVT and will be blinded to when the VFSS has been performed.  Data analysis is via a standardized quantitative protocol from recorded studies.  
All swallow studies will be reviewed independently in a blinded fashion.  Studies will be de-identified and presented in random order to the assessing clinicians.  Studies will be classified according to the PAS developed by Rosenbek et al.  The PAS defines penetration as material entering the airway but not passing below the vocal folds.  Aspiration is defined as material below the level of the vocal folds.  The scale further delineates grading by depth of penetration or aspiration, and by patient response to the event.  Swallow studies will also be measured quantitatively using parameters derived from the protocol published by Leonard and Kendall.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Mean UES opening, swallowing safety (PAS), and EAT-10 scores will be compared before and after LSVT by analysis of variance, treating examiner as a fixed effect and patient as a random effect to account for repeated measures. All tests will be two-sided; tests will be at a level 0.05, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison. Quality of life with the EAT-10 will be assessed at baseline, 1 week after LSVT completion and 6 months after LSVT completion.  
Power calculation has been completed.  Twenty patients will be recruited.  To detect a change of more than two standard deviations in swallowing ability with 80% power and setting a=0.05, would require 13 subjects.   This allows for drop out or loss to follow up in the cohort.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the effect on swallowing of a well-known voice therapy treatment (Lee Silverman Voice Treatment) for patients with Parkinson's Disease.  Those who are having Voice therapy to help improve speech will be invited to have their swallowing assessed before and after the therapy has taken place.  We believe the therapy will also improve swallowing, as it does speech, and we intend to measure the improvement by analyzing barium contrast swallow studies performed before and after the therapy is done.  </summary>
