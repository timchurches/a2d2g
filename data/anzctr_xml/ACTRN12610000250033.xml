      <outcome>total of respiratory complications. 
Presence of perioperative respiratory complication as defined by one or more of the following:
Bronchospasm, laryngospasm, severe coughing, desaturation &lt; 95%, airway obstruction and/or stridor.
The presence/absence of respiratory complications will be recorded during the time of anaesthesia and the time spent in recovery. The overall presence of respiratory complications will be taken for the analysis</outcome>

    <concealment>All patients will be recruited at the pre-anaesthetic visit. Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be enrolled and only after informed consent is given voluntarily by the parent/guardian. The patients will be randomised by computer generated block randomisation. The participant will be assigned the next available Participant Number</concealment>
    <sequence>The patients will be randomised by computer generated block randomisation. Following written informed consent, the participant will be assigned the next available Participant Number. The Participant Number will correspond to a numbered randomisation envelope. The randomisation is concealed in the closed envelope and will only be opened by the anaesthetist in charge of the patient at induction of anaesthesia. The participant number will be used to identify the patient for the duration of the study</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infants undergoing minor elective surgery have their airway managed at the discretion of the anaesthetist in charge with either an endotracheal tube or an laryngeal mask airway. Research already done witin the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) Anaesthetic Unit has identified some patients with asthma, eczema, hay fever, a current cold &amp; exposure to smoking have a higher risk of airway complications following their surgery. However, the best practice for the management of an infant's airway is still under debate. 
The aim of this study is to identify which airway support, laryngeal mask or endotracheal tube, is safer in regards to respiratory problems in the perioperative period for infants (0-12 months) undergoing minor general surgery.</summary>
