  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sublingual Fetanyl Wafer.

In the present cross-over trial, healthy participants will receive a single dose of both sublingual wafer (100mcg) and IV fentanyl (100mcg), one treatment per period, in randomised order. A 5 day wash-out period is applicable between Sublingual/IV treatment arms.

In both arms dosing is subject to participants' passing a 50mg pre dose-day (Day -1) naltrexone challenge, such that pre-dose naltrexone may be administered to counter-act the effects of fetanyl dosing.</interventions>
    <comparator>IV Fentanyl 

Single Intravenous dose of 100mcg administered as a 5 minute direct infusion (via an indwelling cannula) at the commencement of Day 1 of the study.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fentanyl is a strong analgesic (painkiller) with similar effects to morphine. Recently a fentanyl wafer has been developed that dissolves quickly when placed under the tongue.  This has advantages of quick absorption, rapid onset of action and would be suitable for patients who cannot swallow tablets, or are phobic to needles. 

The present study compares the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the sublingual wafer fetanyl formulation with the currently registered IV forumulation.</summary>
