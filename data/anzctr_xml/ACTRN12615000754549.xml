    <concealment>Nursing and/or medical staff will identify potentially suitable patients requiring urine sample collection, and make a decision about the appropriate method of urine sample collection on clinical grounds (independent of this research project), at the point of triage or during clinical assessment. 

If appropriate for CCU and meeting inclusion criteria, a study researcher or clinician will invite the parents or carer of suitable patients to provide verbal consent to participate in the study. 
Study participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to the intervention (additional suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold saline soaked gauze) or standard care, via opaque envelopes containing patient allocation.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Study participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to the intervention (additional suprapubic cutaneous stimulation with cold saline soaked gauze) or standard care. A statistician not directly involved in the analysis of the study results will prepare the randomisation schedule using random permuted blocks with at least three different block sizes to ensure concealment of allocation. A paper based system using opaque envelopes will be used to allocate participants in the emergency department.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat, including all randomised participants where primary outcome data is available.

The primary outcome measure is a binary yes/no outcome of voiding urine within 5 minutes. We will report the absolute difference between the two groups for percentage of successful CCU, together with the 95% confidence interval for the difference of percentages, and calculate p values using a chi squared test. 

Secondary outcome measures will be:
- parental and clinician satisfaction with the urine collection technique in each group
- whether there is a successful CCU caught in each group
- contamination rate of CCU samples in each group
For each secondary outcome, we will describe the rates of successful CCU and contamination for each group with percentages and 95% confidence intervals. The appropriate difference between groups will be estimated (difference of proportions for categorical outcomes, difference of means for continuous outcomes), together with the 95% confidence interval for the difference. P values will be estimated using chi square for categorical variables and t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables.

As a sensitivity analysis, all treatment comparisons for primary and secondary outcomes will also be presented adjusted for age and sex to account for any chance imbalance between the treatment groups with respect to this potentially confounding factor using linear and logistic regression models for continuous and binary outcomes respectively. 

A sample size of 354 patients will be included for the study (177 in each group). 

A Baseline Study was conducted where the time to void for children requiring CCU using standard urogenital cleaning alone was measured. 12/57 (21%) of patients &lt;12 months of age voided in less than 5 minutes. We surveyed a panel of 20 expert clinicians (Paediatric Emergency Medicine Physicians and Paediatricians at consultant level) who reported a 15% increase in success rate would suggest that this simple technique should be incorporated into their clinical practice. Data from 40 patients in a completed Pilot Feasibility Study suggests this is a reasonable estimate of the likely treatment effect. 

With a sample size of 322 patients (161 in each group) the study would have 80% power to detect a difference of 21% (non-intervention arm) vs 35% (intervention arm) success rate of infants voiding within 5 minutes. An additional 10% of patients (16 in each group) will be recruited in the sample size to account for a small percentage of loss to follow-up of primary outcome results.
