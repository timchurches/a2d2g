Experimental: TARGET protocol EN 1.5 kcal/mL - Enteral (EN) feed 1.5 kcal/mL. The goal rate for administration of TARGET protocol EN is 1ml/kg/hr. To calculate the goal rate, weight is based on ideal body weight.

Active Comparator: TARGET protocol EN 1.0 kcal/mL - Enteral feed 1.0 kcal/mL The goal rate for administration of TARGET protocol EN is 1ml/kg/hr. To calculate the goal rate, weight is based on ideal body weight.

    <summary>Nutrition therapy is an essential standard of care for all critically ill patients who are
      mechanically ventilated and remain in the intensive care unit for more than a few days.

      The investigators plan to conduct a 4,000 patient, double-blind, randomised controlled trial
      to determine if augmentation of calorie delivery using energy dense enteral nutrition in
      mechanically ventilated patients improves 90 day survival when compared to routine care.</summary>
