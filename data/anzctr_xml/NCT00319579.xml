             beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers)

          6. A past history of permanent proteinuria

          8. Unable to give informed consent

          9. Unwilling to participate in the follow-up assessments at one, two, three, four and
             five years, or unwilling or unable to conduct home blood pressure or laboratory
             measurements

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Kidney transplantation, a 'miracle' of modern medicine, is the preferred treatment option for
      End Stage Renal Disease compared to dialysis, patients who receive kidneys have a 70%
      reduction in risk of death, a dramatically improved quality of life and cost the health care
      system considerably less. As a result there are over 3000 Canadians, and 57,000 Americans on
      the waiting list for a kidney. To meet the shortage in cadaveric kidneys, rates of living
      kidney donation have nearly doubled over the last 10 years, and will continue to rise with
      growing demand.

      Yet despite its advantages for the recipient, living kidney donation remains a complex
      ethical, moral and medical issue. The premise for accepting living donors is that the
      "minimal" risk of short and long-term medical harm realized by the donor is outweighed by the
      definite advantages to the recipient and potential psychosocial benefits of the altruistic
      gift to the donor. The only benefit for the living donor is psychological - donors experience
      increased self-esteem, feelings of well-being and improved health related quality of life
      with their altruistic act of assuming medical risk to help another. The short-term
      consequences of living donation are well established. On the other hand the long-term
      implications of living kidney donation are far less certain. This study will look at the long
      term implications of living kidney donation.</summary>
