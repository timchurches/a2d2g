  <interventions>
    <interventions>physical therapy program composed of manual therapy, supervised exercises and electro acupuncture
Manual therapy (Mobilizing exercises) was performed for 20 minutes 3 times /week for 8 weeks.
(Supervised exercises) Flexibility exercises were done to gastrocnemius-soleus, hamstring and quadriceps muscle by ask patient to hold the muscle stretch for 30 seconds and do three repetitions with each muscle group on each leg. The strengthening exercises consisted of quadriceps and hamstring "sitting" followed by maximal isometric contractions of the quadriceps and hamstrings. The active range of motion maneuvers performed were straight leg raises (hip), abduction/adduction (hip), short arc extension (knee), leg extensions (knee) and leg curls (knee)., strength, endurance and active range of motion activities . the session extended to about 20 minutes and repated 3 times/week for 8 weeks (total time of exercises about 40 minutes as long as there is no pain or muscle fatigue 
The EA treatment lasted for 20 minutes 3 times/week for 8 weeks at the 9 selected acupuncture points.</interventions>
    <comparator>well-designed home exercise program
the exercises performed daily for 45 minutes divided into 3 times per day for 8 weeks  The physical therapist reassessed the exercise program after 4weeks for each patient to keep the program challenging and beneficial. The patients were made aware of the side effects and contraindications (swelling, increase joint pain) of excessive exercise</comparator>

Western Ontario Mc Master's Arthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire (Arabic translation, appendix I) The WOMAC is divided into three dimensions: pain, stiffness and physical function listed in 24 items. The Likert scale (a verbal scale of five points: none = 0, slight =1, moderate = 2, severe = 3, extreme = 4) is used for scoring each item</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The main inclusion criterion was a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee based on fulfillments of one of the following clinical criteria developed by Altman and colleagues1986,(18): 1) knee pain, age 38 years or younger, and bony enlargement; 2) knee pain, age 39 years or older, morning stiffness for more than 30 minutes, and bony enlargement; 3) knee pain, crepitus on active motion, morning stiffness for more than 30 minutes, and bony enlargement; or 4) knee pain, crepitus on active motion, morning stiffness for more than 30 minutes, and the age 38 years or older. Altman and colleagues found these criteria to be 89% sensitive and 88% specific.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of clinically applied treatment include manual therapy, supervising exercises and electro-acupuncture like TENS compared with well-designed home exercise program for  OA of the knee.

Our hypothesis was that physical therapy consisting of manual therapy, supervised exercises and electro-acupuncture  like TENS (EA like TENS) conducted in the clinic would be more effective than exercise program performed at home for decreasing pain and improving function.</summary>
