  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Conversion to Multiple Sclerosis (MS) According to the McDonald Criteria (2005) - The McDonald criteria use dissemination in time and space established by magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings to provide a clinical diagnosis for MS. Dissemination in time is established by a new time constant 2 (T2) or gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion found on a repeat MRI. Dissemination in space is established by the presence of any 3 of the following: 1 Gd+ lesion or 9 T2 bright lesions if there is no enhancement; greater than or equal to 1 infratentorial lesion; greater than or equal to 1 juxtacortical lesion; greater than or equal to 3 periventricular lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Various time points from randomization up to 24 months</timepoint>

      <outcome>Time to Conversion to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) Defined by Either a Second Attack or a 3-Month Sustained Increase (Greater Than or Equal to 1.5 Points) in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score - CDMS was defined by the occurrence of a second exacerbation or relapse over 24 months in participants who presented with first clinical demyelinating event (FCDE) accompanied by an abnormal MRI scan. EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a 24 months randomized, double-blind, Placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical
      trial with an optional 12 months open label extension.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of fetal bovine serum
      [FBS]-free/human serum albumin [HSA]-free formulation of Interferon [IFN] beta-1a (RNF) 44
      microgram (three times weekly and once weekly) versus placebo on the time to conversion to
      McDonald multiple sclerosis (MS) criteria (2005) in subjects with a first clinical
      demyelinating event at high risk of converting to MS.

      The main secondary objective of study is to evaluate the effect of RNF 44 microgram (three
      times weekly and once weekly) versus placebo on the "Time to conversion to clinically
      definite MS (CDMS)" in subjects with a first clinical demyelinating event at high risk of
      converting to MS.

      At the end of 24 month double-blind core REFLEX trial, subjects who will not convert to CDMS
      and decide to receive open-label (OL) treatment will be enrolled into an open-label, 12 month
      extension period to evaluate the effect of RNF 44 mcg three times weekly treatment on the
      time to conversion to McDonald MS and time to conversion to CDMS.</summary>
