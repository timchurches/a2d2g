    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Lung Clearance Index 2.5 (LCI2.5) Through Week 24 - Lung clearance index (LCI) is a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity that is derived from a multiple breath washout test using Nitrogen (N2). LCI2.5 represents the number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/40th of its starting value.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in BMI-for-age Z-score at Week 24 - BMI was defined as weight in kg divided by height in m^2. z-score is a statistical measure to evaluate how a single data point compares to a standard.
