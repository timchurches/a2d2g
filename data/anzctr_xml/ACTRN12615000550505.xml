    <concealment>Following Hollywood Hospital ethics approval, this project will recruit suitable and consenting participants from the private rooms of Prof. D Wood at the Perth Orthopaedic Institute, Hollywood Private Hospital. Potential participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria and without the exclusion criteria, will be provided with written information regarding the trail and given the opportunity to ask questions. Those willing to participate will sign informed consent and then be randomised to one of the two groups (inset patella component, or onlay patella component). The randomisation and allocation to treatment groups will be completed using a random number generator (www.random.org) by a different investigator to the investigator enrolling participants. Participants will be blinded as to their group. Consenting participants would then undergo their total knee arthroplasty based on their group, and then be followed up equally. </concealment>
    <sequence>A web-based random number generator (www.random.org) will be used to place participants in one of the two groups. The random numbers are generated based on atmospheric noise, which is arguably more random than simple randomisation using computer driven sequence generation.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A priori power calculation has been determined using GPOWER (GPOWER Version 3.1.5, Bonn University, Bonn, Germany). This has demonstrated that for an anticipated moderate effect size (d = 0.50) in the primary outcome variable (pain subscale of the KOOS), a total of 64 knees (32 in each intervention group) is required to reveal differences at the 5% significance level, with 80% power. In order to account for a 20% drop-out per group over the 5 year evaluation period, a minimum total of 78 (39 patients per group) will be recruited into this trial.

Scores from the questionnaires and knee function tests will be collected for each patella group and compared using SPSS or equivalent data software. The purpose will be to generate hazard ratios and confidence intervals looking for significant differences at p&lt;0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this trial is to compare current patella component designs (inset vs onlay), with the hope of finding significant improvement in anterior knee pain or knee function for one design over the other. Subsequently, future patients can benefit from surgery using the superior design. 

This trial will recruit suitable and consenting participants from the private rooms of Prof. D Wood at the Perth Orthopaedic Institute, HPH. Consenting participants would undergo a total knee arthroplasty (which they otherwise would undergo, whether they were enrolled in this study or not, as part of their clinical care). The patella component of their total knee arthroplasty (TKA) will be randomised to either an inset design or onlay design. All surgeries will be carried out by Prof. D Wood using his routine surgical technique and peri-operative care. Participants are not placed at increased risk or offered inferior treatment in this study based on current knowledge.

Participants will have standard postoperative weekly physiotherapy sessions as part of the standard care following total knee arthroplasty, and will be followed up by Prof Wood at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60 months, also as part of usual care. During this interval follow up, participants will also complete a series of validated scoring questionnaires and functional tests, administered by a trained assessor.

These functional data will be compared across the two study groups (inset patella component, onlay patella component) and hazard ratios and confidence intervals generated using  statistical software. Anonymous results will be submitted for publication in a leading orthopaedic journal to inform other surgeons and medical professionals of the results. </summary>
