  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment Monitoring:

CTCs will be enriched from whole blood sample (7.5ML in EDTA) using microfluidics. The recovered CTCs will be labelled and analysed within one week before treatment starts to create a baseline, and 3 months after treatment cycle started, and at least 3 weeks after treatment cycle ends as follow-up. 

There will be additional follow-ups at the 6th, 9th and 12th month after treatment.


Early Detection:

Healthy individuals and individuals with a family history of cancer or predisposition to cancer will fall under this group. 7.5ML of blood in EDTA will be taken from these participants and analysed for CTCs (to create the baseline). A follow-up blood test will be done yearly for another 9 years after the first test. Every year, the participant will also be asked if he/she has been diagnosed with cancer within the last 12 months. The full set of yearly CTCs results and trends will be studied and analysed.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage change in number of CTCs. 

The CTCs number is determined firstly by using microfluidics to enrich the CTCs, followed by antibody-based labelling and counting of CTCs under a fluorescent microscope. A percentage increase/decrease is derived after determining the difference between the previous and current reading.  </outcome>

      <outcome>Relationship of CTC levels in the blood and cancer incidence.

The cancer incidence is assessed by a telephone or email follow-up directly with participants. Participants can also self-report by emailing us.  </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is (1) to determine effectiveness of monitoring a cancer patients response to his/her treatment by detecting and counting the Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream, and (2) to establish the relationship of the number of CTCs in patients before and after cancer diagnosis.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and are about to start treatment for cancer (Part 1) or if you a healthy individual not previously diagnosed with cancer (Part 2). 

Study details
For both groups, blood samples will be collected at various timepoints to assess CTCs number. In participants commencing cancer treatment this will be over a 12 month period while healthy individuals will be assessed once a year for 10 years. 

Upon the completion of this study, we will be able to evaluate the feasibility of using CTCs number as an indicator or marker for early cancer detection and for cancer treatment monitoring for cancer patients.</summary>
