Ancillary-correlative (renal tumor classification, biology) - Tumor tissue, blood, and urine samples are collected for research studies, including immunohistochemistry. CT scans and MRIs are also performed. Loss of heterozygosity analyses (chromosome 1p and 16q) are performed by extraction of DNA. DNA polymorphisms are assayed by polymerase chain reaction using standard methodology. Leftover specimens are archived for future studies. (LOH and INI1 testing discontinued as of April 2014)

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients with the first occurrence of any tumor of the kidney identified on CT scan or
             MRI are eligible for this study; histologic diagnosis is not required prior to
             enrollment but is required for all patients once on study

          -  Eligible tumors include (but are not limited to):

               -  Nephroblastic tumors

                    -  Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumor) (favorable histology, anaplasia [diffuse,
                       focal])

                    -  Nephrogenic rests and nephroblastomatosis

                    -  Cystic nephroma and cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma

                    -  Metanephric tumors (metanephric adenoma, metanephric adenofibroma,
                       metanephric stromal tumor)

               -  Mesoblastic nephroma (cellular, classic, mixed)

               -  Clear cell sarcoma

               -  Rhabdoid tumor (any malignant rhabdoid tumor occurring outside the central
                  nervous system [CNS])

               -  Renal epithelioid tumors of childhood (papillary renal cell carcinoma, medullary
                  renal cell carcinoma, renal tumors associated with Xp11.2 translocations,
                  oncocytic renal neoplasms after neuroblastoma)

               -  Angiolipoma

               -  Ossifying renal tumor of infancy

          -  Patients with the first occurrence of the following tumors are also eligible:

               -  Extrarenal nephroblastoma or extrarenal neprogenic rests

               -  Malignant rhabdoid tumor occurring anywhere outside the Central Nervous System

          -  Required specimens, reports, and copies of imaging studies must be available for
             submission or must become available during the required timeframe

          -  For ALL patients (with exception of bilateral, bilaterally predisposed or unilateral
             tumor in solitary kidney planning to enroll without biopsy), the following submissions
             are required:

               -  A complete set of recut hematoxylin and eosin (H &amp; E) slides**

               -  Representative formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue block or if a block is
                  unavailable, 10 unstained slides from a representative block of tumor**

               -  Institutional pathology report, transmittal form and pathology checklist

               -  Copies of images and institutional reports of CT and/or MRI abdomen and pelvis

               -  Copies of images and institutional report of CT chest for all malignant tumors

               -  Institutional surgical report(s)

                    -  Tissue must be from diagnosis, prior to any chemotherapy or radiation

          -  For patients with clinical features and required imaging findings consistent with the
             eligibility for the bilateral study, AREN0534 (or successor study), confirmed by
             central review, biopsy is not required; however, if biopsy is done, tissue must be
             submitted as for other renal tumors, and initial risk assignment will require
             pathology and surgical rapid central reviews; transmittal form and pathology checklist
             are also needed

          -  Patients with extrarenal Wilms tumor must have tumor tissue available for central
             review

          -  Patients with extra-CNS malignant rhabdoid tumor must have tumor tissue available for
             central review

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent

          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute
             (NCI) requirements for human studies must be met</inclusivecriteria>
