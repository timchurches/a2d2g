  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention general practitioners (GPs) will be trained in the use of a brief cognitive impairment screening tool (the GPCOG), which is superior to other dementia screening instruments because of its brevity and its use of an informant report in borderline cases. GPs will also be trained in the use of  dementia management guidelines (the Care of Patients with Dementia in General Practice Guidelines) funded by the NSW Department of Health and endorsed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. These consensus guidelines have been developed by general practitioners for the use of general practitioners caring for patients with dementia in the community.Training will take place either in the GP's own surgery or at a central location. The training will include a detailing intervention or presentation by a GP educator which will run for approximately 20 minutes. It will also include practice in the administration of the GPCOG and discussion of relevant cases. All intervention GPs will be provided with support materials and the Guidelines. Both intervention and control GPs will complete patient audits at the beginning and end of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>The waitlist or control GPs will  provide usual care to their patients. They will be mailed the support materials and the Guidelines at the end of the study, after 12 month follow up data has been collected from their patients.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>GPs are approached to participate from a randomised sequence of GP practice names. The approach is made by study personnel blind to the GP allocation. Patients are recruited by a mail out to all eligible patients on those GPs' databases. Patients and carers are interviewed by study personnel blind to the GP allocation. After recruitment and baseline interviews, allocation involves contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is “off-site”.</concealment>
    <sequence>Practices are allocated in a ratio of 2:1 to the intervention or control group. The randomisation code was developed using a computer random number generator to select random permuted blocks. The block lengths were varied randomly.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to determine whether training in and use of a brief cognitive impairment screening tool and training in dementia management guidelines can improve diagnostic rates, management techniques and patient and carer outcomes compared with General Practitioners (GPs) who are not so trained and their patients and carers who undergo usual care. It will also evaluate the benefits of screening as opposed to case finding for early dementia in general practice.</summary>
