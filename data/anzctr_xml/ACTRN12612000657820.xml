    <interventions>22 Healthy subjects will be assigned to one of the below treatment arms - 

Treatment A (N=6): Open-label intravenous (IV), 90 mg/mL x 2.4 mL (total 216 mg/ 50 mL normal saline).

Treatment B (N=8): Double-blind (6 active : 2 placebo) subcutaneous (SC), 90 mg/mL x 2 injections (1.2 mL per injection / total 216 mg per subject) or placebo administered at one location, 2 adjunct injections in one anterior upper thigh.

Treatment C (N=8): Double-blind (6 active : 2 placebo) subcutaneous (SC), 90 mg/mL x 4 injections (1.2 mL per injection / total 432 mg per subject) or placebo administered at 2 locations, 2 adjunct injections in each anterior upper thigh.

 Subjects will be randomized to Treatment A (active),
Treatment B (active), Treatment B (placebo), Treatment C (active) or Treatment C (placebo) in a ratio of 3:3:1:3:1. Randomizations will be stratified within each group equally to either the 60- &lt; 80 kg weight group or the 80-100 kg weight group .</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The absolute bioavailability of BMS-936557 following 216 mg and 432 mg SC administration compared to IV administration in healthy subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The absolute bioavailability of BMS-936557 following 216 mg and 432 mg SC administration compared to IV administration will be estimated as a ratio of dosed
normalized exposure following SC dose over that following IV dosing.

Treatment A (IV) - PK sampling will be performed on day 1 (pre-dose, 20 mins, 1 hr, 2 hrs, 6hrs and 12hrs post dose), day 2 , day 3, day 4, day 6,  day 8, day 15, day 29, day 43 and day 57 post dose.

Treatment arm B and C (SC) - PK sampling will be performed on day 1 (pre dose and 12 hours post dose) day 2 (24 &amp; 36 hrs post dose), day 3 (48 &amp; 60hrs post dose), day 4, day 5, day 6, day 8, day 15, day 29, day 43 and day 57.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics will be assessed by single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUC(0-T), dose-normalized (DN) AUC(0-T), AUC(INF), DN AUC(INF), T-HALF, CLT (IV only), CLT/F (SC only), Vz (IV only), Vss (IV only), and Vz/F (SC only).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety Outcome Measures. The following Adverse events have been reported - infections (such as skin infections, abcesses, diverticulitis) and allergic reactions to study drug. Other common side effects are - 
-Cough
-Pharyngolaryngeal pain (throat pain)
-Back pain
-Dizziness
-Pyrexia/hyperthermia (fever)
-Rash</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety assessments will be based on the following - 
- medical review of adverse event reports (screening, day-1, day 1 - 6, day 8, 15, 29, 43 and 57).
-vital sign measurements (screening, day-1, day 1, 2, 8, 15, 29, 43 and 57)
- ECGs (screening, day 1, 3, 5, and 8).
-physical examinations (screening, day-1, day 8, 29 and 57).
-clinical laboratory tests (screening, day-1, day 2, 5, 29, 43 and 57).
The incidence of observed adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Immunogenicity Measures</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected on Days 1, 15, 29, 43, and 57 for assessment of BMS-936557 antibodies</timepoint>
