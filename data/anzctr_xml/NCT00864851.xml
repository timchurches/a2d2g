  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Left Ventricular Mass Indexed to Height (LVMI) - Left ventricular mass (LVM) was measured through echocardiography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2 Max) at Peak Exercise - Exercise tolerance as measured by VO2 max at peak exercise using the standard exponential exercise protocol (STEEP).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Distance Walked in 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) - Exercise tolerance using the 6MWT was measured as the total distance walked in 6 minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF-Q) Summary Score - Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the MLHF-Q, version 2. The questionnaire is designed to assess the degree to which heart failure symptoms affect a patient's daily life. The summary score ranges from 0 to 105, with a score of 105 representing the highest adverse impact on a patient's QoL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class - The NYHA functional classification system relates symptoms to everyday activities and the patient's quality of life.
NYHA Classification - The Stages of Heart Failure:
Class I (Mild): No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class II (Mild): Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class III (Moderate): Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
Class IV (Severe): Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Plasma Globotriaosylceramide (GB3)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) - Renal function was assessed by an evaluation of change from baseline to Month 12 in eGFR as calculated using the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Urinary Albumin/Creatinine (A/Cr) Ratio</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 12 (Week 53)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety Evaluation - Adverse events were collected throughout the study, from the time of informed consent to approximately 30 days post-final infusion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>56 Weeks</timepoint>
