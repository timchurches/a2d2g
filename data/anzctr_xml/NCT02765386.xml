  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When providing amplification post-implantation to residual acoustic hearing in the implanted
      ear, the lower frequency boundary can be modified to minimize or avoid overlap between the
      frequencies coded through acoustic hearing and those presented through electrical
      stimulation. This boundary is termed the cross-over frequency (Fc) and the effect of
      modifying this parameter will be investigated in this study. To avoid the research being
      confounded by prior bias for a particular frequency allocation, the study will be conducted
      with newly implanted recipients.

      This study will also investigate whether tests which measure the ability to use low frequency
      hearing and objective measures can predict the preferred Fc and speech performance benefit.</summary>
