  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend the laboratory 11 times over 4 weeks. The first visit will be screening and involve a DEXA scan, isometric strength test an incremental exercise test (VO2max test; 10-15 min of stationary cycle exercise) during which respiratory gas will be sampled and heart rate will be monitored. In the second and last (11th) visit participants will undertake a 500 kj  (~30-45 min of exercise) performance trial on a stationary exercise bike to assess performance. The remaining visits will involve 8-12 repeated 60 s intervals of high-intensity stationary cycling (100% peak power output determined from VO2max test) with 75 s of recovery between each repetition. The number of repeats will start at 8 and be increased dependent on improvements over each session. Each session will be ~30 min and the number of repetitions will increase over the coarse of the two weeks. There will at least 1 day rest between each exercise session. On the 3rd and 10th (second to last) visit we will collect muscle, blood and urine samples before, immediately following and 3 h post exercise. A cannula and/or venepuncher will be used for sampling blood, and a bergstrom biopsy needle for collecting samples from the thigh muscle under local anaesthetic. The interventions will be delivered by trained exercise physiologists. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>ANOVA or non-parametric tests where appropriate and followed up with post-hoc tests will be used to determine differences in end points. Significance will be accepted at P&lt;0.05. 

Sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint being mitochondrial derived peptide levels and previous experience. A total of 9-10 participants will be needed to detect a 25% increase at a power of 80% and alpha value of 0.05, if we expect a mean blood level of mitochondrial derived peptide of 150 pg/ml +/- 30.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise improves health, reduces the incidents of disease and prolongs lifespan. However, the mechanisms through which exercise acts are not clear. A discovery has recently been made in rodents and cells, that mitochondria (the part of the cell that produces energy) can make peptides. Excitingly, these mitochondrial derived-peptides have systemic health promoting effects similar to exercise and may come from skeletal muscle. However, little is known about the factors regulating their levels, particularly in humans. This project aims to improve our understanding of how exercise improves health. If mitochondrial-derived peptides are identified as being endogenously regulated by exercise in humans, they have the potential to become novel targets for preventing and treating various diseases.</summary>
