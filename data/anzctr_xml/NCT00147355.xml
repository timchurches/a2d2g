  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This substudy is an open-label, randomised study comparing the uptake of recombinant
      interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving different combinations of
      antiemetics and analgesic agents during rIL-2 dosing in ESPRIT. The design is a factorial one
      with 4 arms. All patients will receive regular ibuprofen and paracetamol from days 1-6 of the
      rIL-2 dosing cycle; in addition, patients will be randomised to receive one of two antiemetic
      combinations, i.e. ondansetron or metoclopramide with or without low dose codeine phosphate
      as an additional analgesic agent.</summary>
