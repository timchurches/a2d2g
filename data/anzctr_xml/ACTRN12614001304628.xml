  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants (members of the general community) in this BPS monitoring study will be asked to complete pre-monitoring questionnaires and to wear a biometric sensor device which will be provided to them. Participants will be asked to wear the sensor device for 24 hours or up to four weeks. The sensor devices collect information such as heart rate, the number of steps taken, skin temperature, etc. While wearing the device, the participant will also be asked to respond to five mobile phone alerts per day, asking them to input how they are currently feeling and what they are doing. The biometric data and the affective (psychosocial) mobile application data will be merged and analysed. 

Participants will be able to nominate their preference as to which device they would like to use, however this will be dependent upon availability of devices. 

The app/biometric devices being used include:


Affective (Psychosocial) Mobile App
The affective mobile app is programmed so that during any given day, five randomly timed alerts, are sent to the participant asking questions about current affect, management strategies and general health and wellness questions.

BASIS watch: The BASIS watch is a wrist watch that continuously measures heart rate, skin perspiration, skin temperature, number of steps taken and sleep metrics (onset, interruptions, and wake times). Apart from wearing and recharging the watch (typically for 30 minutes every 4 days), the participant does not need to do anything else. Participants who receive the BASIS watch are asked to wear it for two to four weeks (except when showering). 

The Equivital system involves wearing a chest belt harness, as well as a galvanic skin response velcro sensor on ones finger tip, to continuously monitor heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, body position, skin temperature and galvanic skin response for 24 hours (except when showering or engaging in activity that might damage or dirty the device).

The eMotion devices (eMotion HRV and Faros 360) records and logs heart rate variability and movement data. These devices are small and the eMotion HRV does not require a chest belt; rather it contains two sensors that sit firmly on the chest. Participants will be asked to wear these devices for one 24 hour interval (except when showering).

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Affective mood states as measured by the Affective mobile app in real time. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured five times a day (random alerts) by the Affective mobile app. The completion of the survey will take between 1-3 minutes and the number of days whereby participants will be asked to complete the daily affective app survey's range from 1 day to 4 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological self report measures (PHQ-9, GAD-7, Kessler 6, Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale, Emotional Regulation Scale, Mindfulness Awareness, Perceived Stress Scale, Personality Traits, Mental Health Continuum and the Flourishing Scale) will be recorded for possible sub-group analysis, classification and predictors of biometric data patterns.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The psychological self report measures will be administered once, prior to the using the affective mobile app and wearing the biometric devices. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Data mining techniques and multivariate methods, such as pattern classification analysis, cluster analysis, orthogonal vector models and scaling methodology will be used to identify clustering biopsychosocial variables and derive predictive algorithms. Time series forecasting techniques using hidden markov models and weighted sum inference will also be deployed.   

Two hundred participants are required to be sufficiently powered to undertake the data mining activities. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to explore the relationship between different emotional states and physical changes in the body such as heart rate, skin temperature, movement levels. Being able to track emotional changes (e.g. anxiety, calmness) within each day along with physical changes (e.g., increased heart rate) will help us to better understand trigger points for health symptoms. With a large amount of emotional and physical data we will be able to begin to identify predictors of changes to well-being, as well as to develop profiles of when someone is beginning to experience a drop in well-being, for example, becoming stressed or anxious. </summary>
