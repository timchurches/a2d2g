  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgical management of the fracture involving open reduction and internal fixation using a plate.
The operation will be performed at the earliest available time after the patient has been randomised. On average the operation will take between 60 and 90 minutes to perform.  The operation will only be performed once on each patient unless there are complications requiring further surgery.
Post operatively the patients will be seen by a physiotherapist and given a guided 16 week physiotherapy program, exactly the same as that given to the control candidates.  They will commence this on the day following their operation</interventions>
    <comparator>Conservative management: sling and physiotherapy guided rehabilitation program.
This is a 16 week program consisting of progressive range of motion exercises in the initial four weeks, then introducing strengthening exercises from week five onwards. 
The patient will be seen by a trained physiotherapist who will give the patient a sheet of exercises and will supervise the patient for a 30 minute session to practice them.  The patient will be instructed to perform the exercises daily at home.  They will be seen every 1-2 weeks by the physiotherapist for a 30 minute session to ensure that they are managing the exercises and to be supplied with new ones as they advance through the program
This program is the same as the one given to the patients in the Intervention arm.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) functional scores
This is a short questionnaire completed by the patient that asks questions about the functional status of the patients upper limb.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Constant Shoulder outcome score
This is an assessment completed by the surgeon at the time of their follow up visits that scores objective measures of shoulder function, primarily strength and range of motion</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiographic fracture union
Defined as the presence of bridging trabeculae accross the fracture site on plain X rays. The x rays are taken at follow up visits until union has been demonstrated. They are reviewed by the treating surgical team.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications of treatment
These are identified at the standardised follow up visits by asking the patient and reviewing the notes.  The Follow Up data collection form specifically asks abou the presence or absence of a list of defined complications: wound problems requiring treatment, non union, symptomatic malunion and complex regional pain syndrome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Recorded at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Return to work
At each follow up visit the patient is asked for the date that they returned to work.  Once this date has been recorded it does not need to be re-recorded on subsequent visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of return to work recorded at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to identify whether the clinical outcomes of mid-shaft clavicle fractures treated with an operation involving fixation with a plate and then physiotherapy are superior to those treated with physiotherapy alone.
The study hypothesis is that there will be no difference in outcomes between the two groups at one year after their injury and subsequent treatment.</summary>
