  <interventions>
    <interventions>The whole surgery is performed through the vaginal route and includes the following components: Anterior vaginal mesh (anterior Prolift system) repair, Sacrospinous hysteropexy and posterior fascial plication. The anterior Prolift system is a transvaginal surgical kit designed for the treatment of anterior vaginal wall prolapse. It consists of a synthetic mesh graft with four arms. The graft is placed between the bladder and the anterior vaginal wall without tension and the arms retrieved through the Obturator foramen using special trocars. This surgical procedure is a 'one off' procedure.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to evaluated the efficacy and safety of anterior vaginal mesh repair, sacrospinous hysteropexy and posterior fascial plication in the management of anterior compartment dominated uterovaginal prolapse. Patients demographics, medical and obstetric history, previous surgeries, pre-operative POP-Q and peri-operative information were collected. Post-operative patient evaluation occurred at six weeks and six-monthly thereafter and included pelvic examination (POP-Q), patients satisfaction and 2 additional questions: would you have chosen again to undergo this surgery? and would you recommend this surgery to a friend with a similar condition? The primary outcome measure of this study was the objective success rate, defined as less than stage 2 prolapse at all compartments. Secondary outcome measures included subjective success rate (defined as no prolapse sensation), patients satisfaction, functional (bladder, bowel and sexual) outcomes and complication rates.</summary>
