  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage Change From Baseline in Penile Curvature - A negative value in the percentage change from baseline in penile curvature deformity (angle measured in degrees) indicates less curvature.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Peyronie's Disease Bother Domain of the Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) - Peyronie's disease bother score range 0 (no issue or not at all bothered) to 4 (extremely bothered) on 4 questions; total score range 0 to 16.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>No subject should be enrolled until all eligibility criteria have been satisfied. Subjects
        who receive placebo in a previous Auxilium-sponsored study may enroll in this study
        provided they continue to meet the eligibility requirements. To qualify for the study a
        subject must:

          1. Be a male and be = 18 years of age

          2. Be in a stable relationship with a female partner/spouse for at least 3 months before
             screening and be willing to have vaginal intercourse with that partner/spouse

          3. Have symptom(s) of Peyronie's disease for at least 12 months before the first dose of
             study drug and have evidence of stable disease as determined by the investigator

          4. Have penile curvature of at least 30° in the dorsal, lateral, or dorsal/lateral plane
             at screening. It must be possible to delineate the single plane of maximal curvature
             for evaluation during the study

          5. Be judged to be in good health, based upon the results of a medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory profile

          6. Voluntarily sign and date an informed consent agreement approved by the Institutional
             Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC). The subject must also sign an
             authorization form to allow disclosure of his protected health information (PHI). The
             PHI authorization form and informed consent form may be an integrated form or may be
             separate forms depending on the institution

          7. Be able to read, complete and understand the various rating instruments in English or
             the appropriate local language for the country in which the study is being performed.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>A subject will be excluded from study participation if he:

          1. Has a penile curvature of less than 30° or greater than 90° at the screening visit

          2. Has any of the following conditions:

               -  Chordee in the presence or absence of hypospadias

               -  Thrombosis of the dorsal penile artery and/or vein

               -  Infiltration by a benign or malignant mass resulting in penile curvature

               -  Infiltration by an infectious agent, such as lymphogranuloma venereum

               -  Ventral curvature from any cause

               -  Known active hepatitis B or C

               -  Known immune deficiency disease or be positive for human immunodeficiency virus
                  (HIV)

          3. Has previously undergone surgery for Peyronie's disease

             accurately measure the subject's penile deformity after administration of
             prostaglandin E1 or trimix

          5. Has a calcified plaque as evident by appropriate radiographic evaluation, penile x-ray
             or penile ultrasound that would prevent proper injection of study medication (penile
             ultrasound only in EU countries). Non-contiguous stippling of calcium is acceptable
             for inclusion provided the calcium deposit does not interfere with the injection of
             AA4500 into the plaque

          6. Has an isolated hourglass deformity of the penis

          7. Has the plaque causing curvature of the penis located proximal to the base of the
             penis, so that the injection of the local anesthetic would interfere with the
             injection of AA4500 into the plaque

          8. Has previously received alternative medical therapies for Peyronie's disease
             administered by the intralesional route (including, but not limited to, steroids,
             verapamil, and the naturally occurring low molecular weight protein, interferon-a2b)
             within 3 months before the first dose of study drug or plans to use any of these
             medical therapies at any time during the study

             oral (including, but not limited to, vitamin E [&gt; 500 U], potassium aminobenzoate
             [Potaba], tamoxifen, colchicine, pentoxifylline, over-the-counter erectile dysfunction
             medications, or steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or topical routes (including, but
             not limited to, verapamil applied as a cream) within 3 months before the first dose of
             study drug or plans to use any of these medical therapies at any time during the study

         10. Has had extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) for the correction of Peyronie's
             disease within the 6-month period before screening or plans to have ESWT at any time

         13. Has significant erectile dysfunction that has failed to respond to oral treatment with
             phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors

         14. Has a penile Duplex Doppler ultrasound evaluation at screening that shows compromised
             penile hemodynamics that in the opinion of the investigator is clinically significant

         15. Has uncontrolled hypertension, as determined by the investigator

         16. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other significant medical
             condition, which in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unsuitable for
             enrollment in the study

             completion of all scheduled study visits

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a Phase 3, open-label study of the safety and efficacy of AA4500 0.58 mg in
      subjects with Peyronie's disease. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 21
      days before the initial injection of study drug in the first treatment cycle.

      After up to four treatment cycles, each subject will be followed for additional safety and
      efficacy assessments on Days 168 (± 7 days) and 252 (± 7 days) (nominal weeks 24 and 36).

      After the final injection of each treatment cycle, the investigator will model the plaque in
      an attempt to stretch or elongate the plaque. If the subject's penile curvature is reduced to
      &lt;15° after the first, second, or third cycle of injections or if the investigator determines
      further treatment is not clinically indicated (eg, adverse events; allergic reaction),
      subsequent treatment cycles will not be administered.

      Approximately 300 subjects will be enrolled.</summary>
