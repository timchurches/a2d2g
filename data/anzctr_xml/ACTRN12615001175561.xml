  <interventions>
    <interventions>75 mg of oral Pregabalin will be self-administered twice daily commencing 5 days before the participant's operation and continuing for 15 days after the operation including operation day. The trial participant receives a total of 42 doses of 75 mg Pregabalin over a total 21 days.

The Pregabalin will be delivered via the oral route in the form of a tablet (size and colour matched placebo will be used). Adherence to the dosing scheme will be monitored via Participant Diaries. These diaries will be checked at all visits (pre-op, operative, post-op). 

Adherence to the dosing scheme will also be monitored via a 'calling plan.' Participants will be called 6, 3 and 1 day before their operation to check they are taking their medication appropriately. They will also be called 4, 8 and 12 days after their operation for the same reason. This plan helps to avoid the circumstance of an individual being excluded from the results due to poor compliance. A participant will be considered non compliant if they miss a total of 8 doses or if they miss 4 consecutive doses. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is a placebo drug of the same appearance, colour and size as the Pregabalin drug. It will also be self-administered twice daily from 5 days pre-operation to 15 days post-operation for a total of 42 doses over 21 days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the effect of usual care analgesia plus 75 mg twice daily, oral Pregabalin for 5 days pre- and 15 days post-surgery when compared with usual care analgesia plus matching placebo. This comparison will be tested in the treatment of arthroscopic or minimally invasive shoulder surgery, in terms of average rest pain, measured by a VAS Pain score obtained 2 weeks post-operatively.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation will be concealed by computerised randomisation and generation of opaque numbered envelopes which will be secured in the hospital compounding pharmacy. Only pharmacy staff administering medication will be unblinded. The investigators conducting recruitment will allocate a trial number to be taken to the pharmacy for the random allocation of treatment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants who meet all criteria for enrolment will be randomised to double-blind treatment at Visit 1, using standard random permuted blocks. The Trial Biostatistician will create a spreadsheet with assignment for each trial participant number. The study coordinator will then be responsible for the physical formation of the trial envelopes, which will be kept within the compounding pharmacy. Therefore, the allocation of "Pregabalin" vs "Placebo" is randomised and each new participant is allocated the next available trial participant number. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is based on the primary objective: to compare the efficacy of Pregabalin 75 mg twice daily plus standard care analgesia with that of standard care analgesia alone, on the change in pain severity from baseline to 2 weeks in terms of average rest pain two weeks post-operative, as measured on an VAS scale recorded in the participants diary.
In regard to the existing literature, Singla et al. (2015), found no statistically significant difference in average pain scores between Pregabalin 150mg and Placebo group, 72 hours post surgery (effect size equal to a difference between means of 0.04 of the pooled standard deviation).  On the other hand, Jain et al. (2012), using a self-reported pain measure found an effect size of 1.50 standard deviation difference between Pregabalin and Placebo groups, although the sample sizes were small (20 per group) and so the results may not be typical.  A recent review found general group differences to be of the order of half a standard deviation, and so in the interests of conservatism, an effect size of half a standard deviation difference between the post-test (14 days) means for the two groups would be expected. This effect size is equal to a medium difference according to the conventional criteria of Cohen (1998). 
As specified below, the statistical analysis of pre-test and post-test data will be based on the ANCOVA framework. A statistical power analysis of ANCOVA was therefore performed using the method of Aberson (2010). Assuming no correlation between baseline and post-test (14 days) VAS Pain scores, (functionally equivalent to a simple independent samples t-test between the two treatment groups at post-test), and a 2 tailed p-value of 0.05, a sample size of 70 patients per group would lead to a power of 80%. 

The Pearson correlation between baseline and post-test is herein assumed to be the same for both treatment groups. This assumption will be explicitly test for, but there is no clinical or theoretical reason why the correlations would be assumed to be different. As there is little theoretical reason for specifying a particular correlation, we employ the conventional criteria of Cohen (1998), with a baseline  post-test correlation of 0.10 being regarded as small, 0.30 as medium and 0.50 as large. 

The power figures associated with these correlations would be 83.7%, 86.6% and 92.9% respectively. Allowing for 10% drop-out or attrition by two-weeks, the resulting figure of 77.8 (70/0.90) can be conservatively rounded to 80, therefore 80 participants per treatment group would be required. 

Mean changes from baseline in efficacy measures will be analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) within a general regression framework such as the multilevel or generalized estimating equation approach to repeated measures. Fishers exact test will be used to compare the incidence of Serious Adverse Events, discontinuation due to adverse events and TEAEs in the two treatment groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to assess whether Pregabalin is an effective pain medication for patients recovering from shoulder surgery. Pregabalin is a type of medication proven to be effective at treating certain types of pain and it is currently being used by many shoulder surgeons for their patients, however, there is yet to be any published scientific proof that Pregabalin is effective in these patients. This study aims to determine whether this medication is effective for these patients and reduces their overall pain during the period from 5 days before their operation to two weeks after their operation. </summary>
