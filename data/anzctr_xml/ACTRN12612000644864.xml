    <interventions>Providing patients receiving enteral nutrition with a standard enteral formula (that is in current use in Australia) of either lower or higher FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) content.  The FODMAP content of the lower formula is 11.9g/L and the higher is 48.2g/L.  The enteral nutrition regimen including required dose and mode of delivery will be prescribed by the unit dietitian.  The study duration will be for up to seven days or the development of diarrhoea.</interventions>
    <comparator>Lower FODMAP enteral formula of 11.9g/L compared to higher FODMAP enteral formula of 48.2g/L.  Both formulas are standard formulas in current use in Australia.  The enteral nutrition regimen including required dose and mode of delivery will be prescribed by the unit dietitian.  The study duration will be for up to seven days or the development of diarrhoea.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients who are referred to the unit dietitian for commencement of enteral nutrition will be approached to participate in the trial.  If enrolled, patient will receive an enteral nutrition regimen as prescribed by the unit dietitian, but randomised to one of two standard formulas; one of lower FODMAP content or one of higher FODMAP content.  If the patient is unable to consent to study participation, the person responsible will be approached for consent.  

The unit dietitian will know (and order) the identity of the formula.  The study investigator who will collect data on faecal output will be blinded to the formula that is received.  The formulas will be delivered to the ward, hung and administered in opaque bags by the foodservice staff to prevent the study investigator from identifying the formula.  The formulas will be labelled and referred to in documentation as 'Formula A' or 'Formula B'.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomised by a computer-generate sequence.  They will only receive one formula.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to provide patients receiving enteral nutrition with a lower or higher FODMAP formula and monitor the proportion of patients that develop diarrhoea.  We hypothesise that the lower FODMAP formula will prevent the development of diarrhoea.</summary>
