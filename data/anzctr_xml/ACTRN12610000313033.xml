  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although most patients with different haematological disorders present with either bleeding or clotting, there is little known about how patients develop these complications and what risk factors are involved. 

Platelets are an essential component of haemostais to stop bleeding and also in case of their activation may give rise to thrombosis. 

So it is important to study the role of platelet-function and activation in the patients who are diagnosed with different haematological disorders/cancers and receiving treatment.

Studying platelets function and activation with various new techniques will give us a better understanding of platelets activity in haematological malignancies such as leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma or other haematological disorders who present to the Launceston General Hospital (LGH), Tasmania, Australia. 

With the help of the Flow Cytometer and also as a part of PhD degree at University of Tasmania (UTAS), School of Human Life Sciences, we are aiming to establish different methods of studying platelets activation and function in different haematological malignancies in order to examine the theory of these malignancies and rheir association with platelet activation and or dysfunction.  

Significance of the Project:
The availability of fluorescent monoclonal antibodies and probes provides a powerful tool for the investigation of platelet function by flow cytometry.  To date, most platelet function analysis by flow cytometry has focused on the involvement of platelets in thrombotic disorders and acute coronary syndromes.  One area where research has been limited is in oncology patients, including those with malignant e.g. leukaemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and benign e.g. immuno thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenic purpura, haematological disorders, where patients usually present with either bleeding or thrombosis symptoms. It is well documented that bleeding is quite common in these patients often leading to more intensive platelet intervention and sometimes poorer prognosis. Thrombocytopenia is usually evident due to the late diagnosis of disease with subsequent marrow replacement or as a consequence of the treatment. However, the effect of platelet dysfunction may also contribute more significantly than is currently known. 

Patients with haematological disorders who bleed often receive platelet transfusions. Although this approach usually rectifies the bleeding to suggest the defect is quantitative, it is not known whether abnormal platelet function also contributes to the bleeding diathesis in these patients. Indeed, this is yet to be corroborated given that donor platelets are initially healthy and unaffected when transfused so offer both volume and functionality to the patient before disease or drug regimens have any affect on them.</summary>
