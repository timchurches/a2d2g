    <interventions>Brief name: anal swab

Kidney transplant recipients attending routine review appointments will be approached to participate. They will be provided a participant information and consent form (PICF) detailing the purpose, methods and risks and benefits of the study. The study will include adults willing and able to give informed consent in English. Consented participants will complete an initial coded demographic and behavioural questionnaire. Trained staff will then take an anal swab taken using a moistened Dacron swab for subsequent HPV testing. The Dacron swab will be vigorously eluded into a ThinPrep (Hologic) vial containing PreservCyt fixative medium. Any participant with either a significant cytological abnormality, or in whom high risk HPV is detected, will be referred for further investigation at a specialist clinic. A letter will be sent to participants with negative or low-risk results as well as their nominated GP.

This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of collecting potentially sensitive behavioural data, taking anal swab specimens and performing rectal examinations, in order to identify those at high risk of serious disease. </interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any correlations between virological or cytological results, via anal swab analysis and demographic or behavioural characteristics highlighted from the baseline questionnaire.

The HPV prevalence of all the participants, to include the prevalence for any HPV infection and also separate analysis of low-risk, high-risk and individually, once the study is completed further sub analysis for transplant status, length of time on immunosuppression and behavioural factors. Prevalence of cytologically confirmed LSIL and HSIL will be calculated in the same fashion. Risk factors for prevalent HPV infection and HSIL will be analysed using logistic regression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility of providing screening for human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the anus in patients who have had or who are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant at Westmead Hospital. The trial also aims to provide initial estimates of the prevalence of HPV infection in this population.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged over 18 years, and you have had or are on the waiting list for a kidney transplant at Westmead Hospital.

Study details
At a routine assessment visit, all participants will complete a questionnaire for demographic and sexual behaviour information, and have an anal swab taken. The sample will be analysed for different types of HPV infection and to see if any abnormal cells are present. Any participant with either a significant cytological abnormality, or in whom high risk HPV is detected, will be referred for further investigation at a specialist clinic.

It is hoped that this trial will provide information on whether it is feasible to collect this information in transplant recipients, as well as providing initial estimates of the prevalence of HPV.</summary>
