  <interventions>
    <interventions>Active Team is gamified physical activity intervention delivered via mobile phone application (app). The app utilises online social networking platform, Facebook, to connect users to at least two of their existing friends, who form a team. During the 100 day intervention, participants are provided with a pedometer and the Active Team app. They are encouraged to wear the pedometer for all waking hours and aim to take at least 10,000 steps per day. The app also contains social and gamified features, such as the ability for team members to challenge each other to walking-based challenges or send virtual gifts to one another. Server logs of page views and activity in the app will be used to determine engagement with the app.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control condition: Participants allocated to this condition utilise a basic version of the Active Team mobile phone application. As in the intervention condition, participants are provided with a pedometer to measure their step counts which they are encouraged to record in the apps calendar function. Unlike in the intervention condition, however, the basic app does not contain any social or gamification features. 

Wait list control: participants in this condition are wait listed for the duration of the study. These participants are given the opportunity to access the intervention after they have completed the 9 month follow up assessment.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants are allocated to conditions based on an allocation schedule that is held by an independent allocation officer (an administrative staff member), who has no direct involvement with the study. Following the enrollment of a team of participants into the study, the researchers will contact the allocation officer who will randomly allocate those participants into one of the three conditions. Researchers will not have direct access to the allocation schedule. </concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomization will be used. The allocation officer will generate randomly sequenced blocks (of random length), using a random number generator website (random.org). </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis that was used to determine minimum sample size:
The G power statistical program was used to calculate minimum sample size to detect a significant difference (alpha=0.01, beta=0.2) with a small to moderate effect size if one exists. This analysis indicated that a minimum sample size of 440 is required.  

Statistical analysis that will be used to analyse results: 
All statistical analysis will be conducted using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v21. 
Primary analysis: the SPSS mixed models function will be used to assess the direction and statistical significance of changes in objective physical activity and secondary outcomes (quality of life, mental health, and constructs of social cognitive theory) between the three time points (baseline, 3 months, and 9 months). 

Secondary analysis: mediation analysis will be used to determine the effect of user engagement with the intervention, on intervention efficacy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical inactivity is a leading cause of disease and premature death worldwide. 
To address this, a growing area of interest is web-based physical activity interventions, which have the potential to reach large numbers of users at relatively low costs, and to effectively change behaviour. At the forefront are interventions capitalising on online social networks and gamification. The current study aims to test the efficacy of 'Active Team', a purpose-built, gamified physical activity intervention that connects users to each other via their Facebook profiles and is delivered via mobile phone application.
