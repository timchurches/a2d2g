  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observation of airways resistance in patients that are mechanically ventilated.
Two groups of patients will be selected, patients with normal lungs and patients with lower airway obstruction(COAD and asthma)
Each patient will be placed on controlled mechanical ventilation, in SIMV and progressively smaller diameter endotracheal tubes will be inserted into the existing endotracheal tube for a period of less than one minute.
Measurements of flow and volume and determination of resistance will be determined.
The patients will have these measurements done within an hour.
The patients will be recruited when they are in intensive care. The recruitment will therefore not be planned. Only when patients are deemed suitable candidates by their existing ventilation will a relative be contacted for consent purposes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During mechanical ventilation, increased upper airway resistance may be due to a partial obstruction of the
artificial airway or a large airway abnormality. Increased lower airway resistance is usually due to acute or
chronic airways disease. Either of these problems can lead to increased work of breathing, uncoordinated
ventilator support, respiratory distress and difficulty weaning. Recognition of these problems can lead to
important interventions such as bronchoscopy, artificial airway change or reposition, bronchodilator therapy
and change of ventilation strategy that can improve patient distress and safety. Quantification of these
variables can allow assessment of severity and the response to intervention.
Our hypotheses are that
1. the most valuable variable for quantifying reduced expiratory airflow will be the passive expiratory volume
expired during the first second of expiration PEV1 expressed as a percentage of the Vt (PEV1/Vt ratio). This
is similar to the well recognised standard of FEV1/VC ratio from spirometric quantification of (lower) airflow
obstruction.
2. the most valuable variable for quantifying increased inspiratory resistance during VCV with decelerating
inspiratory flow or during PCV will be the difference between the Paw and calculated Palv during early
inspiration divided by the inspiratory flow at that time.
3. Upper airway obstruction will be distinguished from and lower airway obstruction by a higher inspiratory
resistance relative expiratory resistance
We propose to examine these hypotheses in patients with normal lungs with added inspiratory resistances
and in patients with lower airway obstruction (COAD or asthma) to show whether measurements of flow and
volume are independent of or can account for ventilator pattern (flow rate, flow pattern, tidal volume) and can
recognise and quantify both increasing resistances in large (upper) airways and lower airway obstruction to
distinguish between them.
Methods
Two patient groups will be selected based on the following lung pathology
1. Normal Lungs: 20 mechanically ventilated patients with no significant underlying lung disease and no
significant lung injury will be selected.
Each will be studied to provide a normal values of the resistance measurements.
Then each will be given a series of 3 upper airway resistances for a period of less than a minute to mimic
large airway obstruction (similar to a partially blocked endo-tracheal or tracheostomy tube). This will be
achieved by placing a 10 cm sterilized flexible tube in the endo-tracheal or tracheostomy tube to simulate a
residual diameter equivalent to an ETT size (internal diameter) 6, 4.5 and 3 mm. This is little different to and
carries no more risk than routine patient suctioning where the artificial airway is partly occluded to a similar
degree for a short time
2. Lower airway obstruction (COPD, Asthma): 20 mechanically ventilated patients with known obstructive
airways disease (lower airway obstruction)
Each patient group will be placed in controlled mechanical ventilation and given the same series of
ventilatory patterns to determine the reliability of the measurements of inspiratory and expiratory resistance
measurements under different ventilatory conditions</summary>
