  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study period extends over 14 weeks, which includes  a 2 week screening period, 8 weeks of treatment, and a follow up visit 4 weeks after the final dose has been administered.  Dose-escalating study of oral lisdexamfetamine from a minimum of 100mg/day to a maximum of 250mg/day and then decreased over the 8 week treatment period to establish safety profile in adults with methamphetamine dependence.  Study drug to be dispensed daily at study site drug treatment centre.  Participants and dispensing staff will be aware of dose-escalation, but will be blinded as to when dose is escalated to reduce expectancy effects.  Participants will also be offered weekly counseling, but participation in the trial is not contingent on this.  </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine dependence.  There is a theoretical basis that drugs similar to methamphetamine, such lisdeamfetamine, may allow dependent users to stablise their use.  Currently, there is no data on what dose of lisdexamfetamine is safe for people who are habituated to methamphertamine use.  This study aims to ascertain the safety of giving a higher dose, while also looking for any change in methamphetine use or risk behaviours while taking the study drug.  </summary>
