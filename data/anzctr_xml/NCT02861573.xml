    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      combination therapy in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
      There will be three cohorts in this study with 70 participants enrolled in each cohort:
      Cohort A will receive pembrolizumab + olaparib, Cohort B will receive pembrolizumab +
      docetaxel + prednisone, and Cohort C will receive pembrolizumab + enzalutamide. Outcome
      measures will be assessed individually for each cohort.</summary>
