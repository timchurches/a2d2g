  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project using telehealth will investigate the effect of online support to the homes or primary residence of aged and palliative care patients and carers. The project will involve the provision of an iPad, with specially designed applications. The iPad home screen will have all the options loaded that are specific to the project with all other Apple applications removed. There will be an application for the patient and one for the carer. There will be a 'contact nurse' function, as well as a Facetime button to facilitate video conferencing between the nurse and patient or carer. Cisco jabber is loaded onto the iPad as the virtual case conferencing platform. The community nurse will organise a virtual clinic with the patient as part of a monitoring function and this time will be scheduled with the patient as clinically indicated. The patient is asked to complete the symptom severity tool that is loaded into the patient application function each day. An increase in symptom scores will send an automatic email alert to the community nurse who will respond when able. The patient and carer will be taught how to assess the patient functional status and this will be recorded weekly. A drop in functional score below 70% signals the need for a virtual case conference between all key health care providers. The patient and carer will be informed of the working hours of the nurse as this is not a 24 hour service, so routine provisions to access the On call service will be in place to support out of hours and on weekends.   This project will not only facilitate regular and responsive online access to health professionals but will provide brokered access to quality information and resources to support palliative care patients and their carers. The education is loaded onto both the patient and carer application functions. This information is provided from the website CareSearch and is peer reviewed and evidenced based. The types of information provided include how to access community services, general information on how to care for someone with a life limiting illness, and information on Advance Care Planning. The palliative care service will test if use of information technology can be incorporated into current care processes and whether this will reduce service requirements and/or increase the number of patients that can be managed in the community as well as sustaining a patient at home for the same time or longer.
The formal project will conclude at the end of May 2014 however all patients will remain supported via this technology until death. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the impact of a telehealth-based intervention on nursing time and unplanned/emergency health care utilisation in the care of palliative care patients. This will be achieved through the patient maintining a diary about health care utilisation. The nurse will record and monitor all visits undertaken through the telehealth forum and data will be assessed for median length of time for contact and saved travel time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>assessed weekly and as needed as alerted by the patient or their caregiver.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the potential of a telehealth-based intervention in replacing current usual care. Current usual care requires a face to face home visit of the patient by the nurse. At the home visit the symptom severity score and Australian Karnofsy Performance Score (AKPS) are recorded. These tools have been loaded onto the patient's i Pad and they are instructed in how to complete these on a daily and weekly basis. Once completed any deviation in scoring is automatically flagged to the nurse via an email alert. This functionality enables a responsive service determined on changing patient need.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The nurse will enter the data from all telehealth visits into a data sheet held by the website CareSearch every time there is a telehealth contact. The nurse will monitor the patient daily to ensure the symptom scores have been completed. Failure to complete the scores will result in the nurse making contact with the patient or carer.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the acceptability and utility of telehealth-based measures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>An initial survey regarding participant comfort in using technology will be conducted at baseline and ongoing user acceptability will be reviewed fortnightly.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine longitudinal changes of activity via the wearing of the Fitbit  in palliative care patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fitbit data is automatically synchronised to the patients iPad and is available daily. Data will be reviewed weekly to look at trends over time.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Until January 2014, only Area 4 patients with the National Broadband Network (NBN) connections will be enrolled. Area 4 covers the postcodes from Noarlunga Centre to Willunga on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia. After January 2014, all Area 4 patients will be enrolled and for those not able to connect to the National Broadband Network a 3G enabled iPad will be provided.
Participants must be 18 years of age or over to be eligible.

Analysis of data pertaining to staff and patient confidence and useability of telehealth interventions will be assessed using both qualitative and quantitative measures.
The number of participants arrived upon was taken from the review of the previous years referral numbers of palliative care clients from Area 4 on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Sample size calculations were not conducted as this is a finite group and the tight project timelines mean numbers needed to be determined on what could realistically be achieved in the given timeframe.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the impact of a telehealth-based intervention on service provision for palliative care patients as well as assessing its potential in replacing current usual care through increased video link contact opportunities and remote monitoring of patients and their carers at home. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, require palliative care in Seaford, Aldinga, McLaren Vale and Willunga in South Australia, and have access to a National Broadband Network (NBN) connection. Trial details: Participants in this study will be provided with regular and responsive online access to health professionals, and access to quality information and resources to support palliative care patients and their carers. Participants will be monitored on a regular and ongoing basis to determine the feasibility, acceptability and utility of the telehealth-based intervention.
