  <interventions>
    <interventions>The  one month of probiotic Salivarius BLIS K12, the dose will be  one tablet daily each  with 2 x 10 to the 9th  ( 2 x 100,000,000) colony forming units of S. Salivarius K12 plus the lyoprotectant agents trehalose, lactitol and maltodextrin, which are added to enhance the stability and viability of the bacteria. Blis K12  disolves in mouth,
and while  disolving  in mouth is preferred for efficacy, can be swallowed. Adherance will be monitored as the children are  school pupils for the 5 weekdays witnessed by teachers and community health workers and observed for 2 days by their parents</interventions>
    <comparator>One school will receive no treatment initially. The BLISS K12 probiotic intervention will be offered to this school's pupils 4-6 weeks after the first two schools start the same intervention</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the Group A Streptococcal GAS throat  colonization rate will be established  comparing  the number of  positive  GAS  throat swabs taken by community health workers, compared with the total of  all consented pupils who had a throat swab taken. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary  time points for checking throat swabs are prior to commencing the probiotic, then one month after onset of probiotic use,  then three and four month after onset of probiotic use</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome is the Group A Streptococcal GAS  Sore throat  rate. It will be established  comparing  the number of  children with BOTH positive  GAS  throat swabs  and symptomatic sore throat on questioning whether their throat is sore or comfortable prior to the swab  being taken by CHW compared with the total of  all consented pupils who had a throat swab taken. The tool willl be the throat swab, the question about throat soreness or comfort and the record of that reply matching the throat swab taken.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary time points will be just prior to the onset of the BLIS K12 trial then one month after onset of taking probiotic BLIS K12   for a month, with further secondary time points  3 and 4 month after onset  of one month course of  probiotic Blis K12.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>With a stepped wedge design, Two whole schools will be allocated to the treatment for a month to 6 weeks prior to the third school commencing. This will mean that the third schools'  two pre treatment GAS swabs  status in that period will be controls  with no active treatment for that period. They will then have identical one month  BLIS with completion, and three month after starting GAS swabs.  </concealment>
    <sequence />
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Two Geographically similar rural schools with similar demographics near 100% Maori pupils, will be assigned to the initially commencing and later commencing groups which limits the risk of confounding factors, accounting for assessed differences in Group A Streptococcal throat colonization rates. A third school Education quintile 1 but decile 2, with similar NZDeps  in the initially begininng group is urban and has 75% Maori pupils.   All schools have  mainly Maori pupils and similar Education decile 1 meaning significantly likely to have families from NZ Deprivation centiles 8,9, 10 of the age group 5-12years the most vulnerable to GAS  and complication of Acute Rheumatic fever.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Firstly to test the primary outcome of BLIS K12 impact on GAS carriage at one month, the first two  schools (whose pupils n250 start BLIS K12 first )  change in  Group A Streptococcal GAS throat carriage or colonization  rate ( asymptomatic positive swabs over total swabbed pupils) over the month  of BLIS K12 treatment will be compared to the change in rate of the untreated ( yet to be treated) control group n250 of the third school .Our assumptions for the main outcome, 20% baseline carriage, 90% consent, 85% adherence, true effect size calculated at 86% initially with measured effect size 73% and expected carriage 5.4%  we will be able to reject a null hypothesis of experimental and control rates being equal probability 0.997. An uncorrected chi squared statistic will be used to evaluate this null hypothesis. If 80% consent and 61% efficacy the study will have 83.4% power hence still a well powered study.
Secondly to test the secondary outcome the GAS  sore throat rate ( symptomatic sore throats on questioning  that are  GAS positive, divided by all throat swabs taken at that school) over the same period of the month of BLIS K12,will be compared between first two and third control yet to start school, comparing point prevalence of GAS sore throats. These two first comparisons also control for seasonal variation.
Having controlled for seasonal variation/documented how much is occuring in controls a third series of comparisons of rates will be made with n500 comparing GAS throat colonization rate (asymptomatic and symptomatic) before, after one month of intervention, 3 months after starting BLIS and for n 250 four months after starting BLIS; Fourthly comparisons of rates over time will compare GAS sore throat rate again with confidence intervals, p values.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We propose to offer a probiotic BLIS K12 to about 500 Whakatane primary school children. In small trials in Italy and Kawerau, NZ  it has decreased acute Group A Streptococcal GAS sore throats and recurrent GAS sore throats respectively, both while taken and for many months to follow. Using an open stepped wedge design we will compare GAS colonization and point prevalence of GAS sore throats as our primary outcome measures; The yet to start school  rates will be controls for the first month then participants</summary>

    <publicnotes>The first presentation refers to a local open  trial of BLIS K12 n23  in recurrent GAS infections from which we derive the likely  % change in GAS colonization and GAS sore throats for the power calculations.

The second study refers to the likely GAS colonization rate at the onset of our study  20%, based on  our similar adjacent communities in this study of Kawerau   similar demographics age, ethnicity and deprivation deciles.  </publicnotes>
