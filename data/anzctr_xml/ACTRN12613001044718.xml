  <interventions>
    <interventions>Trial B - Subjects will arrived after 5 days of controlled energy deficit diet (30 kcal/kg fat free mass (FFM) per day). All diets will be prepared by a specialized team and provided as pre-packaged meals, adherence to diet will be monitored via a check-list filled by participants. Tracer intravenous administration (L-ring-13C6 Phe) will start upon subject arrival and continue during 3 h for measurement of resting fractional synthetic rate (FSR) in calorie restriction diet intervention. Thereafter, subjects will undertake a resistance exercise bout (leg press, 6 sets, 8 reps, 80% 1 repetition maximum, 3 min rest between sets). In this trial subjects will ingest a 0 (placebo),  15 or 30 g of Whey Protein in liquied form (500 ml) immediately after the exercise and FSR will be measured between 1 and 4 h post exercise for determining the muscle anabolic response to resistance exercise after 5 days of a calorie restriction diet.

Trials C &amp; D -Subjects will arrived after 5 days of controlled energy deficit diet (30 kcal/kg fat free mass (FFM) per day). Ring-13C6 Phe infusion will begin prior to resistance exercise. At the completion of exercise, subjects will ingest either 0 (placebo),  15 or 30 g of Whey Protein in liquid form (500 ml). FSR will be measured between 1 and 4 h post exercise for determining the response after exercise to either 0, 15 or 30g of WP after 5 days of a calorie restriction diet.

The difference between trial B and C &amp; D is that trial B incorporates measurement of resting FSR prior to exercise, whereas trial C and D do not incorporate a period of resting FSR measurement. After exercise all the trials are essentially the same but the drinks will be randomized to contain either 0, 15 or 30 g of protein.

All participants will undertake all trials. The washout period between trials is 9 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Trial A  Subjects will arrive after 5 days of controlled energy balanced diet (45 kcal/kg FFM per day).  All diets will be prepared by a specialized team and provided as pre-packaged meals, adherence to diet will be monitored via a check-list filled by participants. Tracer intravenous administration (L-ring-13C6 Phe) will start upon subject arrival and continue during 3 h for measurement of resting fractional synthetic rate (FSR) under energy balance. This trial incorporates no resistance exercise intervention or protein intake.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our primary objective is to determine the effect of 5 days of dietary energy restriction (i.e. ~30 vs. the normal energy balance of ~45kcal/kg FFM/day) on muscle myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate (FSR; directly measured muscle protein synthesis) at rest as measured by primed constant infusion of ring-[13C6]phenylalanine. 

Our secondary objectives involve examining whether the anabolic stimulus of protein ingestion and resistance exercise will significantly increase FSR (post-exercise FSR).  If an exercise plus nutrition intervention rescues the deleterious effect of a hypocaloric diet on muscle FSR this will provide novel and practical information for effective weight management in which fat mass can be reduced without loss of muscle mass.</summary>
