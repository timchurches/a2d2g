          -  Written informed consent for NY-ESO-1 expression screening and gene profiling on
             resected tumor tissue and for the complete study has been obtained from the patient

             days preceding the first ASCI administration, or planned use during the study period.

             effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or
