    <healthcondition>The acute and residual effects of THC consumption will be explored in healthy volunteers (who are experienced, but non-chronic cannabis smokers).</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The level of THC administered will be 2x 3.2% THC cigarettes over a period of 12-15 minutes (16 puffs or less in total). This will be a one-off intervention undertaken during one of two testing conditions, spaced exactly 1 week apart.</interventions>
    <comparator>2x non-THC placebo (herbal) cigarettes will be administered over a period of 12-15 minutes (16 puffs or less in total). Once again, this will be a one-off intervention undertaken during one of two testing conditions spaced exactly 1 week apart.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Performance on a computer-based driving simulator and sustained vigilance task.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 minutes, 1.5 hours &amp; 4.5 hours post treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physiological measures of fatigue during computerised driving simulation and sustained vigilance task. Participants will wear specialised glasses designed to measure the number and type of blinks and saccadic eye movements made during the computer-based tasks (which then give a physiologically determined fatigue score).</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 minutes, 1.5 hours &amp; 4.5 hours post treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Performance on a battery of computer-based cognitive measures (attention, reaction time, tracking, motor coordination, etc.).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 hour 10 minutes; 2 hours 10 minutes &amp; 4 hours 10 minutes post treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Performance on a computer-based cognitive battery measuring response inhibition, decision making &amp; time perception tasks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2.5 hours post treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>THC levels in blood and saliva.

Blood will be taken via an intravenous cannula (administered by a relevantly qualified Division 1 Nurse) and THC levels will be determined via Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis. 
Saliva will collected in polypropene tubes and THC levels will be determined via Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours &amp; 6 hours post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Salivary Cortisol levels. 

Saliva will be collected in Polypropene tubes and Cortisol levels will be analysed via Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours &amp; 6 hours post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimated autonomic nervous system activity. Physiological measures including respiration, heart rate, sweating and temperature will be measured using a specialised ambulatory vest containing electrodes that are secured into place.  

The device measures (via electrodes and a portable data collection device) components of heart rate variability and  auxiliary measure of sympathetic function such as sweating.  It measures respiratory parameters via plethysmography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physiological data will be recorded continuously from baseline through to 6 hours post treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the effect of THC (active component in cannabis) on driving performance along with various measures of cognition and decision-making, fatigue, vigilance (attention) and stress during both the acute and residual phases of cannabis consumption. 

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced cross-over design means that 20 healthy participants will will attend 2 experimental conditions and smoke  either 2* THC cigarettes or 2* Placebo cigarettes at each testing session.</summary>
