  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cardiac patients at our centre currently receive either iv propofol or intravenous (iv) etomidate for anaesthetic induction, depending on their anaesthetist's preference. We will randomise 152 study participants (stratified by attending anaesthetist) to receive either iv propofol (n=76) or iv etomidate (n=76) for anaesthetic induction. All operating room (OR) staff and postoperative care staff will be blinded to the randomisation. The study will be conducted in two phases.
Phase 1: During phase 1, the anaesthetist will be aware of the study drug allocation (38 propofol, 38 etomidate, total n=76).
Phase 2: During phase 2, the anaesthetist will also be blinded to the study drug allocation (38 propofol, 38 etomidate, total n=76).

This study design will allow us to assess whether blinding the anaesthetist to the study drug in itself impacts our study outcome. All aspects of patient care, with the exception of the choice of induction drug, will be according to standard practice. Data will be collected directly from the patient notes, and extracted from the anaesthetic machine which automatically compiles physiological and dosing data during the anaesthetic.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The area below the baseline pre-induction mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), i.e. the area between the MAP curve and the line of pre-induction MAP, over the first 10 min following induction. Baseline MAP is defined as the average pre-induction MAP taken over a 3 min period immediately prior to induction. MAP will be continuously measured via an intra-arterial catheter from time of insertion (normal practice, inserted at the start of case before induction) throughout each case, and compiled automatically (every 30 s) by the SaferSLEEP system (Safer Sleep LLC, Tennessee), which is used for all anaesthetics in our hospital.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>All participants will be randomised to one or the other induction drug. All other aspects of the care will be the same (according to standard practice).
We will conduct the study in two phases.
Phase 1: all staff will be blinded to the study drug allocation, but the person administering the treatment (anaesthetist) will know the study drug allocation.
Phase 2: the study drug allocation will be concealed from all staff, including the person administering the treatment. This will allow us to assess whether the act of blinding alters the way in which anaesthetists give these drugs (and thereby potentially alter the stability of blood pressure during induction).</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacodynamics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The key efficacy measures (integral of MAP/time below a baseline defined by the pre-induction MAP, and use of vasoactive drugs within the first ten minutes after induction) will be compared between randomised groups with the stratification factor (anaesthetist) and whether the treatments were blinded as fixed factors. To test whether blinding alters the relative effects of the two randomised treatments, the interaction term (blinded treatment x randomised treatment) will be tested in the model. The MAP data will be compared between groups using a general linear model. The results will be summarised as the means difference and 95% confidence interval, derived from the general linear model. If the MAP area below pre-induction baseline is not adequately normally distributed then the data will be loge transformed prior to analysis. The use of vasoactive drugs within ten minutes of induction will be compared between groups using logistic regression. The effect will be summarised as the odds ratio with 95% confidence interval.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anaesthesia is largely standardised for cardiac patients undergoing surgery in the Green Lane Cardiac Unit at Auckland City Hospital. Anaesthesia is normally induced with either etomidate or propofol with relatively standardised use of co-induction agents such as midazolam and fentanyl. Currently there are approximately equal numbers of patients receiving propofol and etomidate. Etomidate is thought to be more stable for blood pressure than propofol in some patients. However, we do not know whether this is true. We wish to determine whether etomidate or propofol is the better drug to give for anaesthesia in cardiac patients, in terms of haemodynamic stability.  </summary>
