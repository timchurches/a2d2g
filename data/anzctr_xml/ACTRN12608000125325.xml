  <interventions>
    <interventions>Real-Time Continuous glucose monitoring with Guardian Real-Time where glucose levels are displayed on the monitor every 5 minutes. If the levels are falling at &gt;2mmol/20minutes or similarly rising at that rate, the monitor will alarm and thus appropriate interventions can be carried. Before any intervention is taken, the levels displayed are confirmed with a finger prick test. Subjects will be fitted with this monitor after surgery or the coronary event and will wear it up to 3 days post-event.</interventions>
    <comparator>Intermittant glucose testing with finger pricks that will be carried out 4-6 times a day. The results obtained will require appropriate action as specified by the hospital's existing protocol for post-operative glucose control. Subjects here will also be fitted with the continuous glucose monitor but it will be blinded so as not to reveal the levels but rather to store it for retrospective comparison. Subjects will be monitored for a period up to 3 days from the event.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In patients with type 2 diabetes, it is proven that good glucose control during stressful events like after surgery and after a heart attack helps improve the outcome. Therefore in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring insulin and undergoing stressful events, real-time continuous glucose monitoring which provides detailed information on the glucose trends may  improve glucose control compared with intermittant glucose monitoring with finger pricks shich are "snap shots" of the ever fluctuating glucose level.</summary>
