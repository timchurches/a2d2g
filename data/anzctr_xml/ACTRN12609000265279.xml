  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a randomised, parallel, intervention study with four arms: nuts, potato crisps, chocolate, control (no additional food). This study will be carried out to assess the effects of consuming energy-dense foods everyday for 12 weeks on energy balance, body weight, cardiovascular risk factors and sensory response. The foods will include 42g (1100KJ) of hazelnuts, 50g (1100KJ) of potato crisps or 50g (1100KJ) of chocolate. For the first two weeks of the study, the participants will consume their normal diet (Baseline). After this two-week period, they will be randomly allocated to one of the four groups for 12 weeks. The study lasts 14 weeks in total.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body weight. This will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition. This will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Plasma total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations will be measured by enzymatic methods using kits and calibrators supplied by Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim, Germany) on a Cobas Mira Plus Analyser. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol will be measured in the supernatant following precipitation of apoprotein B containing lipoproteins with phosphotungstate-magnesium chloride solution (Assmann et al., 1983). Plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration will be calculated using the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al., 1972).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensory specific satiety. Participants will be asked to attend a tasting session and complete a series of ballots. Firstly, they will be asked to rate their appetite indices rating (hunger, thirst, desire to eat, how much they think they could eat, fullness and preoccupation with thoughts of food) on a 100mm visual analogue scale. They will then taste six food samples (potato crisps, pretzels, hazelnuts, marshmallow, chocolate, shortbread biscuit) and rate their overall liking of each food (pre-treatment set). Following this they will be provided with either nuts, chocolate or potato crisps (depending on randomisation) that they can consume as much of the snacks as they want. Participants will repeat appetite indices rating. Finally participants will be asked to re-taste and re-rate their overall liking of the six food samples (post-treatment set). Sensory specific satiety scores for each snack are created by subtracting the mean change (mean difference between before treatment consumption and after) for overall liking for the rated sample set (not including the treatment) from the change (difference between before treatment consumption and after) for overall liking of the treatment in the rated sample set.</outcome>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment will be used. This will be achieved through allocation being performed by the statistician who will have no involvement in the enrollment process and is located in another building. Once participants have been accepted into the study, sufficient details for allocation (study number, age, sex, BMI) will be sent to the statistician who will return group allocation codes once blocks are complete.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated using random sequences of the four groups generated using SAS 9.1.3.  Due to the strong possibility of age, sex, and BMI effects, groups will be balanced using 8 strata constructed using sex (M/F), age (18-40, 41-65), and BMI (-24.9, 25-29.9) categories.  Allocation will be conducted by the "off-site" statistician within each strata. Incomplete blocks remaining at the conclusion of enrolment will be allocated first using strata based on sex and BMI and then BMI, and finally without stratification.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Public health recommendations include regular consumption of nuts. It is important to determine whether nut consumption on a daily basis results in weight gain which may negate the positive health benefits of regular nut consumption. Some previous research suggests that nuts may possess unique characteristics that prevent weight gain, even though they are high in fat and calories. No studies to date have compared regular nut consumption with regular consumption of other energy dense foods. 			

If there is something unique about nuts, which prevents weight gain, then there is the potential to include nuts in the diets of those who in particular struggle to maintain a healthy body weight, e.g. ex-smokers, yo-yo dieters, individuals with the metabolic syndrome. 

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess energy balance, body weight, cardiovascular risk factors and sensory response to the daily consumption of nuts for twelve weeks compared with the consumption of other energy-dense foods.</summary>
