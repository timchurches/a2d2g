      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Weight Z-score at Month 12 - The Z-Score indicates how many standard deviations a participant is from the population norm values. The body weight z-scores are designed to take into account the amount of weight gain that would be expected due to normal growth in children and adolescents. The body weight z-scores are by age and gender standardized values (corresponding to a normal distribution with mean 0 and a standard deviation of 1) of the actual weight measurements. Change From Baseline is calculated as value at Month 12 minus value at Baseline.</outcome>

It described whether a mean will be above or below the standard and how unusual the measurement is with range from -3 to +3; 0 =same mean, greater than (&gt;) 0 a greater mean, and less than (&lt;) 0 a lesser mean than the standard. Growth parameters were compared to a standard defined by Centers for Disease Control's growth charts.</outcome>
