Electronic scales (BabyWeigh Scale, Medela AG, Switzerland, sensitive to 2g) are used to weigh infants before and after a feed to measure milk intake. Infant body composition is measured with bioimpedance spectroscopy (SBF7, Impedimed, Brisbane, QLD, Australia) pre- and post-feed. Stomach and bladder volumes (mL) are measured with ultrasound (Toshiba Aplio XG, Japan) before and after a feed. Infants body length (cm) is measured with non-stretch type.
Resistance measurements at 0 kHz, 50 kHz and infinite frequency (R0, R50, Rinf) and resistance of intracellular water (Ricw) are analyzed with customized infant settings. Free-water volumes (mL) and free-water change (mL) are determined from stomach and bladder volumes (mL) calculated from ultrasound images. The effect of the milk intake (mL), feed duration (min), and the volume of the infants stomach and bladder (mL) on the resistance values (ohm) pre-/post-feed are assessed to establish the feasibility of using these values interchangeably during data collection.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The initial aim was to recruit 30 infants, 2 or 5 months old  for longitudinal study and 40 for cross-sectional (10 in each age group of 2, 5, 9 and 12 months old). Those recruited at 2 and 5 months were invited to continue as a part of longitudinal study. We expected to keep 80% of the cross-sectional participants (n=16) and would need extra 14 to a total of 54. We had to recruit  18 extra participants for cross-sectional study  (n=58) to achieve gender balance, thus increasing target to 72.
Sample size calculation: 
Participants with useable data were included in study Effect of milk intake (mL) and extracellular fluid reservoirs on bioimpedance (resistance, ohm) in term breastfed infants. Pilot data (n=5, two measurements under identical conditions) gave mean +/- SD within participant differences of 7.4 +/- 7.7. Using alpha = 0.05; 62 participants gives the study power of 0.8 to detect a mean difference between pre- and post-feed resistance measures of 2.4.
In an absence of any knowledge about how different two measures of %FM with bioimpedance and ultrasound skinfolds for study Determinants of body composition (percent fat mass, %) in breastfed infants using bioimpedance spectroscopy and ultrasound skinfolds  methods comparison we have taken an effect size of 0.5. To this effect size 33 participants would have given us power of 0.80. The number of participants was rounded to 40, ten in each age group. Recruitment was extended to achieve similar group sizes whilst maintaining the gender balance. Using alpha = 0.05, 58 participants give the study power of 0.94 to detect the effect size of 0.3.

Data analysis: 
Statistical analysis used R 2.9.0 1 for Mac OSX with packages nlme, irr, multcomp, lattice, ggplot2, car and MASS. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean +/-SD (range), model parameters presented as estimate (95%CI). P values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant except where an adjustment for multiple comparisons false discovery rate was performed. All tests were two-tailed. Analysis was carried out by age groups and by different sex within age.
Bioimpedance measurements were assessed for variability (CV) and repeatability (ICC, 95% CI) for a subset of infants (n=16, two per age/sex grouping). Changes in resistance pre-/post-feed (delta R) were assessed by calculating bias/95% CI for pre- versus post-feed BIS as per Bland and Altman (n=59). A 95% CI containing zero was interpreted as no consistent change. Associations between changes in resistance and predictors/covariates of interest were assessed using linear regression. Model selection used forwards stepwise selection. Age was treated as a categorical variable, and included in the models where an analysis of variance omnibus test indicated that one or more ages differed from the others. Association between infant age (factor) and pre-feed resistance were assessed using Tukeys all-pair comparisons based on OLS regression. Model appropriateness tested using standard residual diagnostics. Infant movements pre-/post-feed were compared using paired Students t-test.
One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests  were used to compare the 13 calculated sets of %FM results with distributions from each of the eight references. Each age/sex group has been compared with the most appropriate reference distributions. Raw data (n=58) was used for calculating averages to compare overall equations performances in the whole group. Some overall analyses were repeated after removing two equations with minimum (less than 1/3) matches to the references.
Linear mixed effects models with random intercept per participant were used to determine whether %FM measurements differed systematically by infant sex, infant age group, or equation. Where there were more than two levels of categorical variable, Tukeys Honest Significant Difference was used to determine which levels differed. Possible sex differences between methods were tested with interaction between sex and equation.
For study Gastric emptying (mL/min) of term fully breastfed infants feeding on demand data were checked for normal distribution showing no evidence that the data required transformation. Linear regression with two fractional polynomial terms of continuous covariates was used with the random effect of different slopes over time for each participant and the time post-feed as the fixed effects. The model accounted for the small stomach volumes/long time post-feed. The time immediately post-feed was coded as 0.5 minute not 0.0 minute as 0 is not a valid value for some of the polynomial terms. Final model was selected using the decrease in the log likelihood.
Final selected models (fractional polynomials of time, up to two terms, plus initial feed volume) were used to investigate the association between post-feed stomach volumes (dependent variable) and concentrations and doses of leptin, lactose and fat (predictors). The fractional polynomial model for protein concentration and dose failed to converge and more simplistic model was used with linear random effects vs. intercept only random effect. 
A linear regression (univariate models) was used to test relationships between stomach pre-feed residual volume, milk intake, feed duration and leptin and macronutrients concentrations and doses. Multivariate models accounting for total feed volume were used for testing relationship with feed volume dependent predictor (fat dose and concentration).
Statistical analyses for longitudinal study on the change of pesticide residues in breatmilk were performed using the SPSS software (SPSS, version 19.0 for windows, SPSS, USA). Data were presented based on volume of human milk (ng/mL) and milk fat (ng/g fat). Only values above detection limit were used. One-way ANOVA with Bonferronil and Tukey multiple comparison tests were used to compare differences in pesticides concentration between pre- and post-feed milk samples, and pesticides at different lactation stages.
Multiple linear regressions were used to analyse associations between pesticides concentration in mothers milk and maternal demographics, such as age, parity, body mass index (BMI) and body composition (% fat mass), and infants demographics, such as infants birth weight (kg), body length (cm), head circumference (cm) and baby body composition (% fat mass).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Obesity is considered to be at epidemic proportions yet data is limited for the mechanisms of breastfeeding that reduce risk of obesity later in life. In particular the influence of breastmilk components on gastric emptying rate, appetite control and body composition in term infants is largely poorly understood. Furthermore an accurate non-invasive methodology to measure infant body composition is required to identify infants at risk of obesity.
Aims: This study aims to investigate the relationship between infant gastric emptying rate and the composition of the consumed breastmilk, with the focus on milk proteins (whey and casein fractions), appetite hormones such as leptin and adiponectin and POPs. Further associations between breastmilk components and infant body composition will be investigated with the accent on longitudinal study. New methods of measuring infant body composition (ultrasound skinfolds) will be developed.

Objectives: 
1.	To establish possible longitudinal associations between breastmilk macronutrients and components and both infant and maternal body composition. 
2.	To investigate and describe gastric emptying of term fully breastfed infants feeding on demand and establish possible associations with breastmilk composition.
3.	To establish effect of milk intake and extracellular fluid reservoirs on bioimpedance in term breastfed infants I order to evaluate the possibility to use pre- and post-breastfeed measurements interchangeably.
4. To determine body composition (percent fat mass, %) of breastfed infants using bioimpedance spectroscopy and ultrasound skinfolds and to compare performance of these two methods in term breastfed infants.
5. To determine pesticide residues concentration in human milk during the first year of lactation and establish possible associations between pesticide residues in breastmilk and demographic factors of breastfeeding dyads.</summary>
