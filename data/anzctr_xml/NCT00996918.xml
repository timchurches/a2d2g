  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Reporting a Serious Adverse Event. - Safety was measured according to standard adverse event collection as described in the Adverse Event Section of the Results. Complete tables of events are provided there.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Week 195</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Base Study Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assesment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog/11) at Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 and 78. - The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension.This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Base Study Baseline in Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Score at Weeks 13, 26, 39, 52 and 78. - The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Base Study Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score at Weeks 26, 52 and 78. - NPI:12-domain caregiver assessment of behavioral disturbances occurring in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, appetite/eating, nighttime behavior. Severity (1=Mild to 3=Severe), frequency (1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score (range 0-144); higher score=greater behavioral disturbances; negative change score from baseline=improvement.</outcome>
