  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to surgery will be treated by insertion of a reverse total shoulder arthroplasty within 28 days of the date of injury. This procedure usually takes 2 hours to perform. Surgical technique (approach, version, component fixation and prosthesis choice) will be left to the discretion of the treating consultant orthopaedic surgeon. The glenosphere will be placed low, avoiding superior tilt. The tuberosities will be repaired using nonabsorbable sutures. The arm will be placed in a shoulder immobilizer (either in internal rotation or some external rotation at the discretion of the treating surgeon). Post operatively patients will be instructed on elbow wrist and hand exercises to commence immediately. After two weeks pendular exercises and passive flexion to 90 and passive external rotation to neutral will be commenced. Unrestricted passive, active assisted exercises will be allowed, graduating to active mobilisation (as tolerated) at 6 weeks. Resisted range of motion exercises will be allowed after 12 weeks. A minimum of 5 physiotherapy one on one face to face contacts within 3 months of treatment will be required. Patients will perform self-guided exercises every day as instructed in their face-to-face sessions. The exact duration, timing and structure of the physiotherapy sessions is not specified. The design of the trial reflects the heterogeneity of rehabilitation practices in common usage. 
Patients who do not consent to be randomised will be offered participation in the 	observational arm of the study. Their treatment will consist the same two treatment options as the RCT arm. Treatment will be decided by patient preference as per usual 	practice at each institution. Treatment protocols, follow up and outcome measures will be the same as the randomised arm. The outcome of this arm of the trial will be analysed separately.
The physiotherapy regime in the observational arm of the study is identical to that of the randomised trial.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>The study will be a combined a randomized and observational study
The core study will be a multi-centre prospective randomised controlled trial.
Patients who do not consent to be randomised will be offered participation in the 	observational arm of the study. The outcome of this arm of the trial will be analysed separately. The use of an observational preference arm in addition to the core RCT addresses criticisms of selection bias in the RCT by following non-randomised patients, and increases generalisability by following a large cohort of patients receiving the same treatment options as the RCT, as part of usual care. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size 	calculation
Case series documenting the outcome after reverse shoulder arthroplasty have shown a standard deviation (SD) of 13 in the ASES score. The minimum important clinical difference (MICD) in ASES scores has been estimated to be 6.4-18. We consider a difference of 10 to be necessary in order to justify the additional costs and risks of surgery. A total of 60 patients (30 in each group) will provide 80% power to detect a MICD of 10 points at significance of 0.5%.  We aim to recruit 72 patients to allow for 20% loss to follow-up.

Statistical analysis
Differences in baseline characteristics (i.e., intrinsic and injury-related variables) 	between both intervention groups will be assessed using the student s t-test (parametric continuous data), Mann-Whitney U-test (nonparametric continuous data) 	or Chi-square test (categorical data). 
Unadjusted analysis by intention-to-treat will be performed to test the difference in primary and secondary outcomes between the intervention groups. Student s t-test (parametric continuous data), Mann Whitney U-test (nonparametric continuous data) or Chi-square analysis (categorical data) will be used. A p-value &lt; 0.05 (2-sided tests) 	will be taken as threshold of statistical significance.
The observational arm will be analysed separately, comparing the same treatment groups against the same outcomes using multivariable linear regression to adjust for potential confounders

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Humeral neck fractures account for 5% of fractures of the appendicular skeleton and are the 3rd commonest osteoporotic fracture occurring with an incidence of 6.6 per 1000 person year. There is a unipolar age distribution with most occurring in the elderly independent population with osteoporosis who fall from a standing height. This incidence is set to increase in the next 20 years as a result 	of population growth. 49-85% of proximal humeral fractures are minimally displaced and are usually treated non-operatively with most having good outcome regardless of comminution. The poorer outcomes associated with displaced, multi-part fractures has led surgeons to investigate operative alternatives.
Studies have not shown a clear benefit from surgical fracture fixation using a variety of implants compared to non-operative treatment because of fracture severity and the difficulty in achieving stable fixation in osteoporotic comminuted (fragmented) bone. Newer fixation devices (locking plates), which have some advantages in osteoporotic bone, have been subject to randomized trials, but have not been shown to improve outcome.
Replacement of the fractured humeral head (hemiarthroplasty) is another treatment 	option, but has not been shown to be clearly superior to non-operative treatment or plate fixation.
Recently, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (replacement) has been used to treat these fractures, with several case series published. This prosthetic design negates the effect of tuberosity malunion and nonunion that are common after internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty by creating a mechanical advantage for the deltoid muscle to allow active forward elevation and abduction. Studies comparing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty to hemiarthroplasty have shown improved pain scores and functional outcomes after reverse shoulder 	arthroplasty.  As a result the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty for the treatment of proximal humeral fractures is increasing. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty has been reported to have a high complication rate including instability, loosening, poor rotation and radiological notching. The risk of complications and prosthetic longevity limits the use of reverse shoulder arthroplasty in young patients 	with most prostheses being inserted in patients over 65. 
No comparative trial has been performed to test the effectiveness of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty against non-operative treatment.
