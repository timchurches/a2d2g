Experimental: Aflibercept / Arm 1 - Subjects with macular edema secondary to CRVO will be treated with the study drug intravitreal aflibercept.


Treatment: drugs: Eylea (Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye, BAY86-5321)
The recommended dose for intravitreal aflibercept is 2 mg equivalent to 50 µL Study treatment will be administered at baseline and at monthly intervals until stabilization of disease. When stability is achieved, the treatment interval can be extended based on visual and anatomic outcomes as judged by the treating investigator.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) occurs when the main blood vessel that transports blood
      away from the retina (the very back portion of the eye) becomes blocked, causing the leakage
      of fluid into the retina and thereby causing a swelling of the macula (the portion of the
      retina responsible for fine vision). This swelling is called macular edema. When the macula
      swells with fluid, central vision becomes blurry. The study drug aflibercept has been shown
      to reduce the amount of fluid and blood leaked into the retina. It can help to stabilize, and
      in many cases, improve the vision loss related to CRVO. Aflibercept has been approved for the
      treatment of macular edema secondary to CRVO in the United States (US), European Union (EU),
      Japan, and other countries.

      The study is considered research because, although the study drug is already on the market
      for macular edema secondary to CRVO, there are no studies available that address the
      questions of what are useful intervals for treating and assessing patients, how do they
      differ among patients, and how are criteria applied for retreatment. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness, treatment interval, and safety of the treatment
      regimen (pattern for administering treatment) in subjects with macular edema secondary to
      CRVO. In addition, this study will explore new imaging methods for assessing the affected
      eye.</summary>
