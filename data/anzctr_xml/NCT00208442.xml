  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the performance and compare the wear characteristics
      of two polyethylene cup liners, Marathon and Enduron, in the treatment of patients with hip
      joint disease requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be
      randomly allocated to one of the polyethylene cup liners, Marathon or Enduron and will be
      evaluated at regular intervals using clinical and x-ray assessments.</summary>
