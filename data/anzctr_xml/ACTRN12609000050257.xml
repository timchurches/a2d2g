  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two immunisations will be given appromximately 1-6 months apart (depending on cohort) whilst an ultrasound is performed over the area of injection. The first immunisation administrered with the angle of needle administration at 60 or 90 degrees. The second vaccination will be administered at the alternative angle under ultrasound examination.  The ultrasound procedure will aim to view the tissues surrounding the injection site to visualise the entry of the needle and where the vaccinate is deposited.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the deposition of vaccinate during vaccine administration for needle administration at a 60 degree and  90 degree angle to the arm or thigh.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For adult and toddler cohorts - at vaccination occuring at randomisation and again 6 months later.
For adolescent and children cohorts, at vaccinations occuring 1 and 6 months post randomisation.
For infants, at vaccinations which occur at 4 and 6 months of age</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare safety of vaccine administration at 60 or  90 angle.  This will be measured using a seven day diary card which will record any local redness, swelling or pain that occurs following immunisation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a descriptive study using ultrasound to assess the appropriate angle of administration for intramuscular vaccinations. The primary aim of this study is to use ultrasound assessment to accurately describe where the vaccine is delivered during vaccine administration for needle administration at a 60° and  90° angle to the arm or thigh.

The study will also compare any reactions (such as redness, swelling, pain) for 7 days following immunisation when the vaccine is administered at either 60° or  90° angle.</summary>
