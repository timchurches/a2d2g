      <outcome>Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS) With BNC105P Alone in Patients After Progressing on Everolimus. - Median time to progression for arm P participants who crossed over to BNC105P monotherapy after progression. Progression is defined per RECIST criteria as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase II: Adverse Events of Everolimus and BNC105P When Administered as a Combination or Sequential Regimen. - Determine adverse events of everolimus and BNC105P when administered as a combination or sequential regimen. Total number of serious and non-serious adverse events for Arm A and Arm B are summarized. Complete adverse event information is supplied in the Adverse Events reporting section.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exploratory Objective: Correlation of PFS With Biomarkers - Exploratory analysis of serum biomarkers were undertaken to generate a potential signature for response. The correlation with 6 month progression free survival P value for four plasma biomarkers is reported.</outcome>
