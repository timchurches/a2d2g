  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomized treatment with:
Group1 - glucose tablets, 
Group2 -Jellybeans, 
Group3 -Mentos dragees 
Group 4- orange juice

1. For each treatment group, the treatment is administered immediately upon identification of hypoglyacemia (blood glucose measured on optium glucometer &lt; 4 mmol/L). 2. The treatment is a single treatment for each episode of hypoglycaemia (i.e. one treatment given immediately). If hypoglycaemia has not resolved by 15 minutes (after identification)  a repeat treament is given.
3. Treatment is given at a blood glucose concentration of less than 4 mmol/L. Each treatment option is 0.3 g/kg of simple carbohydrate (as only one of the 4 treatment options is liquid, "concentration of glucose" is not relevant, and we have based the dose on amount of simple carbohydrate)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine the most effective treatment for hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) amoung four common treatments (glucose, jellybeans, juice, Mentos lollies) for hypoglycaemia in children with diabetes. We hypothesise that glucose tablets and Mentos lollies will be more effective than the other treatments</summary>
