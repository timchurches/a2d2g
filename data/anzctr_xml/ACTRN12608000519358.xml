  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to identify protein markers that are suitable for allowing early detection of ovarian cancer.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have either:
(1)  known ovarian cancer diagnosed from a previous pathology specimen.

(2)   an ovarian mass which may be benign or malignant.  


and you will be having surgical removal of either your ovary or ovaries (oophorectomy or ovariectomy) or your uterus (hysterectomy). 

Trial details:
Participants will be requested to donate biological samples: blood, tissue, ascites (peritoneal cavity fluid), urine and uterine lavage (washings). This does not interfere with other diagnostic tests, or with the required medical or surgical treatment. Surgery will be performed in exactly same way, as if the samples had not been collected.

Detection of ovarian cancer at its earliest stages provides a good prognosis for full recovery; however survival diminishes greatly when the cancer spreads beyond the ovary. Current ovarian cancer markers lack the accuracy needed to provide a suitable early detection test. This study uses new procedures to identify a number of candidate blood protein markers produced by ovarian cancers which may be suitable as early cancer markers.</summary>
