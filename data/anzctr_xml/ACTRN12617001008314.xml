  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1 - 12 months
0.2g per ml (20%) sub cutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) weekly, switching from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), subjects current monthly IVIg dose divided by 4 (range: 0.05  0.15g/kg), n= 30
Intervention 2 - 12 months
0.2g per ml (20%) sub cutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) fortnightly, switching from intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), subjects current monthly IVIg dose divided by 2 (0.1  0.3g/kg), n=30

Adherence/fidelity will be established with an initial 2-4 week in hospital training period where patients are educated on self administration of sub cutaneous immunoglobulin. From then on there will be a scheduled review by an investigator at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months where adherence and complications will be discussed, blood tests will also be taken to assess immunoglobulin levels. Doctors and nursing staff will be available by appointment at any time in between scheduled reviews.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For this non-inferiority trial, 90 patients (30 per arm) are proposed. Assuming a standard deviation of approximately 1 (this standard deviation estimate is generated from a cohort of known CLL patient with hypogammaglobuliaemia) then a minimum of 66 patients (i.e. 22 patients in each arm) are required to be 95% sure that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit of -1g/L. A single sided t-test will be conducted to test the primary endpoint.
Pharmaco-economic analysis will be conducted to compare the cost of IVIg versus SCIg therapy on a monthly and annual basis.
To evaluate safety, the number of patients reporting adverse events will be recorded and compared between the three arms.
The overall health-related QOL scores obtained from the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30, five individual EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales, and the SF-36 modified questionnaire will be summarised descriptively at baseline and each subsequent assessment time point for each treatment arm separately. Overall patterns of change in QOL across the course of the study may be investigated using general linear mixed modelling; this will also allow investigation of associations between patient and treatment characteristics with QOL.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess whether subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) replacement therapy is an acceptable alternative to intravenously immunoglobulin (IVIg) replacement therapy in terms of safety and efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinaemia.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years, have a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and are currently receiving IVIg. 

Study details
Study participants will be allocated by chance to one of the three groups. One group will continue receiving IVIg monthly for at least 12 months (their usual care). Second group will receive SCIg (Hizentra®) weekly for at least 12 months and third group will receive SCIg (Hizentra®) fortnightly for at least 12 months.
Safety and efficacy measures including evaluations of blood samples and completion of questionnaires will be collected over a 12 month period. 

This study will address whether SCIg is an acceptable alternative to IVIg in terms of safety and efficacy in patients with acquired hypogammaglobulinaemia in the setting of CLL.</summary>
