  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive individualised education regarding atrial fibrillation (AF) and its health risks, and will be provided with education materials to take home. All consenting patients will be provided with a handheld iPhone ECG device (iECG); called the AliveCor Heart monitor which is an approved medical device (ARTG Identifier 208100). The iECG is a special cover that attaches to an iPhone, which enables a single lead ECG reading to be taken using an application on the iPhone.  Patients will be taught how to record their own iECG. Patients will be asked to record an iECG four times per day for four weeks. Recordings will be spread out through the day at times suitable to the patient (e.g. Immediately before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep). Patients will also be advised to take additional iECG recordings, as soon as practicable, if they experience AF symptoms. Each iECG will be automatically transmitted to a secure server where each iECG will be analysed by the automated algorithm. iECGs will be monitored and reviewed by the research assistant for the presence of AF and also to ensure that patients are performing their ECG recordings. If AF, or any other clinically significant event is identified, the research assistant will contact the patient and advise them to arrange for urgent follow-up with their treating doctors, and will advise the treating doctor and specialists of the findings. 

Patients will also be asked to keep an AF symptom recurrence checklist for 4 weeks. They will be asked to self-report on the occurrence of AF, AF-related symptoms including palpitations, dizziness and syncope, and any medical or hospital presentation related to these.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The feasibility of patient self-monitoring for AF recurrence using an iECG. This will be assessed using a combination of measures including: 
* The ability of the iECG to identify recurrences of AF; measured using data from each participant obtained from the iECG - reviewed for the presence of AF by the research assistant and the automated algorithm
* The compliance of participants to the intervention; measured by the number of iECG recordings they record over the one month - i.e are they achieving the requested target of 3-4 recordings each day
* Qualitative data on process measures and barriers; measured using semi-structured participant interviews at one month post discharge from hospital
* Acceptability and patient willingness to participate in the program; measured using recruitment data including the reasons provided for non-participation</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>AF is a major health and economic burden.  Post-operative AF is thought to be mainly transient and reversible, however, there is very limited information about how often it may recur. Some research suggests it affects up to 8% of patients in the two years following surgery, but this is likely an under-estimate of the actual rate, as AF is often asymptomatic and there is no routine surveillance. The rationale for this study is to determine if a brief intervention increases knowledge about AF symptoms and whether a simple iPhone based handheld ECG device could be utilised to identify AF when recordings are obtained by post-operative cardiothoracic surgical patients.</summary>
