  <interventions>
    <interventions>Preoperative and postoperative hamstring stretches.
Two, 2 min stretches twice daily for 4 weeks prior to total knee arthroplasty and for 6 weeks after total knee arthroplasty. Participants will be all be instructed in this exercise by a senior musculoskeletal physiotherapist at commencement in a one on one session and will recieve and instructional video on a DVD or USB drive. Participants will receive an exercise log and reminder text messages twice weekly.  Accompanied by otherwise routine postoperative rehabilitation protocol after surgery (quadriceps and extension control, flexion range of motion, gait patterning, oedema control, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prevention) to be done twice daily for 15 minutes immediately following the hamstring  exercise.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control exercise: Three, 20 second 10cm high straight leg raises twice daily for 4 weeks prior to total knee arthroplasty and for 6 weeks after total knee arthroplasty.Accompanied by otherwise routine postoperative rehabilitation protocol (quadriceps and extension control, flexion range of motion, gait patterning, oedema control, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prevention)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee extension angle. A clinical measurement made with the participant passive and lying supine. The thigh in flexed to 90degrees by the examiner with the contralateral lower limb fully extended to keep the pelvis level. With the thigh maintained at  the 90 degree position the knee is then passively extended until a point of elastic resistance or discomfort is reached. The acute angle subtended by the line of the thigh and the line of the leg is the knee extension angle. Measured using the digital level (thigh flexion) and digital inclinometer (knee extension angle) functions of the Angulus ROM iPhone application.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 4 weeks (immediately prior to total knee arthroplasty), 10 weeks (6 weeks after total knee arthroplasty), 30 weeks (6 months after total knee arthroplasty)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee range of motion.A clinical measurement made with the participant active and lying supine. The participant fully extends the knee with a forceful quadriceps contraction whilst lying supine. The acute angle made between the line of the thigh and the line of the leg is measured (extension range).The participant then fully flexes the knee with whilst lying supine. The acute angle made between the line of the thigh and the line of the leg is measured (flexion range). Extension range is subtracted from flexion range to give range of motion. Measured using digital inclinometer of the Angulus ROM iPhone application.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 4 weeks (immediately prior to total knee arthroplasty), 10 weeks (6 weeks after total knee arthroplasty), 30 weeks (6 months after total knee arthroplasty)</timepoint>

      <outcome>Gait mechanics (EMG, force plate, optical). 
1. EMG (Electromyogram). Timing and magnitude of quadriceps and hamstring activation.
2. Force Plate. Gait cadence, speed, symmetry, step length, contact patterns
3. Optics. Limb segment motion with particular emphasis on use of available knee extension range of motion during gait.  </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hamstring tightness and insertional tendonopathy is a common condition that frequently coexists with osteoarthritis about the knee. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the definitive treatment of advanced symptomatic knee ostoearthritis but does nothing to treat hamstring tightness and insertional tendonopathy which can then interfere with the recovery from TKA by causing pain and altering gait mechanics. Little data exists on the coexistence of these two conditions however. The author proposes a prospective randomized  blinded trial to assess the effect of hamstring stretching on knee extension angle,gait, fixed flexion deformity and symptoms in the osteoarthritic knee and to assess the effect of hamstring stretching the same parameters after TKA. Patients presenting to participating orthopaedic surgeons for treatment of knee osteoarthritis with flexion, varus or flexion and varus deformity &gt;= 10 degrees and scheduled for TKA will be eligible for enrollment in the study. Clinical assessment of the knee, gait analysis and validated outcomes scores to be assessed at time zero, after four weeks of stretching and six weeks after TKA. Final examination and scoring at 6 months post op. Symptoms to be assessed using standardized assessment forms (Euroqual, WOMAC, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Knee Score, KOOS). Unilateral TKA participants will be randomly allocated to either a control (CTKA) or treatment (TTKA). Bilateral TKA patients will also be randomly allocated to either a control (CTKA) or treatment (TTKA).The TTKA treatment groups will undergo a stretching program 4 weeks before and 6 weeks after TKA surgery. The Participants will be instructed in performing a hamstring stretch by a physiotherapist. Participants will be required to perform a 2 x 2 mins progressive hamstring stretches twice daily (total of 8 min hamstring stretch on each leg). Instruction video to be provided to each patient on portable USB drive. Reminder text messages twice weekly to be sent. Gait lab technician and clinical assessor and inpatient physiotherapist to be blinded.</summary>
