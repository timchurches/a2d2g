    <studytitle>The Low Glucose Suspend Trial - Comparing insulin pump therapy with low glucose suspend feature versus standard insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes with hypoglycaemia unawareness</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with real-time continuous glucose monitoring system and low glucose suspend feature (CSII + RT-CGMS + LGS)  versus continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion only (CSII) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia - a randomised controlled trial</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with real-time continuous glucose monitoring system and low glucose suspend feature (Paradigm Veo)for six months duration.  Dose of insulin will remain unchanged as per clinician prescribed regimen.  Continuous glucose monitoring will involve insertion of a sensor just under the skin that sends continuous blood glucose readings back to the Paradigm Veo pump.  This pump has the added feature of Low Glucose Suspend function.  If a low glucose level is detected and the patient does not respond to the alarm, the pump will suspend insulin infusion for 2 hours.  Both the pump and glucose sensor system will be worn for the entire 6 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the rate of severe and moderate hypoglycaemia.  Severe hypoglycaemia is defined a hypoglycaemic event associated with loss of consciousness or seizure.  Moderate hypoglycaemia is defined as a hypoglycaemic event requiring assistance.  In addition to patient recall, moderate hypoglycaemia will be further quantified with the use of blinded CGMS before, during and after the intervention period.  Moderate hypoglycaemia will be described as episodes of blood glucose level &lt;2.8mmol/L.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In a subset of adolescent patients, counterregulatory hormone response to hypoglycaemia, as measured during hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp study.  This involves recreating hypoglycaemia through a controlled infusion of insulin and glucose.  Participants will need to spend a day in hospital around visit 3 and 5, before and after the 6 month intervention.  During this procedure, patients have two intravenous drips inserted into the veins in each arm, one for infusion of insulin and glucose and one for blood samples to be taken.  Blood glucose levels are monitored closely and dropped from normal range to a low level over several hours.  This level is low enough to cause the body to respond and drive the glucose level in the body up but not low enough to cause seizures or coma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and after the 6 month intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>During the hypoglycaemic clamp study as described previoiusly, we also ask about symptoms experienced during hypoglycaemia (such as shakiness, hunger) to obtain an adrenergic symptoms score</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and after the 6 month intervention</timepoint>
