  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Active (New or Newly Enlarging) T2 Lesions From the Last Natalizumab Infusion (Baseline) Through 8 Weeks of Fingolimod Treatment - Active lesions were measured on brain MRI scans, performed at week 8, compared to the prior scan. The primary variable was analyzed by fitting a negative binomial regression model adjusted for washout group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Number of active T2 lesions from last natalizumab dose through 8 weeks of fingolimod treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Active (New or Newly Enlarging) T2 Lesions From the Last Natalizumab Infusion (Baseline) up to the Initiation of Fingolimod Treatment - Lesions were measured by MRIs and the number of active (new or newly enlarging) T2 lesions was calculated from baseline to beginning of treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8, 12 and 16 weeks (number of active T2 lesions during the washout period only)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Active (New or Newly Enlarging) T2 Lesions During the First 8 Weeks of Fingolimod Treatment - Lesions were measured by MRIs and the number of active (new or newly enlarging) T2 lesions was calculated for first 8 weeks of fingolimod treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Number of active T2 lesions during 8 wks of fingolimod treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Active (New or Newly Enlarging) T2 Lesions During the 24 Weeks After the Last Natalizumab Infusion (Baseline) - Lesions will be measured by MRIs and the number of active (new or newly enlarging) T2 lesions will be calculated for 24 weeks from baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) by Washout Group - Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) measures the changes in neurologic impairment, either chronic (progression over time), or acute (MS relapses). The EDSS steps range from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Relapse severity is assessed based on severity of neurologic impairment as evaluated using the EDSS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to week 16 and week 32</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cumulative Number of Gadolinium-enhancing T1 Lesions From the Last Natalizumab Infusion - Gadolinium-enhancing lesions will be measured on post-contrast T1-weighted brain MRI scans</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks and 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Death During Washout Period - Adverse events were summarized by the number of patients having any adverse event overall.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to maximum of 16 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Death During Fingolimod Treatment - Adverse events were summarized by the number of patients having any adverse event overall.</outcome>
