  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart failure is a common, disabling condition. Research has shown that a disease management programme for patients recently in hospital with heart failure, including education, attention to diet, exercise and medications, and regular review by trained staff can reduce death and hospital admissions. There is some evidence to suggest benefits of a supervised programme of exercise in improving fitness and well-being in this patient group. This study will show whether adding regular supervised gym-based exercise to a disease management programme can further improve important outcomes including death, hospital use and depression in a cost-effective manner.</summary>
