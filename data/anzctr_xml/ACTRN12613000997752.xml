  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is no nationally accepted tool, in emergency departments, for assessing pain in patients with cognitive impairment.  Current Australasian practice is for emergency nurses to assess a patients pain using the verbal analogue scales (0-10 pain scale score).  However, a verbal analogue scale does not meet the needs of the older person with cognitive impairment and or communication barriers.  Given the lack of an appropriate screening tool, pain assessment and timely analgesic intervention is made more difficult for older persons with cognitive impairment.  

The Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) screening tool has features that most closely resemble an ideal tool for ED clinicians for pain assessment of cognitively impaired patients. PAINAD comprises five behavioural categories: breathing, vocalization, facial expression, body language and consolability. The PAINAD tool uses a ten point score scale which is assigned by the clincian as a result of responses given by the patient. PAINAD is similar to the verbal analogue scale (0-10 scale) emergency clinicians currently use for pain assessment. Furthermore, in a time poor environment such as the ED the PAINAD tool is quick, relatively simple to use and allows for measuring pain assessment trends over time.

Our randomised blinded prospective study will be conducted in four emergency departments: two departments were randomized to use the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) tool and two departments to continue standard care using the verbal analogue scale. A convenience sample of patients with suspected long bone fracture in the control sites (two) will be examined for cognitive impairment using the SIS cognitive screening tool and continue to routinely be assessed for pain using current pain assessment scales (verbal analogue scale). 

In the intervention sites (two) a convenience sample of patients with suspected long bone fracture will be screened for cognitive impairment using the SIS and if the score is less than four (cognitive impairment), patients will be screened for pain using the PAINAD tool.

    <concealment>All patients over 64 years with a suspected long bone fracture will be eligible for enrolment in the study. Subject and treatment allocation is not concealed with only the site randomised to the intervention.  However, Clinicians are blinded to the outcome study measures. In this trial two of the four sites were randomly allocated to use the PAINAD tool or standard treatment pain assessment (verbal analogue scale). The allocation to intervention will not be concealed from subjects (emergency nurses) as they will complete the PAINAD tool and obtain a pain score. The PAINAD score provides the nurse with a pain assessment scale (0-10). Once the nurse obtains a PAINAD score they will apply their standard pain management treatment regimes. Clinicians will not be blinded to the PAINAD score, but are blinded to its purpose (time to analgesia). The time to analgesia will be collected from the medical record independently of the nurse administering the analgesic. </concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation of coin tossing was used in this trial to allocate the PAINAD tool or standard pain assessment (verbal analogue scale) treatment to each site.  The four sites were broken into geographical areas: south Sydney and north Sydney.  Each hospital was assigned either heads or tails. The called side, such as heads, was allocated to the intervention, the other side was allocated to the control group. At all sites a convenience sample of participants with suspected long bone fracture over the age of 64years will be used in the study. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using IBM SPSS v.19. Descriptive statistics will be calculated, followed by comparisons of cognitively and non-cognitively impaired patient groups using the t-test and X2 test. Univariate analysis for the effect of each measured variable will be assessed using a Chi-squared test. Age will be considered as an ordered categorical variable. Variables with P&lt;0.25 on univariate analysis will be included in a baseline multivariate logistic regression model. Backward elimination of variables which are not significant and show no evidence of confounding will be used to obtain a final model. Chi-squared analysis and a multivariate logistic regression models will be applied to determine significant relationships. 

Our target sample size is 484 [121 per site].  The sample size estimates are based on various assumptions.  All are assuming a mean of 185 (SD 167) minutes in the control sites based on the prior prevalence data. The ICC determines the inflation factor for the clustering effect.  An ICC of 0.1 is more realistic but gives an IF of 5.9. I have given the target time of cognitively normal patients as 80 minutes, with a power of 0.8 or 80%.  Based upon these power calculations we would require a total number of 472 patients or 118 per site.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We know very little about how ED clinicians adjust care practices to accommodate for the needs of cognitively impaired older Australian experiencing acute pain.  Given the front line positioning of emergency services, emergency department nurses are well placed to become active leaders and innovatively responsive in reducing human suffering. Pain, is costly both in human suffering and lost productivity. Therefore, ensuring timely pain assessment and appropriate analgesic interventions for older people with cognitive impairment is critical.  
International studies have demonstrated the benefits of the Pain in Advanced Dementia Screening Tool (PAINAD), but no study has taken place in Australasian EDs.  This research proposes to explore pain management in older (&gt;64years) Australians with suspected long bone fractures and to randomise the use of the validated pain assessment tool (PAINAD tool) for patients with cognitive impairment.  The aim of the study is to conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial of the PAINAD screening tool for cognitively impaired older people (&gt;64years) presenting to emergency departments with suspected long bone fracture and compare results to standard treatment.
