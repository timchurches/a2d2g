    <concealment>Patient admitted in Psychiatric Emergency Room of Irmandade da Santa Casa de Sao Paulo in agitation and that meet inclusion criteria will be evaluated by a trainee psychiatrist to verify if there is rapid tranquilization demand. Inclusion criteria was determined by another psychiatrist. If there is demand subject will receive one of the five options cited. Allocation will be  done by numbered containers. Studied medications will be packaged in identical color-coded boxes.   After initial dose only haloperidol plus prometazine will be used accordily to clinician juggement. If a subject need another intervention he will immediately removed from study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each drug regimen medication will be selected in blocks of five subjects and will be distributed in this order: olanzapine, ziprasidone, haloperidol plus prometazine, haloperidol plus midazolam and haloperidol. This selection will be realized until the total number (150 subjects) be reached. It will used permuted block randomisation. Patients will be assessed by two psychiatrists. They will all masked with regard to the patient's treatment assignment and patients will be instructed not to reveal their current treatment to these investigators.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Agitated or violent behavior, mostly as a result of serious mental illness and substance misuse constitutes around 10% of the reasons for use of emergency services. The drugs used in such situations should calm patients safely and swiftly. Guidelines, however, are usually statements of consensus and differ on which drugs to use. Some of the new generation antipsychotics are really not only for oral use but also for parenteral use such as olanzapine and ziprasidone. These medications means an advance in rapid manage of acute behavior alterations. By the way, knowledge about antipsychotics profile in agitation and aggressive behavior is limited and few studies compare several drugs in rapid tranquilization. The objective of this study is to compare five options of parenteral (intramuscular) antipsychotics, including olanzapine, ziprasidone, haloperidol, haloperidol plus promethazine and haloperidol plus midazolam as first medication in agitation.</summary>
