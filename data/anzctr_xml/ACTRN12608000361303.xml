  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of Conversation Tool by Practice Nurse, to guide structured motivational interaction with breastfeeding mother at each routine preventive health visits for child immunisation at 2, 4 and 6 months of age. Routine visits take 10-30 minutes and the intervention may take 5-20 minutes dependent on pragmatic factors and mothers' issues, with the total visit anticipated to last 15 - 30 minutes. The intervention will be trialled over a period of 18 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Practice Nurses in the control General Practices will provide standard treatment at child immunisation visits. Usually this includes a general question on child health and wellbeing, and commonly includes directive advice regarding any breastfeeding concerns raised by mothers at the 2 month visit but generally no further discussion at subsequent visits unless initiated by the mother. Commonly practice nurses have limited knowledge of breastfeeding management or motivational interviewing skills.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Central randomisation by computer of clusters, namely General Practice locations, to intervention or control, and hence of the women who attend those practices to intervention or control groups by cluster. Pregnant women are invited to participate by mailout from birthing hospitals, and allocated when they identify their usual general practice. Thus allocation was concealed at the time of randomisation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple cluster randomisation by computer allocation of practices to intervention or control. Stratification by practice size, larger and smaller practices in each of two locations randomised separately. Size determined by number of infants as current patients.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Contolled trial with participants in the intervention group receiving a single intervention on up to 3 occasions at routine visits and participants in the control group receiving usual care at routine visits. All participants in the intervention group receive the same intervention, the Conversation Tool application.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Health of mothers and infants would improve if breastfeeding rates were closer to the recommendations. Mothers' choices about how to feed their babies depend on information initially, motivation continually, and in the longer term, support. Support is most effective when provided by those skilled in breastfeeding management and good communication. This study proposes that proactive ongoing support from a known and trained primary health professional, namely the General Practice Nurse, using a motivational interviewing approach, can improve breastfeeding duration and delay introduction of solids or other foods.</summary>
