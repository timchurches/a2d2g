  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be delivered by an ICU nurse, the insulin will be commenced when blood glucose &gt; 14.0 mmol/L and infusion adjusted to target blood glucose 10-14 mmo/L. Concentrations &lt; 10 mmol/L would not be actively treated with glucose. As per the NICE-SUGAR trial each ICU will be able to use the relevant institutional protocol rather than a standardised protocol.
Treatment will be for the duration of ICU admission until day 28.
Study data will be collected by the sites research nurse and each site will have a monitoring visit to ensure accurate data collection.
 </interventions>
    <comparator>The control will be standard care which is the commencement of insulin when blood glucose is &gt; 10.0 mmol/L, with insulin adjusted to target blood concentrations in the range 6-10 mmol/L. 
Again insulin algorithms will be via local protocol rather than standardised within the study.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed by a statistician. Data will be presented as n (95% CI), mean (SD) or median [IQR] as appropriate. The main analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat basis using standard statistical methods for categorical and continuous data. We will report the primary outcome (incident hypoglycaemia) as relative risk and 95% confidence intervals. Demographic and time weighted glucose data will be analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Chi-square, Fishers exact and Mann-Whitney tests as appropriate. We will report mortality data at day 90 and the number of days alive and not in hospital censored at 90 days. These data will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests. Percentage of patients with positive blood cultures will be analysed using Chi-square test. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared and published before database lock.
Our sample size is based on pilot data from our exploratory study at the Royal Adelaide Hospital with the relative risk of hypoglycaemia (liberal vs. control: 0.47 (95% CI, 0.19-1.13). Assuming a baseline event rate from NICE-SUGAR data of incident hypoglycaemia in participants with type 2 diabetes assigned to conventional treatment of 17.5%, a sample size of 408 study participants would provide 80% power (alpha 0.05, delta 9.5%) to determine a reduction in hypoglycaemic episodes. We will allow 10% loss to follow up/unexpected short period of observation so that we will enrol 450 participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When patients with diabetes are very unwell (critically ill and admitted to ICU) their blood glucose levels are often higher than previously. This frequently requires the use of insulin which is administered directly into a vein.
We are uncertain about how aggressively we should treat these blood glucose levels.
Currently, patients with diabetes are treated exactly like all other patients, i.e. persons without diabetes, such that insulin is administered when blood glucose reaches 10 mmol/L and titrated to target a blood glucose less than 10 mmol/L. This approach - called conventional glucose control - may increase the risk of very low blood glucose levels (termed hypoglycaemia), which is known to be harmful to patients in ICU, and may cause blood glucose levels that are low relative to their normal blood glucose levels before they were sick (termed relative hypoglycaemia), which may also be harmful.
Because intensive care clinicians are uncertain as to which of these approaches is better participants will be randomly assigned, like the flip of a coin, to receive either: 
Conventional glucose control participants will be treated the same way patients with diabetes usually are, which is exactly like all other patients without diabetes, and insulin will be administered when blood glucose reaches 10 mmol/L with insulin adjusted to target blood concentrations in the range 6-10 mmol/L. 
OR 
Liberal glucose control participants will only have insulin administered when their blood glucose is &gt; 14 mmol/L and the insulin will be titrated to target a blood glucose 10-14 mmol/L.
We are evaluating whether a more liberal approach in patients with diabetes, i.e. insulin in administered when blood glucose is &gt; 14 mmol/L and titrated to target a blood glucose 10-14 mmol/L leads to a reduction in complications that are associated with insulin use and result in better outcomes for patients with diabetes. This approach  called liberal glucose control - isnt necessarily better, as higher blood glucose levels may increase the risk of developing infections in ICU and could lead to weakness after ICU.
This study will include 450 patients who have diabetes and are admitted to ICU. Patients admitted to one of 12 hospitals in Australia or New Zealand will be asked to participate.
