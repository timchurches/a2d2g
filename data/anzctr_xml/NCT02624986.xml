  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Idasanutlin
Treatment: drugs - Obinutuzumab
Treatment: drugs - Rituximab

Experimental: Dose-Escalation Cohort (DLBCL Participants) - Participants will receive 'Regimen A', which includes escalating doses of idasanutlin in combination with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab (1000 milligrams [mg]) for 6 cycles (1 Cycle=28 days) until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved. Regimen A will be followed by treatment which includes idasanutlin in combination with fixed dose of rituximab (375 milligrams per square meter [mg/m^2]) for 6 cycles (1 Cycle=28 days) to determine the RP2D for this treatment.

Experimental: Dose-Escalation Cohort (FL Participants) - Participants will receive 'Regimen A', which includes escalating doses of idasanutlin in combination with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab (1000 mg) for 6 cycles (1 Cycle=28 days) until MTD is achieved. Regimen A will be followed by Regimen B which includes obinutuzumab given alone in Cycle 1 and idasanutlin and obinutuzumab combination from Cycles 2-6 (1 Cycle=28 days) to determine the RP2D for this regimen.

Experimental: Expansion Cohort: DLBCL Participants - Participants with DLBCL will receive 6 cycles (1 Cycle=28 days) of induction treatment with idasanutlin at the RP2D identified during the dose-escalation phase, in combination with rituximab. Induction treatment will be followed by post-induction consolidation treatment with rituximab and idasanutlin for 6 months.

Experimental: Expansion Cohort: FL Participants - Participants will receive 6 cycles (1 Cycle=28 days) of induction treatment with idasanutlin at the RP2D identified during the dose-escalation phase, in combination with obinutuzumab. Participants will receive either 'Regimen A' or 'Regimen B' which will be determined at the end of the dose-escalation phase. Induction treatment will be followed by post-induction maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab and idasanutlin for a maximum of up to 24 months.


Treatment: drugs: Idasanutlin
Participants will receive idasanutlin film-coated tablets at a starting dose of 100 mg daily on Days 1 to 5 of each 28-day cycle. Escalation will occur in at least 50-mg increments, and daily dosages greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 400 mg will be split into twice daily dosing.

Treatment: drugs: Obinutuzumab
Participants will receive a fixed dose of obinutuzumab, 1000 mg intravenous (IV) infusion to be given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6 (1 Cycle=28 days). For eligible participants with FL, post-induction treatment may be given at a dose of 1000 mg via IV infusion on Day 1 of every other month for a maximum of up to 24 months.

Treatment: drugs: Rituximab
Participants will receive a fixed dose of rituximab, 375 mg/m^2 IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6. Post-induction treatment for eligible participants may be given at a dose of 375 mg/m^2 IV infusion on Day 1 of every other month for up to 6 months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a open-label, mutlicenter, non-randomized, study to evaluate the safety, efficacy,
      and pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin in combination with obinutuzumab in participants with R/R
      FL and rituximab in combination with idasanutlin in R/R DLBCL. The study will include an
      initial dose-escalation phase followed by an expansion phase. The dose-escalation phase is
      designed to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for idasanutlin in combination with
      obinutuzumab for FL and in combination with rituximab for DLBCL. The expansion phase is
      designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of obinutuzumab in combination with
      idasanutlin at the RP2D with the selected regimen in participants with R/R FL and of
      rituximab in combination with idasanutlin at the RP2D in participants with R/R DLBCL.</summary>
