  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of increasing allied health services in two medical areas of the Central Adelaide Local Health Network. Specifically, the effect of increasing allied health services by virtue of increased staffing (total increase of 13 full-time equivalents across all areas) in the Acute Medical Unit and in General Medicine at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and The Queen Elizabeth Hospital will be evaluated by collecting outcome data (e.g., hospital length of stay, discharge destination, re-admission rate) for the first 6 months post-implementation and comparing these to historical data from Central Adelaide Local Health Network and also with Australia-wide data from a national database. </interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>The prospective sample will include all patients who receive allied health services in the Acute Medical Unit and General Medicine at the Royal Adelaide Hospital or The Queen Elizabeth Hospital following the increased levels of allied health staffing. The historical cohort will include all patients who received allied health services in these areas in the previous calendar year. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of implementing increased allied health services to the Acute Medical Unit and General Medicine services across Central Adelaide Local Health Network, by comparing outcome data post-implementation of the increased allied health staffing levels to historical and Australia-wide data. In order to be able to compare data between the prospective and historical cohorts, the main outcomes that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the increased allied health services will comprise data that have been collected and are available for comparison from current databases (i.e. Central Adelaide Clinical Casemix and Costing databases, Health Round Table reports, Client Management Engine).
