  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Delta-inulin
Other interventions - Dose finding comparison

Experimental: 25mcg JJA venom - Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT (without delta-inulin) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 25mcg (dose finding comparison).

Experimental: 25mcg JJA venom + 5mg delta-inulin - Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT with delta-inulin (at a fixed dose of 5 mg with each dose of venom) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 25mcg (dose finding comparison, adjuvant comparison).

Active Comparator: 50mcg JJA venom - Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT (without delta-inulin) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 50mcg, ie. the current standard of care.

Experimental: 50mcg JJA venom + 5mg delta-inulin - Subjects will receive semi-rush JJA VIT with delta-inulin (at a fixed dose of 5 mg with each dose of venom) aiming to achieve a maintenance dose of JJA venom of 50mcg (adjuvant comparison).


Treatment: drugs: Delta-inulin
Addition of adjuvant, delta-inulin to JJA VIT regime, to determine if this will allow lower doses and shorter regimes to promote protective responses, reducing costs and morbidity of JJA VIT.

Other interventions: Dose finding comparison
Define minimum effective maintenance dose (50mcg vs 25mcg). In "real world" sting challenges after 12 months of JJA VIT objective systemic reaction rates after 50 and 100 mcg maintenance doses respectively 14/130 and 12/126 subjects vs reaction rates to stings in similar subjects without JJA VIT 70-76%. Venom delivery in sting likely &lt;20mcg. Therefore minimum effective maintenance dose not yet defined.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the potential use of delta-inulin as an adjuvant to
      facilitate the desired immune response to Jack Jumper Ant (JJA) venom with a lower dose of
      venom, thus reducing adverse reactions, venom requirements and costs of treatment.
      Specifically we aim to compare outcomes of in-hospital JJA sting challenges and JJA venom
      specific IgE, and IgG4 responses to semi-rush JJA VIT at maintenance doses of 25 and 50 mcg
      of JJA venom, with and without delta-inulin adjuvant.</summary>
