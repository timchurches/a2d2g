  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two levels of intervention being tested over a two-year period:
Intervention 1: participants can redeem a free pass within the first six months of the study for a single visit to the Peninsula Aquatic and Recreation Centre allowing pool usage, gym usage, an exercise class or spa/warm water pool use.
Intervention 2: This comprises intervention 1, plus: generic congratulatory SMS/letter for those redeeming passes, or 15 min follow-up and encouragement phone call from a health educator for those not redeeming passes; 2 x 15 min phone contacts per year (4 over two years) from a health educator to discuss usage of Centre and give support in developing plans for physical activity; 4 x two-page newsletters per year with practical advice and encouragement concerning physical activity, and; posted Christmas and Birthday cards each year with brief physical activity messages included.

All study members are given a PARC digital swipe card, which has a unique identification number embedded in it, that can be used to record their use of the facility on a monthly basis. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined as the number needed to show a significant difference in weekly participation in organised physical activity. It is assumed that 10% of control subjects will become regular participants in organised physical activity. Therefore a sample size of 300 in each arm of the study will be required to show with 95% confidence limits and 80% power: (i) a 10% difference in outcome between participants in Intervention 1 and the control group (i.e., 20% vs. 10%); and (ii) a 10% difference between those in Intervention 1 and Intervention 2 (i.e., 30% vs. 20%).  To accommodate a 25% drop out among recruited participants over the two year course of the study, the target sample size was inflated to 400 per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical inactivity is prevalent in Australia and is a significant contributor to the nations burden of chronic disease. Increasing the availability of recreational infrastructure could, however, positively influence levels of physical activity. This study, conducted in partnership with Frankston City Council, will investigate the impact that establishing a major recreational and aquatic centre has upon physical activity and measures of well being in the community. It will test the additional impacts of using marketing strategies to boost centre usage, and thereby inform future action to multiply the health benefits of public investments in recreational infrastructure.</summary>
