  <interventions>
    <interventions>A dose-response trial consisting of 5 cohorts (Cohort A, B, C, D, E). 

All participants will complete 2 dose-escalation conditions, involving 10 min increments of standing activity breaks. Standing activities will be split into 2 x 5 min breaks and consist of calf raises, mini squats and marching on the spot. The maximum dose of standing activities will be reached once the dose-limiting threshold (DLT) has been achieved.  

DLT:
Failure to achieve at least 80% of the target time in active standing due to fatigue, pain or effort required. The maximum dose for a cohort will be considered reached if 70% or more (n 'greater than or equal to' 7/10) of the cohort have met the DLT.

Dose escalation:
Cohort A  Prolonged, uninterrupted sitting (10 hours) will be broken up by 10 min standing activities, followed by 20 min standing activities on a separate occasion. 
Cohort B  If DLT is not met, dose escalation will commence at 20 min and increase by a further 10 min.
Subsequent Cohorts will continue until DLT is met. Once DLT is met, a final Cohort (Cohort E) will repeat the dose escalation of the penultimate Cohort to confirm maximum tolerable dose. 
Active standing breaks will be evenly distributed across the testing day (according to dose escalation). The initial dose escalation will involve 2 active standing breaks (seperated by 4 hours) and will increase up to 10 breaks (breaks every half-hourly to hourly) in the final dose escalation. Each testing day will be separated by a minimum 4 day washout period.

A standardised breakfast will be provided at approximately 8.30am and lunch at approximately 12.30pm. Meals will contain approximately one third of the participant's energy requirements and the combined macronutrient profile of testing day meals will be in line with the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges as recommended by the Nutrient Reference Values for Australians and New Zealanders. 

Participants will be provided with an activity monitor and an ambulatory blood pressure monitor. 

All testing days will be supervised and take place at the Hunter Medical research Institute (HMRI). </interventions>

    <designfeatures>A dose-escalation design.

The dose-escalation incorporates increasing amounts of standing activities across the 5 cohorts (n=10 per cohort), until a dose-limiting threshold (DLT) criteria is reached. The DLT is failure to achieve at least 80% of the target time in active standing due to fatigue, pain or effort required. The maximum dose for a cohort will be considered reached if 70% or more (n &gt; 7/10) of the cohort have met the DLT.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A within-participant reduction of at least 3 mmHg in systolic blood pressure compared to baseline condition will be considered the minimum response criteria to detect clinically meaningful differences. This is consistent with the effect size seen in regular and single bout exercise trials, and is conservative given that 1  2 mmHg reductions in blood pressure are associated with reduced CVD morbidity at a population level.
Blood pressure and cardio-metabolic biomarkers (blood glucose and insulin) will be assessed using generalised linear mixed models with random intercepts. On completion of each cohort, ambulatory blood pressure and cardio-metabolic biomarkers (blood glucose and insulin) will be analysed to identify within-group differences. Safety and feasibility outcomes will be analysed descriptively, and by comparing odds of adverse events across experimental conditions. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Living a sedentary lifestyle significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and having a subsequent cardiovascular event, such as a stroke. People who have had a stroke spend 75% of their waking hours at home sitting down, which is much higher than healthy age-matched individuals without stroke. This sedentary behaviour is damaging for stroke survivors already comprised cardiovascular health, and is likely a significant contributing factor to the recurrent stroke which 30% of survivors have after their initial event. 
Stroke survivors are very inactive; with very few able to engage in the level of physical activity recommended to improve their cardiovascular health. In people without stroke, breaking up prolonged sitting using regular activity breaks (walking or simple strengthening exercises) significantly improves cardiovascular disease risk factors such as blood pressure and glucose metabolism. Results from our recently completed pilot study indicates that breaking up prolonged sitting time in stroke survivors achieves similar cardiovascular benefits. Breaking up stroke survivor sitting time with standing activities significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (mean 3.6 mmHg reduction). Lowering of blood pressure reduces the risk of hypertension, the leading modifiable risk factor associated with recurrent stroke, and thus has the potential to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Therefore, breaking up sitting time is a promising and innovative physical activity alternative to employ with stroke survivors to improve their cardiovascular health and subsequently, reduce recurrent stroke risk. The next important step is to determine the minimum amount and duration of activity breaks (dose) required to improve these cardiovascular risk factors in this population. 
This study will be the first to determine the optimal dose of active standing breaks needed to reduce blood pressure and improve glucose metabolism in stroke survivors. Fifty stroke survivors living at home who are able to stand and walk will complete a baseline habitual sitting condition followed by 2 dose-escalation conditions. Breaks in sitting will be active standing breaks which will increase in 10-min increments each condition. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals throughout each condition and blood pressure and physical activity will be monitored during and up until 48-hours post-condition. Outcomes of blood pressure (primary), blood glucose, insulin levels (secondary) and safety and feasibility indicators will be collected. </summary>
