  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at whether the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation improves outcomes in women with locally advanced cervical cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have locally advanced cervical cancer which is suitable for primary treatment with chemoradiation and you have not received any previous pelvic radiotherapy. 

Trial details: 
Participants will be divided into two groups. Both groups will be treated with standard external beam radiation treatment to the pelvis and brachytherapy(internal radiotherapy). They will receive cisplatin intravenously during the radiation at a dose of 40mg/m2 weekly for 5 doses. One group will also receive 4 cycles of 3 weekly adjuvant chemotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel intravenously, beginning within 4 weeks of completion of all radiation treatment. The study aims to see whether the adjuvant chemotherapy increases the response to treatment and improves survival times.</summary>
