  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial attempts to measure the effectiveness of Spinal Manipulation in the management of Emphysema and Chronic Bronchitis. Pre -trial, all participants have their Lung Volume measured, undertake a standardized treadmill walking exercise measure, and complete a Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire.  Participants are allocated to 3 experimental groups. Group 1 receives Soft Tissue Therapy followed by Spinal Manipulations; Group 2 receives Soft Tissue Therapy followed by Spinal Manipulations followed by a standardized treadmill walking exercise program. The participants receive 8 intervention sessions in total at a rate of 2 per week over a 4 week period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 3 receives Soft Tissue Therapy only.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The degree of movement in the Cervical and Thoracic Spines contribute to the effectiveness of breathing. In cases of respiratory disease, the degree to which this movement may limit breathing potential is well understood. However, strategies that address correcting such limitations are not as well documented. Furthermore, the inclusion of such strategies within respiratory rehabilitation programs is yet to be investigated. This study aims to test the effectiveness of Spinal Manipulation as a co-management strategy for use within a respiratory rehabilitation setting. The overall aim is to test a new respiratory rehabilitation program that includes Spinal Manipulation as a standard component in the management of certain chronic respiratory conditions.</summary>
