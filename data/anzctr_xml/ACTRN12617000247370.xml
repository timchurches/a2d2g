  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multiple prototype contact lens designs made from etafilcon A material will be assessed during the study, where each design will be worn daily for up to a week on a daily disposable modality. The prototype lenses are made from etafilcon A, with powers ranging from +3.00 to -6.00, base curve from 8.2mm to 8.7mm, and diameter from 13.8mm to 14.3mm. 
Participants will attend separate fitting and assessment visits for each lens type (Fitting Visit on Day 1, and Assessment Visit on at least Day 7). There will be a minimum 2-night washout period between lens designs, i.e. after an assessment visit but
before the next fitting visit.
Prototype lenses all have a multifocal design and each design will be available in +3 to -6 dioptre powers. The difference between the prototype designs are in their manipulation of higher order spherical aberrations via their optics (i.e. differing power distribution throughout the lens), in order to achieve an increased depth of focus. Different manipulations can achieve either different or similar depths of focus. The power profiles of the prototype lenses feature multiple undulations with a smooth rise and fall of optical power as a function of optic cord diameter, and each of the prototype designs have variations of the undulations to provide different amounts of depth-of-focus.
Participants will test up to 5 prototype contact lens designs and at least 1 (maximum of 2) control lens (commercially available lens).
However, as participants are able to withdraw at any time, the final number of lenses tested by each participant is essentially determined by them.
Participants are asked to bring in any leftover lenses to the Assessment Visit as well as the foils of the lens blisters they open and use, to assist us in monitoring adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will test at least 1 (maximum of 2) commercially available contact lens as a control for at least a week. The control lenses are 1-Day Acuvue Moist and 1-Day Acuvue Moist Multifocal. All will be worn on a daily disposable modality.
There will be a minimum 2-night washout period between lens designs.
Participants will attend separate visits at the beginning and end of each wear period.</comparator>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment. Ocular medication can be prescribed during the course of the trial as per standard optometric practice.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the
clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.</exclusivecriteria>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 20 participants are required in order to demonstrate a statistically significant paired difference between the control lenses and each iteration in visual acuity of 0.1 +/- 0.15 logMAR units at the 5% level of significance and 80% power. The minimum sample size is a requirement at each stage of the cross over trial.
The sample size is not adjusted for drop outs due to the short nature of each stage. Participants will need to be replaced if drop outs occur.

Visual acuity will be recorded on a logMAR scale. Data will be summarised as means +/- standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Visual acuity will be compared between each lens design and control lens types. The significance of lens design will be determined for each visit. Repeated effects linear mixed model with subject random intercepts or paired t tests will be employed for the analysis of visual acuity. 

Subjective ratings will be recorded on a scale of 1 to 10 on steps of 1. Data will be summarised as means +/- standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Subjective ratings will be compared between each lens design and control lens types. The
significance of lens design will be determined for each visit. Repeated effects linear mixed model with subject random intercepts or paired t tests will be employed for the analysis of subjective ratings. </statisticalmethods>
