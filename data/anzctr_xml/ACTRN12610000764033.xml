  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 1:  For three months the participating General Practitioners (GPs) were asked to consent patients to allow access to their referral letters. The consent included access to the specialist diagnosis. 
Part 2:  The practitioners were invited to use the Referral Writer software to refer patients to the specialists. As in the phase before the Referral Writer we recorded the diagnosis of each patient referred to the specialists. The information relayed in each letter was scored before and after the Referral Writer with reference to a published measure of the quality of referral letters in six specialties (Urology, Breast, Gynaecology, Upper Gastrointestinal, Colorectal, Respiratory). The duration of part 2 was four months, including one month to allow the practitioners to become familiar with the software. 
Part 1 and part 2 were back-to-back and the overall duration of the trial was a period of seven months.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the first three months of the trial, participating General Practices(GPs) refered eligible patients to specialists as per standard protocol.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of referral letter standard protocol versus those developed using the Referral Writer.

The amount of clinically relevant information relayed in the referral letters was scored  before and after introduction of the Referral Writer, by two specialists from each discipline (lung, breast, gynaecology, colorectal, upper gastrointestinal and genitourinary) using a validated data collection form (questionnaire)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At three months and seven months from the start of the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Specialist triage factors

The specialists scored their confidence about triaging the patient based on information recorded in the letter using the data collection form</outcome>
      <timepoint>At nine months from the beginning of the study (two months of data assessment)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient outcome (diagnosis)

The specialists identifies the likelihood of the patient having benign pathology or a condition that warrants a specialist opinion for urgent surgical treatment, an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition or a life limiting condition using the data collection form</outcome>
      <timepoint>At nine months from the beginning of the study (two months of data assessment)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The data in this study offer evidence for the value of the referral writer, a computerised, interactive referral pro forma in improving the utility of referral letters when patients are referred for a specialist opinion. Comprehension referral letters, based on the evidence for the predictive value of various elements of the history and examination have a significant value in ensuring that the patient is seen by the right specialist at the right time.</summary>
