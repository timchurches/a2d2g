  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thai Family Support is an intervention for families of young substance users. This intervention was developed based on the 5-step method and Community Reinforcement And Family Training program together with Thai culture. It comprises about 14 hours of group treatment with the families of the substance users delivered over 6 sessions over 6 weeks.  The treatment is designed specifically to support family members, so the substance users themselves do not attend.  Sessions cover a variety of skills and techniques to help families deal with their substance-using relatives and help them manage their psychological functions and maintain well-being.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited both from the community (in response to advertising and promotion) and from three primary health care units (PCUs) in Udonthani Province, Thailand. Community members can self-refer in response to advertising, while PCU staff will refer potetial participants to the reseracher, with the participant's consent.  Participants will be given information about the study and will sign a consent form before undertaking assessment.  At the end of the assessment, if the participant is eligible, they will be randomly assigned to receive the Thai Family Support Program either immediately or after a delay of 6-8 weeks.  
Randomisations will generated by someone not connected to the study and will be sealed in envelopes that are opened by the researcher at the end of assesesment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will occur separately for each PCU (three in total).  Randomisations will be generated using a web-based program in permutations of 2 and 4.  They will be sealed in envelopes, that will only be opend by the researcher at the end of assessment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The National household Survey on Substance and Alcohol Use in Thailand showed that approximately 2.5 million people had used at least one kind of substance in their lifetime. That comprised 5.42% of the total population aged between 12-65 years in 2007. It has become strongly evident that alcohol and drug use of individuals can seriously affect family members who live with them, as well as their close friends. Impacts on families who are living with a substance user fall into 5 areas: physical and psychological health of family members, poor family relationships resulting from their relative's substance use, financial impacts and employment impacts, disruption of social life, and impact on families in relation to different types of substance. Despite the deep and wide-ranging impact of substance use on other family members, families typically receive little or no support from treatment services, which instead, tend to focus attention on helping the substance user. The objectives of this program are to: a) Increase well-being of Concerned Significant Others (CSOs) and reduce mental distress b) Increase rates of Substance Users (SUs) seeking help and engaging in treatment , and c)  Improve relationships between Concern Significant Others (CSOs) and Substance Users (SUs).</summary>
