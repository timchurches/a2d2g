  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive Ai Chi intervention. Ai Chi is an aquatic exercise containing 16 movements invented by Jun Konno in 1993. The spirit of roundness and flow is adapted from Tai Chi, one of  Chinese martial arts, and Watsu, a Japanese body-mind relaxation technique. Ai Chi emphasizes gentle, smooth, and broad movements, Participants need to stay in a semi-squat position with shoulders underneath water surface. It is very important to start with breathing exercise followed by arm and leg movements, and finally coordinated whole body movements. Ai Chi exercise includes several components: flexibility, strength, coordination, relaxation, postural control, and balance.
Ai Chi sessions will be delivered by a certificated physiotherapist with 2 year experience in aquatic therapy and Ai Chi. Training frequency will be 60 min per session, 3 sessions per week for a total of 6 weeks. It will be small group sessions taking place in a hydrotherapy pool in Cheng Hsin General Hospital.
Each participant will have a check sheet and it has to be registered at every session in order to monitor adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in active control group will receive conventional aquatic therapy composed of strengthening, movement facilitation, and motor control training. Participants will be instructed by physiotherapist in a small group and the sessions are taking place in hydrotherapy pool in Cheng Hsin General Hospital. Training frequency will be 60 min per session, 3 sessions per week for a total of 6 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Deterioration of balance and gait performance is commonly observed in stroke survivors. Previous studies have shown that water-based exercise is significantly beneficial to postural control and and mobility. Ai Chi is an aquatic exercise emphasizing translation of weight, muscle strengthening, and coordinated body movements. This study aims to investigate the effects of Ai Chi on balance and gait performance over other aquatic exercise in individuals with stroke.</summary>
