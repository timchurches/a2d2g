  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention programme is based on the Cystic Fibrosis model of care for early childhood with regular clinic review for any deviation from normal health and to institute early treatment and/or preventative care. Reviews will be undertaken as a minimum at 1-3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months after the day 0 assessment and as required in one of three community centres (Otara, Mangere, Manurewa) staffed by the nominated general practitioner (GP) or nurse practitioner and practice nurse.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control families will receive the current usual care which is GP review for family directed health concerns with re-referral to paediatric services as necessary. They will then be followed up for specialist review at 24 months.</comparator>

    <sequence>Randomisation of patient number to intervention or control will be achieved using block randomisation, with random block size, to ensure the participants are balanced in the 2 groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are seeking a workable solution to the inequitable and escalating numbers of Maaori and Pacific children with chronic lung disease which the current healthcare system is struggling to accommodate. The primary aim is to determine whether an international model of care from the specialised patient population of CF delivered in tertiary hospitals can be adapted as an intervention programme and be delivered in a local and community setting to NZ Maaori and Pacific paediatric populations at high risk of developing chronic lung disease.  Parents of children admitted to hospital with a severe lower respiratory tract infection will be approached for consent, and be randomised to an intervention programme group or a control group of usual care.  Both groups will be followed throughout the two years of the study and will receive a medical examination to assess their respiratory health at 24 months.</summary>
