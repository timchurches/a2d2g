  <interventions>
    <interventions>We aim to recruit 10 volunteers who have the clinical diagnosis of (OsteoArthritis)OA of the thumb joint to enter a
double blinded, placebo controlled study of Curcumin (Nalgesic) with three (single dose) oral administration (tablet) conditions (placebo, normal dose - 1200mg, and double dose 2400mg). This is a cross-over trial. All participants receive all the interventions in different sequences during the study. They act as their own control. There is a full 7 day period between treatments to ensure washout of the trial drug. The trial will be conducted over three consecutive week-ends (Saturdays).</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients who satisfy the criteria for inclusion by Dr Lewis (rheumatologist) will be added to the total pool of eligible participants and central allocation using a random schedule generated by MS Excel will be applied by a research pharmacist who is off-site. Patients will receive all combination of treatment in this repeated measures design however neither patients nor the experimenters are aware of which phase of the trial each participant is allocated to until the conclusion of the trial.  
This study is not measuring the effectiveness of Nalgesic against standard treatments but rather is testing
whether a natural compound can provide pain relief in this patient group. As such, we intend to measure
effectiveness at two doses Vs. placebo.</concealment>
    <sequence>Using MSExcel, random number generation employed to allocate subject ID to treatment orders. Depending on the sample characteristics, we may use a Block Randomisation or a Minimisation procedure to allocate participants to ensure comparability of the groups on variables such as age, sex, disease activity etc.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a significant health issue and the burden of disease represented by OA is likely to escalate with the aging of the population  OA of the hand is a common form of OA but has received much less research attention than OA of the hip or knee. While various treatments exist for OA, interest is increasing in those provided by naturally occurring compounds. These compounds, while safe, are often largely untested with respect to the claims made about their efficacy in the market place. We will examine whether curcumin (a derivative of tumeric) can provide pain relief and increased mobility of the thumb joint.</summary>
