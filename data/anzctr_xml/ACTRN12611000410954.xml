  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dignity Therapy is a brief, individualized psychotherapeutic intervention where people with terminal illness are offered the opportunity to create a generativity document, the Dignity Therapy transcript.  In a recorded face-to-face interview guided by a counsellor, the patient is invited to recount aspects of their life they want remembered, find meaning and purpose to their life, and express final words or advice to their family and friends.  The interview is transcribed and edited, and a final document is returned to the patient to share with others as they wish.  This short-term therapy can be delivered in two to four sessions of 45 minutes to an hour over the course of a week or two, depending on the patient's desires and health status.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dignity Therapy, a brief psychotherapeutic intervention based on empirical research into the concept of dignity at the end of life, has proven successful at increasing hope, sense of meaning and will to live in a palliative care population where most patients had cancer diagnoses (Chochinov, Hack et al. 2005).  This study will establish the feasibility and acceptability of offering Dignity Therapy to the MND patient population, and measure associations of the intervention with increased hope, meaning and dignity.   It will lay the groundwork for a possible future experimental study. 

This study will also examine what impact Dignity Therapy has on the MND family carer during the caring experience, specifically looking at whether Dignity Therapy with the patient is associated with an increase in hope or decrease in anxiety, depression and caregiver burden in the family carer.  Previous Dignity Therapy studies focused on the interventions positive influence on the bereavement experience of family members, but did not look at how the intervention may affect the carer during the caring experience.</summary>
