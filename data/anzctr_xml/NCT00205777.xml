Anterior iliac crest bone biopsy done to exclude presence of osteomalacia or more subtle defects in mineralization; investigated qualitative aspects of bone. Also assessed decrease in rate of bone turnover, investigated mechanism for observed increase in BMD Calculated indices included: Bone Formation Rate (BFR)-Bone Volume Reference (BFRBV). BFR accounts the bone volume which is actively mineralizing, which depends on the number of osteoblasts that are active. BFR= Fraction of mineralizing volume and bone volume multiplied by mineralization apposition rate (MAR).</outcome>

      <outcome>Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) - WHQ is a measure of mid-aged women's emotional and physical health. Consists of 36-item assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health: Depressed mood; Somatic symptoms; Anxiety/fears; Vasomotor symptoms; Sleep problems; Sexual behavior; Menstrual symptoms; Memory/concentration; and Attractiveness. Each item scored on a 4 point scale (yes definitely, yes sometimes, not much, no not at all) reduced to binary option as 0 (no) and 1 (yes). Domain subscale score was calculated as sum of domain items score divided by number of domain items. Total score was calculated as the sum of individual domain subscale score divided by number of domains. Total score range from 0 (absent) to 1 (present), with higher scores indicating more pronounced distress and dysfunction. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</outcome>

      <outcome>European Foundation for Osteoporosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (QUALEFFO) - QUALEFFO is an osteoporosis-specific health instrument developed specifically for participants with vertebral deformities used to evaluate the effect of back pain and treatment on quality of life. The QUALEFFO questionnaire includes 41 items in 5 domains: pain, physical function, social function, general health perception, and mental function. The total score is calculated according to the scoring algorithm developed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. Total scores are reported from 0 to 100, with lower scores corresponding to better quality of life. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</outcome>

      <outcome>Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)- Health State Profile Utility Score - EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state. Baseline values at different time points were considered only for the participants who were evaluable at those time points.</outcome>
