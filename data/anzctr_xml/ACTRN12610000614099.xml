  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions are delivered primarily in schools and are developed in coordination with Student Health Councils. Interventions aim to promote healthy eating and increase physical activity before, during and after school. Interventions such as school policies and improvements to the physical environment at school (e.g. school canteen, water fountains, sporting equipment) also implemented.

The main intervention activity is in the development of the student Health Councils so that the students can design and develop interventions that are acceptable and appropriate for their school. For example, Student Health Councils are supported to initiate and administer breakfast clubs, lunchtime activities, and health promotions in their schools. The Student Health Councils meet weekly throughout the intervention (3 years) .</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison group is exposed to background activities in the region with no specific intervention activities initiated. For example, schools in the comparison group may be involved with regional providers that deliver activity sessions in schools or may initiate their own school food policies.</comparator>
