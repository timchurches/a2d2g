    <interventions>Medical scribe use by Emergency Doctors.

A trained medical scribe will assist an emergency doctor during emergency consultations. Doctors will be allocated scribes by randomisation of scribes into available shifts. They may work with one or more scribes over the whole study, but only with one scribe per clinical shift.

The training the scribes have received is a pre-work course with additional tutorials and simulation training, followed by observer shifts as a trainee with gradually increasing responsibility (between 7 and 16 clinical shifts). They are deemed to be competent when they have undertaken three shifts in a row and been evaluated as competent after each shift on a modified Angoff scribe performance score. 

Scribes will take clinical consultation notes as directed and will assist with clerical tasks as directed. Scribes will be randomly allocated to shifts of public Emergency Department doctors in Victoria (at enrolled sites) over a one year period from November 2016 to October 2017.

Each site will require 100 clinical shifts and 100 controls. We estimate that this will require 3 months of 1 EFT of scribe per site. Scribes will also be required to work initial orientation shifts at each new site prior to commencing collecting study data (to learn the site processes and electronic medical record functionality). We estimate this period to be 2 weeks per site.

There will be no minimum or maximum number of shifts for a physician to be exposed to, however it is likely that 4 physicians will be required per site - anticipating an even spread of about 12-13 shifts per physician at each site.</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Emergency doctors (eligible to participate in the study who were allocated to receive scribes for some shifts) will carry out their usual work without the assistance of a medical scribe which includes their usual note taking and clerical duties during the same study time period.

2. Emergency doctors (eligible to participate in the study who were not allocated scribes for any shift) will carry out their usual work without the assistance of a medical scribe which includes their usual note taking and clerical duties during the same study time period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emergency doctor productivity (patients per hour per doctor) working with a scribe, compared to working without a scribe.

This will be measured by integrating 3 sources of information from 3 databases.
1. Electronic metadata collected during usual care for each patient from each ED
(demorgraphics (age, gender), triage category, arrival and departure time from the ED, name of physician allocated to the patient)

2. Doctor's rosters

3. Scribe's rosters</outcome>
      <timepoint>August 2016 to October 2017</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Income (per hour per doctor) for the hospital using a scribe compared to income (per hour per doctor) for the hospital without using a scribe at Bendigo Emergency Department

Assessment will be via hospital administrative databases which collect data on income achieved per patient after coding processes are undertaken for the patient attendances; combined with the ED administrative databases on time of patient arrival and discharge; compared to doctor and scribe rosters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>August 2016 to November 2017</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Productivity of Emergency Doctors using dictation systems for medical notes compared to using medical scribes generating medical notes at Austin Emergency Department

This will be assessed comparing patients per hour per doctor with and without medical scribes. It is the same data collected in the primary outcome, however it is a subset only from the Austin, which is the only site that uses ED doctor dictation services.</outcome>
      <timepoint>August 2016 to November 2017</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stress levels of Emergency Physicians supervising trainees during clinical shifts at Dandenong Emergency Department comparing shifts using a medical scribe to shifts without a medical scribe

This will be assessed via a survey. The same survey is anticipated to be used that is currently running at Cabrini ED ANZCTR number 12616000202460p, measuring responses against a likert score.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emergency doctor documentation quality comparing documentation using a scribe to documentation without using a scribe at Bendigo

Evaluations of documentation will be made by emergency physicians blinded to the role of the author that will assess features of documentation important to Emergency Presentations. The features will be measured using 5 point Likert scores. Examples would include:
documentation of presenting complaint
documentation of medication allergies
documentation of diagnoses and number of diagnoses
documentation of disposition plan for the patient</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All doctors eligible for inclusion into the study will be enrolled at each site. Doctors enrolled will then be randomly allocated to either receive or not receive scribes for the duration of the study. Doctors allocated to receive scribes will then have their available shifts determined and those shifts will randomly have scribes allocated to them or not. </concealment>
    <sequence>Doctors and shifts will be allocated using the Excel random number generator program by an investigator in advance of the study being undertaken (as soon as each roster becomes available for analysis).</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Doctors will have many shifts available for scribes. A proportion of these available shifts will receive scribes (randomly allocated). This will mean that sometimes the study doctors have scribes allocated during the study period, sometimes they won't.
There will be another group of doctors who will be eligible for scribes but aren't randomised into this arm of the study. They will form a contemporaneous comparator group.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Demographics of patients and doctors will largely be compared using KruskallWallis equality-of-populations rank test for age and X2-tests for other variables.
Differences between scribed and un-scribed shifts in patient age, wait time and duration of stay will be assessed using linear regression (scribe predictor).
Stress levels of doctors will be measured by survey and 5 point Likert scales will be generated. These will be analysed using non-parametric comparisons.
Documentation quality will be compared using blinded analysis (to patient identifiers and to whether the notes were scribed or generated by the physician without the use of a scribe) of individual medical notes, marked on a 5 point Likert scale by emergency physicians. They will be analysed using non-parametric comparisons.

The sample size was calculated using a medical productivity of 0.86 patients per hour per doctor (generated from the current initial results of medical productivity at Cabrini Emergency Department, evaluated in study ACTRN12615000607572), using a 2-tailed test with a significance level of 5%, seeking a productivity improvement of 15% (which is an estimate of the economic viability/breakeven point for the role in Australia). This requires 100 shifts and 100 controls and each site requires the same on iterative sample size testing.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Medical scribes are clerical assistants to doctors. ED docs currently spend 48% of their time on clerical data entry into computers. Scribes undertake secretarial/clerical data entry tasks in Emergency departments to enable the doctor to leave their desk and get back to the bedside to treat more patients in a safe, cost-effective way. There is economic equipoise about whether the scribe role should be introduced to Australia. Work to date has been undertaken at Cabrini ED and shows promise. There is a need for a mulit-centre public ED evaluation of the role. There is no equivalent study anywhere in the world.

We are undertaking a multi-centre randomised controlled trial of scribes, using Australian scribes we have trained at Cabrini this year in a research capacity. Cabrini is auspicing the study and the principle investigator is Dr Katie Walker. Scribes will be randomly allocated to consenting doctors to work at each site for 5 months FTE (100 scribed shifts and 100 control shifts at each site) and administrative data on consultations per hour per doctor will be gathered.

We will evaluate the role and its impact on medical productivity in four sites which represent typical public Emergency departments across Victoria and Australia. The sites are Bendigo, Austin, Monash Paeds and Dandenong. We have gathered a team of national and international experts who work in Victoria to ensure robust delivery of the project with expert methodology and execution. We have the only medical scribe workforce available in Australia ready to participate. This will enable a determination on whether scribes provide a cost-effective way of delivering medical care in Australian EDs.</summary>
