    <statisticalmethods>Change scores (delta) from baseline to week 4 and from baseline to week 8 will be calculated for each individual to reduce within-group variability. Group means of the change scores will be assessed using one-way independent ANOVA with Gabriels post-hoc comparison test, at p &lt; .05. Correlation between appetite and anxiety and stress will be assessed using Pearsons r. 

A priori power analyses conducted using G*Power version 3.1.9.2 (Buchner, Erdfelder, Faul, &amp; Lang, 2014) determined a sample size of 111 was required to attain a power of .80 for detecting a large effect size (assuming ANOVA is used to test for interaction effects; if simple one way ANOVA used to test the differences between means, only 52 participants are needed). This indicates that our proposed sample size (N = 120) is adequate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to conduct a preliminary investigation of Caralluma supplement to examine its efficacy for reducing anxiety and stress in healthy adults over eight weeks. The study will assess 1 g/day compared to placebo. Satiety will also be measured to investigate any correlation between treatment effect for anxiety / stress and self-reported reduction in appetite. 

It is hypothesised that a reduction in anxiety and stress (i.e., a decrease in negative anxiety scores ) over eight weeks would be significantly greater in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. Regarding Carallumas effect on satiety, it is hypothesised that a decrease in the VAS score would be significantly greater in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. It is also hypothesised that a decrease in the VAS score for appetite would be positively correlated with a decrease in the anxiety and stress scales.  </summary>
