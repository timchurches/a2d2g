  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive either testosterone undecanoate intramuscular injection (REANDRON 'Registered Trademark' 1000mg/4ml solution) or placebo at 8-week intervals for 48-weeks, with initial administration occurring within 3-months of traumatic brain injury. Ampoules of REANDRON 'Registered Trademark' and matching placebo will be supplied by Bayer-Schering, Australia. </interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo ampoules will match the REANDRON 'Registered Trademark' vials in appearance and content to maintain blinding.  Placebo testosterone will be presented in an identical 5 ml glass ampoule and has similar appearance as a clear, yellowish oily solution.  Ingredients include benzyl benzoate and castor oil.  Bayer Australia Limited will supply the matching placebo ampoules.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the cognitive and behavioural effects of the intervention compared to placebo, both objective tests and behavioural rating scales will be utilised. The primary outcome measures for this trial include the Mini Mental State Examination, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, WAIS-III Digit Span, WAIS-III Digit Symbol Test, and Controlled Oral Word Association Test. The primary behavioural rating scale includes the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale, both patient and informant versions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 12 months from initial treatment administration</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the blood and brain biomarkers associated with Alzheimers disease, and neuroinflammation in the intervention and placebo groups. This primary outcome assesses the change-from-baseline in biomarkers including the brain beta-amyloid burden, as measured by amyloid PET, plasma beta-amyloid, and inflammatory and oxidative markers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 12 months from initial treatment administration</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the psychosocial outcomes of the intervention when compared to placebo, the Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory, both patient and informant versions will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 12 months from initial treatment administration.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine participant quality of life after the intervention, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Quality of life after Brain Injury will be used. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 12 months from initial treatment administration.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

This also includes drug/alcohol dependency related disorders;
People whose primary language is other than English;

    <concealment>Informed consent will be obtained prior to initiation of any clinical screening procedure. Informed consent may be obtained up to 28 days before the first treatment. More than one visit may be required to complete all the screening evaluations.

If the participant meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, randomisation will be performed via the IVRS/IWRS. Randomisation number and treatment kit numbers will be provided by IVRS/IWRS. Participants, medical doctors, and the research staff will be blinded to the randomisation outcome. Administration of study drug or placebo will commence within 28 days of screen. 

Participants will subsequently be administered either testosterone or placebo injection.</concealment>
    <sequence>Assignment will be randomised using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). We will provide the age, admission GCS score, and education. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>The design is a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will include estimates of effect (% success) together with 95% confidence intervals.  Exploratory analyses will include ANOVA, chi-squared, t-tests, and regression techniques where appropriate. It is planned to make formal comparisons between the randomized groups to assess the efficacy of testosterone injection compared to placebo.
The requisite number of participants was determined by a priori analysis using G*Power version 3.1.5. Based on two-tailed analysis with a medium effect size of .30 and an alpha of .05., a sample size of 80 (df=78) would be needed to achieve a power of .79.</statisticalmethods>
