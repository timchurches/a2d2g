  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers who decide to participants will need to sign and return the Consent Form prior to the commencement of the following sequential study procedures:

Telephone Screen
Upon receipt of a signed Consent Form the participants will be contacted by the research nurse who will conduct a telephone screen to check your initial eligibility for the study. This telephone screen will be carried out at a time convenient to you and will take approximately 30 minutes. 

During this telephone screen the research nurse will ask you questions relating to your current medications, previous history of any mental health condition, previous history of injuries to your head or neck and past medical history.

Online Survey
If the research nurse confirms that you meet the initial eligibility to continue in the study you will be asked to complete an online survey. This survey will be sent by email to you for you to complete. Your name will not appear on the survey it will be replaced with a unique participant number. This survey will ask you more in-depth questions about your previous medical history including any history of depression and/or anxiety, any drug and alcohol use, previous head  injury  and/or  pain.  You will be asked to complete the survey on your own and it is expected to take you approximately 30 minutes.

The research nurse or study psychologist will contact you soon after you have completed the online survey to discuss any queries or concerns that may have arisen for you as a result.  

Psychological Assessment
If you are confirmed to be eligible to continue to participate in the psychological assessment, an appointment will be made for you with the studys clinical psychologist. In this study the researchers prefer this assessment to be carried out face-to-face, However, we recognise that this may not possible for all participants because of the distance they are from the study site. For participants who are unable to attend a face-to-face interview, which will be conducted in the Clinical Research Facility at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, than the clinical psychologist will conduct this assessment via Skype or telephone at an appointed time. 

The clinical psychologist will perform the psychological assessment using a structured interview process which includes the completion of questionnaires.  The WebNeuro cognitive assessment that will be required to be complete online assesses your motor tapping, choice reaction time, verbal memory-recall and digit span. This assessment takes approximately 30  60 minutes to complete.

If you are confirmed to be unsuitable to continue participation in the study during this assessment then the clinical psychologist will inform you of this either during or after your assessment. If you require further clinical follow up or require ongoing psychological support, the study psychologist will provide a written referral to your local doctor or alternatively refer you to the public mental health care system closest to you.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
If you are confirmed to be eligible to proceed on to have the imaging of your brain then the research nurse will arrange an appointment visit for you at one of the following facilities: 
 
- Herston Imaging Research Facility, Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital campus, Bowen Bridge Road, Herston
- Princess Alexandra Hospital Medical Imaging Department, Ipswich Road, Woolloongabba
- Hunter Medical Research Institute Imaging Centre, John Hunter Hospital campus Newcastle, Lookout Road, Newcastle 

During your visit to the imaging facility you will be required to undergo two non-invasive imaging procedures with a clinical scanner used for routine testing. Your two scan procedures will be done in a single visit on the same day with a short break in between. 

For the 1st MRS scan you will be require to lie in the scanner for approximately 40 minutes. During this scan images of your brain and information on its chemistry will be obtained.

The 2nd MRI scan is a functional MRI and will assess the blood flow in different areas of your brain. This scan will take approximately 45 minutes. These are additional MR scans which you would not be undergoing unless you were part of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD)  is  a  complex  condition  where  sufferers  are  affected  by  a  varying  range  of symptoms following an exposure to a traumatic situation or event. Sufferers may experience symptoms such as recurrent and intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, or distress and avoidance of situations that are similar to the event that first occurred.

It is not yet known why some people experience PTSD following a traumatic event and others do not. This research study aims to try to determine if the chemicals that allow the brain to carry out its normal functions are different in a person who suffers from PTSD when compared to a person who does not. 

In this study researchers will use a technique called Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to look for any changes in the normal chemistry of the brain. The researchers will then compare the images obtained from participants who have PTSD with those who do not. 

The researchers conducting this study hope that by using MRS to look for and isolate any abnormalities in the brain chemicals of those with PTSD this may lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment for PTSD suffers in the future.

MRS is a non-invasive medical test. It is conducted on the same machine as conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The MRI scan uses a powerful magnet, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed images. MRS is a series of tests that are added to an MRI scan to measure the chemical properties of molecules in cells and tissues. 

In this study MRI will be used to take anatomical images of your brain and MRS will be used to provide detailed information about the nature and chemical environment of the molecules in your brain.
