  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With over one million operations a year, cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is one
      of the most common major surgical procedures worldwide (1). Acute kidney injury is a common
      and serious postoperative complication of cardiopulmonary bypass and may affect 25% to 50% of
      patients (2-4). Acute kidney injury carries significant costs (4) and is independently
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality (2,3). Even minimal increments in plasma
      creatinine are associated with an increase in mortality (5,6).

      Multiple causes of cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury have been proposed,
      including ischemia-reperfusion, generation of reactive oxygen species, hemolysis and
      activation of inflammatory pathways (7-10). To date, no simple, safe and effective
      intervention to prevent cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury in a broad
      patient population has been found (11-14).

      Urinary acidity may enhance the generation and toxicity of reactive oxygen species induced by
      cardiopulmonary bypass (10,15). Activation of complement during cardiac surgery (16) may also
      participate in kidney injury. Urinary alkalinization may protect from kidney injury induced
      by oxidant substances, iron-mediated free radical pathways, complement activation and tubular
      hemoglobin cast formation (9,17,18). Of note, increasing urinary pH - in combination with
      N-acetylcysteine (19,20) or without (21) - has recently been reported to attenuate acute
      kidney injury in patients undergoing contrast-media infusion.

      In a pilot double-blind, randomized controlled trial the investigators found sodium
      bicarbonate to be efficacious, safe, inexpensive and easy to administer. These findings now
      need to be confirmed or refuted by further clinical investigations in other geographic and
      institutional settings.

      Accordingly, the investigators hypothesized that urinary alkalinization might protect kidney
      function in patients at increased risk of acute kidney injury undergoing cardiopulmonary
      bypass needs to be confirmed in an international multicenter, double-blind, randomized
      controlled trial of intravenous sodium bicarbonate.</summary>
