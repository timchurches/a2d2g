    <interventions>Intervention Group 1:

- A new IT tool will be used by the patient and primary level care team (patient, general practitioner (GP), practice nurse (PN), allied health professionals (AHPs), specialists) to support care planning, share information with the patient and the team, and support a streamlined referrals process.

- An education and training program will ensure that people (both practitioners and people with diabetes) can navigate the resources available to them and improve peoples understanding of diabetes management and include four components:
1. Training specifically on how to implement the DCP for practitioners and will be conducted at the start of the DCP. Practitioners will the option to complete the training in-person or online, however, in-person training will be encouraged.
2. Forums for all enrolled practitioners which will be held once each quarter, in-person, to discuss how the project is progressing and hear from a guest speaker on diabetes. 
3. Weekly to monthly (frequency depending on demand) phone access to a diabetes specialist for all practitioners to discuss specific concerns/questions
4. DCP website which includes information on what the DCP is about and links to multiple diabetes related resources for both practitioners and patients which can be accessed at any time during the trial.

- A new funding model will make more funding available for the care of those with the greatest need ('need' is based on a pre-defined set of clinical metrics), and will reward practices for improving patient health outcomes, improving patient experience, and delivering best-practice standards of care (through quality improvement support payments).  This funding model will replace care planning MBS items,  those items associated with diabetes-related PIPs/SIPs and AHP funding tied to a patients care plantypical GP consults continue to be claimed through Medicare.

- A new Care Facilitator role will be created. Care Facilitators, in collaboration with the general practice team and other members of the care team, will support the patient in finding the best available care options and proactively managing their care.

    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed for patients

Patients will know which group they will be in (control, Intervention 1, Intervention 2) at the time of enrolment

Allocation is concealed for general practices through a central randomisation process run by UniSA and notified via the phone and mail.

This trial will be run as a pragmatic clustered randomized clustered trial.

The clusters are general practices, meaning general practices will be recruited and then patients will be recruited from participating general practices. Each general practice (and all enrolled patients connected to that practice) will be randomised into either the control group, Intervention Group 1 or Intervention Group 2

Our recruitment of general practices will focus on the Medicare Locals/Divisions of General Practice of our consortium partners in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria.

Each Medicare Local/ Division of General Practice will be allocated either to Intervention group 1 or Intervention group 2. This means that each Medicare Local/ Division of General Practice will have general practices in either Intervention 1 or Intervention 2 and general practices in the control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use a block randomisation process which is applied separately for each Medicare Local /Division of General Practice and separately for urban (RA-1) and rural (RA-2-5) general practices.</sequence>

    <summary>Diabetes Care project - Overview


Brief Project Description:

The Diabetes Care Project (DCP) is an approximately two-year pilot which is part of the Australian Governments response to the growing incidence of chronic disease in Australia. The pilot will test new ways of providing more flexible, better coordinated care, to improve the management of care for people with diabetes.  Approximately 150 general practices and over 10,000 patients across three states will be participating in the pilot.

What does the project involve?

The project is piloting four key changes in how care is delivered to people with diabetes:
1. A new IT tool will be used by the care team to support care planning, share information with the patient and the team, and support a streamlined referrals process
2. An education and training program will ensure that people (both practitioners and people with diabetes) can navigate the resources available to them and improve peoples understanding of diabetes management. This training will be delivered online, in person, and on paper.   
3. A new funding model will make more funding available for the care of those with the greatest need, and will reward practices for improving patient health outcomes, improving patient experience, and delivering best-practice standards of care.  This funding model will only replace care planning MBS items and those items associated with diabetes-related PIPs/SIPstypical GP consults continue to be claimed through Medicare
4. A new Care Facilitator role will be created. Care Facilitators, in collaboration with the general practice team and other members of the care team, will support the patient in finding the best available care options 
To ensure proper evaluation of the impact of the pilots new model of care, participants must experience a different mix of arrangements. After enrolling, each practice will be placed into one of the following three groups:
1. Control Group: This group practices care as usual with no major changes
2. Intervention Group 1: care is funded as usual.  Practices will receive support through a new online IT tool and there will be a greater focus on care coordination (changes 1-2 above)
3. Intervention Group 2: This group introduces a Care Facilitator role in patient care, support from a new online IT tool, and new funding arrangements for practices and allied health professionals (changes 1-4 above)</summary>
