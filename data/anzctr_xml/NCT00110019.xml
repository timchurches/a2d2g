  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival is defined as time from study entry to death from any cause. The comparison of overall survival was conducted in intention-to-treat population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survival was assessed every 3 months if patient is &lt; 2 years from study entry. Every 6 months is patient is 2-5 years from study entry.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival - Progression-free survival was defined as time from study entry to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients without disease progression were censored at last date of assessment. Disease progression was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles during cycle 1 through 10, and every 3 cycles after cycle 10. Survival was assessed every 3 months if patient is &lt; 2 years from study entry, and every 6 months if 2-5 years from study entry.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response (Complete and Partial Response) Rate - Tumor response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Objective response =complete response (CR) + partial response (PR). Complete response is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles during cycle 1 through 10. After cycle 10, tumor response was assessed after every 3 cycles.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial studies carboplatin, paclitaxel, and sorafenib tosylate to
      see how well they work compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with stage
      III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sorafenib tosylate may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and
      paclitaxel together with sorafenib tosylate is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel
      in treating melanoma.</summary>
