  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was defined as the time from randomization to time of first documented disease progression (unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions) or death, whichever occurred first as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 (RECIST v1.0). Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started. Primary PFS variable was defined based on the investigators' assessments and the statistical conclusions on the primary efficacy endpoint were based on investigator assessed PFS. PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 9 weeks up to Week 36, thereafter every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to the clinical cutoff of 30 June 2011, up to 4.75 years)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death. OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 9 weeks up to Week 36, thereafter every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to the clinical cutoff of 30 June 2011, up to 4.75 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Best Overall Response (OR) of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) in Participants With Measurable Disease at Baseline - Best OR was assessed using RECIST v1.0 criteria. Participants were classified as responders if their best OR was either confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or confirmed PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter [LD] of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD). Participants without any post-baseline assessments were regarded as non-responders. The 95% CI for the one sample binomial using Pearson-Clopper method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 9 weeks up to Week 36, thereafter every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to the clinical cutoff of 30 June 2011, up to 4.75 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DR) - DR was defined as the time when response (CR or PR per RECIST v1.0) was first documented to the date of disease progression per RECIST v1.0 (unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions) or death. Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 9 weeks up to Week 36, thereafter every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to the clinical cutoff of 30 June 2011, up to 4.75 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) - TTF was defined as the time between randomization and date of disease progression (per RECIST v1.0; unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions), death, or withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events, withdrawal of informed consent, insufficient therapeutic response, refusal of treatment/failure to co-operate, or failure to return, whichever occurred first. Progressive disease is defined using RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 9 weeks up to Week 36, thereafter every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to the clinical cutoff of 30 June 2011, up to 4.75 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Generic (FACT-G) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) Subscale Scores - FACT-G is core questionnaire of Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) measurement system to evaluate quality of life (QoL) in cancer population. FACT-G consisted of 27 questions grouped in 4 domains of general Health-Related QoL (HRQoL): Physical Well-being (PWB), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB) and Functional Well-Being (FWB); each ranged from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). FACT-G ranged between 0-108. Since questions could be reversed coded, as appropriate, before calculating FACT-G, 0 and 108 could be considered worst and best health states. FACT -B is used for assessment of HRQoL in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: 7 items for each physical, functional, social/family; all 3 ranged from 0-28, emotional (6 items) ranged from 0-24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranged from 0-36. All single-item measures ranges from 0-144. High scale score represents a better QoL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Cycles 3, 5, 11, and post progressive disease (PD; 14 to 28 days after disease progression [up to the clinical cutoff of 30 June 2011, up to 4.75 years])</timepoint>

    <summary>This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of Avastin plus Herceptin/docetaxel,
      versus Herceptin/docetaxel alone, in patients with HER2 positive locally recurrent or
      metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic
      disease. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either Avastin (15mg/kg iv q3weeks) +
      Herceptin (8mg/kg iv loading dose and 6mg/kg iv q3weeks maintenance) + docetaxel (100mg/m2 iv
      q3weeks) or Herceptin + docetaxel alone. The anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.</summary>
