  <interventions>
    <interventions>FDG PET/CT imaging on a dedicated PET/CT system (Siemens Biograph) is to be performed at baseline, and after one cycle and four cycles of Cetuximab therapy. CT is to be performed every 3 months to determine the progression-free survival. Patients will be followed up for at least one year. The FDG PET/CT imaging is non-invasive but requires the patients to fast for 6 hours before the examination and takes up to 3-hour stay.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the current study is to determine if the change in parameters acquired by FDG-PET/CT before and 4 weeks after the initiation of cetuximab therapy is predictive of the progression-free survival (PFS) in the third-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer</summary>
