  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 physiotherapy sessions (one 60 minute session and eleven 30 minute session one to one) delivering the Lyn Watson MDI Program.  This rehabilitation program is primarily based around maintaining good scapula and humeral head control through 6 stages.  Assessment of the effect of  manual correction determines the position of scapula and/or humeral head control that improves a patients objective asterisk(s).  This position is then adopted in a setting action whist performing drills in the relevant stages. 
Exercises are performed with theraband or weights for resistance.  An outline of the 6 stages of the Lyn Watson protocol is as follows:


Stage 1- Coronel Plane Strengthening 0 to 45 degrees Abduction: 
Scapula upward rotation and tilting
Internal Rotation/External Rotation from 0 to 45 abduction with theraband
Standing/bent over rows 0 to 45 degrees abduction

Stage 2- Building Posterior Musculature
Bent over rows
Side lie external rotation
Standing rows

Stage 3: Flexion Drills 
Flexion Drills from 0 to 45 degrees Abduction

Stage 4: Coronal Plane Strengthening 45 to 90 degrees Abduction
Internal Rotation/External Rotation from 45 to 90 degrees abduction with theraband
Standing/bent over rows 0 to 45 degrees abduction
Flexion to 90 degrees abduction 

Stage 5: Specific Strength Drills
Bent over rows (Posterior deltoid)
Supine and sitting flexion (Anterior deltoid)
Lateral Raises (Middle deltoid) 

Stage 6: Sports Specific and Functional Specific Drills
Drills determined by the requirements of the patient.
Load and progressed to allow for return to sport or function. 


Each week will be used to review, prescribe and progress the exercise program.  A trained trial physiotherapist will deliver the program and compliance will be monitored by exercise log sheets. 

Each participant will be asked to perform his or her prescribed exercise program at home (home exercise program).  This will involve the participant performing 3 to 7 exercises with the use of therabands and weights, which will be provided to the participant as part of the trial.  The exercise program will take between 15 and 20 minutes to complete and will be performed two to three times a day; to once every two days, depending on the phase of the program.  At the beginning of the program, the exercises will focus more on recruitment of muscle (exercises performed two to three times a day) and later in the program the exercises may focus more on muscle strength (exercises performed once every second day). 


At the end of the 12 week program and after the 12 week outcome measures have been taken, participants who score less than a minimal detectable change on both primary outcome measures have the option to cross over into the alternative treatment arm for a subsequent 12 weeks. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>12 physiotherapy sessions (one 60 minute session and eleven 30 minute session one to one) delivering the Rockwood Instability Program. Each week will be used to review, prescribe and progress the exercise program. The program focuses on concurrently strengthening all three parts of the deltoid, the internal and external rotators of the glenohumeral joint and scapula stabilizing muscles, in two phases.  

The exercises for each phase remain the same and are as follows:
Standing external rotation
Standing internal rotation
Standing punch
Standing row 
Abduction to 45 degrees
Wall, knee and full push ups

Phase 1: involves the above exercise with increasing resistances of theraband: 0.5kg (tan 50 % elongation), 1.0kg (tan), 1.5kg (yellow), 2.0kg(red), 2.5kg(green) and 3kg (blue). 

Phase 2: Once the participant has progressed to the blue band then the participant performs the same exercises with a weight and pulley system commencing with a load of 4-5 kg and working in 1kg increments to 7kg (female) or 11 kg (male).

 A trained trial physiotherapist will deliver the program and compliance will be monitored by exercise log sheets. 


Each participant will be asked to perform his or her prescribed exercise program at home (home exercise program).  This will involve the participant performing 3 to 7 exercises with the use of therabands and weights, which will be provided to the participant as part of the trial.  The exercise program will take between 15 and 20 minutes to complete and will be performed two times a day throughout the entire 12 week program. 


At the end of the 12 week program and after the 12 week outcome measures have been taken, participants who score less than a minimal detectable change on both primary outcome measures have the option to cross over into the alternative treatment arm for a subsequent 12 weeks. </comparator>

Randomisation will be done by the contacting an off-site trial administrator who will hold the randomisation schedule, and will not be involved in assessing, enrolling or treating participants.

A researcher at La Trobe University who will have no contact with

Two different groups of participants with MDI will receive two different exercise programs for a duration of 12 weeks.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed on intention to treat principles (primary method) and on a per protocol basis. Data Analysed will focus on detecting the between group treatment and within group treatment effects (with effect sizes and 95 % confidence intervals) at each of the follow up time points. Primary analyses for the MISS, the WOSI, scapula co-ordinates, scapula angles, strength, angle of symptom onset in abduction, limiting angle in abduction and the Orebro will be performed using linear mixed models. If the data is inappropriate for the use of a linear mixed models, a repeated measures ANCOVA will be used. Global rating of change and satisfaction scores will be measured with Mann Whitney U tests. Reason for limit in abduction and incidence of dislocation will be analysed with chi square tests. Adverse events, medications taken, co-interventions, compliance with the exercise program and success of blinding will be recorded.

If the primary efficacy analysis reveals statistical significance between groups on a primary outcome measure, a responder analyses will be conducted to detect the clinical importance between groups. This will be achieved by dichotomizing individual participants as either responders or non responders based on whether they improved from baseline by more than the MCID on the MISS (5 points) and/or the WOSI (10.4%). The difference between the proportions of participants who experience an improvement greater than the MCID in the two groups will then be analysed with risk ratios, risk differences and numbers needed to treat.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to compare the relative effectiveness of two different and standardised exercise programs (The Lyn Watson Program and The Rockwood Program) on function and instability specific outcomes as well as strength and scapula measures, on patients with non traumatic Multidirectional Instability of the glenohumeral joint.
The hypothesis is that the Lyn Watson program will produce clinically and statistically superior results on outcomes due to the programs focus on achieving and maintaining scapula control.
