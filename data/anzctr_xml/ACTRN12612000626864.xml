    <interventions>All participants will be recruited at the pre-anaesthetic visit and randomised to receive either an inhaled placebo or inhaled salbutamol (200 mg; Ventolin, GSK) via a Metered Dose Inhaler (pMDI) and spacer approx 30 min prior to surgery. The attending anaesthetists, the surgeon, recovery staff, as well as the research staff undertaking lung function assessments will be blinded to the group allocation.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will be recruited at the pre-anaesthetic visit and randomised to receive either an inhaled placebo (identical to salbutamol puffer but without salbutmol) or inhaled salbutamol (200 mg; Ventolin, GSK) via a Metered Dose Inhaler (pMDI) and spacer approx 30 min prior to surgery. The propellant used in both puffers is hydrofluoroalkane.

      <outcome>Lung function changes before and after the administration of salbutamol or placebo

Lung Function will be measured prior to surgery using the forced oscillation technique, as described below prior to and 15 minutes following administration of salbutamol or placebo. Mean Zrs from 3-5 acceptable measurements will be obtained as per international guidelines and respiratory resistance, reactance, frequency dependence and area under the reactance curve reported. Baseline values will be expressed as standardised deviation (z) scores using locally derived reference values and bronchodilator response reported as the relative (%) change from baseline. Lung volumes will be assessed at the same time.
Forced oscillation: 
The mechanical impedance of the respiratory system (Zrs) will be measured with the modification of the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT). Briefly, a small-amplitude signal between 4-64 Hz will be delivered to the subject through a mouthpiece and/or LMA (as appropriate) via a low-deadspace wave tube. The averaged Zrs data between 4 and 40 Hz will be evaluated to obtain total respiratory resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) in line with international guidelines. In addition to the average values the within-breath variations of these parameters as functions of tidal volume and flow will also be determined. 
Lung volumes: 
Functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilation distribution (lung clearance index and moment ratios) will be measured using an ultrasonic flow meter (Exhalyzer D with ICU insert, Eco Medics, Duernten, Switzerland) using the multiple breath nitrogen wash-out (MBW). Children will breathe via a mouthpiece (or LMA as appropriate) -with a nose clip in place. Once a stable breathing pattern has been established, 100% O2 is introduced and continued until the exhaled nitrogen concentration is stable and decreased to &lt;1.5%. Washout data are analysed off-line for FRC and global indices of ventilation distribution and will include the lung clearance index, alveolar-based mean dilution numbers and the mixing ratio.  An increase in markers of ventilation distribution reflects more inhomogeneous ventilation.</outcome>

    <concealment>All patients will be recruited at the pre-anaesthetic visit. Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be enrolled and only after informed consent is given voluntarily by the guardian and by the patient if appropriate.  The patients will be randomised by computer generated block randomisation. The next available participant number will be assigned to the patient.
The drug randomisation will be performed by pharmacy at Princess Margaret Hospital. The patient will receive the study drug corresponding with his/her Participant Number. The study drug is in boxes with patient numbers detailed on the outside. The participant number will be used to identify the patient for the duration of the study.
All staff involved with the care of the patient and the data recording and entering will be blinded to the group allocation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the development of anaesthesia management guidelines, perioperative respiratory
adverse events (PRAE) remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality during paediatric
anaesthesia, causing more than three quarters of critical incidents and nearly one third of
all perioperative cardiac arrests.
In a previous large cohort study in over 9000 children, we identified several risk factors
(current or recent upper respiratory tract infection, wheezing &gt;3 times in the last 12
months, eczema, nocturnal dry cough, a family history of asthma, eczema, rhinitis or
passive smoking) which can help in every day clinical practice to identify the children at a
particularly high risk for PRAE. Additionally, we demonstrated in an audit of children with a
recent URTI, that inhaled salbutamol reduced the incidence of perioperative
bronchospasm (5% vs. 11%, p=0.027) and persistent coughing (5.5% vs. 11.5%,
p=0.0314) in the perioperative period. The role of pre-treatment with reliever medications
for other PRAE risk factors (such as asthma, present/past eczema) is unknown. We
therefore propose a double blinded randomised controlled trial of the use of inhaled
salbutamol in children with two or more known risk factors for PRAE on the incidence of
PRAE.
We will randomise 470 children (6-16 years) to receive either inhaled salbutamol or an
inhaled placebo prior to the administration of anaesthesia. We will also assess lung
function before and 15 minutes after the administration of salbutamol or placebo.
Furthermore, we will monitor and record all respiratory complications (laryngospasm,
bronchospasm, severe and persistent coughing, airway obstruction, oxygen desaturation
(&lt;95%) and postoperative stridor).
We hypothesise that children receiving salbutamol will experience significantly less PRAE
when compared with children who did not receive salbutamol preoperatively.
This study may help to reduce the health costs associated with respiratory complications
(e.g. unplanned hospital admissions, prolonged hospital stay, additional treatment) and
may help us to avoid unexpected admissions to the intensive care unit. Additionally, our
findings may lead to a reduction in waiting list times and aid us in deciding the best time for
the childs surgery. Finally, this study may increase the availability of preventative
strategies that may reduce the numbers of children who have their surgery cancelled due
to respiratory issues. Cancellation of surgery has an adverse economic impact for
hospitals, causes enormous emotional and financial burdens on the child and his/her
family who have made many arrangements to attend hospital. Reducing the number of
cancellations will ease the distress experienced by children and their parents when
surgery does not go ahead as planned, which will have add on effects for child/parent
satisfaction regarding their hospital experience.</summary>
