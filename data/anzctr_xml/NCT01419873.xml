  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Actrapid Human Insulin

Treatment: drugs: Actrapid Human Insulin
Actrapid Insulin is a drug used in routine neonatal practice to treat hyperglycaemia. The intervention in this study was to base dosing on insulin by a computer based-model approach as opposed to sliding scales, fixed protocols or clinician intuition

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Very low birthweight neonates commonly develop high blood sugar levels. There is an
      association between high blood sugar levels and poorer short term outcomes but it is not
      known whether the high sugar level itself actually causes the problems.

      There are a range of ways to manage high sugar levels but there are no consensus guidelines
      to follow. One option is to manage the high sugar levels with an infusion of insulin. Studies
      looking at insulin infusions have often used fixed protocols to guide the amount of insulin
      to be given and are often complicated by hypoglycaemia.

      This study investigated whether using a model-based approach to individualise insulin
      administration to neonates with high sugar levels would provide a safe and effective
      management option for controlling blood sugar levels and avoid the complication of low blood
      sugar levels.</summary>
