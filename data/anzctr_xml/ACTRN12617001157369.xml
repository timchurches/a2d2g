  <interventions>
    <interventions>From day 2, volunteers will receive either oral tablets of  lithium 250mg or 500mg/day for 8 weeks. In addition, during weeks 5-6, they will also receive oral tablets of amiloride 5mg/day, and during weeks 7-8, they will receive amiloride 10mg/day. The volunteers will be seen weekly to assess adherence by tablet count. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Fixed sequence design, in which the first 4 weeks, participants will receive lithium alone; in the subsequent 4 weeks, they will have  2 ascending doses of amiloride added to lithium. The objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between 2 dose levels of lithium (250 and 500mg/day) and 2 ascending dose levels of amiloride (5mg and 10mg day).</comparator>

    <designfeatures>This is a randomized (for lithium dose), open-label, fixed sequence study in 12 healthy volunteers. From Day 2 to Day 57, subjects will take lithium 250mg capsules at night, either one or two daily (allocation to lithium dose will be via computer generated random code, stratified by gender). From Days 30- 43, all subjects will take one amiloride 5mg tablet at night.  From Days 44- 57, all subjects will take two amiloride 5mg tablets at night.  
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>1. Demographic and Background Characteristics: Demographic, background characteristics and trial data will be descriptively summarized for all subjects.
2. Plasma lithium concentrations: summary statistics by study week.
3. Urine osmolality: Effect of lithium alone and in combination with 2 amiloride dose levels on changes in urinary concentrating ability by analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
4. PKPD analyses: Modelling of the relationship between plasma lithium concentrations, plasma amiloride concentrations, urinary amiloride concentrations, and change in urinary concentrating ability, to identify Lithium:amiloride dose ratio that minimizes lithium-induced changes in urinary concentrating ability. This will be performed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling techniques.
5. EEG: log Fourier power will be calculated for eyes open and eyes closed periods separately for all electrodes. Frontal midline power, left-right alpha asymmetry, and frontal-posterior alpha asymmetry will be extracted as separate measures and each subjected to repeated measures ANOVA with effect of Lithium and eyes open/closed as factors.
6. A statistically significant 5% reduction in arginine vasopressin (AVP) -stimulated urine osmolality was reported after 4 weeks of lithium treatment in 11 healthy volunteers (Walker 2005).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lithium is first line treatment for acute and maintenance of bipolar affective disorder, and as augmentation for refractory major depression. The most prevalent renal effect of lithium is impairment of renal concentrating ability, which may affect at least half of all patients on chronic lithium treatment. Up to 20% of patients will report polydipsia and polyuria as a result of this change. If lithium is stopped early on, the decreased urinary concentrating ability is largely reversible. However some patients who remain on lithium long term, will develop a progressive impairment of urinary concentrating ability [nephrogenic diabetes insipidus]. This functional lesion is not usually reversible and is associated with a chronic focal interstitial fibrosis in renal biopsy, which may be progressive and lead to end-stage renal failure.

Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that in clinical case series can reverse lithium-induced polyuria and improve renal concentrating ability. Mechanistically, amiloride blocks the renal epithelial sodium channel, which is the major entry site for lithium in collecting duct cells.  Although combining amiloride with lithium could reduce development of lithium-induced renal toxicity, it is unclear what the optimal dose of both drugs might be. Earlier studies have used 10mg/day (Bedford 2008), or 10-20mg/day (Batlle 1985, Kosten 1986).  The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between 2 dose levels of amiloride (5 and 10mg/day) and 2 dose levels of lithium (250 and 500mg/day), based on changes in renal concentrating ability.
