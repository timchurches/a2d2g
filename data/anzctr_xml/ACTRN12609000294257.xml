  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study to determine the maximum dose of CP-870,893 that can be safely administered in combination with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed) as the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma that can't be removed surgically.

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have malignant pleural mesothelioma that cannot be removed surgically and are planned to receive treatment with standard chemotherapy (cisplatin and pemetrexed) . 

Trial details: 
Participants will receive standard treatment with cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy which is given intravenously every 3 weeks, with the addition of CP-870,893 (CD40 activating antibody) on day 8 of each cycle. CP-870,893 activates the immune system which might help treat the cancer. Assessment for side effects by patient questionnaires and assessment by health professional, and collection of blood tests  will occur weekly whilst on treatment and at 90-day follow-up visit.  Tumour response will be measured with scans after the first cycle of treatment (PET scan), and after every 2 cycles of treatment (CT scan).  The study aims to determine the maximum dose, side effects and effectiveness of CP-870,893 that can be safely administered in combination with standard chemotherapy as the first line treatment for malignant mesothelioma.  It will also help to characterise the body's immune response to the treatment.
After the maximum dose of CP-870,893 has been determined, 6 patients receiving the treatment at the maximum dose will have biopsies taken of the cancer before treatment starts and at the completion of treatment.</summary>
