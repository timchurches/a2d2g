    <interventions>This will be a randomised, placebo controlled, double-blind, 5-condition cross-over single day study with a 2 MJ high carbohydrate (CHO) breakfast meal, comprised of 185 g of white toast bread, followed 3 hours later by a lunch meal which is consumed ad libitum until the participant is comfortably full. The 5 intervention arms are:
1. 2MJ carbohydrate breakfast + Placebo in acid resistant capsule given 60 minutes prior to breakfast (negative control)
2. 2MJ carbohydrate breakfast + Acarbose, 50 mg, in acid resistant capsule given 60 minutes prior to breakfast (positive control)
3. 2MJ carbohydrate breakfast + grape seed extract (1500 mg, in acid resistant capsule given 60 minutes prior to breakfast)
4. 2MJ carbohydrate breakfast + onion skin extract (1500 mg, in acid resistant capsule given 60 minutes prior to breakfast) 
5. 2MJ carbohydrate breakfast + grape seed extract (750 mg)/onion skin extract (750 mg) synergy in acid resistant capsule given 60 minutes prior to breakfast
Participants will arrive at Plant and Food Research Ltd in the fasted state at 0800h. Treatments will be provided at 0830h in acid-resistant capsules to ensure delivery of extracts to the small intestine avoiding any potential loss of activity in the stomach. Participants will be provided a 2MJ carbohydrate breakfast at 0930h which they must consume in 15 minutes. Capillary blood glucose concentrations will be monitored via finger prick at 0830h (t= -60), 0930h (t=0) and at 30 minute intervals for the following 3 hours (1000h, 1030h, 1100h, 1130h, 1200h and 1230h) and 60 minute intervals for the following 2 hours (1330h and 1430h). Throughout the day participants will rate hunger, fullness and other appetite-related sensations, including satisfaction, current thoughts of food (TOF), energy level, thirst and nausea using visual analogue scales (VAS). An ad libitum lunch will be served at 1230h (t=180). For the measurement of energy and macronutrient intake, foods will be weighed before and after each meal. The study day finishes at 1500h. There will be a minimum washout period of 3 days in between treatments.

    <statisticalmethods>Data on demographic and anthropometric characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Efficacy endpoints of VAS and EI will be presented as mean, standard error of the mean (mean, SEM). VAS data assessing feelings of hunger, fullness and other satiety indicators throughout the study days as well as VAS data assessing the palatability of the breakfast and lunch meals will be analysed using repeated measures Linear Mixed Model ANOVA (SAS: PROC MIXED, SAS version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA, 2002 2008). The energy and macronutrient intake data from the outcome meal (ad libitum lunch) following each of the 5 treatments will also be analysed using ANOVA. The treatment, participant and study day are included in the procedure, in addition to the treatment/time interaction which address whether the trajectory over time during the study period differed between the breakfast treatments (diet*time). Where the repeated measures Linear Mixed Model ANOVA is significant, Tukey's post hoc analysis will be used for comparisons between treatments. Statistical significance is set at P less than 0.05.
20 male participants will complete all 5 interventions. Energy intake at the ad lib lunch meal is the primary end point outcome variable in this trial. A power analysis was performed to provide estimates of variance components using data from a previous test meal experiment performed at the Human Nutrition Unit which investigated the effect of a test breakfast on satiety and energy intake (EI) at an ad libitum lunch meal in a similar group of 18 lean men. Energy intake at the ad lib lunch meal was the primary outcome, and the calculations have used the assumptions of outcome differences of 500kJ, equivalent to a change of 5 percent in an individual consuming a typical daily intake of 10MJ/day. In order to inform as to the within-person standard deviation, numbers corresponding to the smallest and largest standard deviation from the previous trial were used (686kJ, 990kJ):
Paired data (cross-over)  continuous outcome (EI)
Anticipated standardised effect is [anticipated difference in outcome250kJ or 500kJ]/ [sd of difference of outcome variable measured on two occasions estimated from previous studies]. In order to detect an outcome difference of 5% (500kJ) as significant at P&lt;0.05 
(i)difference is 500/686 and is equal to 0.73    80% are 17 subjects and 90% are 22 subjects
(ii)difference is 500/990 and is equal to 0.51    80% are 33 subjects and 90% are 42 subjects
The model based upon an estimated error variance taken from the previous study could be larger (or smaller) than previously observed &amp; hence the actual probability of detecting the effect is uncertain. Using the upper 80% confidence interval (worst case scenario) the number of subjects required falls between 17-33 subjects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The gastrointestinal (GI) tract and specifically the most distal part of the small intestine (SI), the ileum, has become a renewed focus of interest for mechanisms targeting appetite suppression. The ileal brake is stimulated when energy-containing nutrients are delivered beyond the duodenum
and jejunum and into the ileum, and is named for the feedback loop which slows or brakes gastric emptying and duodenojejunal motility. More recently it has been hypothesised that the ileal brake also promotes secretion of satiety-enhancing GI peptides and suppresses hunger, and
hence in turn places a brake on food intake. Postprandial delivery of macronutrients to the ileum, other than unavailable carbohydrates (CHO) which bypass absorption in the small intestine en route to fermentation in the large bowel, is an uncommon event and hence this brake mechanism is
rarely activated following a meal. Evidence linking the ileal brake to enhanced satiety can be found from a number of studies that have delivered nutrients to the ileum enterally.
Early nasoileal (NI) tube feeding studies where lipid emulsions were infused directly into the ileum significantly decreased appetite and food intake (Welch et al., 1985; Welch et al., 1988b; Welch et al., 1988c; Maljaars et al., 2008, 20009, 2010, 2011, 2012; see review by Shin et al., 2013). There is some preliminary evidence that commercial lipid formulations designed to resist digestion and absorption in the proximal
small intestine are transported to the ileum and suppress food intake (Burns et al., 2000, 2001, 2002; Diepvens et al., 2007), although findings from these feeding studies remain mixed (Smit et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2012).
Our research group has recently shown that hunger and food intake can be altered acutely by infusion of glucose in to the ileum using an NI tube (Shin et al., unpublished data) suggesting that carbohydrates can also activate the ileal brake mechanism. However, no corresponding evidence
exists for ileal brake activation following the ingestion of carbohydrate containing foods. This is likely to be due to the very efficient digestion and absorption of carbohydrates by the proximal SI resulting in minimal glucose availability in the ileum.
In order to ensure arrival of CHOs into the distal small intestine (ileum) it is necessary to induce a degree of carbohydrate malabsorption in the proximal small intestine (duodenum and jejunum). This approach has previously been demonstrated using a carbohydrate meal and pharmacological interventions such as the a-glucosidase inhibitor migitol (Lee et al., 2002; Kaku et al., 2012) or a novel glucose transport inhibitor
LX4211 (Zambrowicz et al., 2013) where enhanced ratings of satiety and postprandial GLP-1 and PYY concentrations beyond 2 h have been demonstrated, indicating ileal brake activation.
A number of natural occurring plant phytochemicals have been
demonstrated to posses similar carbohydrate malabsorption potential (Lakshimi et al., 2012), although their ability to trigger ileal brake activation has not as yet been demonstrated in vivo. We have recently identified in vitro, a commercially available grape seed extract (Oxifend, Registerd Trademark, grape seed extract, New Zealand Extracts Ltd) and food-grade onion skin extract OSE produced on a pilot scale in collaboration with the Food Processing Engineering Lab in Tamaki Campus, University of Auckland, using a proprietary freeze-drying method, possessing the ability to inhibit the activity of starch digestive enzymes and the absorption of glucose by the gut mucosa, respectively. By combining these extracts with a starch based meal we hope to induce enough glucose malabsorption in the proximal SI to activate the ileal brake. However, efficacy of these blockers singularly or in combination has not yet been assessed in a human study population.</summary>
