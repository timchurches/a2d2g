  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Survival Without Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity - Defined as the time from date of randomization to first date of a Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; as graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 3.0) or death due to any cause. Grade 3 TEAE: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated. Grade 4 TEAE: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Participants who were alive without experiencing Grade 3 or 4 toxicity were censored at the date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to until 218 events (defined as death or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity) have been observed (up to 33.3 months).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS is the duration from enrollment to death. For participants who are alive, OS is censored at the last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to until 218 events (defined as death or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity) have been observed (up to 33.3 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression (PD), or death due to any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to until 218 events (defined as death or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity) have been observed (up to 33.3 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Tumor Response (Response Rate) - Response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD)=at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD)=small changes not meeting above criteria. Response rate (%)=Number of participants with CR+PR/Number of participants analyzed *100. Disease Control rate=Number of participants with SD+PR+CR/Number of participants analyzed *100.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to until 218 events (defined as death or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity) have been observed (up to 33.3 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Survival Without Clinically Important Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity - Survival without Grade 3 or 4 toxicity is the time from date of randomization to the first date of the following clinically important Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 3.0: neutropenia (lasting &gt;5 days), febrile neutropenia, documented infections related to neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and neurosensory events; or death due to any cause. Participants who were alive without experiencing Grade 3 or 4 toxicity were censored for this analysis at the date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to until 218 events (defined as death or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity) have been observed (up to 33.3 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Survival Without Grade 4 Toxicity - Survival without Grade 4 toxicity is the time from the date of randomization to the first date of a Grade 4 TEAE or death due to any cause. Participants who are alive without experiencing Grade 4 toxicity will be censored for this analysis at the date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to until 218 events (defined as death or Grade 4 toxicity) have been observed (up to 33.3 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - Summaries of serious AEs (SAEs) and all other non-serious AEs are located in the Reported Adverse Event Module.</outcome>
