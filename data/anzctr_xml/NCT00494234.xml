  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Confirmed Objective Tumour Response (According to RECIST Criteria) - Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, every 8 also at study termination or initiation of confounding anti-cancer therapy. Up to 2 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response to Olaparib</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time from response (CR or PR) to progression per RECIST criteria</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - The Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of patients with a RECIST tumour response of confirmed CR, PR or stable disease (SD) for =8 weeks +/- 1 week visit window.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Percent Change in Tumour Size - The tumour size is defined as the sum of the longest diameters as measured among all target lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as the time from first dose to the earlier date of radiologic progression (as per RECIST criteria) or death by any cause in the absence of objective progression. Those patients who were withdrawn from the study without disease progression were regarded as censored at their last evaluable RECIST assessment. Where patients had not progressed at the termination of the study, they were also regarded as censored at their last evaluable RECIST assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in ECOG Performance Status: Improvement Rate - The change in ECOG performance status was defined as improved (meaning the ECOG score is less than the baseline value), no change (ECOG is same as at baseline), worsened (ECOG score is greater than the baseline value) or missing (the ECOG score is missing or was not recorded at baseline). If no measurement was recorded at Cycle 1 Day 1, the change was calculated in relation to the last recorded ECOG value prior to Day 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At cycle 7 day 1 (ie, after completing 6 cycles of treatment)</timepoint>
