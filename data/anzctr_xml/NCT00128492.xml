    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Reporting Adverse Events (AEs) - Participants experiencing at least 1 treatment-emergent AE or at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE) were summarized for the study as a whole.

An SAE was any adverse experience that resulted in hospitalization or death.
Participants were monitored for AEs and SAEs during all on-treatment and off-treatment intervals throughout the 18-month study period.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) log10 Colony-forming Units (CFU) Per Gram of Sputum - Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype).
Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and the end of treatment Courses 1 (Week 4), 3 (Week 20), and 9 (Week 68)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Other Pathogens - Sputum samples were collected at all study visits for qualitative and quantitative culture for Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-sensitive [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant [MRSA] S.aureus), and fungal organisms.
Number of participants with other pathogens at baseline and end of AZLI treatment Courses 1, 3, and 9 are reported.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Aztreonam - The aztreonam susceptibility of PA isolates from expectorated sputum samples (collected at all visits) was assessed.
MIC50 = minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum concentration of an agent that inhibits 50% of isolates from a particular organism).
MIC90 = minimum inhibitory concentration (minimum concentration of an agent that inhibits 90% of isolates from a particular organism).
MIC50 and MIC90 values are single measurements for the entire population and not measured on a per-participant basis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline; end of treatment Courses 1 (Week 4), 3 (Week 20), and 9 (Week 68); and at Follow-up (Week 72)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change in Pulmonary Function (FEV1, FEV1 Percent Predicted, FVC, FEF25-75) - Spirometry was performed at each visit. FEV1, FVC, and FEF25-75 were recorded at all visits according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.
FEV1 = the volume of air exhaled in 1 second. FEV1 % predicted is a normalized value of FEV1 calculated using the Knudson equation, based upon participant age, gender, and height. FVC = (forced vital capacity) the maximal volume of air exhaled with maximally forced effort from a position of maximal inspiration. FEF25-75 = forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of the FVC.
The percent change from baseline is presented for each endpoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and end of treatment Courses 1 (Week 4), 3 (Week 20), and 9 (Week 68)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Clinical Symptoms as Assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised Respiratory Symptom Scale (CFQ-R RSS) - The CFQ-R was administered at baseline and every visit thereafter. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms from baseline, assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (range of scores: 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) corresponds to the smallest change in symptoms that a patient can detect and is a change in score of 4 points.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and end of treatment Courses 1 (Week 4), 3 (Week 20), and 9 (Week 68)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Hospitalization Due to a Respiratory Event - Details of all hospitalizations, including the dates of admission and discharge, were recorded on the serious adverse event (SAE) electronic case report form (eCRF).
Time to first hospitalization was the number of days from baseline (Visit 1) to the date of first hospitalization or the date of study completion (last visit) /or early withdrawal if censored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall study (72 weeks) included nine 28-day courses of study drug alternating with nine 28-day courses off drug</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Body Weight - Weight was measured at all visits and was reported to the nearest 0.1 kg/lb. Percent change in weight from baseline was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and end of treatment Courses 1 (Week 4), 3 (Week 20), and 9 (Week 68)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Missed School/Work Days Due to CF Symptoms - Participants were provided with a diary card at each visit to record days of work and/or school missed due to their CF symptoms.
The percentage of school/work days missed was calculated as the total number of school/work days missed divided by the total number of on-study days multiplied by 100 across all participants in a treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall study (72 weeks) included nine 28-day courses of study drug alternating with nine 28-day courses off drug</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Intravenous (IV) Antipseudomonal Antibiotics - Use of IV antipseudomonal antibiotics was compiled from data recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. The time to first IV antipseudomonal antibiotic use was the number of days from baseline (Visit 1) to the date of first IV antipseudomonal antibiotic use or the date of study completion (last visit) /or early withdrawal if censored.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall study (72 weeks) included nine 28-day courses of study drug alternating with nine 28-day courses off drug</timepoint>
