  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial involves two stages. The first stage is to screen, with a blood test, those with a first or second degree relative with type 1 diabetes, for diabetes autoantibodies. The purpose of screening is to determine their risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The screening blood tests can be conducted every 12months for the duration of the study to monitor the development of said autoantibodies. Rescreening will be offerred to all participants during the 5 years study duration and will be conducted with the consent of the participant. 

Those at high risk (positive for two or more autoantibodies) will be invited to participate in stage 2 where they will be given a reinfusion of their autologous cord blood via intravenous infusion. This will be a one off treatment that will take approximately five hours with the reinfusion taking 1 hour followed by a 4 hour observation period. Post reinfusion all participants will enter follow-up with visits and blood tests every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months the following two years after treatment to monitor effect.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to determine the feasibility of using autologous cord blood in children at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. This will be done by assessing the incidence of persons with high-risk of developing type 1 diabetes who have stored cord blood, and assessing the processes involved in reinfusing autologous cord blood in this group. This data will be collected through medical assessments, assessment of past family and medical history and performing laboratory tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>We envisage that by the 3rd year of recruitment and screening, we would have identified the 20 participants that will go onto receive the reinfusion. At this point, data analysis of the number of screening participants to the number of participants idenitified as being high-risk will be conducted. We will assess the processes in preparing and reinfusing the autologous cord blood unit and determine if these processes are feasible.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine safety of reinfusing autologous cord blood in this population by assessing occurance of adverse events through the collection of clinical assessments and blood tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be determined at the point of the reinfusion visit for each participant and ongoing as a participant group by analysing the data and clinical assessments collected on the day and in follow-up. Expected adverse events include pain and/or bruising from venepuncture, nausea, vomiting, fever, rash and itch. All these adverse events will be assessed through clinical assessment and reporting of same.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>As the primary outcome measure is feasibility of recruitment and screening of children who have cord blood (CB) stored and have a first or second degree relative with type 1 diabetes (T1D), or have previously been tested for islet antibodies, the results will be reported using descriptive statistics. Specifically we will determine:
- Response rate to recruitment from families whose child has CB stored at private and public cord banks; comparison of estimated versus actual numbers. 
- Number of children with CB who have a first or second degree relative with T1D
- Number of children with CB who have previously been screened for islet autoantibodies.
These data will inform sample size calculations and expected response rates the proposed randomised controlled trial. Interim analysis of these data will occur once the targeted group for screening have been approached and responded at approximately 3 years into the study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The CORD study is a pilot study aiming to determine the feasibility of reinfusing cord blood in children who are at risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The hypothesis is that autologous cord blood, when reinfused into children at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes, will resotre immune tolerance and prevent or mitigate the development of type 1 diabetes. 

Participants aged 1-12 years with a relative with type 1 diabetes will be tested every 12 months for the development of islet antigens. Following screening, a target treatment group of 20 with two or more autoantibodies, will receive an infusion of their autologous cord blood. Participants will be followed for 3 years or until they develop diabetes.</summary>
