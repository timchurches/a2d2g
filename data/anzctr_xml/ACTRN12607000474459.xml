  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once the patients arrive in the recovery room, skin conductance will be assessed via 3 standard electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes on the hand. The correlation of these measures with the pain score of the patients at the same time will be assessed. The assessment is limited to the time the patients spend in the recovery room.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Up to today, there is no gold standard available for the assessment of pain in young children after operations. Aim of this trial is to investigate the correlation between pain obtained by behavioural or nurse rated assessment with skin conductance readings obtained at the same time. We hope that by that means we may be able to measure pain objectively and be able to conclude about wether or not a child requires acute pain relief.
We will include 180 patients in 3 age groups (1-3, 4-7 and 8-16 yrs) and observe their pain (nurse assessed, behavioural, self assessed) in the recovery room. At the same time we will obtain skin conductance readings via 3 sticky dots on the hand (a method which itself is absolutely pain-free).
From these readings we will try to find correlations or certain patterns that might allow conclusion about the level of pain by simple skin conductance assessment.</summary>
