    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - CC+SI
Treatment: surgery - 3:1 C:V

Experimental: Intervention (CC+SI) - Infants randomized into the "CC+SI group" will receive a SI with a PIP of 25-30 cmH2O while receiving chest compression. The SI will be delivered over a period of 45 seconds. This will be followed by PEEP of 5-8 cm water to perform an assessment of the newborn's heart rate. If heart rate is &gt;60/min continue with standard care as per local hospital policy (standard hospital practice guideline). If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI for another 45sec at which time a further assessment should be performed. If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI.

Active Comparator: Control (3:1 C:V) - Infants randomized into the "3:1 C:V group" will receive CC at a rate of 90/min and 30 ventilations/min in a 3:1 C:V ratio as recommended by the current resuscitation guidelines.


Treatment: surgery: CC+SI
chest compression will be delivered during sustained inflation (CC+SI). The duration of each sustain inflation is 20sec. After 20sec a pause of 1sec id done before the next sustained inflation is delivered for another 20sec. Chest compressions are given continuously. This approach is continued until return of spontaneous circulation.

Treatment: surgery: 3:1 C:V
During 3:1 C:V. 3 chest compressions are given, then stopped and then 1 inflation is given. This approach is continued until return of spontaneous circulation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research question In newborn infants requiring CPR, does CC superimposed by sustained
      inflation compared to 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio improves return of spontaneous
      circulation?

      Overall objective: CC superimposed by sustained inflation will improve short- and long-term
      outcomes in preterm and term newborns.

      Hypothesis to be tested Primary hypothesis: By using CC superimposed by sustained inflation
      (CC+SI) during CPR the time needed to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
      compared to the current 3:1 compression to ventilation (C:V) will be reduced in asphyxiated
      newborns.</summary>
