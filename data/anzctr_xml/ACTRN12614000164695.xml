    <statisticalmethods>Data were collected in a specific designed database and analysed  with statistical analysis performed employing the Software Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 15.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). The Pearson chi square test was used to evaluate the difference in prevalences. A KruskalWallis test was used to assess differences between means and inter-group comparisons. Correlations were determined by Pearson correlation. A p-value of &lt; 0.01 was considered statistically significant.
We estimated a sample size of 56 patients, based on the following assumptions: (1) a two-sided t-student test of statistical significance, (3) a probability of type I error associated with the two-sided test of 0.01 and (4) a probability of type II error associated with the test of 0.2 (ie, the power of the test is 80%).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is aimed to investigate, using skin conductance algesimeters  index monitor pain, the effects of 24% sucrose solution and non nutritive sucking on pain perception during capillary and arterial blood sample taking.
Skin conductance algesimeters reflects the sympathetic nervous system influenced by changes in emotions which releases the acetyl choline that acts on muscarine receptors, causing a subsequent burst of sweat and increased skin conductance.
