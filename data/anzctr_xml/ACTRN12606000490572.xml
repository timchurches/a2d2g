  <interventions>
    <interventions>High protein diet versus a low fat diet: 
Group 2 (Intervention) High-Protein:Reduced-Carbohydrate: Reduced carbohydrate (40% total energy) with a focus on whole grains, low glycaemic index foods, and high fibre (30g/day). The diet will also include increased protein (30% total energy) and moderate fat (30% total energy) with a focus on Monounsaturated Fatty Acids and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids  and no more than 10% being saturated fat, aiming for a reduction in total energy intake of 500kcal/day. 
All subjects will take part in a 12-month group-based programme, attending fortnightly meetings with a dietitian for the first six months to facilitate weight loss and adherence to the specific dietary protocol.  This will be followed by a less intensive 6-month period with monthly sessions. Subjects will then be asked to maintain their weight loss by adhering to the dietary protocol, but will have no further dietitian input for a further 12 months, apart from monthly weighs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 1 (Control) Conventional- Low-fat: Subjects in this group will be prescribed an energy-restricted diet based on current recommended macronutrient composition. This will include 55-60% carbohydrate, with predominantly low glycaemic index, whole-grain foods with high fibre intake (30g/day), and minimal refined carbohydrates. The balance of the diet will be composed of 25-30% fat, with no more than 10% being saturated fat, and approximately 15% protein, aiming for a reduction in total energy intake of 500kcal/day. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reducing the incidence and impact of obesity and diabetes is a priority.  Diet and lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of management.  Despite the widespread promotion of low-fat/high-carbohydrate (LFHC) diets, rates of obesity continue to climb.  Short-term studies in non-diabetic subjects suggest high-protein/low-carbohydrate (HPLC) diets may facilitate greater weight-loss.  
  This randomised controlled trial will assess the impact of a HPLC diet compared with a LFHC diet in 450 overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes.  Subjects will receive group-based and individualized dietitian support.  Weight, diabetes control, cardiovascular disease risk, adverse effects and cost-effectiveness will be assessed over 24 months.  
  Demonstration that a HPLC diet is effective and cost-effective without significant adverse effects in subjects with diabetes would have a wide-ranging impact for individual and public health advice both in New Zealand and internationally.</summary>
