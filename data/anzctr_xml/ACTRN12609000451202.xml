  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aquacel Ag will be applied to the wound bed with a 3cm overlap to allow for the dressing to shrink. Telfa (an absorbent cotton fabric bonded on both sides with perforated non-adherent film) will be placed over the Aquacel Ag and then Hypafix will be used to hold the dressing in place. 
These patients will not be instructed to moisten the dressing at home. 
Patients will be reviewed in 3 days after the initial dressing placement. The Hypafix will be removed, and areas of non-adherence will be trimmed and replaced if still considered to be partial thickness and appropriate for outpatient management. Hypafix will then be re-applied.
Patients will be reviewed at day 10 with dressing removal and photography to allow percentage epithelialisation to be assessed</interventions>
    <comparator>Acticoat3 dressing is applied to the wound bed (blue side down) with a minimum of overlap. The dressing will be moistened with warm water (not saline), and overlapping Hypafix will be used to hold the dressing in place. These patients will be instructed to moisten the dressing three times daily at home with tap water via a spray bottle or shower head. 
Patients will be reviewed in 3 days after the initial dressing placement and the Hypafix and Acticoat3 dressings will be removed. These wounds will be visualised, and the wound will be lightly cleaned with saline and re-dressed with Acticoat7 and Hypafix.
Patients will be reviewed at day 10 with dressing removal and photography to allow percentage epithelialisation to be assessed</comparator>
