  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - therapeutic conventional surgery
Treatment: other - 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy
Treatment: other - intensity-modulated radiation therapy
Treatment: drugs - carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Treatment: drugs - ifosfamide

Experimental: Treatment (combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy) - Stratum 1 (NGGCT): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 of courses 1, 3, and 5. Patients also receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide over 1-2 hours on days 1-5 of courses 2, 4, and 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responsive disease (complete [CR] or partial response [PR]) to induction chemotherapy undergo radiotherapy once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients with PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) and normalization of tumor levels undergo second-look surgery. Patients who achieve CR or PR after second-look surgery undergo radiotherapy.
Stratum 2 (Germinoma): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over 15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3. Continued (see detailed description)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Drugs used as chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. This phase II trial studies how well
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy work in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed
      central nervous system germ cell tumors.</summary>
