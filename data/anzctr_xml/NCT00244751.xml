                       criterion); or,

                    -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected

                    -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable
                       methods.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of GI262570 compared to
      placebo (a pill that looks exactly like GI262570 but contains no active medicine) in
      improving specific tests that indicate the degree of liver fibrosis (scarring). Subjects who
      are enrolled in the study must have had prior treatment with interferon (either pegylated or
      standard interferon) plus ribavirin for at least 12 weeks to treat their hepatitis C, but
      either failed to clear the virus or didn't tolerate the treatment.</summary>
