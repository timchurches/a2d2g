  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized, controlled trial, consisting of 3 study arms (A, B and C), will be undertaken in partnership with 20 community pharmacies in the Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan area. 

Arm B: Pamphlet only: pharmacists will be asked to invite the next 12 customers, after the control participants have been recruited, and who meet the inclusion criteria, to participate in the study (N=120). In this arm, participants will receive a pamphlet from the pharmacist without any further information about self management, other than usual instructions from the pharmacist relating to medication intake, dosage and side-effects. Baseline data will be collected prior to the pamphlet being provided.

Arm C: Pamphlet with education (pharmacies 11-20): pharmacists will be asked to invite the first 12 customers who meet the inclusion criteria to participate in the study (N=120). In this arm, participants will receive a pamphlet from the pharmacist and the pharmacist will review the content of the pamphlet with the participant. Information provided by pharmacists will be standardised. Baseline data will be collected prior to the pamphlet and prior to any further information being provided. The role of the pharmacist will be to reinforce the key messages contained in the pamphlet.

The consumer pamphlet contains evidence-based information about the course of, and self management strategies for, acute and chronic LBP. The pamphlet is aimed at individuals who seek care for, or information about, LBP in primary care settings (eg pharmacies, GP practices, allied health practices). The pamphlet has undergone a period of consultation with key professional health bodies and health stakeholders. The pamphlet content is supported by the Australian Clinical Psychology Association, Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, Australian Osteopathic Association, Australian Pain Society, Australian Physiotherapy Association, Australian Rheumatology Association (WA), Chiropractors Association of Australia, Health Consumers Council, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia (WA) and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The intervention will be conducted as a single trial with anticipated recruitment running over a 6 month period with a completion date estimated at September 2011.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm A: Control (pharmacies 1-10): pharmacists will be asked to invite the first 12 customers who meet the inclusion criteria to participate in the study as a control (N=120). In the control arm, customers will not receive any information about self management for LBP (ie will receive usual care only). Usual care is defined as the standard care and service delivered by pharmacists when providing any prescription medication for use in the management of low back pain or any over the counter analgesic medication for the management of low back pain. Standard care includes the standard advice in regard to taking medications for the management of low back pain. No additional and specific self management instruction or written information will be provided.</comparator>

    <concealment>A randomized, controlled trial, consisting of 3 study arms (A, B and C), will be undertaken in partnership with 20 community pharmacies in the Perth metropolitan area. A convenience sample of pharmacies will be selected through the Pharmaceutical Society of WA. Participating pharmacies will cover major zones of the Perth metropolitan area to represent a range of socioeconomic profiles. Ten pharmacies will be involved in both the ‘control’ (A) and ‘pamphlet only’ (B) arms while a separate ten pharmacies will be involved in the ‘pamphlet with education’ (C) arm only. Pharmacies will be randomly allocated to study groups. Each pharmacist who participates will receive training from the evaluation team according to their allocated study arm and will receive a modest remuneration for recruitment of consumers. Each pharmacy will recruit 12 consecutive customers who meet the inclusion criteria for each study arm.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to undertake an evaluation of a consumer-oriented pamphlet for the self management of low back pain within a primary care context. The project will determine whether providing the pamphlet to individuals who visit a community pharmacy to purchase pain-relieving medications for low back pain is effective (with and without additional education from the pharmacist) compared to not providing the pamphlet. Effectiveness is defined as improving consumer beliefs about low back pain and minimising fear avoidance behaviours related to low back pain. when appropriate, messages are targeted towards best-practice self management of spinal pain. Where additional support is required, a recommendation to seek evidence-based guidance from a health professional is encouraged.

Primary hypothesis: Providing this low back pain educational pamphlet to consumers who visit a community pharmacy to purchase pain-relieving medications for LBP improves beliefs about LBP and minimises fear avoidance behaviours compared to usual care.</summary>
