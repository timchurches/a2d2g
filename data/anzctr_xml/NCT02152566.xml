  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Nasal High flow therapy device

Experimental: Diagnostic PSG/PG, PSG w. nasal high flow therapy - All patients recruited will undergo a diagnostic sleep study, either a full in laboratory attended polysomnography (PSG), or an in-home polygraphy (PG). If respiratory insufficiencies with Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are detected, these patients will undergo an overnight in laboratory attended PSG on a nasal high flow therapy device to test the primary endpoint of this study. Patients without respiratory insufficiencies after the first PSG/PG will take no further part in the trial.


Treatment: devices: Nasal High flow therapy device
Nasal high flow therapy via nasal cannula.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Respiratory insufficiencies during sleep can lead to reductions in the level of oxygen in the
      blood during the night, which has been shown to contribute to a range of morbidities.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the possibility that a nasal high flow therapy device
      may be able to treat respiratory insufficiencies, by stabilizing breathing and preventing
      reduction in blood oxygen.

      Heart failure patients will be screened at a heart failure clinic, and will be asked to
      undergo an overnight sleep study to determine is they exhibit respiratory insufficiencies
      during sleep. This sleep study may be completed in the sleep laboratory (attended
      polysomnography, PSG) or in-home (in-home polygraphy, PG). If they are diagnosed with
      respiratory insufficiencies, they will be asked to attend further overnight studies to see if
      treatment with nasal high flow therapy can be used to stabilize breathing.</summary>
