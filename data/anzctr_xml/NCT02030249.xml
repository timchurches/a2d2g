  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting appetite - Previous research has shown that 2 months on a weight reducing diet increases appetite in the fasting state. There is some suggestion that this diet-induced increase in appetite is sustained even after following a weight maintenance diet for 12 months. The investigators will assess fasting appetite, as measured using visual analogue scales, at 0, 2, 6 and 12 months after commencement of the 2-month standardized weight loss diet. The 6- and 12-month time points are taken after 4 and 10 months on the different weight maintenance programs. This primary outcome (fasting appetite at 12 months) will demonstrate whether the weight-loss-induced increase in fasting appetite that is anticipated at 2 months will be normalized by the 12 month time point, and whether the type of weight maintenance diet (High Protein / Low Glycaemic Index versus Moderate Protein / High Glycaemic Index) influences this.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting plasma concentrations of gut-derived appetite-regulating hormones - Previous research has shown that 2 months on a weight reducing diet alters fasting plasma concentrations of gut-derived appetite regulating hormones in a way that would be expected to increase appetite (i.e. increased ghrelin and decreased peptide YY). There is some suggestion that this change in gut hormone concentrations is sustained even after following a weight maintenance diet for 12 months. The investigators will assess fasting plasma concentrations of gut-derived appetite-regulating hormones (ghrelin and peptide YY) at 0, 2, 6 and 12 months after commencement of the 2-month standardized weight loss diet. The 6- and 12-month time points are taken after 4 and 10 months on the 2 different weight maintenance programs. This primary outcome will demonstrate whether the weight-loss-induced increases in ghrelin and decrease in peptide YY that are anticipated at 2 months will be normalized by the 12 month time point, and whether the type of weight maintenance diet influences this.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bone mass - The investigators will assess bone mineral density and bone mineral content in the lumbar spine and hip (or wrist for people in whom arthritis interferes with the reading) via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) immediately before and after the 2-month standardized weight loss program (i.e. at 0 and 2 months). This primary outcome will help determine whether there is a difference between younger and older participants with respect to changes in bone mass with weight reduction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bone turnover - The investigators will assess serum concentrations of bone turnover markers immediately before and after the 2-month standardized weight loss program (i.e. at 0 and 2 months). The bone turnover markers to be measured are serum procollagen type-I N-propeptide (P1NP, a marker of bone formation) and serum C-telopeptide of type-I collagen (CTX, a marker of bone resorption). This primary outcome will show whether there is a difference between younger and older participants with respect to changes in bone turnover with weight reduction. This primary outcome is important because DXA scanning to assess bone mass can result in artefactual results in people who are are obese or undergoing changes in body fat mass, as will be the case in this trial.</outcome>

             last treatment (local basal and squamous cell skin cancer allowed); Active
             inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis or other disorder
             potentially causing malabsorption; Previous bariatric surgery; Chronic respiratory,
             neurological, musculoskeletal or other disorders where, in the judgement of the
             investigator, participants would have unacceptable risk or difficulty in complying
             with the protocol (e.g. physical activity program); A recent surgical procedure until
             after full convalescence (investigators judgement); Transmissible blood-borne diseases
             e.g. hepatitis B, HIV; Psychiatric illness (e.g. major depression, bipolar disorder).

          -  Medication: Use currently or within the previous 3 months of prescription medication
             that has the potential of affecting body weight or glucose metabolism such as
             glucocorticoids (but excluding inhaled and topical steroids; bronchodilators are
             allowed), psychoactive medication, epileptic medication, or weight loss medications
             (either prescription, over the counter or herbal). Low dose antidepressants are
             allowed if they, in the judgement of the investigator, do not affect weight or
             participation to the study protocol. Levothyroxine for treatment of hypothyroidism is
             allowed if the participant has been on a stable dose for at least 3 months.

             Severe food intolerance expected to interfere with the study; Regularly drinking &gt; 21
             alcoholic units/week (men), or &gt; 14 alcoholic units/week (women); Use of drugs of
             abuse within the previous 12 months; Blood donation or transfusion within the past 1
             month before baseline or CID's; Self-reported eating disorders; Pregnancy or
             lactation, including plans to become pregnant within the next 36 months; No access to
             either phone or Internet (this is necessary when being contacted by the instructor's
             during the maintenance phase); Adequate understanding of national language;
             Psychological or behavioral problems which, in the judgement of the investigator,
             would lead to difficulty in complying with the protocol.

          -  Laboratory screening: If all of the above criteria are satisfied, the participant is
             eligible for a glucose tolerance test (blood at 0 and 120 mins), and blood glucose
             concentrations are analyzed immediately (Haemocue). In addition full blood count,
             urea, and electrolytes may be analyzed as a further safety evaluation.

          -  ONLY IF the glucose tolerance test meets the entry criteria for the study, the
             remaining samples are sent to the local laboratory for a safety check, with the
             following exclusion criteria: Hemoglobin concentration below local laboratory
             reference values (i.e. anemia); Creatinine &gt;1.5 times Upper Limit of Normal (local
             laboratory reference values); Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and/or Aspartate Transaminase
             (AST) &gt;3 times the Upper Limit of Normal (local laboratory reference values); Or any
             other significant abnormality on these tests which in the investigators opinion may be
             clinically significant and require further assessment.

          -  Electrocardiography (ECG). Any abnormality which in the opinion of the investigator
             might indicate undiagnosed cardiac disease requiring further assessment (e.g.
             significant conduction disorder, arrhythmia, pathological Q waves). This is done in
             adults 55-70 years of age.

          -  After LCD phase (in adults): Failure to reach at least 8% weight reduction during the
             LCD phase. This leads to exclusion from the intervention.</exclusivecriteria>
