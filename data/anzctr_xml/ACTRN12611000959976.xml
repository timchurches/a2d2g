  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 robots will be placed in each of two buildings at the residential care facility. THe robots can measure vital signs (blood pressure, pulse oximetry, blood glucose), telecommunication (with family, friends, staff), brain fitness software and entertainment (show videos, photos), lifetime health diary (shows health records), and access to web based content (such as whats on at the retirement village that day). Staff and residents are free to use the robots at thier discretion. THe robots will be there for 4 months. This will be in addition to the standard care that is normally provided to the individuals at the residential care faciliity.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate whether robots can improve quality of life for residents and staff in residential care in a retirement village. This is a non-randomised between groups
trial of 64 staff and 64 residents. There will be 3 robots in each of two buildings. The robots can  take vital signs, provide entertainment and brain fitness games, have telecommunication, and provide information about activities at the village. The main outcome measures
are resident quality of life, depression, and perceptions of the robots. For staff we are also measuring
job satisfaction and morale.</summary>
