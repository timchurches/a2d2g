  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants currently taking tenofovir as part of their stable HIV therapy, have no detectable HIV in the blood, have thin bones, and who could safely use either zoledronic acid or switch their tenofovir to another anti-HIV drug will be randmolmly assigned to either:

1. zoledronic acid 5 mg intravenous (IV) yearly (2 doses) OR
2. switch from tenofovir to another potent anti-HIV drug (without commencing zoledronic acid) selected by the study doctor at the first study visit.

Switch ARV: Dose amounts and frequency will depend on switch ARV selected by the study doctor, however at least daily. Mode of administration is oral for duration of the study (2 years).</interventions>
    <comparator>switch from tenofovir to another potent antiretroviral (ARV)drug (without commencing a bisphosphonate)
Dose amounts and frequency will depend on switch ARV selected by the study doctor, mode of administration is oral.

The switch options include abacavir, raltegravir or a boosted protease inhibitor.  A switch option will be chosen based on previous treatment exposure and side effects.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible patients are allocated to intervention by central randomisation. A randomisation CRF and the screening DXA report is faxed to the central randomisation officer who has a medical doctor review the DXA to determine stratification.
Patients are stratified according to DXA site and severity of osteopenia. The randomisation officer will refer to the appropriate electronic stratum worksheet (1 worksheet per stratum) as instructed by the medical doctor and assign, in sequential order (from top to bottom) the next available randomised intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Within each stratum, randomisation blocks were created.
An on-line number generator (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/RandMenu.cfm) was used to assign participants to one of two interventions (A or B) by a random order. This was repeated for each stratum.
Intervention A was designated as the ‘commence zoledronic acid treatment and continue tenofovir-containing ART’ arm, and B designated as the ‘switch from tenofovir to another potent antiretroviral drug’ arm.
The blocks will allow for even distribution of participants in each of the two arms within the 6 strata as the proportions within each stratum is unknown.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with zoledronic acid or switching from tenofovir to another anti-HIV drug is more effective for improving low bone density over 24 months. These two options can improve low BMD in patients receiving tenofovir, but it is not yet known which one is the best as both strategies have their own advantages and disadvantages. Current evidence suggests that zoledronic acid may be better in terms of increasing bone density but it is not known for sure, hence the purpose of this study.</summary>
