Economic outcome analysis plan
This will comprise (a) the net resource cost of IVC compared to the status quo without IVC (cost analysis) and (b) comparison of net resource use with net health benefits (cost-effectiveness).

a)	 Cost analysis
The total cost of treatment using an IVC filter includes the device itself, the consumables required for insertion and removable, the costs of personnel required for the procedure and costs of complications. Cost components for both arms of the trial which require analysis include length of index hospital stay including number of days in ICU, readmission days including ICU, pharmaceuticals required to treat PE, DVT prophylaxis, associated investigations including all X-rays, CT pulmonary angiography, ultrasonography and any other associated procedures. Follow-up will extend to 90 days post procedure in the first instance; furthermore, long-term outcomes including survival and venous thromboembolic complications &amp; the cost-effectiveness in preventing these complications beyond day-90 will be assessed through use of linked health data as a sub-study. Costs will be drawn from hospital finance data where possible, but all resources will be collected in standard units and otherwise quantified using standard Australian resource data such as the MBS for medical procedures and the PBS for pharmaceuticals. Costs will be standardized to 2015 Australian dollars. The cost analysis will take the perspective of the Australian Health system.

Current cost data estimates:
It is estimated that the total cost of the procedure using IVF filters is approximately $6,000, comprising: $3000 - IVF filter, $3000 - consumables for insertion + labour costs for insertion and removal. Given the significant number needed to treat (estimated to be 10), net savings are unlikely to accrue unless additional individual benefits are evident such as survival and venous insufficiency after VTE. Given estimates of 20% expected DVT and 9-10% expected PE in the study cohort, the device will only be cost saving if PE costs on average, more than A$60,000. 
However, if there is a difference in life saved after the use of IVC filters  that is a reduction in fatal PE as suggested by existing observational studies  this will contribute enormously to cost-effectiveness (as distinct from cost savings).

b)	Cost-effectiveness
Costs of the procedure will be compared to health outcomes as determined from the trial.
The cost analysis as described above will indicate whether IVC filters provide a net saving to the health care system. A net saving in costs combined with a net health benefit suggests a dominant health intervention strategy. In the event that the IVC filters demonstrate health benefits at some cost, formal cost-effectiveness analysis can provide information around the relative health benefits for a given cost, compared to alternative resource demands, such as comparable procedures. 

Using mortality outcomes, both at 90 days after admission and long-term after hospital discharge obtained by linked health data, cost per LYG (life year gained) can be estimated. Long-term outcomes will be analysed as a sub-study through data-linkage. If funding for this sub-study is not available, long-term outcome will be estimated using Markov decision analysis based on probabilities from the literature. Sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to test robustness of the parameters, to identify cost drivers and to estimate conditions under which the procedure is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios can be compared with similar procedures to estimate potential acceptability for wider policy.

    <statisticalmethods>Although IVC filters are increasingly used for thromboprophylaxis in many trauma patients, their clinical effectiveness has never been well documented. They are invasive, expensive and have significant complications some of which are life-threatening. It is important to demonstrate clinical superiority before they are widely used in patients who are already at risk of mortality and, hence, a superiority trial rather than a non-inferiority trial is preferred. We are planning a study of independent intervention (IVC filters) and active controls with 1 control per intervention subject. The incidence of asymptomatic PE between 3 and 7 days after moderate to major trauma is extremely high (24%) despite LMWH or UFH prophylaxis. Prior data indicate that the PE rate among patients who are at high-risk of VTE without thromboprophylaxis (similar to our control patients) is &gt;0.09 (or 9%). The relatively high incidence of PE is expected because (a) we use a proactive approach to detect mildly symptomatic PE, and (b) we have chosen the group of trauma patients who are at extreme risk of VTE and, at the same time, cannot receive pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis and lower limb compression. The TESS score of these patients is expected to be &gt;10. Evidence suggested that IVC filters are highly effective in reducing PE. If the PE rate of the intervention group is close to 0.5%, we will need to study 97 intervention subjects and 97 active control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for intervention and active control subjects are equal with probability (power) 0.8 (or 0.9 if the baseline risk of PE is 10%). We assume there will be a small proportion of patients who will have study intervention crossed over between the two groups. Therefore the total sample size of this study is 240 (120 per group) allowing up to 20% of the study subject crossed over between the active control and intervention groups without affecting the power of the study. If an IVC is associated with an increased risk of lower limb DVT, this sample size will also have &gt;80% power to detect an increased risk of DVT due to the IVC filter from 10% to 25%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a significant health problem especially in hospitalized patients, with a high associated morbidity and mortality. For most patients, the standard of care is to use prophylactic anticoagulation (heparin) and intermittent pneumatic compression to both lower limbs. There is a group of patients who are at very high risk of VTE but these VTE prophylactic measures cannot be used or considered adequate, either for physical reasons (lower limb fractures / open wounds ) or risk of bleeding from anticoagulants (such as severe brain injury). In these patients, the options are to use no intervention or to insert an Inferior Vena Cava filter (IVCF). Although IVCFs are widely used as a mechanical VTE prophylaxis in patients who have contraindications to conventional VTE prophylactic measures, their effectiveness in this regard has not been established. This phase II / III randomized controlled trial aims to assess the clinical effectiveness, benefits and harms, and also the cost- effectiveness of the early use of IVCFs (&lt;72 hrs of admission after severe injury) for trauma patients who have contraindications to conventional VTE prophylactic measures (pharmacological thromboprophylaxis). This trial has the capacity to influence the management of trauma patients worldwide, and to establish the place of IVCFs in modern medical practice.
