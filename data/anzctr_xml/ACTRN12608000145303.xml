    <studytitle>Efficacy of guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in outpatient children: a field trial on primary care pediatricians</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In children with acute gastroenteritis,
are guidelines (oral rehydration with hypoosmolar solution, early refeeding with full-strength infant formula or normal diet, no medications, no microbiological investigations)
as good or better than non standardized treatment
for a reduction in the duration of diarrhea, improvement of body weight and reduction in costs to society?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Seventy-five randomly selected primary care pediatricians will be instructed to comply with guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis. Eighteen regional coordinators will conduct a 2-hour course consisting in a 30-minute presentation of the guidelines and a 30-minute questions' session, followed by presentation and discussion of the study protocol for an additional hour. The pediatricians will be instructed to comply with 5 major recommendations in the guidelines: 1. rapid oral rehydration for 3-4 hours with hypoosmolar solution (Na 60 mmol/L); 2. rapid refeeding, after 4 hours of rehydration, with the child's normal diet, including solids, full-strength milk or formula, without any restriction on lactose intake; 3. not to use beverages as cola, fruit juicers, tea or other drinks; 4. not to request microbiological investigations; 5.no medications. Pediatricians will ask the children's parents to fill in a specific form with day-by-day information about the number of stools per day and their consistency, defined as "liquid", "semi-liquid" or "loose" together with the type of rehydration, feeding, medication and microbiological test administered to the child. The forms will be returned upon the control visit, 5, 7 and 15 days after the enrolment visit. Informed consent will be obtained from the parents of enrolled children.</interventions>
    <comparator>Seventy-five randomly selected primary care pediatricians not trained in the guidelines. They will not be specifically exposed to the guidelines and therefore will manage the patients as they would do normally. Pediatricians will be informed that they will be enrolled in an observational study on the features of diarrhea and its treatment. Pediatricians will ask the children's parents to fill in a specific form with day-by-day information about the number of stools per day and their consistency, defined as "liquid", "semi-liquid" or "loose" together with the type of rehydration, feeding, medication and microbiological test administered to the child. The forms will be returned upon the control visit, 5, 7 and 15 days after the enrolment visit. Informed consent will be obtained from the parents of enrolled children.</comparator>

      <outcome>Costs of active medical prescriptions and microbiological examinations, in addition to oral rehydration solutions and acetaminophen. Costs will be assessed on standard rates as follows: antibiotics or other drugs= 10 EUR; lactose-free formula = 10 EUR; protein hydrolysate formula= 20 EUR; microbiological examinations = 25 EUR. Total average costs will be calculated as the sum of the total costs for all medical prescriptions divided by the number of children in each group.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Each pediatrician will enrol 10 children with acute onset diarrhea in the 12 months of the study (i.e., the first child seen each month until a total of 10 children are enrolled). Onset of diarrhea will be defined as the time of the first loose or liquid stool output. Acute diarrhea will be defined as &gt; 3 loose or liquid stools per day. Dehydration will be estimated with a scoring system.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although there are several guidelines for the management of acute gastroenteritis in children, it is not known whether guideline application actually results in a better outcome of the disease which is a measure of guideline efficacy. Several studies have described the effects of single interventions such as drugs, oral rehydration solution compositions and feeding regimens but nothing is known about a global management strategy. In this national case-controlled field trial, we want to evaluate the management and outcome of children with acute gastroenteritis managed by pediatricians exposed or not to specific guidelines. We believe that the application of guidelines results in an improved outcome of the disease and in a reduction in costs to society.</summary>
