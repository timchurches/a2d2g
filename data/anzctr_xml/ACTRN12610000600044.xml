  <interventions>
    <interventions>Household contacts in the intervention group will receive basic education about tuberculosis and a two year programme of systematic screening and follow-up for active tuberculosis disease. These household contacts will be screened using clinical assessment and plain chest Xrays at the time of enrolment and periodically over the next 2 years. Contacts with symptoms or signs suspicious of active tuberculosis will submit sputum samples for smear and culture.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the case detection rate of tuberculosis among household contacts during the two year follow-up period of the trial. This is measured by clinical diagnosis (according to World Health Organization definition of active tuberculosis). A diagnosis of tuberculosis can be reached based upon clinical history and examination, chest Xray and microbiological diagnosis (sputum investigation including culture). Tuberculosis will be classified as either smear positive, smear negative or all tuberculosis. The diagnosis of tuberculosis in contacts will be classified as pulmonary tuberculosis or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This will be a cluster-randomised controlled trial, where the unit of allocation is the District clinic. Each District will be randomised to be either a control district or a screening District. 

This is an effectiveness and cost-effectiveness study.

All study participants at a given District will either be included in the control or screening group. The randomisation of each District will occur after an initial trial run-in period, in order to test faesability of the study at each District. 

Patients with smear positive tuberculosis will be enrolled at the district tuberculosis clinics at the time of diagnosis or subsequent treatment. Household contacts will be enrolled when patients bring their household members to the district clinics.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a cluster-randomised controlled trial for screening household contacts of tuberculosis patients in 8 Provinces in Vietnam. It is an effectiveness and cost-effectiveness study. We will screen household contacts from districts in the intervention group regularly over a two year follow-up period and determine the case detection rate of tuberculosis disease in the screening and control groups.</summary>
