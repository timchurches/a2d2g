    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, extrema and quartiles, will be produced for each continuous outcome. Tolerability will be described using the proportion of treatment cessations due to intolerance at 8 weeks, and the histogram of final dosages. Adherence will be summarised using the proportion of unused tablets at each visit and the histogram of the number of tablets returned by each patient at each visit. Adverse events will be categorised according to standard diagnostic codes and reported in tabular form under the dosage at which they occurred.

For the primary efficacy analysis, the logarithms of the primary endpoints at weeks 2 and 8 will be fitted in a linear mixed model using the participant as random effects and the baseline value as covariate. The test statistic in this case will be the fitted intercept, which will be zero under the null hypothesis of no change. This approach is a generalisation of the ANCOVA that allows the use of repeated measures data. In practice it corresponds to comparing the average of the repeated measures at 2 and 8 weeks with baseline, accounting for the correlation between all measurements and conditioning on baseline, which improves efficiency. Should normality not be warranted for the log-transformed data, alternative generalised linear models will be sought on the basis of a visual assessment of the residuals and testing of the residuals for consistency with alternative distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests). False discovery rate (FDR) control will be used to account for multiplicity.

Secondary analyses of the primary outcomes will be similar to the primary analyses but include the average true dose of nicotinamide in the preceding period of 2 or 6 weeks as a covariate. Analyses of secondary outcomes will proceed in a similar manner, with logarithmic transformations considered primarily for concentrations, counts and ratios. Inferential analyses will be carried out at a 5% significance level against two-sided alternatives. Estimates will be reported as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchiectasis is a chronic, debilitating disease characterised by productive cough, neutrophilic inflammation, bacterial colonisation, and repeated respiratory infections requiring antibiotics. New and innovative approaches to the treatment of airway inflammation and infection are needed. Nicotinamide, the amide derivative of vitamin B3, has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, and has recently been shown to boost innate immunity and enhance the killing of bacteria. Several feasibility issues need to be clarified prior to undertaking a full, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of nicotinamide in patients with bronchiectasis. These include determining the effects of high dose nicotinamide on airway and systemic inflammation and antimicrobial peptides in patients with bronchiectasis. In addition, we will evaluate the tolerability and safety of high doses of nicotinamide.</summary>
