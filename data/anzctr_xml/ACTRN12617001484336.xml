  <interventions>
    <interventions>The OL@-OR@ trial is a pragmatic, community-based, two-arm, cluster randomised trial, including 48 clusters with 40 participants per cluster (24 Maori clusters and 24 Pasifika clusters). 
Clusters will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to one of two groups: 1) the full OL@-OR@ mhealth tool (app/web version; intervention group), or 2) a simplified version of the mhealth tool (app/web version; control group). It will be up to the participants how often they utilise the app within the 12 week period and they are able to use the app from any location with internet access. 
All participants will be followed for 12 weeks with assessments at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks which includes demographics, lifestyle questions (fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake, Maori/ Pasifika wellbeing questions and feedback on the app will also be collected at 12 weeks. 
The intervention will be delivered through a mobile app or web version, however Community Coordinators will be involved with recruiting participants and supporting them with registering and using the tool. The Community Coordinators are from our Maori and Pasifika communities who have been involved from the start of the project in the co-design phase.
The full OL@-OR@ tool (app and web versions) includes;
- Support for participants to set goals as an individual or family and invite others to join them in their journey to achieve these goals.
- Participants are encouraged to set additional tasks to help them to achieve their goals.
- Participants receive reward tokens for achieving their goals. 
- There are a number of behavioural change culturally tailored resources throughout the app such as lifestyle trackers, recipes, links to helpful websites, nutritional and physical activity information and local activities such as food markets and exercise classes.
- The app also sends regular reminders and motivational messages to help participants reach their goals.
- Participants interact with the content by setting goals, sharing with friends and inviting others to use the app, uploading recipes and local activities and by utilising the tips around physical activity and nutrition.
 
The simplified version of the tool:
- A countdown until when they will receive the full app
- One message a week letting them know when they will receive the full app
- Reminders to complete the questionnaires at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post registration.
- The only interaction required for the control app is leaving the app on their phone and completing the questionnaires at the required time points.

Adherence will be assessed by collecting data in the app around how a participant interacts with the app. This includes looking at data around:
- The total number of times a participant accesses the app during the study.
- The time elapsed between each session the participant accessed the app
- Number of goals a user sets
This will be monitored by the research team at the National Institute for Health Innovation (NIHI)
NIHI will also monitor whether participants have completed their registration, 4 week questionnaire and 12 week questionnaire. Reminders will go out to participants 1 week prior, on the questionnaire due date and 1 week after the questionnaire is due (if not already completed)  to remind participants to complete the questionnaire. An email will also be automatically generated and sent to the participants Community Coordinator to chase up any questionnaires not complete.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will involve a participant downloading a simplified version of the tool which will be used for data collection at baseline, 4 weeks and 12 weeks as per the intervention group and a weekly notification message informing the participant how long they have until they can download the full app at the end of the trial. All participants in the control group will be able to access the full app after 12 weeks once they have completed the 12 week questionnaire.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is 12 week participant adherence to recommended health guidelines, as defined by a self-reported composite health behaviour score based on the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk Prospective Population Study. This composite score includes: smoking (1= not currently smoking; 0=had greater than or equal to 1 cigarettes in past 7 days); fruit and vegetable intake (1 = great than or equal to 5 servings daily; 0 = less than or equal to 4 servings daily); alcohol intake (1 = less than or equal to 13 units per week; 0 = greater than or equal to 14 units per week); and physical activity (1 = more than or equal to 14 units of moderate-to-vigorous activity/week; 0 = less than or equal to 13 units of moderate-to-vigorous activity/week). Scores range from 0 to 4 based on the number of health guidelines met. Participants are classified as adherent if they score 3 or more out of 4 and non-adherent if they score 2 or less. These measures are measured at an individual leave but analysed and reported at a cluster level (as are the secondary measures).</outcome>

      <outcome>Holistic wellbeing (Maori participants) including Tuhononga (cultural connections, Mauri and wellbeing, whanaungatanga (whanua wellbeing and social connectedness) and Rangatiratanga (self-determination, motivation and management) measured by 16 questions based on Maori health models Te Whare Tapa Wha and Te Pae Mahutonga and adapted in part from the Hua Oranga Maori mental health assessment questionnaire. Answer categories consist of a 6-point Likert scale and 4 open ended questions.

Holistic wellbeing (Pasifika participants) including spiritual, physical, mental and family wellbeing measured by 10-items based on the Fonofale Model, the Ottawa Charter and Hua Oranga designed for the purpose of this study. All answer categories are measured on a 5-point Likert scale.

    <statisticalmethods>We aim to recruit 1920 participants in total; 48 clusters with 40 participants per cluster (24 Maori clusters and 24 Pasifika clusters). This sample size will have sufficient power for the analysis of Maori and Pasifika participants separately. More specifically, a total sample size of 960 participants (n=40 per cluster, 12 clusters per treatment group; 24 clusters in total i.e. each ethnic-specific sample) will have 80% power at 5% level of significance (two-sided) to detect a between-group difference of 15% in the primary outcome at 12 weeks post intervention, assuming the proportion of participants adherent to healthy lifestyle behaviours in the control group is 30% and an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.0531.
Data from the trial will be entered into the Drupal database, and imported to SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC) for data analysis at the National Institute for Health Innovation. All statistical tests will be 2-sided at a 5% significance level. A full statistical analysis plan will be developed a priori by the study statistician to guide final analysis and reporting. No interim analyses will be undertaken during the trial. The CONSORT 2010 statement: extension to cluster randomised trial will be followed. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Ol@-OR@ trial is part of a larger project to develop and evaluate a culturally tailored, personalised mobile health (mHealth) healthy lifestyle and wellbeing tool for Maori and Pasifika. This project comprises two phases: 
- During phase one, a partnership approach was taken in which Maori and Pacific leaders and communities co-designed the mHealth tool with the academic research team. Maori and Pasifika partners confirmed that a smartphone app was the optimal vehicle for the intervention and the results of the co-design phase were used to inform the theory based
behaviour change content of the app. 
- In the second phase of the project we will examine the effectiveness of the mHealth tool in a pragmatic, community based cluster randomised controlled trial  the OL@-OR@
trial. 
The trial aims to determine if using the mHealth tool for 12 weeks will improve diet, physical activity and other risk factors for non-communicable
diseases. The trial will involve 1920 participants throughout New Zealand (48 clusters [24 Maori and 24 Pasifika) with 40 people in each cluster).</summary>
