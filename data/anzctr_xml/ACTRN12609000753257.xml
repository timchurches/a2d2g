  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to investigate test-retest reliability of psychometric assessments and feasibility plus community acceptance of teacher-administered omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in a remote community school. Baseline psychometric assessments will be conducted in July, second baseline assessments 9 weeks later and then 9 weeks of supplementation followed by final assessments.</summary>
