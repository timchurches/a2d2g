  <interventions>
    <interventions>Placebo masked tapered cessation of current selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant medication. Participants in the intervention group will have their medication tapered over a month to placebo which will continue for 18 months. The dose of active drug in each capsule will be halved each week for the first four weeks then discontinued. The placebo is a non lactose inert powder filled oral capsule. After the taper period both the active drug and the placebo/taper arm will continue to take one tablet daily for the 18 month study period. </interventions>
    <comparator>Continuation of maintenance selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant treatment. Patients in the control group will continue receiving their antidepressants at the dose they have been taking over the same 18 month time period. The medication will be encapsulated as a powder which look identical to the taper /placebo arm, taken as a daily dose for the entire 18 months of follow up</comparator>

    <concealment>Partipants will be recruited from primary care. Once they have met the inclusion criteria and consented they will be given the next medication pack from a numbered list. The medication has been packed according to the outlined randomisation procedure.
Allocation concealment
Placebos will be identical to the active drug tablets, and identified by a code which will be attached to the patientâ€™s clinical notes.
The dispensing pharmacists will keep the codes in a sealed envelope. The investigator team, General Practioners (GPs) and biostatistician will have no access to the code until the end of the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The medication has been packed according to the outlined randomisation procedure.
Randomisation procedure: 
A non-study biostatistician will provide a computer generated random sequence for the medication packs using random block lengths.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most (85-90%) depression is treated in primary care. Many patients in primary care are now receiving long term maintenance therapy with antidepressants to prevent recurrence.  Whilst research indicates long term maintenance treatment benefits some patients referred to and treated in secondary care, there is no similar evidence for patients with milder symptoms treated exclusively in primary care. Recurrence of depressive episodes is lower in primary than secondary care treated patients (35% vs 75%).
This study is a triple blinded randomised controlled trial of continued treatment vs tapered withdrawal of fluoxetine in patients who have been treated in primary care for at least twelve months and who are not currently experiencing depression. Patients will be followed for 18 months to monitor recurrence of depression, side effects, and general social and occupational functioning and the two arms compared.  This study will further our understanding of the optimal long term treatment of depression in primary care by assessing whether there is any benefit in using antidpressants for preventing recurrence of depression, or whether the medication can safely be stopped.</summary>
