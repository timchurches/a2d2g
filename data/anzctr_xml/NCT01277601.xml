  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF) plus peginterferon a-2a (Peg-IFN) combination therapy for 48 weeks versus
      standard of care TDF monotherapy or Peg-IFN monotherapy for 48 weeks in non-cirrhotic adults
      with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) as determined by loss of hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg).

      The study will consist of 2 phases for participants in the TDF+Peg-IFN 48 Weeks, TDF 48 Weeks
      + Peg-IFN 16 Weeks, and Peg-IFN 48 Weeks groups. Following an initial 48 weeks of treatment,
      participants in these groups will be monitored for 24 weeks for signs of worsening HBV, and
      those meeting TDF retreatment and flare management criteria will be eligible to receive TDF
      monotherapy during a retreatment phase, up to Week 120.</summary>
