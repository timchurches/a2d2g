  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will participate in one group session (approximately 30 minutes), where they will be provided with information about sedentary behaviour, screen time and active play for their child. The session will be delivered by the PhD Candidate/Project Manager during the participants' playgroup time (at the usual playgroup setting). At this session they will receive, and be talked through, a booklet with information about the behaviours, guidelines for sedentary behaviour and physical activity in early childhood, ideas for active play and limiting screen time, and information about goal setting. They will then be asked to set two SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals relating to the outcomes of the study: one for increasing active play and one for limiting screen time. Parents will also receive 2-3 tailored text messages per week (for 6 weeks), which will include tips for limiting sedentary behaviour, ideas for active play, and prompts to check their progress with their goals.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be a wait-list control; they receive the full program after the follow up measurements are taken (i.e., 7 weeks after the intervention group starts the program).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in screen time (minutes per day) measured by parent-report (reliability previously established)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention (baseline) and post-intervention (6 weeks post intervention commencement)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in sedentary time (minutes per day) measured objectively with activPAL accelerometers (valid and reliable in this population). activPALs will be worn for 7 consecutive days at both timepoints. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention (baseline) and post-intervention (6 weeks post intervention commencement)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility: recruitment and retention - recruitment numbers will be recorded and retention calculated by the number of participants still enrolled in the program post-intervention
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-intervention (i.e. 6 weeks post intervention commencement)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility: dose delivered - measured by attendance at the group session and with purposed-designed parent survey questions (e.g., "How many of the text messages did you read/click through to the links?")

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-intervention (i.e. 6 weeks post intervention commencement)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility: engagement in the intervention - measured by parent responses to goal-checking text messages and qualitative telephone interviews (asking questions usefulness/relevance of the session and text messages)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to pilot test the feasibility and potential efficacy of a parent-focused program to reduce sedentary behaviour in 2 to 4 year old children. The program will include a short group session with parents in their existing playgroups, followed by personalised text messages for parents for the next 6 weeks. </summary>
