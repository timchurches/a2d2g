  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to develop, implement and test a multi-component intervention for increasing HMR uptake among retirement village residents. The interventions to be tested are:      

a) Home Medicines Review (HMR) education session 

A consultant pharmacist (who is accredited to undertake HMRs) will provide education to participants (in group) about the role of and benefits from HMR. The consultant pharmacist will visit the retirement villages to deliver the education sessions. Information leaflets about HMR will be given out to participants during these education sessions. 

b) Medication risk assessment

A medication risk assessment checklist will be adapted from a published screening tool/checklist that is available in the public domain (Pharmacy Guilds HMR brochure - http://www.guild.org.au/uploadedfiles/Medication_Management_Reviews/Overview/HMR%20Flyer%20A5%20blue%20Approved.pdf). After the education sessions, all participants will be asked to complete the checklist, with the pharmacist taking them through each question. The completed checklist will then be used by the consultant pharmacist to identify participants who have medication risk factors and thus could potentially benefit from a HMR. 

c) New referral process for HMR 

Participants identified as having one or more medication risk factors (e.g. with one or more tick boxes on the checklist) will be asked to give the completed medication risk checklist to their General Practitioner (GP) during their next GP visit.

The education session, including the activity of participants completing medication risk checklist, will be conducted on a group basis. The entire session will last approximately one and half hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual or normal care. Participants in the control group will continue to receive normal or routine care for 6 months during the study. No interventions will be offered to the control group participants at baseline or at anytime during the study; however, they will not be denied the right to receive a HMR if this is being offered in the course of the study as part of routine care.  At the completion of the study (i.e. after 6 months), the interventions will be offered also to the control group participants to minimise any disadvantage.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient self-reported uptake of Home Medicines Review (HMR) service is the primary outcome measure. This will be measured as the proportions of participants in the two groups who have had at least one HMR since baseline. Patients will be interviewed over the phone to obtain this information. The information will be verified against health profefssionals' reports (General Practitioner, community pharmacist or consultant pharmacist).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3 and 6 months after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Medication adherence will be the secondary outcome measure of the study. Participants will be assessed for medication adherence using the validated 4-item Morisky scale at baseline and at 6 months. Data will be collected using participant self-administered questionnaires at baseline and interviewer-administered questionnaires via telephone at 6 months. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 months after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life will be other outcome measure of the study. The Short Form (SF)-12 Health Survey, which has 12 validated items, will be used to assess participant's health and quallity of life at baseline and at 6 months. Data will be collected using participant self-administered questionnaires at baseline and interviewer-administered questionnaire via telephone at 6 months.

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Residents will be recruited from five to ten retirement villages in Victoria. Retirement villages that are eligible for the study will be identified  in consultation with the Residents of Retirement Villages Victoria Inc. (RRVV). A list of eligible villages will be generated by RRVV. Five to ten eligible villages will be selected (based on facility size and geographical locations) using the RRVV list and recruited for this study. Participating villages will be randomly allocated (cluster randomisation) to one of the two groups (intervention or control) according to their geographical locations. The random allocation process will be carried out by someone oustide the study team, using a sealed opaque envelope technique. 

Invitation flyers/expression of interest forms will be sent to all residents of each participating village. Those who are interested in the study will be asked to complete the expression of interest form and return it to the researchers. Eligible residents will be contacted by phone and invited to participate in the study. Once written consent is obtained, eligible residents will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be allocated to either intervention or control group depending on which retirement village they live in.</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified sampling will be used in this study. The selected villages will be stratified according to geographical location (i.e. Northen/Eastern or Southern/Western regions) in Victoria. These villages will be randomly allocated to either intervention or control group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The majority of older people living in retirement villages are at risk of medication misadventure. In our recent survey of about 2,000 retirement village residents in Victoria, two-thirds had at least one medication-related risk factor, and hence were eligible to receive a pharmacist-conducted Home Medicines Review (HMR), a government-subsidised health service recommended annually for people who are at risk of medication misadventure. However, the uptake of HMR in this group has been very low (6%).

The proposed project aims to develop, implement and evaluate a multi-component intervention (based on stakeholder recommendations) for increasing HMR uptake among RV residents. The study will involve 150 to 200  retirement village residents who will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups depending on  the retirement village  they live in; half will receive the intervention and the others will receive usual care. The intervention comprises educating residents regarding their medication risk and benefits of HMR, and notifying residents general practitioners of residents risk of medication misadventure using a risk assessment form/checklist. Participants will be followed up by phone and questionnaire at three and six months from baseline to assess if they have had received a HMR. This information will be further confirmed with participants health professionals.</summary>
