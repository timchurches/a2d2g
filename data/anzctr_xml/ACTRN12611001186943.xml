  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Pregabalin, Up to 3x75 mg per day for 12 weeks, maximum dose 300 mg/day, oral route
Arm 2: Speech pathology 4 step intervention for chronic cough, administered one on one with speech pathologist. Four steps include cough education, cough counselling, behavioural therapy such as swallowing technique, lifestyle intervention such as vocal hydration and at least one of these components will addressed at each visit depending on individual needs and understanding of the techniques by the participant. Each session will last for approximately 1 hour every 3 weeks for 12 weeks duration.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate and trial a combined therapy of novel medication and speech pathology for a persistent cough that hasn't previously responded to typical medical treatment. We will compare this program to individual component treatments of medication or speech pathology with the aim of significantly reducing cough symptoms and cough severity. Our ultimate goal is to resolve the cough resulting in a significant improvement in patient quality of life.</summary>
