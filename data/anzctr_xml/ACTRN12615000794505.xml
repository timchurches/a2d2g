  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single dose of dexamethasone 4mg will be given as an oral tablet at the same time that the zoledronic acid infusion is started. 

Zoledronic acid is conventionally given as a dose of 5mg intravenously over 15 minutes. However, it may also be given as a dose of 2.5mg over 30-45 minutes in patients with mild renal impairment. The decision regarding dose and duration of zoledronic acid infusion will be made by the treating physician prior to study enrollment.

To facilitate data collection, participants will receive telephone calls from a study investigator one day, four days, and fifteen days following this intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo tablets containing microcrystalline cellulose will be given orally at the same time that the zoledronic acid infusion is started.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Between-group difference in temperature change from baseline. Temperature will be assessed by the participant using a handheld oral thermometer. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The change in temperature from baseline over 3 days will be assessed. 

Temperature measurements will occur at the following time-points: At baseline, temperature will be measured 3 times, each reading taken 1 minute apart. These results will be averaged. Following the intervention, a single temperature measurement will be taken at bedtime on the evening of the intervention. Single temperature measurements will be taken 3 times a day for the 3 days following the intervention, at the following times: first thing in the morning (before breakfast), mid-afternoon, and bedtime. 

Between-group difference in temperature change from baseline to bedtime three days after the intervention will be assessed using repeated measures analysis of covariance. All time-points will be included in analysis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The between group difference in change in symptom score from baseline will be assessed. 

At baseline, participants will complete a questionnaire relating to four common symptoms of the acute phase response (headache, nausea, muscle or joint symptoms, feverishness) that they may have experienced within the preceding 24 hours. This questionnaire is based on the Generic Assessment of Side Effects (GASE) scale, but has been modified for this study. Participants will assign each symptom a score of 0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe). The scores assigned to each symptom will be added, to produce an overall symptom score of 0-12. 

Following the intervention, participants will complete this same questionnaire before bed on the evening of the intervention. The questionnaire will be completed again before bed on the following 3 evenings. Fifteen days after the intervention, participants will receive a phone call from a study investigator, where they will be asked the questions on the symptom questionnaire over the phone. 

Between-group change in overall symptom score (0-12) from baseline over 3 days, and also from baseline to 15 days will be assessed.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall symptom score will be assessed via questionnaire at the following time-points: Symptom score will be assessed at baseline. Following the intervention, overall symptom score will be assessed at bedtime on the evening of the intervention, and again before bed on the following 3 evenings (repeated 4 times in total). Participants will receive a phone call from a study investigator 15 days following the intervention, at which time they will be asked the questions on the questionnaire over the phone, so that an overall symptom score can be calculated.

Between-group difference in change in overall symptom score (0-12) from baseline to bedtime three days after the intervention will be assessed using repeated measures analysis of covariance. All time-points will be included in this analysis. Difference in change in overall symptom score from baseline to 15 days following the intervention will also be evaluated.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>In a previous study, a mean temperature increase of approximately 0.85 degrees celsius within 34 hours was observed following zoledronic acid infusion, compared to a mean temperature increase of 0.20 degrees celsius in individuals receiving placebo. Mean difference in temperature change between the groups was 0.65 degrees celsius  (Wark et al, Osteoporosis International 2012;23:503-512). A sample size of 40 (20 participants per group) will provide &gt;80% power to detect a temperature difference of at least 0.65 degrees celsius between treatment groups, at a significance threshold of 5%, allowing for 10% loss to follow-up  (Pass 2002, WWW.NCSS.COM, Kaysville, Utah).

Change from baseline in mean temperature prior to infusion to morning, noon and night for three successive days will be modeled using a mixed effect model approach to repeated measures.  The main effects of treatment allocation and time and their interaction will be modeled in the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) which will include baseline mean temperature a covariate.  Significant main or interaction effects will be further explored using the method of Tukey to preserve an overall pairwise error rate of 5%.  In the unlikely event that change in temperature is not normally distributed, an appropriate normalizing transformation will be applied.  

The analysis will be undertaken on an intention to treat basis with no data excluded from analysis and initially assuming an unstructured covariance.   In secondary analysis, any missing temperatures will be imputed using standard imputation procedures (Proc Impute, SAS).
 
Should the distribution of change in symptom scores over time be normally distributed the same analysis method as will be used for change in temperature will be used, else repeated measures categorical modelling will be employed.    

In sensitivity analysis, the potentially confounding effect of eGFR will be examined by repeating the primary analysis excluding those with impaired renal function (eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2).  The influence of age will be explored by plotting the change in temperature at midday two days following the intervention (the anticipated maximum temperature based on the study by Wark et al, in Osteoporosis International 2012;23:503-512) by age for each treatment arm and comparing the slopes.

In secondary analysis, differences in the proportion of patients with a significant increase in oral temperature (i.e. a rise of &gt; 1 degrees celsius) or a significant increase in symptom severity (i.e. an increase of 3 or more in the sum of symptom severities) will be assessed using Fishers exact test, and presented as relative risks. Differences in the proportion of patients who require anti-inflammatory medication will be assessed using Fishers exact test. Participants will also be classified into groups based on the dose of anti-inflammatory medication that they take over the 72 hours following the intervention (i.e. none, low dose, high dose), and differences in the proportion of patients in each dosage group will be compared between those who received dexamethasone and those who received placebo using the Chi-squared test.   

These analyses will be performed on data from the first 3 days following the intervention.  Two additional analyses will be performed, comparing firstly the proportion of people in each arm who have a significant increase in symptom severity reported at the phone call 15 days after the intervention and secondly the proportion in each arm who have a significant increase in symptom severity 15 days following intervention OR 0-3 days following intervention. The frequency of each symptom score 15 days following the intervention will be compared between treatment arms using the Chi-square test.

 All tests will be two-tailed, and p &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether the daily temperature profile of patients receiving a zoledronic acid infusion is improved by the administration of oral dexamethasone at the time of infusion, compared to placebo. The study will also assess whether there is a decreased incidence and/or severity of symptoms of acute phase response (APR) with oral dexamethasone compared to placebo. 

This is a prospective randomized-controlled trial of 40 individuals undergoing treatment with zoledronic acid for fracture prevention or Pagets disease. Individuals meeting inclusion criteria will be randomly and equally allocated to receive either dexamethasone 4mg orally or a placebo tablet at the time of zoledronic acid infusion. Incidence and severity of the acute phase response, determined via assessment of symptoms and temperature, will be compared between groups.



At baseline, each participant will undergo oral temperature measurement and will complete a questionnaire relating to symptoms of APR. Daily assessments will continue for 3 days following the intervention. .Fifteen days after the intervention, participants will receive another phone call to inquire about ongoing symptoms.
