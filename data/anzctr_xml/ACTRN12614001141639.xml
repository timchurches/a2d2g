    <interventions>Acute administration of a phytochemical- and mineral-rich filtered sugarcane molasses concentrate (FMC) given as a supplement consumed immediately prior to a standard breakfast meal. All 38 subjects tested Meals 1 to 3, a subset of 15 subjects also tested Meals 4 and 5. The product was given to all subjects in two different doses, 8 g and 22 g, and a sugar-containing, dark-coloured placebo syrup was used as a control. The 15 subjects who were enrolled in the trial extension also subsequently ingested FMC doses of 40 g and 60 g.

Each subject consumed the first three meals, in random order, each on a separate occasion with at least 1 day washout in between. The test meals consisted of:
1.	Test Meal 1: 30 g placebo syrup consumed with 100 g of white bread, 12 g butter, 65 g scrambled eggs and 170 g orange &amp; mango juice.
2.	Test Meal 2: 8 g FMC + 22 g water consumed with 100 g white bread, 12 g butter, 65 g scrambled eggs and 170 g orange &amp; mango juice.
3.	Test Meal 3: 22 g FMC + 8 g water consumed with 100 g white bread, 12 g butter, 65 g scrambled eggs and 170 g orange &amp; mango juice.
The extra meals tested by 15 subjects, in random order, during the trial extension consisted of:
1.	Test Meal 4: 40 g FMC syrup + 45 g water consumed with 100 g white bread, 12 g butter, 65 g scrambled eggs and 170 g orange &amp; mango juice.
2.	Test Meal 5: 60 g FMC + 25 g water consumed with 100 g white bread, 12 g butter, 65 g scrambled eggs and 170 g orange &amp; mango juice.

Placebo and FMC syrups were visually similar dark-coloured liquids but differed in smell and taste. Subjects were blinded as to which syrups were investigational products and which placebo.

The study used a crossover design such that every subject consumed each Test Meal on one occasion only in random order, completing a total of three (or five) test sessions. Each subject completed his or her test sessions on separate weekday mornings at a similar time of day, as close as possible to the time at which the subject normally ate breakfast.
Pre-meal supplement and meal were consumed within twelve minutes, subjects were required to remain seated during their test sessions and only minimal movement was allowed (visiting the rest rooms or walking a couple of meters to the blood sampling area). During each test session, the subjects were monitored by research staff to ensure they complied with the test conditions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A phytochemical- and mineral-rich filtered sugarcane molasses concentrate (FMC), when added to carbohydrate-containing foods as a functional ingredient, lowers postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses. We hypothesized that this beneficial effect would also occur if FMC was administered as an oral supplement taken before a meal. This study measured the postprandial glucose and insulin responses elicited by different doses of FMC administered immediately prior to a standard breakfast to healthy subjects. Each subject was given three or five breakfast meals once, on different days. The composition of the meals was identical, except for the addition of either placebo syrup (Test Meal 1), or increasing doses of FMC (Test Meals 2-5).</summary>
