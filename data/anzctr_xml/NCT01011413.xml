  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical data suggests that the standard dose of the anti-HIV medication, efavirenz (EFV),
      could be reduced without compromising its effectiveness. Lower drug doses could have fewer
      side effects and would make EFV more affordable. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      safety and effectiveness, over 96 weeks, of standard (600mg) versus reduced dose (400mg) EFV
      in controlling HIV as part of initial combination antiretroviral therapy.</summary>
