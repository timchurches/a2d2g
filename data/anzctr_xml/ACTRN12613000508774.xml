    <interventions>Comparison of duodenal ultrastructure between ambulant volunteers and critically ill patients. The duodenal samples from critically ill patients have already been collected as part of a previous study (Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Ethics Committee protocol number 051211). 6 duodenal samples were taken per patient for 15 patients, over the period of 2011-2012. 

Therefore, 6 duodenal samples will be taken from each ambulant volunteer, and the total length of the endoscopy will not be significantly lengthened. An average endoscopy lasts around half an hour. </interventions>

Depending on normality, the difference between groups will be assessed by Students unpaired t-test or the non-parametric equivalent. The null hypothesis will be rejected at a significance of 0.05. 

The number of patients for this study is based on the number of patients in the comparative group i.e. the critically ill patients in whom we have already obtained biopsies (Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Ethics Committee protocol number 051211).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesize that ICU patients have changes in the structure of their small intestinal cells that predisposes them to malabsorption of nutrients. 

To investigate this, we are comparing biopsies from 15 ICU patients and comparing them to biopsies from 15 healthy patients. We will analyse the samples with an electron microscope. </summary>
