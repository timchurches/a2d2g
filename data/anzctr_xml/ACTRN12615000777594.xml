    <interventions>The study involves a simple, point of care test of blood clotting - thromboelastogram (TEG) that measures increased clotting susceptibility far better than other conventional blood tests. These blood test results will be correlated against longer term progress of patients neurological recovery. The outcome test will use standard CT scan, serial Doppler Ultrasound for brain blood vessels and neurological information obtained during routine followup by neurosurgeons and neurologists. The blood for the TEG will be taken together with other routine blood tests and should not usually require separate blood samples. The neurological assessments will be part of routine care.
Tests will be collected within 24-48hours of diagnosis and serially assessed against other conventional methods up to day 14 of diagnosis or discharge.</interventions>

We will correlate TEG markers of coagulation with grading of vasospasm and the degree of cerebral infarction by means of Spearman rho correlation test.We will compare coagulation characteristics of patients with or without vasospasm using non-parametric statistics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When patients suffer from bleeding into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain it is known as a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH).  When a SAH is suffered the patient is exposed to very high risk of death and long-term illness and disability. This is due to development of multiple complications following the start of the bleeding.  The cause of these complications can be attributed directly to the cause of the bleeding in the first place. Examples include thinning of the blood, trauma or aneurysms (a weakness in the wall of the brain arteries that become enlarged and rupture). However, one of the most serious complications of subarachnoid bleeding occurring 3 to 7 days after bleeding is a phenomenon called vasospasm. This phenomenon in which the blood vessels narrow and decrease the blood flow, reducing the blood supply and oxygen delivery to the brain tissue, potentially causing permanent brain damage ( stroke) . It can be fatal if severe.

The causes of vasospasm and subsequent brain damage are not fully understood. 

Understanding the causes of vasospasm and the way it causes brain damage could help in starting new treatment lines that eventually might lead to a better outcome. 

We believe that increased blood clotting could be a contributing factor in reducing blood flow to the brain causing permanent blockage of brain blood vessels and brain damage.

Therefore, our study seeks to determine whether patients who develop symptoms of delayed brain damage have an increased blood clotting tendency. The study involves a simple, point of care test of blood clotting - thromboelastogram (TEG) that measures increased clotting susceptibility far better than other conventional blood tests. These blood test results will be correlated against longer term progress of patients neurological recovery. The outcome test will use standard CT scan, serial Doppler Ultrasound for brain blood vessels and neurological information obtained during routine followup by neurosurgeons and neurologists. The blood for the TEG will be taken together with other routine blood tests and should not usually require separate blood samples. The neurological assessments will be part of routine care.

Some blood plasma may be stored for additional coagulation tests depending on the primary result of the study.

All information gathered will be aggregated and no individual patient would be identified in any publication.

This study is prospective cross sectional cohort study and use thromboelastogram in patients with subarachnoid bleeding excluding trauma related causes. We suspect that there will be association between brain damage symptoms and increasing coagulation of the blood. That will facilitate, in future studies, introducing medical intervention earlier to assist in treating such morbid complication.
