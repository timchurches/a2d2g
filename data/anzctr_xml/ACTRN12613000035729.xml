  <interventions>
    <interventions>we ask children to play an advergame for five minutes. We have two different advergames, one advergame promoting non-food products and one advergame promoting energy-dense food. While playing, we present two bowls of food from which the children can eat freely while playing.he two bowls contain energy-dense snacks. Half of the children are asked not to eat to receive a reward (a pencil), while the other half of the children can eat as much as they like. After the advergame they will fill in a questionnaire. The reward is given when all children in the school have finished the experiment. We explain this after the experiment has ended.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is the group of children that play the advergame promoting nonfood products.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>we measure the amount of food before the child enters the room with a weighing scale. We do this also after the game, so we can see how much each child has eaten.  We will analyse this with SPSS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>before the children have played the game we measure the amount of food, and we do the same after the experiment has ended, before the next child enters the experiment room. The children can eat snacks for approximately 5 minutes, during the advergame. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the self-control of the children is assessed by viewing the behavior of the children with a videoscreen, connected to a camera in the room. The experimenter sits outside the room and can watch what is happening in the room, to check whether the children eat, what they eat, and also how they try not to eat. </outcome>
      <timepoint>we measure this during the advergame.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We want to examine whether children are able to self-control their impulsivity and whether food advertisements increase the need for this self-control. Our hypothesis is that children that have a hight impulsivity have more problems with controlling their food intake after a food commercial than children who have low impulsivity</summary>
