  <interventions>
    <interventions>Rehabilitation commences 2 weeks after surgery. (a)One-to-one physiotherapy: 12 30-minute sessions across 8 weeks, patients also performs 45-minute exercise program twice a week.  Exercises target range of motion, strength, mobility and balance.(b)Class-based physiotherapy: 12 45-minute sessions across 8 weeks, patients also perform a 45-minute exercise program at home twice a week. Exercises target range of motion, strength, mobility and balance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Rehabilitation commences 2 weeks after surgery. Monitored home program: Two 30-minute sessions of physiotherapy and one follow-up phone call across 8 weeks, patients perform 45-minute exercise program 4 times a week. Exercises target range of motion, strength, mobility and balance.</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stair ascension power.  Power will be calculated from measurement of time to ascend 10 steps (height 15cm each step).  Patient is permitted to use walking aid and/or rail for safety.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks, 10 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks post total knee replacement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee range of motion.  This will be assessed by a photo taken of the patient's leg in supine, with skin markers placed on the lateral malleolus  and greater trochanter, with the knee in maximum flexion and extension. A goiniometer will be used to measure the knee position in the photo using the markers as reference points.</outcome>

    <concealment>Subjects are recruited when they attend a pre-operative education session.  Patients are screened by a research officer, and eligible patients are given a subject information sheet and consent form as approved by the Sydney South West Area Health Service human Research Ethics Committee.  Consenting patients then underwent initial assessment.  Following surgery, patients are assessed by a blinded assessor. Eligible subjects are then  allocated into one of the three treatment groups by therapy staff (who are not blinded) by means of consecutively numbered concealed envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of class-based physiotherapy and one-to-one physiotherapy , compared to a monitored home program after total knee replacement surgery. The study hypothesis is that one-to-one physiotherapy will be superior compared to class-based physiotherapy or a monitored home program.</summary>
