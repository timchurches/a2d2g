  <interventions>
    <interventions>Telehealth system with nurse led support. Patients complete a symptoms questionnaire twice daily on a device(morning and afternoon) from Cycle 1 - Cycle 4 of chemotherapy. The questionnaires take approximately two minutes to complete each.
The intervention nurse monitors symptoms and responds if any alerts are triggered. A red alert occurs if a patient reports a symptom requiring urgent attention, a amber alert occurs if a patient reports a symptom requring non-urgent attention. 
In the case of an alert, the nurse will contact the patient by phone and query the symptom, provide self care and support.
The device is a mobile phone enabled android tablet. The handset contains an application that prompts patients to complete a side-effect assessment questionnaire by following instructions on the touch screen tablet. Normal phone functions are disabled. All patients will be provided with the android tablet device and SIM card for the trial. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcomes for this longitudinal randomised controlled trial are nausea, mucositis, constipation and fatigue as assessed by the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist. All four items have a possible scale range of 3. These outcomes were chosen because they are common in patients receiving chemotherapy, are targeted by the PRISMS intervention and have demonstrated improvement following telehealth interventions. 
Sample size calculations were based on 80% power, a two-sided independent-samples t-test with an alpha level of 0.05 and a standardised effect size of 0.4. In the absence of minimal important difference estimates for the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, or any other symptom assessment tool validated for use in cancer patients, evidence-based effect sizes for the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom scales and individual items were used as a guide (see note) In this case, for all QLQ-C30 scales/items excepting the Dyspnea item, a standardised effect of 0.4 represents the lower threshold of a medium-sized clinically relevant difference between groups of cancer patients. Given these specifications, a total of 200 patients (100 per arm) is required. Assuming attrition of up to 10%, a total of 222 patients (111 per arm) are needed at baseline.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating if a mobile phone based system can support patients to monitor their side effects, promote the delivery of evidence based self-care advice in a timely manner, and mediate the role of nurses to effectively provide real-time patient support. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years and have a diagnosis of one of three haematological cancers (Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia), and are receiving four or more cycles of chemotherapy treatment. Trial details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups. Participants in one group will be required to complete a symptoms questionnaire twice daily on a device (morning and afternoon) from Cycle 1 - Cycle 4 of their chemotherapy treatment. The intervention nurse monitors symptoms and responds if any alerts are triggered. A red alert occurs if a patient reports a symptom requiring urgent attention, and an amber alert occurs if a patient reports a symptom requiring non-urgent attention. In the case of an alert, the nurse will contact the patient by phone and query the symptom, provide self-care advice and support. The device is a mobile phone enabled Android tablet. The handset contains an application that prompts patients to complete a side-effect assessment questionnaire by following instructions on the touch screen tablet. Normal phone functions are disabled. All patients will be provided with the android tablet device and SIM card for the trial. Participants in the second study group will continue to receive usual care, which involves the regular appointments with their medical treatment team, provision of hospital contact details and education about chemotherapy prior to first cycle.</summary>
