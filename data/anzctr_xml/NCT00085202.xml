Experimental: Stratum 1 (high-risk group) - Patients undergo craniospinal radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Six weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) and filgrastim (G-CSF) with post-transplantation vincristine. High-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT repeat every 4 weeks for 3 additional courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in ERBB2-Negative Tumors Compared to ERBB2-Positive Tumors - The relationship between ERBB2 protein expression in tumors and progression-free survival was assessed in 122 participants with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma and with ERBB2 protein assessments. If the ERBB2 value was greater than zero, the ERBB2 was defined as positive for the participant. If the ERBB2 value was zero, the ERBB2 was defined as negative. Progression-free survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression/relapse, the date of death, or the date of last contact. The log-rank test was used to compare the PFS distributions of ERBB2 groups.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Compared Between ERBB2 Assessment and Risk Group. - 122 participants with a diagnosis of medulloblastoma were grouped by ERBB2 positive/negative assessment and risk group into 4 groups. Progression-free survival was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression/relapse, the date of death, or the date of last contact. The log-rank test was used to compare the PFS distributions of ERBB2 groups.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of Mutations Associated With SHH and WNT Tumors - To estimate the frequency of mutations associated with SHH and WNT tumors via targeted sequencing.
This outcome was initially expected to be completed by September 2014. Technologic advancements have improved sequencing on formalin fixed paraffin embedded material using smaller quantities of nucleic acids. However, given that this technology is new, we had to thoroughly evaluate it on samples with abundant material first so as not to use up precious patient samples that are available in small quantities. The project has been delayed since extra time and care has gone into evaluating this technology to ensure that the data yield is accurate. We are now proceeding with a methodology that meets our quality controls.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reading Decoding Composite Scores in the Intervention and Standard of Care Groups - To compare the effects of a computer-based training system specifically targeting language, reading, and learning skills (Fast ForWord, Scientific Learning Corporation) with the current standard of care on reading decoding skills as measured by individual academic testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements will be made at time of randomization, at 3 months from initiation of treatment, and yearly thereafter for 10 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Number of Average Risk Patients Whose Treatment Failure Included the Posterior Fossa - To monitor for treatment failure in the posterior fossa of patients whose tumor bed receives a reduced volume of radiation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining radiation therapy with
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Autologous stem cell transplant may be able to
      replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. It is
      not yet known which radiation therapy regimen combined with chemotherapy and donor stem cell
      transplant is more effective in treating medulloblastoma, supratentorial primitive
      neuroectodermal tumor, or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.

      This phase III trial is studying two different regimens of radiation therapy when given
      together with chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant to see how well they work in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma, supratentorial primitive
      neuroectodermal tumor, or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To assess the relationship between ERBB2 protein expression in tumors and
           progression-free survival probability for patients with medulloblastoma.

        -  To estimate the frequency of mutations associated with SHH and WNT tumors (as defined by
           gene expression profiling) via targeted sequencing performed in an independent cohort of
           WNT and SHH tumors (also defined by gene expression profiling).</summary>
