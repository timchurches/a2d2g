  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups for the 12 months of the intervention.  The first group is placed on the CSIRO Total Well Being Diet (high protein, moderate carbs) with no option to change to an alternative regimen.  The second group has the option to choose from the CSIRO Diet, the South Beach Diet (high protein, low carbs) or a Mediterranean-style diet (rich in olive oil, fish and fruit and veg) and also to change between these three regimens during the intervention.  Adherence to the regimen is not measured other than through changes in body weight, HbA1c, lipids and so on. Food records are not kept by participants, nor are urine samples required.  All participants, regardless of group, are monitored fortnightly at the clinic for weight loss/gain on an individual basis in the first 3 months and then every six weeks for the remainder of the study.  The six-weekly visits also incorporate attendance with other study participants in small researcher-led group sessions. Blood tests are performed at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research project aims to show by offering a choice of three different weight loss diets plus the ability to change diet styles throughout the study participants are more likely to remain in the study and more likely to achieve the study goals of a 10% weight loss at 12 months compared with those having usual clinical care.</summary>
