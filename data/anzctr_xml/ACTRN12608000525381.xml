  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) Eligable Hepatitis Cpatients patients who are  going to be treated with interferon-alpha +/- ribavarin will be observed for changes before and 6 weeks into treatment for changes in recognition of facial expressions, mood, anxiety and anger scales and psychiatric diagnosis. The combined duration of these assessments is approximately 2 hours. In addition a healthy control group will also be observed using the same measures.
2) The duration of the trial is roughly 7 weeks - one assessment one week prior to interferon treatment and one six weeks into treatment. In addition for the duration of interferon treatment (usually six to twelve months) patients will be reassessed for psychiatric diagnosis if the treating team feel there has been the possibility of an emerging psychiatric illness.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in thresholds of recognition of different facial expressions. Proceedure:
For the emotion discrimination task, morphed stimuli continua were created that changed from a neutral face to a full exemplar emotional expression. These sequences were generated from a database of films of actors performing facial expressions in front of a Dalsa DS-25-02M30 colour camera (Benton et al., 2007). The camera captured high definition frames (1920 x 1080 pixels) at 25 Hz. We created six such continua using one male and one female actor, for the expressions of happiness, sadness, and anger.

For each continuum (male and female of happy, sad, and angry) we selected 28 frames (i.e., just over one second) from the video footage that covered the development of each emotional expression from neutral to the full exemplar. We selected 10 key frames from these 28 (i.e., every third frame) which were delineated by marking 172 feature points on easily identifiable facial features (e.g., corner of eyes, outline of lips etc.) using Psychomorph software (Tiddeman, Burt, &amp; Perrett, 2001). The shape information from these delineations was used to create morph sequences of 18 images between each key frame using established techniques (Rowland &amp; Perrett, 1995; Tiddeman, Burt, &amp; Perrett, 2001). This generated a sequence of 172 images that closely follows the actual development of the expression and avoids morph-induced artifacts that may occur when creating morphs between a neutral and a full exemplar emotional expression without considering the time course of expression development.
 
Each threshold therefore represents a point along a 172 image sequence; the sequence contains a facial expression developing between neutral and the full exemplar emotional expression over a period of 1.12 seconds. There is no particular expectation that, within the 1.12 second window, expression onset or offset occurs at the same time for all actors and their expressions. There is also no expectation that the different expressions should develop at the same rate. In the present task it is therefore meaningless to, for example, directly compare the thresholds obtained for different expressions.

Images were greyscaled, and the edges were blurred to display mean luminance (using Gaussian blur of standard deviation 10 pixels) so that no hard image edges would be present when the images were displayed on the mean luminance background.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hepatitis C is a condition that if often treated successfully with interferon. However, interferon treatment is known to cause mood problems, including high rates of depression. One possible reason for this is that interferon is thought to affect the brains serotonin system, which governs mood and other emotional tasks such as recognising facial expressions. To date nobody has studied how the brain functioning of this system changes during interferon treatment. Discovering how interferon causes depression will help us to provide more effective treatment, or prevention, of this for future patients undergoing interferon treatment. It may also help us discover what is happening to the brain in other forms of depression.

The purpose of this study is to measure how the recognition of facial expressions changes with interferon treatment and whether this varies with the levels of tryptophan in your blood (tryptophan is a chemical that the body uses to make serotonin). This will give us a measure of how the brains serotonin system changes during interferon treatment and whether this can be linked to the development of depression. This will be done by a computer program which shows pictures of different facial expressions and asks you to decide what emotion they are displaying.
Patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon will demonstrate measurable changes in facial expression processing. Specifically, there will be a change towards that seen in acute tryptophan depletion and depressive episodes; a decreased ability to detect happy faces and an increased ability to detect sad faces. Secondary hypotheses are: the ability to detect angry faces will increase with interferon treatment and will correlate with the irritability measures; the changes in emotional processing will be accompanied with changes in mood and anxiety, and a measurable decrease in the tryptophan/large neutral amino-acid ratio, rather than an increase in the kynurenine/kynurenic acid ratio. We also predict that those already showing depression-like processing of facial expressions and/or those with lower tryptophan/large neutral amino-acid ratios will be more likely to become depressed during the course of treatment.</summary>
