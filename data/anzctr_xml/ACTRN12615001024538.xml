  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten session, manualised communication skills program (TBIconneCT) involving education and video-based feedback to identify and develop use of positive conversation skills by the person with TBI and positive support skills by the communication partner (family member, friend, carer). Participants allocated to the telehealth group will receive all training sessions via Skype video sessions. Sessions are 1.5 hour duration and conducted weekly over ten weeks. Sessions are conducted by a speech pathologist. Intervention adherence will be monitored via a log of completed sessions, and an audit of a sample of sessions to check adherence to a checklist of intervention components.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants within the Sydney metropolitan area will be allocated to either the Skype or in-person intervention at a ratio of 1:3. After completing initial assessments with the participant, the researcher will open a sealed opaque envelopes to determine the intervention.

Participants outside the Sydney metropolitan area will be allocated directly to the Skype intervention. As this arm of the study is non-randomised, allocation is not concealed.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>sample size calculations indicate that a minimum of 16 participants with TBI in each condition are required for detecting a difference between the groups using an alpha level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80% on the primary outcome measure of Measure of Support in Conversation: Reveal Competence within a casual conversation. The sample size will therefore be set at 36 (n=18 in each group) to allow for 10% attrition during the study. 36 communication partners for these participants will also be recruited.

Initial analyses will involve repeated measures mixed ANOVAs using the outcomes of the two treatment groups and the historical control group, using the primary outcome measure, secondary outcome measures and process measures. Repeated measures mixed ANOVAs comparing post-treatment and 3 month follow-up scores will provide information about the maintenance of treatment effects. Intention to treat analyses will be used.</statisticalmethods>
