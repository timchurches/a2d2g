  <interventions>
    <interventions>People with bowel cancer and their first degree relatives will be allocated to an intervention or minimal ethical care group. Those in the intervention group will be posted a detailed information booklet about screening tests recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).  A corresponding information booklet will also be mailed to their General Practitioner (GP) and for index cases only, cancer surgeon. This tailored advice on screening will be provided to participants and their clinicians within 4 weeks of recruitment, and 12 and 24 months later.</interventions>
    <comparator>Those allocated to the minimal ethical care group will each receive one standard pamphlet about bowel cancer within four weeks of recruitment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to improve adherence to guideline recommendations for surveillance for people with colorectal cancer and screening of their first degree relatives using an educational intervention. People with colorectal cancer and their first degree relatives will be randomly assigned to receive tailored educational materials on screeening (intervention group) or standard pamphlets (minimal ethical care group). It is expected that those in the intervention group will have 10%, 12% and 15% higher levels of adherence to screening/surveillance recommendations at 1, 2, and 3 years post recruitment respectively, when compared with those in the minimal ethical care group.</summary>
