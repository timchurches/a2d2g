  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The typical delirium study between 1989 and 2005 compared delirium management in a specialty
      unit such as geriatric medicine with delirium management in general medicine (in most cases
      the research diagnosis of delirium was not communicated to the general medicine group). This
      study will provide open diagnosis of delirium by the CAM to both the geriatric medicine and
      general medicine groups (medical staff, patients, families) plus daily monitoring of delirium
      using digit span and delirium index which is reported to both patient groups. It will also
      compare confusion assessment method (CAM)to a novel diagnostic system of Paul Regal with
      respect to hard endpoints (survival and return home). Hypotheses: 1) General medicine can
      manage delirium as well as geriatric medicine when delirium is openly diagnosed and monitored
      daily (even in speciality units it is rare to find daily measurement of tools such as
      delirium index); 2) The Regal diagnostic system will be superior to the CAM in predicting
      hard endpoints (survival and return home rate for patients living in the community).</summary>
