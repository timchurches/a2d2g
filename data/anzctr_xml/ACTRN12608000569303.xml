  <interventions>
    <interventions>Placement of single endosseous wide diameter titanium oral implants in the fresh extraction sockets or early healed sockets (3-5 weeks) in the molar region to support single implant crowns for 5 years. 
Surgical technique: Atraumatic extraction, sectioning of the molars and removal of each root individually. Sockets will be prepared with standard drills and tapered osteotomes to prepare the interradicular bone.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placement of single endosseous wide diameter titanium oral implants after complete bone healing (at least 4 months post-extraction) in the molar region.
Same type of implants will be used in both test and control groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the success rates of single wide-diameter implants placed at different times following extraction of molar teeth. 
The success criteria of Zarb and Albrektsson (1998) and prosthodontic success criteria of Walton (1998) will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After implant placement and then annually for up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the crestal bone level using standardised radiographs (Payne et al 1999) and peri-implant microbiota through collecting plaque samples for detection and quantification of microbial pathogens by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After implant placement and then annually for up to 5 years</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: To evaluate the clinical outcomes, peri-implant parameters, microbial environment and success rates of three different placement times of single wide implants for replacing molar teeth. 
Materials and mehtods:
Wide diameter implants will be placed at different times following extraction of a single molar tooth in either mandibular or maxillary arches. A total of 39 participants will be randomly allocated to three equal sized groups (13 per group), a control and one of the test groups as follows: 
Control group: Implants placed after complete bone healing 
Test group 1: Implants immediately place after extraction 
Test group II: Implants placed after an early osseous healing time (3-5 weeks).</summary>
