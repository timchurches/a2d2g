    <interventions>This RCT aims to compare, in people with depression or anxiety or both, the efficacy of an internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) with one of five levels of support plus usual care, to usual care alone to establish the superiority over usual care alone and to calculate the cost effectiveness of each level of support. 

The iCBT program for depression and anxiety consists of six online lessons representing best practice CBT, as well as regular homework assignments and access to supplementary resources delivered over the course of 10 weeks. Each lesson was designed using a cartoon narrative and included: psycho-education, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, graded exposure, problem solving, assertiveness skills, and relapse prevention. 

The present study is the first to compare the efficacy and adherence of iCBT for anxiety and depression (6 lessons + homework + automated reminders) with one of five levels of support plus usual care, compared with usual care alone. The six groups are:

1.  Self-help only, no personal reminders or contact to these participants 
2. Technician contact upon request, participants are able to contact a technician with a query and the technician will possess a script of how to respond to these queries (a lesson by lesson script)
3. Scheduled technician contact after each lesson (6 contacts in total), enquiring how the participant found the lesson and if they have any questions
4. Clinician contact upon request, participants are able to contact a clinician with a query  
5. Scheduled clinician contact after each lesson, (6 contacts in total)  
6. Usual care control group, after completing three sets of questionnaires, these participants will assess the iCBT program unsupervised (for no cost to the participant) via a secure website

Technician = health worker 
Clinician = Mental health clinician
Usual Care = permission to access GP, use medications and other psychological help for anxiety and depression as desired. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU) - usual access of GP services, medications, and/or other psychological help for anxiety and depression as desired. 

All participants randomised to the control group (TAU) will receive usual care with their GP or health practitioner. Over the 24-week waiting period, participants will be required to complete 3 sets of online questionnaires, which enquire about their mental health (e.g. anxiety, depression, days out of role etc.). At conclusion of the 24-week waiting period, participants will be offered access to the iCBT Mixed Anxiety and Depression Program via a secure website.

The TAUl group, after completing three sets of questionnaires, will receive the iCBT program unsupervised (for no cost to the participant) via a secure website. They will receive the same level of support as the self-help group (i.e. self-help only, no personal reminders or contact to these participants).  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A pre-to-post-treatment improvement of effect size (ES)&gt;1.0 is expected for the intervention groups on the co-primary measures (PHQ-9; GAD-7). These groups are also expected to improve more than the waitlist control group by an ES of 0.6. Sample size is powered to have an 80% chance of detecting 0.6SD differences at p&lt;.05. 

All analyses will be undertaken using intention to treat linear mixed model analyses. Relationships between observations at different occasions will be modelled with the appropriate covariance matrix. Planned contrasts will be used to compare changes between pre-treatment and post-treatment, and 3-month follow-ups. Planned pairwise comparisons will be used to compare between-groups at post-treatment, and follow-up and effect sizes will be calculated (Hedges g) to measure the size of the between-groups difference on primary and secondary outcome measures. 

Cost Effectiveness: The cost of each staff intervention (salary cost by duration of intervention) will be recorded and the mean cost per group calculated. The mean health gain in each group will be calculated from the cumulative effect size change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 transformed into DALYs using the Sanderson and Andrews formula. The Cost effectiveness is the ratio between cost and health gain in each group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Major depressive disorder ranks second amongst the most important causes of disability in Australia. Anxiety disorders also rank in the top ten causes of disability. One problem is that the benefits of antidepressant medication, the most widely used remedy for both these disorders, are small and the harms are significant. There is a swing towards the use of psychological treatments, of which cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the best researched. However CBT has many out of pocket costs (average &gt;$60 per visit), quality is not assured, and therapy is not widely available outside major city centres. Internet delivered automated cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) on the other hand, produces the same benefit and freedom from harms as face to face CBT, but has advantages of low cost, high fidelity and wide distribution at levels comparable to medication.

In iCBT studies, however, adherence varies markedly according to the amount of encouragement or clinical guidance provided. In our research, adherence varied from 33% for a group who received no support, to 68% for those who received automated reminders, to 81% for the group who received telephone reminders from a technician. A later comparison of technician reminders with coaching by a clinician showed no difference in adherence or efficacy. The two levels of support were therefore comparable but the costs to the health system were not.

The primary purpose of this trial is to examine the efficacy and adherence of iCBT for anxiety and depression (6 lessons + homework + automated reminders) across five varying levels of support plus usual care, compared with usual care alone. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to one of six groups with varying levels of support: 1) Self-help only; 2) Technician contact upon request; 3) Scheduled technician contact after each lesson; 4) Clinician contact upon request; 5) Scheduled clinician contact after each lesson; or 6) Treatment as usual (TAU) control group.

The main hypotheses to be tested are:

1. iCBT at all 5 levels of support will significantly reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, distress and disability compared to a TAU control group. 
2. The efficacy will be related to the frequency of support.
3. The adherence rate will be related to frequency of support.
4. The most cost effective (staff cost per unit of health gain) will be technician support on request.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide further information regarding (1) the adherence rates and treatment effects that are associated with various levels of clinician or technician support, (2) the cost effectiveness that is characteristic of each level of intervention, (3) whether certain levels of intervention are not sufficiently effective to be attractive to a health service, and (4) whether there are levels of intervention that are not sufficiently more cost effective than a lower cost intervention to be attractive to a health service.
