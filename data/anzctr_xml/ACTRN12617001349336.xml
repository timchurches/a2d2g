    <interventions>Intervention capsule (High omega-3 oil blend)
Capsules of DHA enriched fish oil based high concentrated omega-3-acid oil formulation based on PronovaPure 150:500 EE EU. Each capsule contains 467 mg of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (169 mg of EPA and 298 mg of DHA ethyl esters).
- each participant will be randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group
- participants will be asked to consume 2 oral capsules (1000mg per capsule, 2000mg total/day) per day for 4 weeks
Women will be asked to return unused supplements at the end of the study. The proportion of capsules returned will serve as a measure of adherence. Blood omega-3 concentrations at the end of intervention will be used as an independent biomarker of adherence.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Separate per-protocol analyses will be conducted which only include women who consume at least 80% of their study capsules. Differences in the omega-3 LCPUFA content between the omega-3 LCPUFA and Control groups at the end of the intervention period will be compared by non-parametric and parametric tests as appropriate. The relative increase in omega-3 LCPUFA, as well as the pattern of omega-3 LCPUFA concentrations across this period will also be compared between groups using general linear models with repeated measures.  A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered as the level of statistical significance in all analyses. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are known to play a critical role in both maternal health and infant development, and have a particularly important role in protection against preterm delivery and in ensuring the optimal development of the brain and visual system of the fetus and infant (Makrides &amp; Gibson, Med J Aust, 2002; Demmelmair &amp; Koletzko, World Rev Nutr Dietet, 2015). Achieving and maintaining an adequate supply of these fatty acids during pregnancy and breastfeeding is therefore of vital importance for both short and long term health outcomes of the infant. Recent studies have suggested that many women of childbearing age in many countries, including Australia and the US, fail to meet the recommended levels of intake of these fatty acids, and as a result have a low omega-3 status (Meyer, Nutrients, 2016). Therefore, there is a concern that a significant proportion of women have an insufficient omega-3 status during pregnancy and while breastfeeding in order to meet the needs of their infant. In addition, fish consumption in the majority of these countries also remains low, and therefore these women rely predominately on omega-3 supplements in order to increase their omega-3 status. It is also known, however, that the bioavailability of different supplements into human blood and breast milk can vary significantly according to the formulation and form in which the fatty acids are provided. This is particularly important in the case of women who are breastfeeding, since the uptake of supplements into breast milk depends on both the efficiency of uptake into the maternal circulation, and the transfer of these fatty acids to the breast milk. As such, it is vital to directly test the ability of supplements provided to lactating women to be taken up into the breast milk.
The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of supplementing breastfeeding women with the Pronovum formulation PRF-037 (150:500 Ethyl Ester in SMEDDS) on concentrations of DHA and EPA in breast milk after 4 weeks of supplementation.</summary>
