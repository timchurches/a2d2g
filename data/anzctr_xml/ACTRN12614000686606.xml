  <interventions>
    <interventions>The self-paced tablet app is largely based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. It consists of several modules designed to help individuals become more aware of their unhelpful thoughts and behaviours and helps then identify guiding principles for their life. The time it takes to complete each module will differ for each person and is dependent on individual needs. Participants are given 6 weeks to complete the modules at their own pace. The app provides users with tools and strategies to better manage their emotions and helps them to set goals in order to move their life in valued directions. The app collects data on overall usage and time spent in each module. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate whether a self-help interactive program delivered via tablet devices can help Indigenous youth to reduce their suicidal ideation. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which includes therapeutic activities grounded in acceptance and commitment therapy or a wait list control group. We predict those using the intervention program for 6 weeks will report reduced suicidal ideation, a reduction of reported suicide plans, and lower symptoms of depression, anxiety, hopelessness and impulsivity. </summary>
