  <interventions>
    <interventions>All people admitted to participating palliative care units will be asked to provide access to their case notes for collection of admission data. This data will include information about their symptoms on admission, any medications they are taking at the time of admission, and any investigations undetaken, this will all be collected from the admission case notes. An assessment of possible adverse drug reactions will be made based on this data. All people admitted to participating palliative care services over the 3 month study period will be asked to participate. A single set of data will be collected.

In addition, a subset of patients will be asked to participate in an interview to ask further questions about their symptoms, the impact of these symtpoms, medications being taken, any problems or side effects experienced, and their beliefs about medicines. These participants will be asked to allow a single interview, weekly completion of a simple prompt diary each week, and telephone calls each week until end February 2010.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the prevalence, clinical characteristics and avoidability of advere drug reactions (ADR)-related referrals to palliative care services and ADRs that occur in a cohort of palliative patients longitudinally.
The Naranjo scale will be used to assess probability of an ADR.
Causality and classification will be assessed using the Scale by Edwards and Aronson (Lancet 2000).
Severity of the ADR will be assessed using the World Health Organisation Adverse Reaction Terminology (WHO-ART).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a need to quantify the extent and severity of adverse drug reactions in palliative care to inform intervention strategies to reduce the burden of harm and pharmacovigilance as new drug therapies are introduced for the management of symptoms at end of life. This study will review the case notes of all patients admitted to participating palliative care units over a 3 month period, and then to seek permission to interview 30 participants from each site for symptoms, the burden of the symptoms, medications and health service use from the time of admission until death or end of study in February 2010.
1. To analyse the contribution of adverse drug reactions  to referrals to Palliative Care Services 
2. To determine the nature and frequency of adverse drug reactions in patients referred to palliative care services 
3. To explore the relationship between adverse drug reactions and common symptoms experienced in palliative care
4. To undertake patient interview to determine their experience of adverse drug reactions and their perception of the impact of adverse drug reactions. To describe the resource utilisation of those patients in the subset of patients interviewed with the symptoms and index medicines of interest who experience an adverse drug reaction.</summary>
