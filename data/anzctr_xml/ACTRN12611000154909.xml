  <interventions>
    <interventions>Measuring liver stiffness in kilopascals using transient elastography (FibroScan) in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients and comparing them to healthy controls.
Each FibroScan measurement will only take 5 minutes for 10 successful acquisitions.  This will only be done once. If the patient has an abnormally high reading e.g &gt;8 this will be repeated in 3 months to verify the reading.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Liver stiffness measured in kilopascals using transient elastography in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and age matched healthy control patients. Transient elastography will be assessed using the FibroScan machine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary outcome will be measured at recruitment (time=0). This is a crosssectional prevalence study thus patients will not have a second follow up reading unless the first is very abnormal.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hepatobiliary disease is a common manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Usually this is apparent by the development of abnormal liver function tests (LFT).  In the majority of cases deranged liver tests are transient, can be related to the activity of the inflammatory bowel disease and have no clinical sequalae.  However, There are several other causes for deranged LFTs in IBD which may lead to permanent scarring of the liver. A scarred or fibrotic liver often may not declare itself by abnormal liver tests and transient elastography (TE) is a non invasive method of measuring liver stiffness now used widely in research and clinical practice.  In the field of hepatitis C, it is largely replacing the need for a liver biopsy to exclude advance fibrosis and cirrhosis. In this project we seek to find out the prevalence of liver injury in IBD patients by measuring liver stiffness using an operator independent machine called FibroScan (RT).</summary>
