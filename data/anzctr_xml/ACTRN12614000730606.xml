    <studytitle>The effect of lower limb fibreglass cast on the efficacy of the Impulse Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) device on lower limb venous haemodynamics in healthy subjects</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Randomised controlled trial of 24 healthy participants aged between 18 and 65 years, randomised to have one foot placed in an  intermittent pneumatic compression device with a lower limb fibreglass cast placed over it, and the other foot placed in an intermittent pneumatic compression device alone, to compare venous haemodynamic effects of the fibreglass cast on the performance of the intermittent pneumatic compression device by measuring venous flow in the popliteal vein of both legs.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>An Intermittent Pneumatic Compression System (IPCS), VENA PRESS System with foot garment. (Website photos and description of features: http://priushcs.com/?page_id=159) will be placed on both feet of healthy volunteers. This is a system that is used regularly for DVT prophylaxis in high risk and immobile patients post-surgery.

The subjects' feet will be placed in a foot compression garment (a cuff) that will be attached by tube assembly to a pump unit. When the pump unit is turned on, a distal aircell within the foot cuff will inflate rapidly to approximately 130mmHg +/-10% and will then settle to 52mmHg, and a proximal aircell follows approximately 0.3 seconds after, to settle at approximately 48mmHg. After 6 seconds of compression at 48-53mmHg, the cuffs deflate. The cycle repeats every minute

Volunteers will then be randomised to have either their left or right foot (and the compression garment) placed within a below knee fibreglass cast, as would normally be placed if someone suffered a fractured ankle or an Achilles tendon rupture.


Ultrasound (USS) measurements of bilateral popliteal vein blood flow will be done to compare the performance of the IPC device within a fibreglass cast to the performnace outside of a fibreglass cast. Measurements will be done at the following times (All USS measures will be done on the left leg first, regardless of which is randomised to the cast, and will be undertaken twice for each measure  the mean of both measures will be used for statistical analysis).
- Baseline (Time 0)
- 40 minutes: prior to starting the IPC device
- 60 minutes: after the IPC device has been running for 10 minutes continuously

After obtaining the final measure at 60 minutes, the study will be deemed to have been completed. At the end of the study the cast and IPC devices will be removed.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on a paired SD for peak systolic velocity of 6.8 cm/s with an IPC (outside of a fiberglass cast) used in a previous haemodynamic study, a sample size of 24 has 90% power with an alpha of 5% to detect a paired difference of 4.8 cm/s in peak systolic velocity. (The mean peak systolic velocity in the seated position after 20 minutes from previous studies was 5.3 cm/s, increasing to 20.1 cm/s with an IPC device, representing a 3.8-fold increase from baseline).

Paired t-tests will compare the outcome variables (the mean of two readings) for the casted limb versus the non-casted limb, at each time point separately, and also for the change from baseline. A mixed linear model will be used to estimate the overall difference between the two interventions, the effect of time, and whether there was an interaction between the interventions and the effect of time.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a device called an Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (IPC) device, that may be used to improve blood flow in the legs of patients when they have had operations or been admitted to hospital. IPCs have been shown to reduce the risk of developing blood clots in the legs (Deep Vein Thrombosis  DVT) and the lungs (Pulmonary Embolism  PE) due to long periods of immobility. They work by placing an inflatable cuff on the patients calf or foot, which is then inflated several times a minute while the patient is immobilized. The inflated cuff squeezes the veins in the sole of the foot and the calf, reducing pooling of blood in the leg, and thus reducing the risk of blood clots forming in the veins.

We want to see whether the fibreglass cast impairs the performance of the IPC underneath it. 

To figure this out, we want to measure the return of blood from the legs in study participants who have an IPC device on both feet, and who then have one leg placed in a fibreglass cast. </summary>
