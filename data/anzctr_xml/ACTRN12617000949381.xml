  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will utilise a portable ventilator (Philips Trilogy 100) that delivers mouth piece ventilation (MPV) to support their inspiratory effort once extubated. This device provides inspiratory support via a mouthpiece or straw when participant is awake and alert and wishing to expand their lungs.  The device will be set up and intervention carried out with a Senior Physiotherapist with greater than 10 years experience. All patients admitted with cervical spinal cord injury, requiring intubation and being cared for in ICU will be approached for inclusion. This feasibility study will only be conducted at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane. Participants will utilise this MPV device prophylactically from the time they are extubated through to when the participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation or dies. The participant will determine how much they utilise the MPV device to relieve any breathlessness, assist with clearing airway secretions or relieving mild fatigue. The amount of time they utilise the device will be recorded on a data memory card within the device. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant use of MPV

This will be recorded by the data memory card of the MPV device detailing the amount of time and amount of breaths the participant utilised the device. The amount of time for set-up of the device at extubation will also be noted from the memory card. </outcome>
      <timepoint>From extubation until participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation, dies or withdraws from the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant feedback 

Feedback with regard to the use, comfort and settings will be gathered from the participant on a daily basis.  A semi-structured interview with regard to their use of the MPV device during their ICU stay will also be carried out.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ongoing daily from extubation until participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation, dies or withdraws from the study. Once the participant is discharged from ICU they will be approached for any further feedback in a semi-structured interview with regard to their use of the MPV device during their ICU stay.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinician feedback

Feedback from all clinicians that actively work with a patient utilising MPV as part of the study will be gathered.  This will be in regard to their feedback on perceived appropriateness and positive/negative effects of MPV for the patient participant in their care. This will be carried out in a semi-structured interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ongoing daily from extubation until patient participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation, dies or withdraws from the study. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICU length of stay

This will be recorded as the total length of stay in intensive care for the patient participant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient participant discharge from ICU</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sustained phonation time with/without MPV (composite outcome)

This measure is the taken as the length of time for which a participant can sustain the sound of "aaahhhh" made after taking a deep breath in and maintaining the sound at even pitch and volume. The participant will complete this with own effort breath after extubation and then when own inspiratory effort supplemented with a MPV breath.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This measure will be recorded daily until participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation, dies or withdraws from the study. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of pneumonia

Pneumonia is defined as new chest xray infiltrates with at least two of: temp &gt;38 Â°C, shortness of breath, cough and purulent sputum, altered respiratory auscultation and white cell count &gt;14,000/ml or leukopenia &lt;3000/ml.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>This measure will be recorded daily from the point of immediate pre-extubation and then daily until participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation, dies or withdraws from the study. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forced vital capacity (FVC)

This measure will be collected using a Wright spirometer which measures lung volume through a mouthpiece or endotracheal tube connector.  The highest recording will be taken after up to 5 attempts. This outcome will be collected by a Senior Physiotherapist with greater than 10 years experience.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This measure will be recorded daily from the point of immediate pre-extubation and then daily until participant is either discharged from ICU, requires re-intubation, dies or withdraws from the study. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To explore the feasibility of mouthpiece ventilation (MPV) use in the intensive care environment for patients who are extubated after suffering a cervical spinal cord injury and the barriers and enablers from a practice perspective.
 
Significance: Respiratory failure and the need for re-intubation for those suffering acute tetraplegia is a known risk which extends ICU stay and costs, delays rehabilitation and increases stress for patients and their families.
This is the first time that early application of MPV combined with standard conventional treatment in patients with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) has been evaluated.  This team will lead the way by taking the first steps towards determining if MPV can be utilised to deliver post extubation breathing support. The findings from this study will form the foundations to determining if MPV can impact on outcomes such at extubation success, need for re-intubation and ICU length of stay (LOS).
   	
Outcomes: This study will provide much needed pilot data about a MPV intervention for catastrophic injury populations. More importantly, this study will inform of relevant factors that will likely lead to effective translation of this intervention into routine clinical practice, including the resources and education. Data from this pilot study will inform a larger study to determine the effectiveness of MPV and the health and economic benefits for individuals and the health care system.  The internal and external connections established with the clinical advisory group during this study will support collaboration for a larger future trial.
