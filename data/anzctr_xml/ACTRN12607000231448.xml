  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is known that transition from paediatric to adult care in Type 1 dibetes mellitus is often difficult. Young people are anxious about leaving a familiar service. In adult health care they are 'diluted' where Type 2 diabetes mellitus predominates. Australian figures suggest that up to 50% of young adults with Type 1 diabetes are not in specialist care. Failure to engage with specialist care means poor diabetes care and control, and the risk of medium and long term poor health outcomes. We hypothesise that a comprehensive transition program involving communication, mentoring and health professional support will improvement engagement with adult health care better than current clinic practice.This study aims to determine what resources and support are needed to ensure that successful transition occurs. The literature suggest that it is not enough that young people arrive at their first appointment to an adult service; they need to stay engaged and hence the reason for the longer term nature of the study, following young people for up to 18 months after discharge from paediatric servcies</summary>
