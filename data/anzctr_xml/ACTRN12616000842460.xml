    <interventions>Interventional Procedure (Arm 1): Snare-WithIn-The-scope-CHannel (SWITCH) Cold Snare Polypectomy

In this arm, all polyps encountered during colonoscopy will be removed by SWITCH cold polypectomy technique. This involved advancement of the snare which is already in the scope channel, transecting the polyp (i.e. polypectomy), then partially withdrawing the snare into the channel (without removing the snare from the scope channel) prior to suctioning the polyp for retrieval. All further polyps encountered in the same patient will be removed by the same technique. 

All procedures will be performed by 2 consultant gastroenterologists with expertise in therapeutic colonoscopy. The procedure duration is similar to any standard colonoscopy and is allocated half an hour slot in the weekday elective endoscopy list. Duration can vary depending on number of polyps encountered. </interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator/Control Procedure (Arm 2): Conventional Cold Snare Polypectomy

In this arm, all polyps encountered during colonoscopy will be removed by conventional cold snare polypectomy. This involves insertion of snare into the scope channel, transecting the polyp (i.e. polypectomy), then removing the snare out of the scope channel prior to suctioning the polyp for retrieval. All further polyps encountered in the same patient will be removed by the same technique.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>- Mean total polypectomy time per patient

The total polypectomy time is defined as the total time from a polyp has been detected detected by the endoscopist until the polyp has been transected, then has been suctioned and has reached the trap (i.e. from polyp detection until polyp reaching the trap) , as measured by the research assistant with a stop watch. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>- Mean total procedure time per patient.

Total procedure time is defined by the time from when the procedure starts (i.e. scope tip inserted into the anus of the patient) until the procedure has finished (i.e. scope tip has been withdrawn from anus of the patient).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From scope insertion into the anus of the patient (i.e. start of the procedure) until scope withdrawn out of the anus of the patient (i.e. end of the procedure). </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the efficiency of two common procedures for the removal of colorectal polyps. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if:
- You are aged 18 years or above, 
- Are undergoing elective colonoscopy, 
- And have at least one colorectal polyp of size 9mm or less. 

Study details: 
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. 

Participants in one group will undergo conventional cold snare polypectomy. This involves inserting the polyp removal device (i.e. the snare) into the colonoscope channel for removing your polyp. Then removing the snare out of the colonoscope channel prior to retrieving your polyp. 

Participants in the other group will undergo snare-within-the-scope-channel (SWITCH) cold snare polypectomy. This involves leaving the polyp removal device (i.e. the snare) in the scope channel prior to and after removing your polyp, and during retrieval of your polyp. 

Participants will not know which group they are in until after the study is completed. Procedure time will be measured in all participants and compared across groups. This will enable us to determine which of the two procedures is more efficient.
