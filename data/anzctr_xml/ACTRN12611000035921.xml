  <interventions>
    <interventions>A simple one off administration of a drug cocktail (fluconazole 50mg single oral dose, pindolol 15mg single oral dose, para-aminohippurate 440 mg iv over 1 minute ) given simultaneously to measure tubular secretion and reabsorption is both safe and representative of tubular function. GFR will be measured using standard radioisotope (chromium) labelled EDTA clearance. Using these methods, we will compare a normal (normal plasma creatinine, no known medical conditions) older age group (aged &gt;65) with a matched aged group with mild renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min) as well as a younger normal group (20 -40 yrs). A more accurate estimate of the contribution of renal tubular function for drug handling will allow safer drug prescribing especially in the elderly patients. Participants will be recruited over a 6 month period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In clinical practice it is assumed that changes in tubular function parallel changes in GFR. However this may be incorrect. 
As most drugs are organic acids, renal tubular handling may play a critical role in the elimination of drugs. 
Clearance of these drugs will be determined by analysis of area under receiver operated curves (ROC) and correlated to the GFR clearances.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples wlll be collected at time 0, and 1hr,2hr,4hr,6hr, 24hr post drug administration and timed urine samples (0-3hr, 3-6hr, 6-24hr) will be collected for each participant. The samples will be stored and analysed as a single batch at the completion of the study.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The kidney plays a major role in the handling of most drugs by several mechanisms including filtration and tubular secretion / reabsorption. With renal impairment, modification of drug doses is required.  In clinical practise, changes in renal function are estimated according to the creatinine clearance (CrCl) (estimate of glomerular filtration rate [GFR]). The formulae used, include age as a variable that assumes that renal function declines with age alone. It is also assumed that changes in tubular function parallel changes in GFR , but this may not be correct. Given that many drugs are organic acids, tubular secretion / reabsorption are important variables that in the setting of impaired kidney function may significantly alter drug handling. 
Previous studies have shown that a simple drug cocktail given simultaneously to measure tubular secretion and reabsorption is both safe and representative of tubular function in younger subjects. Using this method, we will compare a normal (normal plasma creatinine, no known medical conditions) older age group (aged &gt;65) with a matched aged group with mild renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min) as well as a younger normal group (20 -40 yrs).  A more accurate estimate of the contribution of renal tubular function for drug handling will allow safer drug prescribing especially in the elderly patients.</summary>
