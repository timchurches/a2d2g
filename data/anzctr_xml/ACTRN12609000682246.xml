  <interventions>
    <interventions>The primary objective is the assessment of the safety of O'Neil Long-Acting Naltrexone Implants for the treatment of substance dependence both during and after its treatment effects have diminished. Patients will be treated with naltrexone implants.

Naltrexone implants ("O'Neil Implant") consisting of naltrexone loaded poly [trans- (DL)lactide microspheres compressed into tablets with a poly(DL)lactide coating will be inserted into the lower abdomen through a small (approximately 7mm) incision under local anaesthetic as a one-off procedure at commencement of the 12-month study. Each implants total weight is approximately 3.1 g with a naltrexone drug loading of 60%.  Patient retreatment during the 12-month study is allowed following return to regular heroin use defined as greater than 3 times per month, or in the event of attendance to accident and emergency or hospitalisation for accidental opioid overdose. Persons weighing under 63 kg will be treated by insertion of two, and those over 63kg by insertion of three naltrexone implants.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Several clinical trials have been completed up to publication stage.  Adverse Event reported during these trials are as summarised below:

Vomiting from withdrawal	
Difficulty with erections
Bleeding, swelling and pain around 
implant site	
Diarrhoea
Pain at implant site at times	
Swollen implant site
Headache
Wound oozing	
Redness at implant site	
Wound slightly gaping and bruising	
leg pain	
Acute methadone withdrawal (SAE)	
Wound site infection	
Left side implant tender	
Serous exudation from wound site	
Small purulent pimple at wound site	
Infected implant site	
Mild, intermittent allergy to implant	
Insomnia	
Abdominal Rash	
Discomfort over implant pellets	
Weight loss (although more likely
 result of excessive amphetamine use)
Infection	
Exacerbation of pre-existing depression
Nausea, vomiting from detoxification	

Many of the above events are likely associated with withdrawal effects from opioid detoxification.   

Adverse events will be assessed through self-reporting, patient questionnaires and during routine clinic visits, as well as those recorded in hospital admissions and health service utilisation records obtained from the Western Australian Data Linkage System.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The twelve month primary endpoint will occur at 12 months after implantation. Outcomes are recorded at weeks 1,2,4,8,12,24,39, and 52 post implant.</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.Participation in another clinical drug trial during the last 12 weeks.

2.Women during the lactation period, or pregnant as confirmed by positive urine pregnancy.

3.Severe psychiatric disease, in the opinion of the investigator, which will interfere with the subject's ability to provide research data and informed consent.

4.Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not likely to complete the study for what ever reason.

5.Subjects with any clinically significant abnormality (to be determined by the investigator) following review of screening laboratory data and full physical examination. Stable medical conditions unlikely to affect patient safety or the outcome of the investigation may be acceptable if agreed by the study monitor appointed by the sponsor.

6.Patient lives outside the Perth metropolitan area or cannot provide sufficient contact details to make follow-up over a sustained period successful.
