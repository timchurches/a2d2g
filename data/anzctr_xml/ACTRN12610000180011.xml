  <interventions>
    <interventions>diet modification (by using medium-chain triglyceride oil exclusively when cooking), followed by amniocentesis (performed at GA 16 weeks or later with ultrasound guidance under aseptic precautions) to exclude aneuploidy, followed by thoracocentesis (using a 21 gauge needle to pierce into fetal chest under ultrasound guidance under aspetic precautions), and finally OK-432 pleurodesis (a dosage of 0.1~0.5KE OK-432 per side  was used after thoracocentesis to drain dry the pleural fluids and will be repeated two weeks later if pleural effusions recur, a maximun of three treatments will be adopted).
The duration of amniocentesis itself (we only calculate the duration when the needle is in the amniotic cavity) is less than 30 seconds. The duration of thoracocentesis will be longer since we need to aspirate all the pleural fluids and it usually took less than 3 minutes. The duration of OK-432 pleurodesis is the sum of the duration of thoracocentesis plus the duration of instillating the medication. The time cost in unilateral pleurodesis is usually less than 5 minutes, and thus the duration of bilateral pleurodesis is less than 10 minutes. Gestation ages of the fetuses ranged from GA(gestational age) 16 weeks to 29 weeks.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>responses include poor response, partial response, or total remission

Poor response is defined as progression or no improvement of disease. Partial response is defined as lessening of severity of disease but not complete remission. Total remission means disappearance of pleural effusion.

The main tool used for evalutaion is ultrasound.</outcome>
      <timepoint>two weeks after OK-432 pleurodesis and will be followed fortnightly until end outcome occurs, including livebirths, delivery of dead fetus, or termination of the pregnancy with alive fetus before GA 24 weeks.</timepoint>

    <concealment>fetuses with bilateral pleural effusions are enrolled initially. They were given diet modification first for one week, then those without response would receive amniocentesis; after the karyotype was availabe after one week, those with normal karyotype would receive thoracocentesis; and only those with lymphocyte-rich pleural fluids would enter the treatment group if no spontaneous remission occurred. OK-432 pleurodesis would be performed in the treatment group and the fetuses would be followed up fortnightly.</concealment>
