  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To investigate the 'estrogen-protection' hypothesis by comparing changes in psychotic
      symptoms between one group of patients receiving standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus
      placebo and a second matched group receiving standard antipsychotic drug treatment plus
      100microgram estradiol patch in a double blind controlled trial.

      Hypothesis : That the women receiving adjunctive estradiol will demonstrate a more rapid and
      more substantial decrease in psychotic symptoms over the course of the study than the women
      receiving adjunctive placebo.</summary>
