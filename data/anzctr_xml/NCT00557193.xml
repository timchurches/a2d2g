  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lestaurtinib-related dose limiting toxicity as graded by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) of MLL-R infants randomized to combination chemotherapy with or without lestaurtinib - All randomized patients will be included in the intent-to-treat efficacy analyses. EFS will be calculated from the time of randomization, which is just prior to beginning Induction Intensification. A 1-sided log rank test will be used to compare EFS between the 2 arms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EFS of patients treated on Arm C - A one-sided 95% confidence interval for EFS will be constructed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EFS - Will be compared between patients on Arm C to those on Arm B. A one-side log rank test will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse events as assessed by the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 - Will be compared between the arms using a one-sided Z-test of proportion, alpha = 5%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 11 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of toxic death</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 11 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of infants who received prophylactic treatment for prevention of fungal infections - These will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Proportion of infants who received prophylactic treatment, empiric treatment and IV immunoglobulin (IG) will be determined. Mean serum IgG levels (days 1 and 15 of induction) will be calculated. Mean number of days hospitalized during Induction until count recovery will also be computed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 11 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry and by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction - Correlation between MRD and outcome will be described in this population. Cox regression will be utilized to correlate MRD values with 3 year EFS.</outcome>

             undifferentiated leukemia (AUL); patients with T-cell ALL are eligible; patients with
             bilineage or biphenotypic acute leukemia are eligible, provided the morphology and

             pretreatment will not affect initial induction assignment as long as the patient meets
             all other eligibility criteria; IT chemotherapy per protocol is allowed for patient
             convenience at the time of the diagnostic bone marrow or venous line placement to
             avoid second lumbar puncture; (note: the central nervous system [CNS] status must be
             determined based on a sample obtained prior to administration of any systemic or
             intrathecal chemotherapy, except for steroid pretreatment); systemic chemotherapy must
             begin within 72 hours of this IT therapy

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy with or without lestaurtinib with to
      see how well they work in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of stop cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Lestaurtinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more
      effective with or without lestaurtinib in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</summary>
