  <interventions>
    <interventions>The PEP Personal Trainer is a newly developed device which has been designed to provide both PEP (positive end expiratory pressure) chest physiotherapy and some key additional functions. A PEP mask is held to the face by the user. The user inhales gently through the mask and then exhales against resistance because of a one way valve and resistor. This provides pressure back down their airway. It is suggested that the subject reach and maintain 10-20cm water pressure for 3 seconds. This is a standard and well proven form of chest physiotherapy. During a session a user will normal perform 100 exhalations. The PEP PT measures the pressure associated with each blow using a electronic sensor contained within the mask. The PEP PT connects wirelessly to a tablet device. The key features of the device include: 1. An alarm to remind the subject to perform their PEP (typically done twice daily), 2. The screen displays the ideal pressure curve which the subject can follow to ensure an ideal technique, 3. The subject can play games on the device which again require and encourage an ideal technique (for example piloting a space ships which collects asteroids), 4. The device counts the number of blows performed and provides prompts and encouragement, 5. The devices scores each blow and assigns a point for each effective blow (PEP points) which the child's parent can redeem for rewards, 6. The device stores information about both adherence and technique which can be reviewed at consultations. In this trial subjects will be randomised to either the PEP PT or a control device which measures adherence and technique but does not connect to a screen or have the other features. The subjects use either device for 6 weeks. Subjects assigned to the control device then use the PEP PT for six weeks (wait list control method).</interventions>
    <comparator>A control device which also provides PEP, measures adherence and assesses technique, but does not provide the other functions including feedback will be used as the control.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence with chest physiotherapy as measured by the PEP device (for example if the patient is prescribed 100 blows in the morning and one hundred at night and they perform 100 blows in the morning and 50 at night, they will be assigned 100% adherence for the morning and 50% for the night).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Technique with PEP. Each blow will be assessed against set criteria. The device will count the number of "good" blows. The number of "good" blows with the PEP PT compared to the control device with be the secondary outcome.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants attending the Mater Children Cystic Fibrosis clinic will be invited to enrol. Following providing informed written consent participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two intervention arms. A research assistant will prepare study packs which contain study allocation. Subjects will be divided into one of 6 groups based upon their age and lung function (3 age groups and 2 lung function groups) - minimisation to help ensure balance in both groups. There will be equal numbers of control and intervention in each group. The research assistant will be a computer random number generator to allocate the numbers in blocks of 2 or 4 subjects. Subjects in each group will be given a folder in sequential order.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random sequence generation. There will be equal numbers in 3 age groups (4-8, 8-12 and 12-16y). The two older groups will be divided into those with FEV1 above and below 80% predicted.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Advice from our statistician suggests that 35 subjects would allow a 10% improvement in adherence to be detected, in a population with a 20% standard deviation in adherence, with a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. Thus we plan to recruit 36 subjects.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is investigating whether a new physiotherapy device used in children with cystic fibrosis meets the needs of clients better than the current technology and thus is used more often and effectively used than the standard device. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition associated with significant lung disease. Chest physiotherapy helps move infected secretions out the lung and is a standard part of daily therapy. However, adherence with this therapy is low for many reasons. This device has been designed to address many of these problems and hopefully will improve adherence. The type of physiotherapy being addressed in thus study is call PEP (which stands for positive expiratory pressure) and would be well known to patients and those involve in patient care. The prototype device measures the pressure produced during each blow. The active device connects wirelessly to a tablet computer. Each blow is displayed on the screen. There are features including a game controlled by the blows, an alarm function, points which are earned with each correct blow which can be redeemed and the capacity to download adherence data at clinical reviews. Subjects will be randomly allocated to use either the new device or a control device which measures adherence but otherwise looks the same as a normal device for 6 weeks. Subjects will be aged 4-16 years. The main outcome will be adherence with the device. Those who don't get to use the device in the first 6 weeks will get to use it during a second 6 week period.</summary>
