  <interventions>
    <interventions>All study participants in the intervention group will be vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccine at 4 years of age.  The intervention group refers to the study allocation from phase I of the study (already occurred), that is, those subjects who received a birth dose of monovalent acellular pertussis vaccine.  

The intervention subgroup who received a booster dose of Infanrix-IPV (Registered trademark) (DTPa-IPV) at 18 months will receive the same Infanrix-IPV (Registered trademark) (DTPa-IPV) for the 4 year old booster dose.  

The intervention subgroup who received Boostrix-IPV (Registered trademark) (dTpa-IPV) at 18 months will receive the same Boostrix-IPV (Registered trademark) (dTpa-IPV) for the 4 year old booster dose. 

The intervention subgroup who did not receive any booster dose at 18 months old, will receive Infanrix-IPV (Registered trademark) (DTPa-IPV) for the 4 year old booster dose.  

All participants in the intervention group will also be vaccinated at 4 years old with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (M-M-R-II), which is due according to the Australian Immunisation Schedule, but is not the study intervention.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare surrogate measures of protection (absolute serum IgG concentration of anti-Pertussis Toxin (PT), anti-pertactin and anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) will be measured by ELISA in serum samples at  MIPR laboratory CDC using a well-standardised assay) against pertussis before and after a DTPa-IPV or dTpa-IPV booster vaccine at 4 years old in children previously recruited to a randomised trial of acellular pertussis (Pa) vaccine at birth. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of 4 year old vaccination (baseline) and 1 month after (28-42 days post visit 1).  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare adverse reactions and frequency between the study subgroups following the 4 year old pertussis boosting schedule.  

Known and possible adverse reactions to the pertussis containing vaccines, DTap and dTap, include local site reactions such as redness, swelling, hardness and pain, and systemic reactions such as fever, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, drowsiness, generalized muscle aches and joint aches.  These possible side effects will be screened for by the use of a daily diary card to be completed by the parent for the first seven days after administration of vaccination with respect to specific symptoms and signs as well as a separate general 30 day (28-42 days post visit 1) diary card to record general symptoms and illnesses as well as medication use.  In addition, limb swelling will be monitored by means of daily limb circumference measurements performed and recorded on the 7 day diary card by the parent again for the first seven days after vaccination.  These diary cards will then be collected and reviewed at the followup visit at 1 month after vaccination.  A followup phone call to the parents will also be completed in the 2-7 days post-immunization time frame to ensure that no serious adverse effects have occurred.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary timepoint will consist of the 7 day period after vaccination with the use of a 7 day specific symptom diary card as well as the 1 month interval (28-42 days post visit 1) between visit one and visit two with the use of a general 30 day diary card  to record general symptoms, illnesses and medication use during this period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate antibodies to other concomitantly administered vaccine antigens before and after a 4 year old pertussis boosting schedule.  Specifically, absolute serum IgG concentration of anti-tetanus, anti-diphtheria and anti-polio (serotypes 1, 2, 3) antibodies will be measured at MIPR laboratory CDC using well-standardised ELISA assays.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of 4 year old vaccination (baseline) and 1 month after (28-42 days post visit 1).  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Contraindications to vaccination as listed in the current NHMRC Australian Immunisation Handbook 10th Edition or as listed in the Infanrix-IPV or Boostrix-IPV Product Information. DTPa-IPV or dTpa-IPV vaccine will not be administered to individuals known to be hypersensitive to any component of the vaccine or residues carried over from manufacture (such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde). 
2. Evidence of a second booster diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccination since completion of the first booster vaccine at 18- 24 months old. 
3. Administration of immunoglobulins or any blood products within the 3 month period prior to the first visit; in which case, a delay in enrolment will be considered in the absence of other excluding criteria.
4. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition contraindicating MMR vaccination.
5. History of serious chronic illness or condition which in the judgement of the clinical investigator would preclude study participation.
6. History of neurologic disease or seizure (excluding simple febrile seizure).
7. Must not have had the vaccinations scheduled for age 4 years (ie Infanrix-IPV and measles mumps rubella vaccine).

    <concealment>Potential subjects will be contacted from a database of original study subjects from the Immunogenicity and safety of acellular pertussis vaccine at birth trial.  

Eligible participants must meet inclusion and exclusion criteria at the time of enrolment and informed consent must be obtained from the parent/carer.  

Treatment allocation depends on whether they participated in the second phase study, Persistence of immunity and response to a booster dose of DTPa or dTpa vaccine at 18 months old following acellular pertussis vaccine given at birth in healthy infants.  If they participated, then the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-polio vaccine they will receive at 4 years of age will be the same as what they received at the 18 month old trial.  If they did not participate in the 18 month trial, then the subjects will receive Infanrix-IPV.  </concealment>

    <designfeatures>This study is open and not blinded.  It will maintain group allocation determined in the second phase (Persistence of immunity and response to a booster dose of DTPa or dTpa vaccine at 18 months old following acellular pertussis vaccine given at birth in healthy infants) study.  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Immunogenicity: Continuous (geometric mean antibody concentration) and categorical (presumptive threshold) measures of antibodies to pertussis and other contemporaneously administered antigens will be examined. All serum antibody concentrations will be log transformed for statistical analysis as geometric mean concentrations (GMC) with 95% confidence limits. Where protective thresholds are well-established, the proportions with 95% confidence limits at or above the assay cut off will be calculated  anti-diphtheria (0.1 IU/ml)*, anti-tetanus (0.1 IU/ml). Between-group comparisons will be performed using appropriate statistical methods e.g. t-tests for comparisons of continuous data; Chi square tests for comparisons of categorical data. 
Note: * this threshold is significantly above the known protective level of 0.01 IU/ml but is the lower limit of assay detection.

Safety and reactogenicity: descriptive analyses will be performed on the number, type and severity of local and systemic reactions and severe adverse reactions that occur following vaccination and presented by treatment group. Comparisons between groups will be performed using Students T-Test for continuous variables and chi-square tests for proportions.

With respect to sample size calculations, in the first phase study, a total of 221 subjects received Pa vaccine at birth (Groups 1-3) and 219 no Pa vaccine at birth (Groups 4-6). Therefore, it is estimated that allowing for 25% drop out, approximately 300 children may be available for follow up at 4 years. 

The sample sizes for the third phase subgroups are based on the goal of comparing pertussis immunogenicity endpoints pre and post-4 year booster vaccine between Pa at birth recipients and no Pa vaccine at birth. 

Groups sizes of 95 subjects each were calculated to achieve 90% power to detect non-inferiority in GMCs for antibodies to all pertussis antigens, using a one-sided, two-sample t-test, with a significance level of 0.025. 

Groups sizes of 80 subjects each were calculated to achieve 80% power to detect non-inferiority in GMCs for antibodies to all pertussis antigens, using a one-sided, two-sample t-test, with a significance level of 0.025.
