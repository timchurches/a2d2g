  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were treated with epirubicin [110 mg/m2 intravenous infusion (IV)] every 2 weeks for 3 cycles followed by 3 cycles of  paclitaxel (200mg/m2 IV) every 2 weeks and 3 cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide; 600 mg/m2 IV , methotrexate; 45 mg/m2 IV and fluorouracil; 600 mg/m2 IV) every 2 weeks.
Filgrastim was recommended in each cycle. Ondansetron + Dexamethazone was recommended as antiemetic treatment in all patients. All patients entered the study who were eligible to receive trastuzumab, received it for 1 year after the completion of chemotherapy. In these patients hormonal treatment with tamoxifen or anastrazole (orally) was started concurrently with initiation of treatment with trastuzumab. All premenopausal patients with receptor positive status received tamoxifen daily for 5 years and goserelin (zoladex) every 3 months for 2 years. All postmenopausal patients with receptor positive status will be treated with anastrazole  daily for 5 years. Radiotherapy (RT) was required for all patients (pre- or post -menopausal), providing that they had either a partial mastectomy or tumor size &gt; 5cm and /or more than 4 positive lymph nodes, irrespectively the type of surgery (conservative or radical). 
The study was used as a validation study. 
The aim was to  observe the prognostic role of selected biomarkers on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as the acute and long-term toxicity. Time of observation: 10 years</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The HE10/08 trial was a large observational single-arm adjuvant study, with prospective collection of biological material. It was specifically designed to be used as a validation study to our previously conducted randomized trial (ACTRN12610000151033), in our continuous quest for pivotal molecular predictors of outcome or treatment effect in patients with operable breast cancer. Patients received dose-dense Epirubicin/Paclitaxel/Cyclophosphamide-Methotrexate-Fluorouracil (E-T-CMF). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was given prophylactically. Ondansetron + Dexamethazone was recommended as antiemetic treatment in all patients. All patients entered the study who were eligible to receive trastuzumab  (HER-2 overexpression or HER-2 gene amplification), received the drug every 3 weeks for 1 year after the completion of chemotherapy. In these patients hormonal treatment with tamoxifen or anastrazole started concurrently with initiation of treatment with trastuzumab. All premenopausal patients with receptor positive status were to receive tamoxifen p.o. daily for 5 years and goserelin (zoladex) p.o. every 3 months for 2 years. All postmenopausal patients with receptor positive status were to be treated with anastrazole for 5 years. RT was required for all patients (pre- or post -menopausal), providing that they had either a partial mastectomy or tumor size &gt; 5cm and /or more than 4 positive lymph nodes, irrespectively the type of surgery (conservative or radical).</summary>
