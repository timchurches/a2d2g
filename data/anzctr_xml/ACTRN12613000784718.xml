    <statisticalmethods>We will consider temperature as a categorical variable, divided into the following groups, according to peak temperature during the first 24 hours:
&lt; 36.5 degrees Celsius (low temperature)
36.5 degrees Celsius to 37.5 degrees Celsius (normothermia)
37.6 to 39.4 degrees Celsius (fever)
&gt;=  39.5 degrees Celsius (high fever)

We will calculate odds ratios (95% CI) for the risk of in-hospital mortality associated with peak temperature for all patients.  We will perform multivariate analysis using logistic regression adjusting for the patients severity of illness (by APACHE III score excluding temperature). To establish if the relationship between temperature and hospital mortality differs between we will fit an interaction between temperature and the individual subgroups.

We shall undertake a sensitivity analysis for admitted to ICU on day of hospital admission versus admitted to ICU after the day of hospital admission.

Continuous variables will be presented as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) and median +/- interquartile range [IQR] for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively.  We will report categorical variables as counts and percentages.  A two-sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In patients in intensive care with severe infections, those who do not develop a fever during the first 24 hours are more likely to die. This study aims to find out whether this is also the case in patients with infections in the absence of functioning white blood cells ('neutropenic sepsis'). We will look at a database of patients who were in intensive care in Australia and New Zealand between 2000 and 2013, to see whether there is a link between peak fever during the first 24 hours and survival among patients with very low white blood cell counts, compared with those with normal white blood cell counts. This study will inform the development of future clinical trials to decide whether the common medical practice of reducing fever during severe infections is harmful or not.</summary>

    <publicnotes>The Quality Assurance Legislation of the Commonwealth of Australia (Part VC Health Insurance Act 1973, Commonwealth of Australia) allows use of data for research purposes without individual patient consent or specific ethical approval.

In New Zealand, this use of anonymous use of data for outcome analysis is classified as a minimal risk observational study, and is exempt from requirements for formal ethics approval.

The ANZICS Centre for Outcome and Resource Evaluation (CORE) Management Committee have reviewed this protocol.</publicnotes>
