  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus standard of care (SOC) treatment
      (capecitabine, gemcitabine, or docetaxel) for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic
      nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      pembrolizumab or Investigator's choice of standard treatment.

      The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab treatment prolongs progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared to SOC treatment.</summary>
