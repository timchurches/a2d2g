  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patient received two bottles, one with a green label contained cotrimoxazole, to be used during the first 3 days, and the second with a red label containing  placebo, was used for the subsequent 2 days. Cotrimoxazole (40 mg trimethroprim + 200 mg sulphamethoxazole per 5 ml) was given in a dose of 4 mg/kg twice daily and prepared by SK&amp;F Inc. in Bangladesh and Roche Inc. in Indonesia. The green-labels had six cells to be marked by the caretaker for the 6 doses in the first 3 days and the red label had 4 cells to be marked for the next 2 days. A marked measuring cup was used to help dispense the dose.  
The first dose of cotrimoxazole was given by the caretaker under supervision at the health facility, with instructions given for the next doses, home care, follow-up visits and recognition of symptoms associated with very severe pneumonia. In Indonesia the second bottle was given to the caretaker on day 3 at a home visit, whereas in Bangladesh both bottles were given to the caretaker at enrollment. All of the treatments were consumed orally.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical outcomes on fast breathing. The infants and children were followed up 5 days after enrollment when caretakers were asked about the clinical condition and subjects were assessed clinically for fast breathing. To evaluate fast breathing, the mean of two respiratory rates counted for 1 minute each within 5 minutes was used for all children, when the child was quiet, feeding, or asleep. Children who failed therapy were referred to the hospital for management. Study staff followed children at home if they did not come for follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Five days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relapse. On Day 15, we conducted a full clinical assessment, assessed for relapse. A relapse was defined as the appearance of any signs of pneumonia after at least 3 days of being free of symptoms from the original episode.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fifteen days</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolled children were randomized to receive either 3 or 5 days of oral cotrimoxazole, prepared by SK&amp;F Inc. in Bangladesh and Roche Inc. in Indonesia. A sequence number with random allocation was generated by computer in central office of each site. Each container bottle was numbered based on the randomization, therefore the person who enrolled, give the bottle to the subjects, and performed the follow up were blinded from the type of treatment. This randomization was performed by an individual unrelated to the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomization was done in blocks of 4, 6 and 8, embedded in larger blocks of 24 at each site. The randomization code prepared by computer, by an individual unrelated to the study was kept locked at ICDDR, Dhaka and The Health Research Unit Padjadjaran University, Bandung. Unblinding was done at an investigator’s workshop after completion of the analysis.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We conducted a trial to compare equivalence of 3 and 5 days of oral cotrimoxazole for treating WHO defined non-severe pneumonia and to study its effect on antimicrobial resistance development in nasopharyngeal Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The primary hypothesis was that a 3 day course was equivalent to the standard 5 day course of oral cotrimoxazole for the treatment of WHO defined non-severe pneumonia in children aged 2  59 months. The secondary hypotheses we tested were a) the relapse rate at 15 days did not differ between the two treatment groups and b) the longer course of antibiotic therapy led to an increased prevalence of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae resistant to cotrimoxazole.  The primary outcome was treatment failure at day 5 and the secondary outcome was relapse at day 15.</summary>
