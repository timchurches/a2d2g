  <interventions>
    <interventions>Early goal directed sedation consisting of a dexmedetomidine based sedation protocol:
The primary sedative agent in the intervention arm is dexmedetomidine delivered by continuous infusion without a loading dose, supplemented by alternative sedative agents as outlined below, to achieve the level of sedation specified by the treating clinician.
Effective pain relief is provided by an infusion or boluses of an opioid (eg morphine or fentanyl) or other agent (eg ketamine) at the discretion of the treating clinician. This is particularly important during painful or noxious procedures (eg. endotracheal suction)
Dexmedetomidine arm [known as GpDex]: refer to study algorithm
Commence dexmedetomidine infusion at 1.0 mcg/kg/hr without a loading dose. This will take about 45 minutes to produce full sedative effect.
Dexmedetomidine infusion will be titrated to sedative effect up to a maximum dose of 1.4 mcg/kg/hr (depending on age: 0-1 yrs 1.0 micrograms/kg/hour, 1-5 years 1.4 mcg/kg/hr, 5-10 years 1.3 mcg/kg/hr, &gt;10 years 1.0 mcg/kg/hr) with dose of infusion specified by the treating clinician to achieve the desired level of sedation specified by the treating clinician.
a)	Dexmedetomidine infusion will be continued until sedation is no longer required to a maximum of 14 days after enrolment. 
2)	Boluses or infusion or both of opioids, as chosen by the treating clinician, will be administered, if required, at a dose specified by the treating clinician to provide analgesia
3)	Alternative sedative agents may be considered if a combination of dexmedetomidine and opioid infusions do not provide sufficient sedation. Examples include ketamine, chloral hydrate, sedating anti-histamines, phenobarbitone as per physician preference
4)	Supplemental propofol can  be used (up to a maximum of 24 hours and a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg/hr, in accordance with individual intensive care unit policy), always at the lowest effective dose to:
a)	Provide sedation during commencement and initial titration of dexmedetomidine infusion
b)	To optimise sedation to achieve the level of sedation specified by the treating clinician at any time when dexmedetomidine alone and at maximum dose is insufficient to provide patient comfort and safety
c)	Provide rescue sedation for immediate control of sudden agitation at any time
d)	Provide additional sedation during procedures
5)	Benzodiazepines (such as midazolam, diazepam and clonazepam) may be administered if sufficient level of sedation is not attained with the above measures.
6)	 Clonidine should not be administered concurrently with dexmedetomidine (although may used to prevent or treat suspected dexmedetomidine withdrawal).
</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard sedation protocol:
The primary sedative agent in GpStd is at the discretion of the treating clinician. This can be any agent or combination of agents EXCEPT that dexmedetomidine can only be used as a last resort. Selected agents can be given by infusion or boluses to achieve the level of sedation specified by the treating clinician.
1.	Boluses or infusion or both of selected opioid or other agent/s chosen by the treating clinician, will be administered at a dose specified by the treating clinician to provide analgesia. 
2.	Midazolam infusion (50-250 mcg/kg/hr) or other benzodiazepines. (1-4 mcg/kg/minute)
3.	Second line sedatives including chloral hydrate, clonidine (as per individual unit protocols), ketamine, barbiturates
4.	Supplemental propofol can  be used (up to a maximum of 24 hours and a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg/hr, in accordance with individual intensive care unit policy), always at the lowest effective dose to:
a.	Provide additional sedation during procedures
b.	Provide rescue sedation for immediate control of sudden agitation at any time.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a feasibility trial of 2 randomised sedative interventions used in critically ill patients, with the primary outcome being the difference in the proportion of time patients successfully achieve light sedation (SBS -1 to +1) in the first 48 hours of sedation in intensive care in each arm. Although this can be achieved in a small number of subjects, a sample size of 60 subjects will be sufficient to show a difference of at least 25% in the proportion of SBS scores in the light sedation range (SBS -1 to +1) in the intervention arm as compared to the standard arm, in the first 48 hours, and allow meaningful assessment of important secondary outcomes. Means with standard deviation for normally distributed variables and medians with interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and proportions with 95% confidence limits, will be reported. If feasible, a logistic regression analysis will be used to identify factors such as site or patient characteristics that are associated with a particular pattern of sedation or clinical practice, such as deviation from the targeted level of sedation or inappropriate deep sedation.</statisticalmethods>
