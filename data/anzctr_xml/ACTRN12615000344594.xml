  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each female subject participated in four session days with a minimum of two days between test days. Each subject was provided with a subject-specific breakfast meal to consume at least 3 h before the test session appointment and only water is permitted thereafter. Upon arrival at the laboratory, a baseline questionnaire to assess feelings of appetite and nausea was completed. A test preload meal was served to be consumed within 15 min. Subjects completed some questionnaires to assess their feelings of appetite and nausea every 15 min for 90 min. A final questionnaire was collected at 120 min and subjects were then provided with a hot meal and water to consume until comfortably full within 15 min. 

The time involvement for each subject on each session day was at least 180 min and there are 4 sessions, therefore 720 min. 

The 4 four test preload meals consisted of an orange-flaboured marmalade spread to which was added either whey protein isolate, isolated alpha-lactalbumin, isolated beta-lactoglobulin or a mixture of free amino acids simulating the amino acid composition of whey protein. Each preload spread (250 g) was accompanied with a slice (45 g) of toasted low-protein bread and 100 ml of water. The whey protein isolate preload meal served as the control. The preload meals were isoenergetic (~1800 kJ) and contained a mixture of carbohydrate (52 g) and protein or amino acids (52 g amino acid equivalent). All the ingredients in the preload meals are food-grade materials. 

The lunchtime test meal served 120 min following consumption of the preload meals comprised of a mixed homogeneous single hot fried rice test meal and bottled water. The hot fried rice test meal made in a commercial kitchen included white rice, minced chicken meat, eggs, peas, carrots, corn, chicken stock, salt, sugar, and vegetable oil. The fried rice test meal contained 36.8 g available carbohydrate, 8.5 g protein, 5.8 g fat and 1.0 g total dietary fibre per 100 g with a calculated metabolisable content of 982.2 kJ per 100 g. The amount of fried rice meal and water was measured before and after consumption using an electronic scale.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dairy whey protein is known for its greater satiating effect compared to carbohydrate and other protein sources. The purported satiating effect of whey protein may be due to the unique mixture of proteins in whey, to major constituent individual proteins and/or to its amino acid composition. Research investigating which component of dairy whey protein plays a role in its satiating effect is limited. In the present study, the effects of dietary whey protein given as intact whey protein isolate, beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin or a free amino acid mixture simulating the amino acid composition of whey protein isolate, on subsequent food intake 120 min later and subjective measures of satiety were compared in healthy normal-weight young adult women. </summary>
