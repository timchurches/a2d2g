  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Twenty children were randomised: 10 received an active video game upgrade package and 10 received no intervention. Follow-up data were available for all study participants (100%). On average, study participants were 12 (SD 1.5) years of age and 40% were female. Their mean baseline BMI was 19.7 (SD 3.6) kg/m2 and they played an average of 80 (SD 72) minutes of electronic games per day. 
Video game playing

Over the 12-week intervention period, children in the intervention group spent less total time playing all video games compared to those in the control group (54 versus 98 minutes/day [difference = -44 minutes/day, 95% CI [-92, 2]], p = 0.06). Children in the intervention group also tended to spend more time playing active video games compared to those in the control group (41 compared with 27 minutes/day [difference = 14 minutes/day, 95% CI [-15, 43], p = 0.3). The average time spent playing inactive games in the intervention group was significantly lower compared to the control group (47 versus 99 minutes/day [difference = -52 minutes/day, 95% CI [-101, -2]], p = 0.04).
Physical activity levels

On average participants provided 12.1 hours (SD 1.4) of activity count data per day. Physical activity (counts per minute) measured with an accelerometer was higher in the active video game intervention group compared to the control group (mean difference at 6 weeks = 194 counts/min [95% C.I. 32, 310], p = 0.04, and at 12 weeks = 48 counts/min [95% C.I. -153, 187], p = 0.6). There were no significant differences in time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activities between the two groups as measured by accelerometer (p &gt; 0.4), record (p &gt; 0.3), or mean PAQ-C (p &gt; 0.3) scores. When all activity time was combined (light, moderate, and vigorous), boys were more active than girls (p &lt; 0.05).
Waist circumference and BMI

Encouraging trends in the intervention group towards reductions in weight and waist circumference were observed. The mean difference in body weight between groups from baseline to 12 weeks was -0.13 kg (95% C.I. -1.97, 1.7), p = 0.9, while the mean difference in waist circumference between groups from baseline to 12 weeks was -1.4 cm (95% C.I. -2.68, -0.04), p = 0.04. However, the pilot study was not adequately powered to detect differences in anthropometric outcomes.</summary>
