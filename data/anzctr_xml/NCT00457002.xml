      <outcome>Incidence of Composite of Adjudicated Total Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) and VTE-related Death During the Intended Treatment Period - Primary Efficacy Population - VTE: nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE), symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or asymptomatic proximal DVT detected by ultrasound. VTE-related death: fatal PE or sudden death for which VTE could not be excluded as a cause. Intended Treatment Period=period that started on day of randomization: period ended (for treated) at latter of a) 2 days after last dose of study drug and b) 32 days after first dose of study drug; period ended (for not treated) 32 days after randomization. A bilateral compression ultrasound (CUS) was performed between Days 5 and 14 for detection of asymptomatic proximal DVT unless a symptomatic VTE was confirmed prior. CUS was also performed on Day 30 Â± 2 except for those participants who had a confirmed symptomatic VTE or proximal asymptomatic DVT prior to that time. All efficacy events were adjudicated by the Independent Central Adjudication Committee (ICAC). Event rate (%): n/N*100 (n=number with observation; N=total efficacy evaluable participants).</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if apixaban can prevent blood clots in the leg (deep
      vein thrombosis [DVT]) and lung (pulmonary embolism [PE]) that sometimes occur within
      patients hospitalized for acute medical illness, and to learn how apixaban compares to
      enoxaparin (LovenoxÂ®) for preventing these clots. The safety of apixaban will also be
      studied.</summary>
