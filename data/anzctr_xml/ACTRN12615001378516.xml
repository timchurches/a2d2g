  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the benefit of adding supra-scapular nerve block to an evidence informed management regime (intra-articular corticosteroid injection plus physiotherapy and oral analgesia as appropriate) for the adhesive capsulitis. 

Standard care: 
1. Patient education (verbal format) detailing the pathology and self limiting nature of adhesive capsulitis.
2. An initial single delivery Gleno-humeral joint (intra-articular space) injection (20 mg Triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 ml Kenalog) and 1.5 ml 2% Lidocaine Hydrochloride (Xylocaine)).
3. Physiotherapy intervention including passive shoulder mobilization (20 min sessions, 2 x week, first 3 weeks, then 1 x week, following 3 weeks) and a twice daily 20 min self mobilization program. Physiotherapy program to be repeated with subsequent supra-scapular nerve blocks (up to 4 over a 12 month period).

Active arm: Supra-scapular nerve block injection (10ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and 40mg of methylprednisolone) administered by the principal investigator (Rheumatologist) as described by Dangoisse et al (1994). Repeated at 3 monthly intervals over 12 months, should any or all of the following criteria be met:
1. A Patient Perceived Rate of Recovery of less than "good to very good Improved" on the 5 point ordinal scale (including the response categories worse, unchanged, unsatisfactory improved, satisfactory improved and good to very good improved)
2. A self-assessment of ongoing pain greater than 1/10 on the visual analogue scale
3. An ongoing deficit of more than 20% of expected full active shoulder range of motion, as determined by the un-involved or contralateral shoulder range of motion.

Adherence will be monitored using the following methods:
1. The principal investigator will record (log) the date of initial and subsequent active or placebo injections
2. The metrologist will record outcome measures at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months.
3. The physiotherapist will record (log) the participant's attendance
4. The participant will record (log) adherence with the home mobilisation program

    <comparator>Control (Placebo) arm: A sham 5ml injection of normal saline delivered subcutaneously in the same manner as the active arm (Dangoisse et al (1994)) with the exception of the depth of delivery. Repeated at 3 monthly intervals over 12 months, as clinically indicated.

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations: In order to detect a 50% improvement in the range of shoulder abduction movement it is estimated that approximately 25 subjects will be required in each arm of the study with 80% power and significance of 0.05.
All analyses will be carried our using SPSS and Stata software (Statacorp, College Station, Texas, USA). An intension to treat will be performed. The mean and standard deviation of change from baseline will be determined at all time points for all outcome measures. Differences in mean change between supra-scapular nerve block and control groups will be calculated, and their significance assessed by an independent samples t-test, establishing p values and 95% confidence intervals.
To determine correlations between physical and self-report outcome measures and QST measures for the identification of sensitisation, repeated measure ANOVAs will be used. Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Frozen shoulder is a condition which involves pain and stiffness of the shoulder joint and is often associated with a significant restriction of arm function and quality of life or well-being. We would like to see whether there are treatments that are better at reducing pain and improving the stiffness than our current treatments.
The current treatment approach is called a glenohumeral joint corticosteroid injection. The glenohumeral joint is the shoulder joint capsule. It involves an injection of a steroid medication and a local anaesthetic agent into the shoulder joint capsule. Physiotherapy exercises are then given. It is thought that the steroid reduces the inflammation and pain around the shoulder joint which then allows the shoulder to be moved more easily with physiotherapy exercises.
The newer approach we want to test is called supra-scapular nerve block. This has been shown to be safe and helpful in reducing pain for people with other types of shoulder problems. The treatment involves an injection of a steroid medication and a local anaesthetic agent into the tissues over the shoulder blade. This injection temporarily blocks the supra-scapular nerve which transmits the pain associated with frozen shoulder. Like the current treatment approach, once the pain has been reduced it should be easier to get the shoulder moving again with physiotherapy exercises. It is possible to repeat the suprascapular nerve block up to 4 times, at 3 monthly intervals, if the pain and stiffness remain. We think that the rate of recovery from frozen shoulder might be faster when current treatment and repeated supra-scapular nerve blocks are done together. 
In order to test this, participants will be randomly placed into one of two groups. One group will receive the supra-scapular nerve block injection and the other group will receive the placebo (saline) injection. These injections may be performed up to 4 times over the course of 1 year. In addition to receiving either the supra-scapular nerve block or the placebo injection, participants will receive the current best treatment available (glenohumeral joint injection and physiotherapy). Baseline information will be collected including age, general medical health, current medications, duration of shoulder symptoms, severity of shoulder symptoms and previous treatment for shoulder symptoms. Measures of shoulder range of motion, participants pain scores and levels of satisfaction will be measured at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months in order to compare both treatment approaches.
