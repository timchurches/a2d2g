    <studytitle>Accommodative Lag with Multifocal Contact Lenses</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A prospective, single-masked [participant only], multiple group, randomised clinical trial to compare the accommodative lag response and  adaptataion obtained with different contact lens designs, where a minimum of sixty participants will wear three of four differently designed contact lenses bilaterally.</scientifictitle>

These lenses will be randomised to be worn for 8 days for each lens type. 4 visits (Baseline/Dispensing, interim visit 1 and 2 , Day 8 visit )are required for each lens type within the 8 day of lens wear. Minimum of 5 days of wash out period is required between different stages.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent.
Be between the ages of 18 to 25 years of age, male or female.
Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses.
Have a contact lens prescription that is myopic between -1.00 and -4.00D (inclusive).
Have astigmatism that is not greater than -0.75DC and anisometropia between the two eyes of 1.00D or less.
Is correctable to at least 6/9 (20/30) or better in each eye with contact lenses.
Be an experienced and habitual contact lens wearer. 
Be able to insert and remove contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 48 hours between in-house studies.
Pregnancy.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The planned number of participants is a minimum of 60.  Enrolment will take place over approximately two months.

Participants will be screened for general clinical trial suitability by way of a routine eye examination which includes refraction, visual acuity and general eye health. Informed consent will be obtained prior to any clinical trial procedures. 

The order of administering the various contact lens designs will be randomised for all participants. Study participants will be randomised into either group 1 or group 2. Within each of these groups, the order of administering the three lens types will be randomised using a cross over design.Concealed allocation will be by way of central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Particpants will be randomly asigned to two groups and the order of lens types to be worn. Randomisation plan will be generated from http://www.radomiation .com.</sequence>
