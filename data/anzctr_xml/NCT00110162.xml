    <summary>RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Androgen deprivation
      therapy may stop the adrenal glands from making androgens.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well androgen deprivation therapy
      works in treating patients with prostate cancer.</summary>
