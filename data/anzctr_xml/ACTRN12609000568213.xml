    <studytitle>Evaluation of the effects of two weeks wear of silicone hydrogel lenses used with one of two lens disinfection solutions on the surface of the eye.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Prospective, randomised, investigator-masked parallel treatment study  in up to 50 participants of the effects of two weeks daily wear of silicone hydrogel lenses used in conjunction with polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) or peroxide-based contact lens solutions on the ocular surface health.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>To investigate ocular surface changes after contact lens wear used in combination with various types of contact lens solutions and to correlate with subjective symptoms. Participants will wear silicone hydrogel lenses on a daily wear basis for a minimum of two weeks. Participants will use either a polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) or a peroxide-based contact lens solution (randomly assigned) for cleaning and storing their lenses overnight. Participants will be instructed to discontinue lens wear or use the peroxide-based solution for an additional week and recovery after this additional wash-out period measured.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess ocular surface changes after contact lens wear. Measurements will include tear secretion rate using Phenol red thread test, tear osmolarity using a vapor pressure osmometer, tear fluorescein break-up time, ocular surface staining and number of goblet cells using impression cytology for the conjunctival surface.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 2 week and after 1 week recovery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To correlate ocular surface changes with subjective symptoms. Standardised questionnaires (McMonnies questionnaire, ocular symptoms questionnaires) will be used to assess subjective symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 1 day, 1 week, 2 week and after 1 week recovery</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Symptoms akin to those experienced by dry eye sufferers are often experienced by contact lens wearers. Some of the preservatives used in contact lens cleaning solutions are known to cause mild damage to the eye's surface. This study aims to investigate the changes to the eye's surface associated with various types of contact lens solutions and whether this is related to any symptoms of dryness.</summary>
