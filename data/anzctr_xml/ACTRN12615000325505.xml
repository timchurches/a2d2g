  <interventions>
    <interventions>Implementation of a cleaning bundle intervention, consisting of 5 interdependent components (training, audit, communication, product and technique), in 11 hospitals for randomly allocated time periods between 20 weeks and 50 weeks.
Interdependent bundle components are each tailored to meet the site context. 

TRAINING
The study team will deliver tailored training activities (reflecting the educational needs identified at each site during the control period through the environmental services pre- intervention surveys):
- at the commencement of the intervention phase for all environmental services staff with a role in environmental cleaning
- as part of induction for new environmental services staff with a role in environmental cleaning
- and as required throughout the intervention phase. 

Content of the introductory training activity (1-2 hour face-face session for environmental services staff) in week 1 of the intervention period will minimally include: the bundle components, clearly defined roles and responsibilities for environmental cleaning at the site and the impact of environmental cleaning on HAI.

Additional training sessions will continue throughout the intervention period as required by the site and provide responsive feedback from the bundle audit activities. Training will articulate with existing education events and timings in trial sites as much as possible, including induction for environmental services staff, team meetings and annual training updates.

TECHNIQUE
All environmental services staff at each site will follow an established cleaning technique throughout the intervention period when completing a daily clean or discharge clean. 
It will be communicated to environmental services staff through the training and through availability of posters, fact sheets and tip sheets/ cards (e.g on the cleaning trolley). 

PRODUCT
Each trial site will have existing supply arrangements for environmental cleaning product, including cleaning equipment. To promote cost-effectiveness and ensure feasibility the product component will be clarified with each site to ensure the product component: 
-	minimally includes the use of disinfectant for all discharge cleans and for daily cleans of high risk/contact precaution rooms. To ensure organic matter is removed effectively either a 2 in 1 detergent and disinfectant product or a 2-step process will be used
-	minimally includes the use of point of care wipes for medical equipment 
-	is Therapeutic Good Administration approved for that use and setting 
-	adheres to manufacturers instructions for use 
-	is compatible with other product or application materials (e.g. microfiber cloths) in use
-	ensures effective cleaning technique is used. 
All environmental services staff with a role in environmental cleaning at the trial site will use this product component throughout the intervention period. 

AUDIT
In this cleaning bundle the DAZO fluorescent marker system will be used monthly in the control and intervention periods as an audit tool by the study team or trained members of the site team at each trial site. DAZOÂ® Fluorescent Marking Gel and UV Light system dries on surfaces following application and resists dry abrasion, but is removed with standard cleaning. The locations of the gel dots will be consistent with the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control Environmental Cleaning Checklist in two different bed and bathroom areas in the Intensive Care Unit and in at least 50% of the hospital trial site wards. 

In 3 hospital sites the study team will use ATP luminometry bi-monthly in the same ward sites as the fluorescent markers to audit bio burden of the frequent touch surfaces post daily or discharge clean. The 3 hospitals will be located in either South East Queensland or at an investigator affiliated site due to equipment limitations. 

COMMUNICATION
The communication component of the bundle will be implemented by the study and site teams, throughout the intervention period. Communication activities will focus on:
-	maintaining a positive feedback loop to all staff about the audit results
-	the role of the multidisciplinary team in preventing HAI 
-	creation of a culture of hygiene through hospital wide promotional activities to raise the profile and importance of cleaning in reducing infections and support a culture shift in the perception of environmental services staff
-	daily contact between cleaning staff and ward leaders or managers
-	supporting the participation of cleaning staff on relevant clinical governance committees.

Site adherence with the bundle components will be monitored by the study team through fortnightly site contact and the review of audit results.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The (whole of hospital) combined number of healthcare associated Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteremia (SAB) infections, healthcare associated Clostridium Difficule infections (CDI) and positive clinical isolates of Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) at each trial site. This is assessed through whole of hospital infection data and reports about these 3 HAIs, along with antimicrobial prescribing data  (including antimicrobial agent, daily drug does and occupied bed days) and hand hygiene compliance data, supplied to the project team by the trial site team. Antimicrobial prescribing and hand hygiene rates may impact HAI rates, This data on healthcare associated infections is routinely collected by the trial site for ongoing surveillance.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>HAI rates, antimicrobial prescribing data, and hand hygiene compliance data will be collected from 1 May 2015 to end of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in costs associated with implementing the bundle relative to changes in health benefits (incremental cost effectiveness ratio). This is assessed by identifying the number and unit cost of resources  used in implementing the bundle (including staff, training, cleaning product) and the opportunity cost of infection (treatment costs, bed days lost) quality adjusted life years (QALY) calculations.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (control period) and monthly during intervention period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number (and %) of ultraviolet gel dots removed correctly following routine hospital cleaning. 
The gel dots  will be applied in frequent touch points (as per the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control Environmental Cleaning Checklist)  post daily clean in two different bed and bathroom areas in the  Intensive Care Unit and in at least 50% of the hospital trial site wards. Wards will be chosen that reflect the National Health Performance Authority (NHPA) risk factors for patient vulnerability: immunosuppressed patients and patients admitted with a risk of infection.  

Following cleaning the next day,  the sites will be checked using the UV light pen, which will (literally) show if the gel dot remains after the cleaning. The outcome measure will be cleaning success, as number of dots removed divided by the total number of dots placed. All results will be recorded using the iCombat application at the time of data collection.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (control period) and monthly during intervention period. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size:
Eleven hospitals with a pre-intervention infection rate (a combination of SAB, CDI and VRE) of 5 per 10,000 patient days will give us 86% power to detect a 20% post-intervention reduction in infection risk. This is based on a two-sided 5% significance level, a within-hospital correlation in infection rates of 0.3 and the stepped intervention timings between 20 and 50 weeks.
Analysis:
The Objective 1 primary outcome of infection rates will be analysed using Poisson regression with the   infection counts as the dependent variable and the weekly number of patient days as the denominator. The key independent variable will be the intervention. The model will include a linear term for time to control for any long term patterns in infection rate, and analysed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM).

The Objective 1 secondary outcome of success or failure of environmental cleaning as measured by removal of UV gel dots will be examined using a similar GLMM but assuming a binomial response.

The Objective 1 secondary outcome of ATP assays will be quantified and expressed as relative light units, then analysed and correlated with the secondary outcome data (ultraviolet dots). 

The Objective 1 outcome of changes in staff knowledge and attitudes around environmental cleaning will be analysed by reviewing the outcomes of pre and post intervention surveys and interviews.

For the Objective 2 primary outcome of cost effectiveness, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio at the hospital level, will be estimated by summing intervention costs and deducting cost savings from reduced lengths of stay and use of health care resources that arise from reduced incidences of infection.

The secondary outcome of changes to costs will be estimates by the extra staff time spent, costs of cleaning products, invisible gels, UV lamps and pathology costs. The changes to health benefits will be estimated in quality adjusted life years using  the number of life years saved from reduced infection outcomes, the expected duration of life (had infection not occurred) based on age and co-morbidities.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are a major cause of avoidable costs, morbidity and deaths among hospital patients.  In Australia 200,000 cases of HAI arise each year and 1.9 million hospital bed days are diverted to treat them. Reducing important HAI requires multiple evidence-based approaches. This study will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of improving environmental cleaning, using an evidence-based bundle, to reduce HAI.</summary>
