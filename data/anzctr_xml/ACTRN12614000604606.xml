  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 pellets each containing 75mg (total dose 900mg) of testosterone will be implanted under the skin of the side of the buttocks. The local area will be cleaned with antiseptic and local anesthetic injected. A small cut will be made and the testosterone pellets inserted under the skin using an applicator device called a trocar. Adhesive strips will be applied to close the insertion site and dressing to cover the area. The pellets remain in situ and dissolve over time. If a situation arises that necessitates discontinuation of testosterone, the pellets must be surgically removed. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: Study the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous implantation of 12 testosterone pellets in hypogonadal males. This will be done by collecting samples and analysis of testosterone levels in the blood by a central laboratory. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Blood samples will be collected before implantation and 5, 8, 15, 29, 57, 85 and 113 days after implantation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: Study the effectiveness of subcutaneous implantation of 12 testosterone pellets in hypogonadal males (with testosterone levels &lt;300 ng/dL). This will be done by collection of information from questionnaires completed by the participants about erectile function, depression and androgen deficiency. The questionnaires to be used include: Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Questionnaire; International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF); Quantitative Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (qADAM); and Subject Satisfaction with Treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Questionnaires will be completed before implantation and 15, 29, 85 and 113 days after implantation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 3: Study the safety of subcutaneous implantation of 12 testosterone pellets in hypogonadal males (with testosterone levels &lt;300 ng/dL). 
The most commonly reported adverse events include: implant site pain, swelling, inflammation, induraton, and erythema, discharge, haemorrhage, and haematoma; injection site pain and there is a risk of injection site infection, accidental expulsion of the pellets and a small skin scar at the implantation site. Adverse events associated with testosterone replacement therapy in general include: changes in sexual desire (increase or decrease) , headache, acne, nausea, itching, muscle pain, deepening of the voice, changes in skin colour, increased body hair, male pattern baldness or increased baldness, changes in liver function tests, hepatitis, rarely hepatocellular neoplasm, elevation of  certain blood electrolytes, depression, nervousness, generalized parasthesia, mood alterations, increase in red blood cells, suppression of certain blood clotting factors,  increase in cholesterol levels, as well as  prolonged,  frequent and painful erections.  Increased and decreased blood pressure can also occur.  There is a possible increased risk of prostate cancer. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be done by collection of information on adverse events and monitoring of laboratory safety results and vital signs from the time of implantation for 113 days.  </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Pharmacokinetics - the measured concentration for testosterone will be graphed and tabled versus time. Summary statistics will be calculated and reported. Pharmacokinetic parameter values will be calculated and reported.
Effectiveness - change from baseline in overall satisfaction of erectile function, depression and androgen deficiency questionnaires will be summarised.
Safety  adverse events will be summarised. Change in pre-dose for each laboratory test and vital sign will be summarised descriptively at each time point collected.
Since this is primarily a pharmacokinetic study, no formal sample size calculation was required. The selection of approximately 24 subjects is typical for such studies.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial aims to study the pharmacokinetics, effectiveness and safety of 12 pellets of 75mg testosterone (900mg total) implanted under the skin in males who have hypogonadism. Testosterone replacement therapy may help to restore male secondary characteristics, sexual behaviour, energy, mood and muscle development. This trial will enrol 24 male participants between the ages of 18-70 who have blood testosterone levels below 300ng/dL. All participants will undergo a screening visit 21 days prior to check for eligibility. Eligible participants will undergo an implantation procedure where 12 testosterone pellets will be implanted under the skin. Blood samples will be collected at various timepoints throughout the trial for pharmacokinetic analysis and safety parameters. Participants will also complete a series of questionnaires throughout the trial. Participants will be followed up for 113 days.</summary>
