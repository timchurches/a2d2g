  <interventions>
    <interventions>Family-based treatment (FBT). In this treatment, the whole family attends 18 50-minute sessions with a trained mental health clinician over 6 months. In the early part of treatment, parents are assisted in finding their own ways to help their child overcome their unhealthy eating habits. This is done through education about the seriousness of eating disorders, as well as coaching parents about how they may go about taking control of their adolescents eating. Once symptoms are under control and weight restoration is nearing completion, parents gradually hand eating decisions back to the adolescent. General adolescent issues, such as learning to function more on his/her own, are discussed toward the end of treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Parent-focused treatment (PFT). In this treatment, the parent(s) and the adolescent are seen separately for 18 50-minute sessions over 6 months. The therapist sees only the parent(s) and works through the same phases of treatment as in standard FBT. The adolescent is seen by a trained nurse for medical management and supportive counselling.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to identify an efficacious outpatient treatment for adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Evidence suggests that family-based treatment (FBT) is efficacious. However, FBT is not helpful for all families as it can be complex and requires all family members to be involved. Therefore, this project will examine whether another form of FBT, called Parent-focused Treatment, is a feasible alternative to standard FBT. To do this we will compare the outcomes for families who take part in standard FBT to those of families who take part in Parent-focused Treatment (PFT).</summary>
