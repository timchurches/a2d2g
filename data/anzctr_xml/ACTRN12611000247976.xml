    <concealment>Allocation concealment will be maintained by using a web-based randomisation service supported by the Trial Centre. 

The study is masked, i.e. treatment allocation will be concealed from investigators, clinicians and parents. To maintain the masking, nursing staff will prepare the bLF dose or control out of site of parents or clinical staff.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 1,500 infants has 85% power at the two-sided 5% significance level to detect a difference in the proportion meeting the primary outcome assuming the true probability is 74% in controls and 80.5% in infants having bLF. The power of the trial remains above 80% even if nonadherence to randomized treatment occurs in 5% of participants. A non-adherence rate &lt;5% is likely based on our previous tria. The estimated proportion meeting the primary outcome in the control arm is informed by pre-trial estimates, blinded (pooled) review of accumulating trial data (most recently undertaken in December 2016), and the anticipated beneficial effects of the growing use of probiotics and downward trend in rates of sepsis. A statistical analysis plan will be prepared and finalised prior to unblinding the data. All randomised subjects will be eligible for inclusion in efficacy analyses in accordance with the intention-to-treat analysis principle. Subjects will be analysed according to the regimen they actually received for comparisons on SUSAR rates. The primary analysis will be a comparison between treatment groups on the proportion experiencing the primary outcome using a chi-squared statistic that accommodates possible correlation of data between siblings from multiple births. Other binary secondary outcomes will be analysed using the same method, whilst comparable approaches applicable to continuous data will be applied as required. Estimates of the treatment effect adjusted for baseline characteristics will be calculated in sensitivity analyses using the relevant linear modelling approach. These modelling techniques will also be used to identify clinically important prognostic factors and to perform tests of heterogeneity in the subgroup analyses. Hypothesis tests will be undertaken at the two-sided 5% level of significance. P-values from secondary analyses that are unadjusted for multiple comparisons will be interpreted in proper context.
Subgroup analyses: Consistency of the treatment effect on the primary endpoint will be evaluated across the following subgroups: (i) birthweight &lt;1000 g and 1000-1499 g; (ii) randomised =72 hr and &gt;72 hr from birth; (iii) those who received and did not receive probiotics by 36 weeks corrected gestation; (iv) = 28 weeks and &gt;28 weeks gestation at birth.</statisticalmethods>
