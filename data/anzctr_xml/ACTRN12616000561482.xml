    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on our audit of existing practice in the Emergency Department, we assume that, in the control arm (standard instructions, written and verbal), the proportion of participants who no longer meet clinical criteria for Faecal Impaction is 45%. Based on our results testing the extended instructions (written and verbal instructions) in the Emergency Department during our previous trial, this proportion is expected to exceed 60% (assumed effect size: odds ratio 1.83). In order to detect this difference at two-sided 0.05 level of significance with a statistical power of 80%, 173 participants per group, are needed. In order to compensate for potential drop-outs and treatment protocol deviators within a supportive per-protocol analysis, a total of 400 individuals (200 subjects within each intervention arm) will be included in the trial.
Following intention-to-treat principles, participants will be analysed as randomised. A binary logistic regression analysis will be used for the evaluation of the primary study endpoint. The factor variable age (as defined by the stratification variable categories) will be used as an adjustment variable within the analysis. Multiple imputations will be used to impute missing outcome data. The primary confirmatory analysis will be conducted at a two sided 0.05 level of significance. The difference in proportions of patients meeting the primary outcome definition (standard vs extended instructions arm) will be computed based on the logistic regression model and reported as effect measures along with a 95% confidence interval.  
 
Interim Analyses 
There will be no formal interim analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint. Safety data i.e. incidence of SAE &amp; SUSAR as well as quality of data collected will be continuously examined, however, every 3 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial of instructions for taking Polyethylene glycol + electrolytes (PEG+E) in the treatment of faecal impaction in children aged 4 to 18 years presenting to an emergency department (ED).
This study aims to compare effectiveness of two different sets of instructions provided with PEG+E for paediatric faecal impaction treatment in an ED.
This is a single-centre, prospective, randomised controlled trial of two instructions (standard instructions vs. extended instructions) provided in both written and video for the intake of PEG+E treatment.
Primary: Main symptom improvement, remission from the inclusion criteria at day 6 post study treatment initialization as rated by the participant or his/her guardian.
Secondary: stool frequency/consistency/ease of stool passage and stool volume (questionnaires)
