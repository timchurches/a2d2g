  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Minocycline
Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: surgery - Surgical spinal cord decompression
Treatment: surgery - Maintenance of minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP)

Experimental: Minocycline - Minocycline twice daily infused over 30 minutes through central venous access as follows 800 mg + 700 mg on Day 1, 600 mg + 500 mg on Day 2, and 400 mg thereafter from Day 3 thru Day 7

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 250 ml normal saline and infused over 30 minutes through central venous access twice daily for 7 days


Treatment: drugs: Minocycline


Treatment: drugs: Placebo


Treatment: surgery: Surgical spinal cord decompression
Surgical decompression by means at the discretion of the clinical management team will occur within 24 hours of injury in all subjects. Stabilization will occur at that time but may also include further interventions at a later time.

Treatment: surgery: Maintenance of minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP)
Standardized hemodynamic management protocol aimed at maintaining MAP = 85 mm Hg for 7 days using volume augmentation with isotonic crystalloid followed by inotropic support if needed will be applied to all subjects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of IV minocycline in improving
      neurological and functional outcome after acute non-penetrating traumatic spinal cord injury
      (SCI).

      The primary hypothesis is that intravenous minocycline twice daily (800 mg initial dose
      tapered to 400 mg by 100 mg at each dose then administered to the end of day 7) administered
      to subjects with acute traumatic non-penetrating cervical SCI starting within 12 hours of
      injury will improve motor recovery as assessed by the International Standards for Neurologic
      Classification of Spinal Cord Injury - ISNCSCI (a.k.a. ASIA) neurological examination
      measured between 3 months and 1 year post-injury, compared to placebo.

      The secondary hypotheses are that the above minocycline treatment will also results in
      improvement in ASIA sensory improvement, in ASIA grade and in functional outcome as assessed
      by Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) and Short Form 36 (SF-36), compared to placebo. In
      addition the effect of minocycline on neurological and functional outcome after SCI is
      expected to be more pronounced in those subjects with motor incomplete SCI compared to those
      with motor compete SCI. A subgroup analysis will be undertaken to examine this hypothesis.</summary>
