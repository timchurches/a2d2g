    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to determine the comparability of the treatment groups for baseline patient demographic or characteristics. Count data (such as duration of cough, number of days coughing up phlegm and number of days with a sore throat etc) will be analysed using Poisson Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) to allow for clustering of patients within doctors. Binary outcomes (such as seen GP for past cough and antibiotics for previous cough etc.) will be analysed using binomial Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Normally distributed data (such as frequency of cough and how well they felt today etc from visual analogue scales (VAS)) will be analysed using mixed model analysis of variance.  Adjustments for confounders for patient age, gender, co-morbidities and chest signs at study entry and possible patient characteristic imbalances will be made. All analyses will be on an intention to treat basis and the significance level set at 0.05.

Subgroup analysis will be performed on the following:
- Chest signs (vs all)
- All patients &gt;55 yrs (vs all)
- Current smokers (vs all)
- CRP greater than 30 mg/L (vs all)

Adjustments will be made in the analyses to account for contributing confounders of patient age, gender, co-morbidities and chest signs at study entry and possible patient characteristic imbalances.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute bronchitis is the 5th most frequent reason to visit a general practitioner (GP), often leading to an antibiotic prescription even though guidelines advise that the infective organism is usually viral. Patient factors are partially responsible for these prescriptions but research indicates that GPs are inconsistent in their labelling of acute bronchitis and may feel the need to use antibiotics just in case. Studies indicate that, overall, patients with acute bronchitis may experience only a marginal benefit from antibiotic treatment, and this benefit may be offset by potential side effects. 

A recent Cochrane systematic review suggests that some patients may benefit from antibiotics. Based on clinical symptoms, signs and investigations, we think there may be two groups of patients with acute bronchitis - uncomplicated and complicated- the former not requiring antibiotics and the latter, associated with poorer outcomes, who might benefit from their use. By identifying those sub-groups, GPs could be more certain about who to treat (and therefore who not to treat) leading to more rational and cost effective prescribing without compromising patient care.

This is a double blind study which means that the patients have been  randomly assigned to recieve either amoxycillin or placebo capsules for 6 days, and neither the patients nor the physicians or trial staff know which treatment has been allocated until database close.</summary>
