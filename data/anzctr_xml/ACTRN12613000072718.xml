  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a cross-sectional study that observed weight cycling history, iron and inflammatory markers at one time point.

Anthropometric data including height, weight, BMI, waist circumference, as well as body composition data including percent body fat, absolute fat mass and lean mass (using both bio-electrical impedance and dual x-ray absorptiometry measurement techniques) were collected. 
Self-reported history of weight cycling, weight loss and 
attempts at weight loss in the past five years was recorded. Participants were also required to undergo one blood test to measure concentration of iron, inflammatory and immune markers.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants will be required to undergo one blood test from which a haematology (including haemoglobin, haematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC) and routine iron studies (serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin) will be measured at a nationally accredited pathology laboratory (Laverty Pathology Australia).

Additional plasma will be stored for analysis of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha) as well as non-routine iron markers soluble transferrin receptor and hepcidin.</outcome>

      <outcome>Participants will be required to undergo one blood test from which immune markers (including absolute lymphocyte count, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, white blood cells, platelets, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils) will be measured at a nationally accredited pathology laboratory (Laverty Pathology Australia).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the effect of weight cycling on iron status, inflammation and immune function. The objective is to measure iron levels, inflammation and the immune systems of young women and then investigate how weight cycling can affect these factors. This research study is part of larger trial that is comparing the effectiveness of a red meat based, low fat diet and a white meat based, low fat diet on weight loss, immune function, blood fats, glucose, insulin and iron levels.</summary>
