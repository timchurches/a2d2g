    <interventions>Intervention: Patients were given a short course of Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) intervention. NET is a mind-body based chiropractic intervention, that utilises muscle testing, semantics and chinese element theory to determine a neuro emotional complex (NEC). A neuroemotional complex is said to be associated with many pain syndromes. The NEC's are assessed through referential statements, through the use of muscle testing. The intervention is created by applying a mechanical mobilisation device (activator) to specific spinal segments whilst the participant contemplates a recalled memory and the recents cause of the pain syndrome. This is believed to help disassociate the emotional content and a pain syndrome to facilitate the return to health. During this time pain is said to be reduced or normalised. Duration of Intervention: The intervention is applied in less than one second mobilising bursts of less than one centimetre amplitude. The burst are repeated 5 times bilaterally at three separate facet joint articulation of the spine. Participants received the intervention at a frequency of 2 sessions per week for one month (8 sessions).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Patients were given a sham NET intervention. This included enthusiastic treatment of muscle testing and semantic testing which did not pertain to any emotional complexed. The referential statements provided were not relevant to the presentation and thus were deemed to have no therapeutic value.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain is the most common presentation to chiropractic practitioners.  Recent evidence suggests that chronic LBP may be associated with physical and psychosocial components. The biopsychosocial model of pain acknowledges the biological, psychological and social dimensions of the pain experience. This model recognizes disability often results from an inability to perform activities due to the pain, or due to the fear of future pain. The mind-body approach attempts to integrate the psychosocial dimensions of the person into therapy. It is for these reasons that manual medicine has begun to embrace the concept of "mind-body" treatments. These treatments attempt in various ways to integrate the function of the mind with the body in both assessment and therapy. Despite these lofty goals, very few of these treatments have been scrutinized under controlled conditions. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that a mind-body approach, identified as Neuro Emotional Technique, may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic low back pain.</summary>
