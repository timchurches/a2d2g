Experimental: PF-03732010 - Single Arm study


Treatment: drugs: PF-03732010
IV infusion. Escalating dose levels, starting at 0.5 mg/kg to Maximum Tolerated Dose. Cycle length of 4 weeks for first cycle, and 2 weekly for subsequently cycles was originally explored, yet based on emerging PK data the Cycle 1 duration is 2 weeks and then weekly. Number of Cycles: Until Progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.

    <summary>P-cadherin may play a part in tumor growth; PF-03732010 is a new drug that inhibits
      P-cadherin. This study will test how well the drug is tolerated, and what effects there might
      be. Blood will also be taken to measure the amount of drug in blood.</summary>
