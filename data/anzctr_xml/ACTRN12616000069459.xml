  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three test fats, palm olein and cocoa butter (high in saturated fatty acids primarily in the sn-1 and sn-3 positions and unsaturated fatty acids primarily in the sn-2 position) and olive oil (high in unsaturated fatty acids primarily in the sn-2 position), will be compared using a 4-week single-blind, randomised 3x3 crossover feeding intervention, separated by 2-week washout periods and a 2-week run in phase, totalling 18 weeks.

For the entire 18 week period, participants will consume a background diet containing a daily average of 30% of total energy as fat, 15-25% as protein and 45-65% as carbohydrate. During the intervention periods, the test fats of interest will be consumed and account for 20% of the total fat intake. During the run in and washout phases, this 20% test fat will be replaced with premium palm oil (different composition to the test palm oil). All test fats will be supplied as pre-prepared frozen meals and baked biscuits.  

Participants will attend the clinic at the beginning and end of each 4 week intervention and run-in phase (weeks 0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18). Dietary intake and test product consumption will be assessed by a simple checklist delivered via an online platform and cross checked by a dietitian at each participant clinic visit. Compliance will be further assessed from plasma fatty acid levels measured in the blood. Body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and a fasted blood sample (20mL) will be collected at each clinic visit.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate whether palm oil and cocoa butter that are high in saturated fat, but contains primarily monounsaturated fat in the sn-2 position of triglycerides, have similar effects on blood lipid profiles than monounsaturated fat olive oil in normal healthy Australian participants.</summary>
