  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Goal-directed Medication review Electronic Decision Support System (G-MEDSS) (accessible from gmedss.com) is a validated electronic platform that has been designed to provide clinical decision support for healthcare practitioners when completing a medication review for their older patients, to tailor care to meet their goals and preferences. The G-MEDSS is designed to produce patient-specific deprescribing reports for a patients GP.

The G-MEDSS contains three tools: 
1)	The Goals of Care Management tool allows the patients goals of care to be identified and aligned with their medication strategies. 
2)	The Drug Burden Index CalculatorÂ© is a validated tool that identifies medications with anticholinergic and sedative effects (measured by the DBI) and provides information and recommendations for physicians. 
3)	The revised Patients Attitudes Towards Deprescribing questionnaire (rPATD) was developed and validated to explore peoples attitudes, beliefs, and experiences regarding the number of medications that they are taking, and how they would feel about cessation of one or more of their medications. 

The G-MEDSS deprescribing report for an individual patient includes the patients global goal of care, a summary of the patients current medications, the patients DBI score and information about interpreting the DBI, information about the rPATD, and a summary of the patients responses to the rPATD. The G-MEDSS system also allows accredited pharmacists to enter medication recommendations and actions on the G-MEDSS reports to allow for the GP to comment on deprescribing recommendations. The G-MEDSS system also allows for a patient summary report (or carers summary report) to be produced that can be provided to patients or carers at the time of the Home Medicines Review (HMR).  

Accredited pharmacists are specially trained pharmacists who are able to conduct medication management reviews (such as a HMR) for patients, under the referral of a general practitioner. Accredited Pharmacists are usually registered with the Australian Association of Consultant Pharmacy or the Society of Hospital Pharmacy. The HMR service is an Australian government-funded community-based collaborative service between the patient, general practitioner (GP) and accredited pharmacist. As part of the service, an accredited pharmacist receives a referral for a patient from the GP (either directly or through the patients community pharmacy), conducts an interview with the patient (usually in the home) to gain a comprehensive medication profile, and documents medication review findings and recommendations in a report for the GP, which can then be used to formulate the patients medication management plan. 

Accredited Pharmacists in the intervention group in this study will produce G-MEDSS reports for their HMR patients to send together with the HMR report to the patients GP. This will be done once at baseline.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to report the demographics of the study population. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and histogram will be used to test the distribution of DBI in the study population. Previous studies have demonstrated that DBI is not normally distributed, as there are usually high proportions of patients who have a DBI score of 0. If this is the case, the Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests will be used to analyse continuous variables and Chi square tests for categorical variables to compare characteristics between groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses will be used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to investigate the associations between changes in DBI with clinically measured outcomes. All statistical tests will be two-tailed, and p values of &lt;0.05 will be deemed statistically significant. All data will be analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 24 statistical software.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: This project is a cluster randomised clinical trial investigating the implementation of a computerised clinical decision support system into the Home Medicines Review (HMR) service to deprescribe inappropriate medications in older adults. Older Australians aged 65 years or over are commonly prescribed multiple medications and the doctor may arrange for a HMR. This service is a way for the pharmacist and doctor to help manage medications in the home. This project is investigating to see whether adding a computerised system into HMR will help to use medicines effectively and to avoid any unwanted side effects.
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that the combination of pharmacist-led medication review (HMR) and a computerised clinical decision support system intervention that incorporates validated deprescribing tools and guides (e.g. drug burden index (DBI), patients attitudes towards deprescribing (PATD) and Goals of Care, i.e. G-MEDSS) may reduce the proportion of older adults using anticholinergic and sedative medications, and improve clinical outcomes in community-dwelling older adults.
Purpose: This study aims to test the efficacy of the addition of GMEDSS in HMR to:
	Reduce anticholinergic and sedative medication use (as measured by the DBI) in patients who are exposed to these medications
	Measure the effect of these medication changes on clinical and functional outcomes (adherence, cognitive and physical function, falls, institutionalisation, mortality)</summary>
