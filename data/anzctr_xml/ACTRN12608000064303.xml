  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in group one will watch a DVD  which will educate patient on how to minimise falls risk in hospital. In addition patients will receive their usual care.
Patients in group two will read a booklet which will educate patient on how to minimise falls risk in hospital. In addition patients will receive their usual care.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two groups and each will receive a different intervention. Both groups will recieve usual care. Both groups are Active.
 On the Orthopaedic Unit at Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) and on the Medical Ward at Swan Districts Hospital(SDH) this consists of 24 hour availability of nursing and medical care, daily physiotherapy, and referrals to other allied health professionals as required. On the Geriatric Aged and Rehabilitation Unit at PAH and at the Restorative Unit at SDH, there are also daily occupational therapy sessions, and social work assessment and management provided. A local falls risk assessment tool that has not been validated is used and orange arm bands are provided to patients assessed as being at high risk for falls at the PAH and a local falls risk screening tool is used by the nursing staff at SDH on patients admission.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accidental falls (event rate of falls  measured in events per time units) as measured during the participants period of inpatient hospital care. (The start of this observation period will be taken from the point of randomisation rather than the date of admission as it may take approximately 2 days to gain consent for participation, particularly where family members have to be approached).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From time of enrolment to discharge from hospital</timepoint>

      <outcome>Rate of fall-related injury during the participants in-hospital admission.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participant will be approached for consent by a researcher.  Once consent is provided the baseline data will be collected. The researcher will then open a randomly ordered opaque envelope containing the group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random allocation sequence will be developed by the project principal investigator using a computerised random number generator who will then produce the opaque sealed envelopes that contain the random allocation sequence.  The project principal investigator will not be involved in participant recruitment or opening the opaque envelopes</sequence>
