  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a fast irregular heart rate that can cause abnormalities in the structure and electrical function of the heart and can cause strokes through formation of blood clots in the heart which move to the brain. A stroke is when blood flow to the brain is interrupted. Although AF is known to increase the risk of stroke, there is new evidence that suggests that other factors may be independently present that cause formation of blood clots in the heart leading to a stroke.

The primary purpose of this study is to identify changes in structure of the heart, the electrical properties within the heart and in the blood chemistry that might increase a persons risk for having a stroke.
