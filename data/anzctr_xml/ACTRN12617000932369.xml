    <interventions>PIPA model of care: Women who attend the participating site (a large maternity hospital in metropolitan Sydney) for their initial midwife-led antenatal booking-in visit during the Intervention arm of the study (the last 12 months of the trial) will receive the PIPA model of integrated psychosocial care. 

The PIPA model of care comprises three key electronic elements:
1)	Administration of the Antenatal Risk Questionnaire-Revised (ANRQ-R) questionnaire (covering a range of known psychosocial risk factors) and the EPDS (including four additional questions to aid more guided exploration of recent thoughts of self-harm among women who endorse EPDS question 10, by the midwife) with responses recorded in a state-wide administrative data platform (eMaternity); 
2)	A computer-based clinician decision-support algorithm, which generates the womans psychosocial risk profile and self-harm risk scores (based on the ANRQ-R and EPDS), summarises the presence/combinations of identified risk factors and articulates six psychosocial risk levels, ranging from No Risk to High Risk; 
3)	Immediate referral prompts for the midwife conducting the assessment: these clinician prompts are embedded within a local folder in eMaternity, and are tailored to the womans psychosocial risk profile and available hospital-based support services.

The ANRQ-R is a revised version of the validated ANRQ (Austin et al 2013). It adheres to the recommendations of Australian national perinatal mental health guidelines and the New South Wales SAFE START guidelines, in terms of the minimum core set of psychosocial variables that are assessed. 

It is anticipated that the time required to complete the EPDS and ANRQ-R will be in line with the time required to complete the corresponding questions in Standard Care (EPDS and SAFE START psychosocial questions). Hence, no additional time has been allocated to the usual booking-in appointment during the Intervention arm of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care: Women who attend the participating site for their initial midwife-led antenatal booking-in visit during the first 12 months of the study will receive the care as usual (the NSW Health SAFE START model of care). 

This model of care includes completion of the series of psychosocial questions provided in the SAFE START guidelines as well as the paper-based Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which asks about symptoms of depression occurring in the previous seven days.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>This is a comparative-effectiveness study which will compare Standard Care to an alternative model of integrated psychosocial assessment (the PIPA model) sequentially over a 36 month period.

Women who attend the participating site for their antenatal 'booking-in' visit during the first 12 months of the trial will receive Standard Care.

Women who attend the participating site for their antenatal 'booking-in' visit during the last 12 months of the trial will receive the alternative PIPA model of care. 

There will be an interval of approximately 12 months to allow for the implementation of a new state-wide administrative database, which will incorporate the PIPA model, and one month of staff training for the PIPA model. During this time, women attending the hospital will continue to receive Standard Care, though no study data will be collected.

Study definitions

For the purposes of the PIPA Project, the following definitions will apply:

Referral: will be defined as the initial referral made by the midwife to one or more of the on-site support options. NOTE: Referrals to services external to the participating site are outside the scope of data collection for the current project, as are referrals made at later antenatal appointments (i.e., not the initial booking-in appointment).

Correct referral: a clinically appropriate referral made by the midwife, as determined by the consensus opinion of senior psychosocial clinicians at the weekly triage and Multidisciplinary Case Discussion (MCD) meetings. 

Incorrect referral: a clinically inappropriate referral made by the midwife, as determined by the consensus opinion of senior psychosocial clinicians at the weekly triage and MCD meetings.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>The primary aims will be evaluated using a between-groups design. Clinical effectiveness and Consumer Perspectives will be analysed using chi-square and independent-samples t-tests (or Mann Whitney U tests, as appropriate). Chi-square analysis of subgroups of women based on risk status may also be explored. Clinically significant differences between the two models will be based upon obtaining at least medium effect sizes or absolute percentage differences of at least 15%. Focus group data will be analysed using inductive thematic content analysis consistent with an interpretive descriptive approach. 

The cost-effectiveness analysis will be from the healthcare system perspective. The incremental costs and effects of Standard Care compared to the alternative PIPA model will be expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The ICER per correct referral made and per incorrect referral averted will be estimated using mean costs and effects and represented with 95% confidence intervals for the ICERs. Costs will be based in activity-based costing methods and will be presented in constant Australian dollars (AUD).

The secondary aims will be evaluated using a within group design. Receiver operator curve analyses will be conducted to calculate the area under the curve and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and positive and negative likelihood ratios negative likelihood ratios of each measure, using the M.I.N.I. as the gold standard (mood and anxiety disorder modules only). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies examining psychosocial and depression assessment programs in maternity settings have not adequately considered the context in which psychosocial assessment occurs or how broader components of integrated care, including clinician decision-making aids, may optimise program delivery and its cost-effectiveness. There is also limited evidence relating to the diagnostic accuracy of symptom-based screening measures used in this context. The Perinatal Integrated Psychosocial Assessment (PIPA) Project was developed to address these knowledge gaps.

The PIPA Project will provide evidence relating to the clinical- and cost- effectiveness of psychosocial assessment integrated with electronic clinician decision making prompts,  and referral options  that are tailored to the womans psychosocial risk, in the maternity care setting. It will also address research recommendations from the Australian (2011) and NICE (2015) Clinical Practice Guidelines. </summary>
