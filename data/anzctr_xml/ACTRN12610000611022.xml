      <outcome>Frequency and severity of adverse events. 

During each consultation, the chief investigator will use a questionnaire to record the type of adverse event (bleeding, haematoma, infection, unacceptable pain, aggravation of symptoms, feeling faint, drowsiness and/or sweating) and the severity of adverse event (mild, moderate or severe).

In addition, participants will be issued a diary so they can record any adverse event (as described above) experienced since the last visit. The participant will be asked to rate the perceived degree of severity (mild, moderate and severe) for each type of adverse event. An open response type format will also be available for participant responses. All adverse events will be managed by the investigators in this project. A detailed description will be made of adverse events that result in withdrawal of participants from the trial.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The allocation will be concealed in a password protected computer file. Concealment of the allocation sequence will be ensured as each participantâ€™s allocation will be contained in a sealed envelope. Envelopes will be made opaque by using a sheet of aluminium foil inside the envelope. In addition, a system using carbon paper will be employed so the details (name of participant and date of recruitment) are transferred from the outside of the envelopes to the paper inside the envelope containing the allocation prior to opening the seal.</concealment>
    <sequence>A simple random sampling procedure using a computer program (Microsoft Excel) will be used to generate an allocation sequence that will be used to allocate participants to either the real or sham intervention groups.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS (SPSS Corp, Chicago III, USA) software. If the participant has bilateral symptoms, data from the most painful side will be recorded and analysed. Data analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle using all randomised participants and missing data will be handled using a modified group mean substitution method. This method involves substituting the missing data value with the mean baseline score plus the difference between the mean baseline and mean follow-up score for that particular group. Standard tests to assess continuous data for normal distribution will be used and transformation carried out if required.

Demographic and anthropometric characteristics (gender, age, mass, height, body mass index, sporting activities, foot posture using the FPI will be determined for each treatment group. Summary statistics will also be calculated for duration of symptoms and side affected (left, right or both).

Outcomes measured at 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks will be analysed. A linear regression approach to ANCOVA will be used to assess for differences in continuous outcomes between the two groups. Appropriate non-parametric statistical tests will be used for outcomes that are nominal and ordinal scaled. The p-value will be set at 0.05.

Eighty participants (i.e. 40 per group) with plantar heel pain (who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be recruited. An initial prospective sample size calculation estimated that 76 participants will provide 80% power to detect a minimally important difference of 13 points in the pain domain of the FHSQ with a standard deviation of 20 points and an alpha set at 0.05. This sample size will also be sufficient to detect a minimally important difference of 19mm for the other primary outcome measure, first-step pain measured on a visual analogue scale.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A dearth of facts and abundance of opinions surround the optimal treatment of plantar heel pain. Despite its prevalence, financial burden and impact on the health-related quality of life, the Clinical Practice Guidelines for plantar heel pain proposed by the Orthopaedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association do not recommend one treatment over another. In addition, two systematic reviews have found few interventions that are supported by good evidence. 

An alternative treatment for plantar heel pain is dry needling, which involves stimulation of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) using a fine filament needle. Dry needling is increasingly used by physical therapists for the treatment of low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain and posterior thigh pain and is thought to improve muscle activation patterns, improve joint range of motion and alleviate pain. However, there have been no published randomised controlled trials that have examined the efficacy or effectiveness of dry needling for plantar heel pain. Hence, the aim of this trial is to investigate the effectiveness of trigger point dry needling for plantar heel pain.</summary>
