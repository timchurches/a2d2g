    <interventions>During the first part of the study with 24 participants ,periods 1 and 2, participants will be randomised to one of four treatment groups as indicated below. 
Treatment A  (2 tubes of 5 g = 10 g) of 2.5% ZYN002 applied once daily for 7 days (Period 1  Healthy Volunteers)
Treatment B  (2 tubes of 5 g = 10 g) of 2.5% ZYN002 applied twice daily for 7 days (Period 2  Healthy Volunteers)
Treatment C  (2 tubes of 5 g = 10 g) of Placebo gel applied once (Period 1) or twice daily (Period 2) for 7 days. Participants will receive the same number of treatments of placebo gel as the number of active study drug in order to keep the study blinded.
Treatment D  (2 tubes of 5 g = 10 g) of 1.0% ZYN002 applied twice daily for 7 days (Period 2  Healthy Volunteers)
During the second part of the study (Period 3  Patients with Epilepsy) with 12 participants, participants will receive the highest tolerated dose (Treatment A or B or D) from the first part of the study or placebo (Treatment C).
ZYN002 or placebo will be applied to the skin on the left and right shoulder and/or upper arm as a single application.
The gel will be thoroughly massaged into the left and right shoulders and/or upper arms by the participant. Once the participant has completed their treatment application they will be instructed to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water to remove any residual gel. Participants will be instructed to not lay or lean on either shoulder/arm, for at least 30 minutes post dosing. Once the application sites are dry each participant will wear a long sleeved t-shirt. Participants will be provided a clean t-shirt on a daily basis. Subjects will be permitted to shower more than 1 hour prior to each mornings dosing. All doses supervised by study staff at study site. Subjects are confined during the dosing period.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size for the study is chosen for the purpose of the study. No formal statistical assumptions are used to determine the sample size.
Pharmacokinetics: PK parameters listed above for ZYN002 (CBD) and THC will be calculated/derived from the data using non-compartmental analysis with WinNonlin. Plasma PK will be calculated on Days 1 and 7, urine PK will be calculated on Day 7 only. Actual sampling times will be used to estimate plasma PK parameters. Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, coefficient of variation, geometric mean) for the individual PK
parameters and plasma concentration over time will be presented by treatment group and period.
Differences in dose-dependent PK parameters (Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, Cav,ss, AUC) between Treatment A and Treatment B in healthy subjects will be compared via an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model or an appropriate non-parametric approach. Similarly, differences between the healthy subjects and the patients will be compared using the same approach. The predose Ctrough plasma levels over all the days of dosing will be compared statistically for assessment of steady-state at each dose regimen using mixed effect ANOVA model. Attainment of steady-state will be concluded if the 90% CI for the geometric mean ratio of Days 5/6, 5/7 and 6/7 are completely within the acceptance range of (0.80  1.25).
Neuropsychological Tests: The neuropsychological assessment parameters will be
summarized for each treatment period and time point using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum). The maximum change from pretreatment values, time to maximum change, and area under the change curve, will be calculated and summarized by treatment. In addition, the maximum change and area under the change curve will be
analyzed using t-tests comparing each treatment. The time to maximum change will be analysed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Safety Analyses: All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analysis.
AEs will be tabulated and classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) by treatment groups. Additionally, the total number of AEs and the total number of subjects with AEs will be identified for each treatment group.
Vital signs collected by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented by treatment. Changes from baseline in the vital signs will also be summarized by treatment. Safety laboratory test results and change from baseline will also be tabulated by treatment group. Pulse oximetry measured on Day 1 through Day 7 will be summarized by treatment. Application site irritation will be summarized using counts and percentages for each treatment and time point.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What is this study about? The purpose of this study is to investigate how safe and tolerable repeat doses (applied daily for 7 days) of ZYN002 transdermal gel is in healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy. The study will look at how the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and then removes the study drug from your body. This will be done by analysing the levels of ZYN002 in your blood and urine at various times following drug administration. Your skin at the application sites and your hands will be checked to see if there is any irritation or reactions present after ZYN002 application. The study will also investigate neuropsychological effects that ZYN002 may have by administering a number of neuropsychological tests.
Who is if for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 55 years and are either in general good health or have epilepsy with partial onset seizures that is stable. 

Study details: This study will investigate various doses of ZYN002 compared to a placebo gel (a treatment with no active ingredients which looks like the real thing but it is not). This study is double-blind which means you and your study doctor, together with the study staff administering the study treatment will not know whether you are receiving ZYN002 or placebo gel. 

What does study participation involve? Your participation in the study includes A screening visit, which could be up to 28 days before your study treatment. One confinement period starting on the evening before dosing and lasting until 36 hours after the last study treatment on the 8th study day. This will require eight (8) nights in the clinic. Two out-patient clinic visits following the confinement period on Days 9, Day 10, Day 11 and the End of Study Visit on Day 13. These visits will be at 48, 72, 96, 72 and 144 hours after the last application of the study treatment on Day 7. Additional out-patient visits may be required if there is any skin irritation present at the study treatment application sites. Throughout the study you will have various medical tests (physical examinations, vital signs measured, ECG measured, neuropsychological tests) and will have several blood and urine samples collected for laboratory analysis.
