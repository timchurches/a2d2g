  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once you have completed the initial questionnaire you will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups, which differ only slightly. Specifically, one treatment group will receive a phone call by one of the researchers and the second treatment group will not. The purpose of this telephone call is to complete motivational interviewing exercises, in order to motivate and prepare the client to engage with the online treatment program. This telephone call will take approximately 20-25 minutes and it will be recorded for quality and accuracy purposes. Consent for this recording will be obtained verbally at the start of the telephone call. One week after the completion of the initial questionnaire, you will be able to access the internet-based self-directed intervention for a duration of six weeks. The online intervention will allow participants to explore their gambling behaviour and develop ways to change or stop it completely. Modules that will be available are based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Motivational Interviewing and include considering the benefits and costs of gambling, personal motivation for gambling and reducing gambling, engaging personal support, psychoeducation, understanding and challenging irrational thoughts and beliefs, managing urges, behavioural strategies to reduce gambling, managing finances, planning for potential relapses, and addressing other life issues. Each of these modules will include information about the module followed by short answer exercises, in order to aid the participants understanding and comprehension of the material. Participants will be able to use the program as little or as much as they like, with no strict rule on the time spent on the program, per week. Adherence will be monitored through the frequency of log-ins, duration per login, modules completed, and attempts per module. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study will implement a treatment of gambling problems through use of an online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program. Participants will have access to this internet-based self-directed intervention for a duration of six weeks.  The online intervention will allow participants to explore their gambling behaviour and develop ways to change or stop it completely. 
The current study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes for problem gamblers completing a self-directed online CBT-based program, one with and one without the addition of a one-off telephone call with a clinician using a motivational interviewing.  intervention.</summary>
