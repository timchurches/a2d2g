  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive 4 cycles of epirubicin (90mg/m2, IV, Day 1) and cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2 IV, Day 1) followed by 4 cycles of Taxotere (docetaxel, 75mg/m2, IV, Day 1) and Gemzar® (gemcitabine, 1000mg/m2 IV, Days 1 &amp; 8), with the addition of Herceptin® (trastuzumab) if the tumour is HER2 positive (trastuzumab: Cycle 1: 4mg/kg IV day 1,  2mg/kg IV day 8 &amp; 15; Cycles 2-4, 2mg/kg IV day 1, 8 &amp; 15;  6mg/kg IV day 22 of Cycle 4).  Trastuzumab will be given for a total duration of one year (13 x 3 weekly cycles).
 
Larger operable and locally advanced tumours are associated with a poorer prognosis and a high risk of micrometastatic disease and require aggressive multimodality therapy. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy remains the core of most pre or postoperative chemotherapy regimens for early or locally advanced breast cancer unless contraindicated.  Given promising data, including the established benefit of docetaxel in the adjuvant setting and the use of gemcitabine in metastatic breast cancer, suggesting non-cross resistance and synergy with the taxanes, a phase II study consisting of 4 cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (day 1) and gemcitabine (day 1 &amp; 8) each cycle delivered every three weeks is proposed. For patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer, the addition of trastuzumab to the docetaxel and gemcitabine treatment cycles aims to maximize synergy seen between all three agents and minimize cardiac toxicity. These regimens aim to maximize the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) rate which may translate into a survival benefit in the long term. Breast cancer tissue will also be obtained to correlate clinical and pathologic response with changes in molecular parameters.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pathologic complete response rate of the primary tumour in the breast (pCR) after epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel and gemcitabine (DG) neoadjuvant chemotherapy in non-HER2 overexpressing breast cancer.  Pathologic complete response is defined as no evidence of invasive tumour remaining in the breast at surgery following completion of chemotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pathologic complete response will be measured after patients complete EC x 4 cycles, followed by DG/DGH x 4 cycles and at the completion of chemotherapy, following surgical resection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pathologic complete response rate of the primary tumour in the breast (pCR) after epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) followed by docetaxel, gemcitabine and trastuzumab (DGH) neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer (immunohistochemical staining 3+ or fluorescent in situ hybridization positive).  Pathologic complete response is defined as no evidence of invasive tumour remaining in the breast at surgery following completion of chemotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pathologic complete response will be measured after patients complete EC x 4 cycles, followed by DG/DGH x 4 cycles and at the completion of chemotherapy, following surgical resection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the clinical (assessed by palpation) and radiological (assessed by ultrasound) response rate, defined as disappearance of disease in the breast and axillary lymph nodes following 4 cycles of EC and 4 cycles of DG/DGH.  To determine the safety profile of neoadjuvant EC followed by DG/DGH.  To determine disease free and overall survival of patients during 24 months participation in the study.  To document the sentinel node biopsy outcomes at the time of definitive surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical tumour assessments will be performed during each cycle of chemotherapy (three weekly).  Radiological tumour assesments will be conducted before treatment, after participants have completed four cycles of chemotherapy (Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide), and after completion of all chemothrapy treatment, prior to surgery.  Sentinel node biopsy assessment will be conducted at the time of surgery, participants undergoing sentinel node biopsy will have an axillary disection as the same time to validate the sentinel node biopys outcomes.  Disease free and overall survial assessments will be undertaken three monthly for a total of 18 months, following the completion of chemotherapy and surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with chemotherapy. Expected toxicities and efficacy will be reviewed by the ANZ BCTG Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment toxicity outcomes will be assessed during each chemotherapy cycle (three weekly).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Expected toxicities to be considered by the IDMC will be grade III/IV non haematological toxicity excluding alopecia, infection, nausea and vomiting, any grade. Grade II pneumonitis and grade III/IV cardiac events (congestive cardiac failure, cardiac death). The expected rates are 20% grade III/IV non haematological toxicities, 5% grade II pneumonitis and 4% grade III/IV cardiac events. If, after 20 patients have completed 8 cycles of treatment, one grade III cardiac event, two grade II incidences of pneumonitis and five grade III incidences of non-haematological toxicity occur this would trigger a review of the study by the IDMC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Toxicity rates will be monitored after 20, 30 and 40 patients have completed at least 8 cycles of chemotherapy.  The specific timing of these IDSMC reviews will be dependent on the time taken to recruit 20, 30 and 40 participants to the trial.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ANZ 0502 (Neo Gem) clinical trial is conducted by the Australian New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group (ANZ BCTG) in a number of hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. 

The trial is for women with newly diagnosed large operable breast cancer or locally advanced breast cancer - which often involves the lymph nodes under the armpit (axillary nodes).  Larger operable and locally advanced breast cancers are associated with a poorer prognosis and higher risk of micometastatic disease.  

Standard treatment for this type of breast cancer usually includes chemotherapy to try to reduce the size of the cancer, followed by surgery and radiation therapy to treat any remaining cancer in the breast.  Whilst this treatment is successful in removing the cancer from the breast in the majority of patients, there is a significant risk of the cancer recurring. 

The treatment in this trial will involve a course of standard chemotherapy (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) followed by a course of two newer chemotherapy drugs for breast cancer (docetaxel and gemcitabine), followed by surgery.   The delivery of chemotherapy prior to surgery offers the potential to substantially reduce the size of primary breast tumours and allow for breast-conserving surgery or surgical resection of previously inoperable tumours.  It is hoped to also reduce the risk of recurrence of the breast cancer. 

The trial includes provision for patients with breast cancer tumours which overexpress HER2, by adding trastuzumab (Herceptin) to the docetaxel and gemcitabine (DGH) treatment cycles in order to maximise the efficacy of all three agents.</summary>
