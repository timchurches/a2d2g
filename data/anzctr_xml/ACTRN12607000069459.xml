  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both groups are interventional and will be enrolled either into a homebased program or clinical based program.  It is a comparative study of home-based management program versus clinic based intervention program.  Participants will have a total of four visits.  Each visit will consist of an interview and completion of quality of life questionnaires. It is anticipated that each visit will be 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours.  Each patient will have access to a core team of heart failure specialists including cardiologist, pharmacist and CHF nurse. These visit will be at recruitment and six-monthly intervals up to a maximum of 18 months.</interventions>

      <outcome>The composite primary outcome was event-free survival from all-cause death or hospitalisation (dichotomous variable) and related days alive and out-of-hospital.

All health outcome data were collected from the date of discharge to home from the index hospitalization. Outcome data were initially collected to March 31st 2011 using standardized methods of data extraction from hospital records. Thereafter, the same methods were used to collected data (extended follow-up to March 31st 2013) on all-cause mortality and hospitalization and related hospital stay. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We estimated this study would have 80% power (two-sided alpha of 0.05) to detect a 15% absolute difference in the primary end-point in addition to a 15% variation in the rate of all-cause hospital stay (in days) with 280 randomized patients.

Univariate comparisons of baseline data involved Chi square analyses (with calculation of odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] for categorical data, Mann Whitney U test for non-normally distributed continuous data (including the rate of hospital stay and health care costs) and Students t-test for normally distributed continuous data. All-cause mortality and event-free survival data were initially analyzed using Kaplan Meier survival curves. Days alive out-of-hospital were calculated as days of survival free from unplanned and all-cause hospitalization. Health care costs are calculated per patient per day. All costs are expressed in 2009/10 Australian dollars (AU$1.00  US$1.00). Backward, step-wise multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models (including baseline demographic and clinical profile data) were constructed to examine the independent impact of group allocation on: i) presence in the upper quartile group for most days of re-hospitalization, ii) event-free survival and iii) all-cause mortality.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a costly and debilitating condition. The benefits of applying nurse led CHF management programs (CHF-MPs) has shown that they improve health outcomes in CHF, especially in prolonging survival &amp; reducing hospital readmission. The aim of WHICH? is to determine whether clinic based or home based programs produce the best outcomes. A randomised study of 1000 patients is proposed. Patterns of health care and quality of life will then be compared. The perspective examined will be health, economic, health policy and consumer.</summary>
