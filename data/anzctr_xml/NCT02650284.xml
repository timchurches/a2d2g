  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oxford Knee Score - Comparing clinical outcomes using the Oxford Knee Score. The OKS is a participant completed 12 question form on activities of daily living that assess function and pain. Scores can range from 0 to 48 with lower scores indicating a poor outcome and higher scores indicating a more satisfactory joint outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months/ 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health related quality of life EQ-5D - Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by indicating the most appropriate level for each of the 5 dimensions. Responses may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. The index can be calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1= the value for full health. The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled from 100 ='Best imaginable health state' to 0= 'Worst imaginable health state'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months/ 2years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>VAS pain - Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the VAS pain. Pain at rest and pain during mobilization are measured using a 10 centimeter Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Participants are asked to indicate their level of pain with 0 being no pain and 100 being the worst pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months/ 2years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>New Knee Society Score (KSS) - Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the KSS. The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as "excellent," "good," "fair," or "poor," a higher value represents a better outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months/ 2years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) - Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the FJS. The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) is a 12 question form that asks the patient their level of awareness of their artificial joint in 12 scenarios commonly encountered in daily life. Scores can range from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating a better outcome (high degree of forgetting the joint in everyday life).</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months/ 2years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of loosening, reoperation and revision - To compare incidence of loosening, reoperation and revision rates. The incidence (ie number of participants who experienced lossening, reoperation or revision) will be counted and presented as a whole number or percentage of the total number of patients, however they will be identified from analysing Xrays and checking Serious Adverse Event/ Adverse Event reports.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of Hospital Stay - To compare length of hospital stay between the two arms of the study</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. The patient has a clinically deficient ACL and cruciate and collateral ligament
             insufficiency on CT arthrogram.

          2. The patient is undergoing revision surgery

          3. The patient has greater than 10° of hyperextension, greater than 10° of varus or
             valgus deformity, greater than 10° Flexion Contracture

             fixation of the prosthesis

          7. The patient's weight, age or activity level might cause extreme loads and early
             failure of the system (surgeons discretion).

          8. The patient has a systemic or local condition that would limit the ability to assess
             the performance of the device e.g. neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, disorder
