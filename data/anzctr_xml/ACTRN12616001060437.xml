  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be asked to consume two study products (placebo and active) during the screening visit. Eligible Subjects who can consume the products will enter the study and commence Run-In, a 14 day period.
During the 14 day Run-In period all subjects will complete a daily telephone questionnaire through an IVRS to document information on the previous day's cramps as well as obtain information on Subjects Spacticity through the measurement of the NRS.
Upon completion of the Run-In, Subjects will be randomised to one of two possible sequences (Control - Active  or Active - Control). Subjects will be allocated to each sequence in a one to one ratio. Subjects will be instructed to take study product two times a day, morning and evening.. Each Cross-over Period (Periods 1 and 2) is 14 days. There will be a 7-day Wash-out between Period 1 and Period 2

Subjects will be given additional study product to account for a 3 day window and potential spills/contamination.

Each treatment may include a combination of any of the following:
Component of Ginger
Ethanol alcohol (trace amount)
Lactose
Sucrose
Aspartame
Water

Participants will consume a single oral disintegrating tablet twice daily, morning and evening.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored via product return.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The sample size chosen for this study was based upon results from three previous Flex studies and was selected without statistical considerations. 
As there are multiple endpoints, it is assumed this sample size will be sufficient to provide initial indication of efficacy for the other endpoints. 
The following endpoints will be used in the study:


Worsening of the following from baseline:
Pain and Intensity of Cramps;
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) Survey; 
ALS Assessment Questionnaire (ALSAQ);
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for spasticity;
Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS);
Tardieu Scale;
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale;
Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale

Safety Endpoints:
Percentage of Subjects with treatment-emergent AEs;
Change in Vital Sign parameters from Screening; and;
Change in laboratory parameters from Screening

The study is exploratory in nature, The efficacy endpoints will be summarised by Treatment Sequence and Period. A paired Wilcoxon signed rank test will be conducted to test for treatment effect at the 5% level of significance. The following descriptive statistics: arithmetic mean (AM), standard deviations (SD), sample size (N), coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum and maximum values will be calculated for the continuous efficacy endpoints (primary and exploratory) by treatment and time point.
All data will be summarised based on the safety population and data will be presented by Treatment Group within Treatment Sequence and Treatment Group. The actual treatment received will be presented. </statisticalmethods>
