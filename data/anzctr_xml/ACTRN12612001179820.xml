  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will extract RNA from placenta samples to quantify gene expression using deep sequencing by RNA-seq and microarray platforms. This is a single time-point "snapshot" observation to generate the complete placental transcriptome in health and disease. A saliva sample from both mothers and fathers will also be collected in the antenatal clinic for genome-wide SNP genotyping to determine parent of origin allele expression in placentas</interventions>

      <outcome>Identification and expression level of all coding and non-coding RNA in placentas from normal pregnancies and those complicated by preeclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We will sequence RNA using the Illumina Hi-Seq platform to generate the data and test the differences between normal and complicated pregnancies using established and custom designed bioinformatics pipelines.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will collect placenta samples from both normal pregnancies and those complicated by preeclampsia (PE) or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). RNA will be extracted from these samples and will be used for whole transcriptome gene expression profiling including both coding and non-coding RNA. This will provide insight into differences between normal and PE and IUGR pregnancies in which the placenta is key to maternal and neonatal outcomes.</summary>
