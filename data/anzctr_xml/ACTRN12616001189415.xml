  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a 12 week structured multiple health behaviour change program (Women's Wellness Program) designed for midlife women. The intervention targets physical activity, nutrition, sleep and stress management. It incorporates health education and goal setting delivered through the Program Book, Website, and health consultations delivered by community based Registered Nurses (advanced practice &gt; 5 years). 
In this proof of concept study participants were allocated in blocks to one of three intervention groups/arms:
Arm A  independent unsupported online program, including
a.	Hard copy of the program book and access to the e-book
b.	Access to the Womens Wellness Program website (weekly program content, activity planner, discussion board, podcasts) 
c.	Administrative and technical support for website issues and questions by email or phone; 
Arm B - supported face to face group program, including
a.	Hard copy of the program book
b.	Administrative support for appointment attendance and questions answered by email or phone
c.	Attendance at a two hour health promotion group at QUT health clinics at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks facilitated by a registered nurse including health education and goal setting;
Arm C - supported online program, including
a.	Hard copy of the program book and access to the e-book
b.	Access to the Womens Wellness Program website (weekly program content, activity planner, discussion board, podcasts) 
c.	Administrative and technical support for website issues and questions by email or phone
d.	Online face to face 30-60 minute individual consultation with a registered nurse at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks, including health education and goal setting.

All participants were asked to access the program materials for 20-30 minutes daily in weeks 1-3. In weeks 4-12 participants were encouraged to use program materials regularly, at minimum twice a week for 30 minutes. 
Strategies to monitor/encourage adherance included weekly diary of physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake; discussion during nurse consultation; online diary; online groups received weekly reminder text messages and emails regarding activity planning and diary activities.
Following the 12 week intervention period, participants retained printed and electronic books. Access to the website ceased following the 12 week intervention period.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 22. Descriptive data expressed as counts and percentages, and mean (SD), and inferential statistics performed using chi square tests, t-tests, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and linear mixed modelling. Effect size also calculated using Cohen's d standard formula  to examine the magnitude of change in the three groups over the study period. Using Cohens guidelines an effect size of 0.20 as small, an effect size of 0.50 was moderate, and an effect size of 0.80 or more was considered to be a large. 
Sample size was calculated based on the outcome measure of Body Mass Index (BMI). The average BMI for Australian women is 26kg/m2, with the BMI for Australian midlife women aged 45 -54 being a mean of 25.2 (SD4.8) and 55-64 years of 25.8 (SD4.7). A difference greater than a one unit difference on BMI is associated with a meaningful difference of a 12% reduction of the odds of healthy survival (95% confidence interval 10%-14%). 
To achieve 80% power and a 95% confidence interval (a=0.05), the three study arms  required 43 participants each, assuming a standard deviation of 4.8 and an observed difference of 2.4 units after the 12 week intervention. Allowing for 15% attrition over the 12 weeks of the study, it was planned that n=148 be recruited.
