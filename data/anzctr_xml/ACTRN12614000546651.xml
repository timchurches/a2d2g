    <statisticalmethods>A feasibility estimate was conducted based on incidence in the previous five years at Melanoma Institute Australia. The eligible number of patients is estimated to be 85 annually: 27 patients with (micro) satellites, 13 with primary melanoma and in-transit metastasis and 45 with first in-transit recurrence.
A sample size calculation was conducted based on the assumption that a change in management in 10% of the study population is clinically relevant. A sample size of 34 from a population of 2000 achieves 90% power to detect a difference (P1-P0) of 0.1000 using a one-sided binomial test. The target significance level is 0.0500. The actual significance level achieved by this test is 0.0440.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the influence of whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT and brain MRI on management of stage III melanoma patients with satellite or in-transit metastases as a first recurrence or at time of diagnosis. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have satellite or in-transit cutaneous melanoma metastases as a first recurrence or at time of diagnosis, in absence of clinical evidence of nodal and/or distant metastasis. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will undergo staging total body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain at time of diagnosis of any first in transit or satellite metastasis to routinely screen for any distant metastasis. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a non-invasive procedure that uses a small and safe amount of a radioactive substance to detect disease in your body. A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan is also a non-invasive procedure and uses x-rays. Combined in a PET/CT scan this creates three-dimensional pictures of your body. A small amount of a radioactive material needs to be injected into a vein in your arm. The total duration of the procedure is usually 2 hours, the imaging itself usually 30-60 minutes. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a non-invasive procedure that uses a magnet and radiofrequency energy to produce detailed images of your body. An injection of contrast agent into a vein in the arm is required. The MRI examination usually lasts 30-45 minutes. MRI is not suitable for some participants with pacemakers or other metal implants. If the first scans do not show any suspective lesions and, after six months, there are no visible signs of distant spread of melanoma, both scans will be repeated once. We will determine the percentage of patients with change of disease management arising from these additional scans. Participants will be followed up at 6 months to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the scans and whether their disease stage has changed.</summary>
