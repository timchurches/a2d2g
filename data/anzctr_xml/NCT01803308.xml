    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - SB9200
Treatment: drugs - SB9200
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Experimental Part A - Experimental: Part A: Part A will use a single ascending dose protocol in small, open-label cohorts to determine the starting dose for Part B in the potentially therapeutic range.

Treatment: drugs: SB9200
Part A open-label, single ascending doses of SB9200 from 100mg - 1500mg.
