  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete only one phase of the trial, and will be randomised as to whether they receive 1a or 1b, or 2a or 2b first. Each intervention involves a single session, taking approximately 90 minutes. Each session will be conducted by a physiotherpist (chief investigator). There will be a 1 week washout period between interventions.


Phase 1: Intervention (1a): Isometric wrist extension exercise  5 x 45 secs with 2 minute rest between repetitions. 

Phase 2: Intervention (2a): Superior isometric exercise protocol as determined after phase 1 performed 5 x 45 secs with 2 minute rest between repetitions.
If after phase 1 no difference is shown between isometric protocols, the cheif investigator will make an a priori decision as to which exercise will be selected as for intervention 2a in phase 2)
</interventions>
    <comparator>Phase 1: Intervention (1b): Isometric wrist extension and supination exercise 5 x 45 secs with 2 minute rest between repetitions. This exercise is different to 1a as it combines extension and supination movements (2 directions of motion)

Phase 2: Intervention (2b): Isotonic exercise matched to  intervention 2a above for time under tension and load.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lateral epicondylalgia (tendinopathy of the wrist extensors at the lateral epicondyle) is a common condition seen in middle aged people, and despite this, best management is poorly understood. Isometric exercises have been shown as effective in treating tendinopathies in the lower limb, however no-one has investigated the impact of different exercise protocols on immediate pain in the upper limb, and thus for lateral epicondylalgia. A two part cross-over study will examine whether different isometric protocols have better results on pain in this condition, and whether the superior isometric exercise is better than isotonic exercise for immediate impact on lateral epicondylalgia.</summary>

    <publicnotes>TMS Protocol:
Baseline measures of corticospinal excitability, SICI and LICI will be obtained using single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS, respectively. The accuracy of TMS will be optimised by aligning the coil with reference markers on a tight fitting cap worn by participants and marked with a latitudelongitude matrix, positioned with reference to the nasion-inion and interaural lines.

Single-pulse stimulus-response curves (corticospinal excitability) will be obtained during low-level isometric contractions of the wrist extensor muscle group. Low-level contractions will be performed by contracting the wrist extensors maintaining the wrist in neutral while performing a 10% MVIC, which equates to 5±1% of root mean square (RMS) electromyography (rmsEMG) during MVIC. A 10% isometric muscle contraction is a non-painful task for someone with lateral epicondylalgia. Consistent muscle activation will be confirmed by recording pre-stimulus rmsEMG throughout the session. For a single stimulus-response curve, 10 stimuli will be delivered in 20% increments from 90% of the participant's active motor threshold (AMT) up to 190% of their AMT. The stimuli will be delivered using a ramped protocol. The amplitude of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) or slope of the stimulus-response curve represents corticospinal excitability.

SICI and LICI are probed by providing a subthreshold stimulus that activates inhibitory interneurons that synapse onto pyramidal neurons in the M1 and results in reduced number of action potentials by the subsequent suprathreshold stimulus. To quantify inhibition, 10 single-pulse stimuli and 10 short-interval paired-pulse stimuli will be delivered in random counterbalanced order. Intensity will be set at 120% of AMT, which will be determined during familiarisation and adjusted if there is a change in AMT. The conditioning stimulus for paired-pulse stimulation will be set at 80% of AMT, the interstimulus interval will be 3 ms to test SICI and 150ms to test LICI, and posterior to anterior current flow will be used to induce I3 waves. SICI and LICI are represented as a percentage ratio where high levels of inhibition are indicated by a low ratio. Therefore, an increase in the SICI or LICI percentage represents a reduction in inhibition.

Participants will be tested at the same time of day and the same day of the week. TMS will be delivered using two Magstim 200 2 stimulators connected via a Bistim unit (Magstim Co, Dyfed, UK) and a 110 mm concave double-cone coil (maximum output of 1.4 T). The motor hotspot for the extensor muscle (with posterior-induced to anterior-induced current flow in the cortex) will be determined and AMT will be established as the intensity at which at least 5 of 10 stimuli produced MEP amplitudes of greater than 200 µV recorded from the extensor muscle.  Valid EMG data for the forearm can be captured with surface electrodes.

The area of electrode placement will be shaved to remove fine hair, rubbed with an abrasive skin rasp to remove dead skin, and then cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Bipolar gel Ag-AgCl electrodes (8 mm diameter, model E258S; Biopac, Goleta, California, USA) will be placed over the extensor muscle (centrecentre interelectrode distance=2 cm). A grounding electrode strap will be placed over the wrist and subsequently used as a common reference for all electrodes. All cables will be fastened with tape to prevent movement artefact. The location of electrodes will be marked with a permanent marker by tracing around the electrode, and measured from ulnar styloid to lateral epicondyle to maximise consistency of electrode placement relative to the innervation zone. An impedance metre will be used to check that impedance does not exceed 10 kO prior to testing. Surface EMG (sEMG) signals will be amplified (×1000), bandpass filtered (high pass at 13 Hz, low pass at 1000 Hz), digitised online at 2 kHz for 500 ms, recorded and analysed using PowerLab 4/35 (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, Australia).

Pre-stimulus rmsEMG activity will be determined in the muscle, 100 ms prior to each TMS stimulus during pretesting and post-testing. Any trial in which prestimulus rmsEMG exceeds 5±1% of maximal rmsEMG will be discarded and the trial repeated. The surface rmsEMG will be calculated from a 500 ms segment that occurred during the asymptote of each maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and was calculated as the amplitude of the RMS value.</publicnotes>
