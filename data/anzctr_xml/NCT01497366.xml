  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sofosbuvir
Treatment: drugs - PEG
Treatment: drugs - RBV

Experimental: Sofosbuvir+RBV - Participants were randomized to receive sofosbuvir+RBV for 12 weeks.

Active Comparator: PEG+RBV - Participants were randomized to receive PEG+RBV for 24 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Sofosbuvir
Sofosbuvir 400 mg (2 × 200 mg tablets) administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: PEG
Pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG) 180 µg administered once weekly by subcutaneous injection

Treatment: drugs: RBV
Ribavirin (RBV) administered as 200 mg tablets up to 1200 mg in a divided daily dose
Dose of sofosbuvir+RBV group based on baseline weight: &lt; 75kg = 1000 mg and = 75 kg = 1200 mg

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was to assess the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir (GS-7977; PSI-7977) in
      combination with ribavirin (RBV) administered for 12 weeks compared with pegylated interferon
      (PEG)/RBV administered for 24 weeks in treatment-naive patients with Hepatitis C (HCV)
      genotype 2 or 3. Efficacy was assessed by the rate of sustained viral response (SVR) 12 weeks
      after the discontinuation of therapy (SVR12). This was a non-inferiority study, and if
      non-inferiority was demonstrated, the study was then allowed to test for superiority.</summary>
