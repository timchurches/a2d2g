          -  Meets the diagnostic criteria for Hyper Eosinophilic Syndrome as defined by:

        Eosinophilia &gt;1500cells/ul for at least 6 months with evidence of symptoms and signs of
        organ system involvement or dysfunction that can be directly related to eosinophilia (with
        no evidence of parasitic, allergic or other recognized causes of eosinophilia such as
        connective tissues disease, malignancy) or Eosinophilia of &gt;1500cells/ul for less than 6
        months who meet the other criteria for HES accompanied by clear evidence of eosinophil
        tissue infiltration and with exclusion for secondary causes of eosinophilia as above.

          -  Compassionate use: Documented failure (lack of efficacy or a contra-indication) to at
             least 3 standard therapies (corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, immunomodulatory
             therapy, and Imatinib mesylate) at the appropriate duration and dose

          -  Long-term access: Entry of subjects who participated in a previous GSK HES study to

             study treatment is known) in a previous GSK HES study: Documented improvement in
             symptoms and/or signs of HES following treatment with mepolizumab or Subjects who
             received mepolizumab or placebo in a previous GSK HES study: The treating physician
             must confirm a positive benefit/risk ratio, and the anticipated clinical benefit from
             mepolizumab must outweigh any potential safety or tolerability risk in this study or
             Subjects who participated in Study 200622 should complete the protocol required
             assessments for the duration of 32 weeks after randomization. Subsequently, subjects
             should complete the 20-week assessments in Study 205203, open-label extension (OLE) to
             Study 200622, prior to being considered for this protocol (MHE104317). In addition,
             subjects should not have had an adverse event (serious or non-serious) considered
             related to study treatment while participating in Study 200622 or Study 205203 which
             resulted in permanent withdrawal of study treatment.

    <summary>104317: The market authorisation application for mepolizumab for the indication of
      hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) was filed in 2008, but later the file was withdrawn due to
      outstanding questions from regulator's raised from the application. On the basis of sponsor's
      evaluation, participants with life-threatening HES who have documented failure (lack of
      efficacy or a contra-indication) to at least 3 standard HES therapies (compassionate use) and
      participants who have participated in a previous GSK sponsored study in HES (long-term
      access) can be consider for mepolizumab treatment where the country regulation permits. In
      this study, participants will receive mepolizumab in an open-labelled manner, and limited
      data will be collected to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of mepolizumab.

      201956: This is a Long-term Access Programme (LAP) which aims to support provision of
      mepolizumab, until it is commercially available, to eligible subjects with severe asthma who
      participated in a GSK-sponsored mepolizumab clinical study in severe asthma. Eligible
      subjects will initiate mepolizumab within a 6-month period following the individual subject's
      last scheduled visit in their preceding clinical study. For each subject benefit versus risk
      will be assessed throughout the study to support continued treatment with mepolizumab.</summary>
