  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves the use of a new laser called the 2RT retinal Regeneration Therapy laser. The laser will be applied once only to one eye. It will be fired approximately 12 times near the arcades of the retina. It utilises low energy and extremely short nanosecond duration laser to produce very limited effects.</interventions>
    <comparator>The other eye will be the control in this trial as only one eye recieves treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in the appearance of drusen in a clinical evaluation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical evaluation will be conducted at baseline, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 12 month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An increase in visual functions of the treated eye. Visual functions will be monitored by measuring patients dark adaptation, static test which involves measuring thershold assesments for isoluminant read and blue increments and flicker sensitivity of 4 and 14Hz. Their Photostress cone recovery will also be measured for improvement. 3 questionaires will also be administered</outcome>
      <timepoint>Visual functions will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month. The questionaires will only be administered at baseline and 12 month.</timepoint>

    <concealment>The patient attends a screening visit to determine eligibility. A clinical exam of the retina is to confirm eligibility. Visual functions are also measured to assess the level of abnormality. If both criteria are fulfilled and the patient consents to partcipating in the study then the patient is enrolled. The eye which displays worse  visual functions and/or appearance is selected as the study eye.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical research study to trial a new laser treatment with the aim of slowing or partially reversing the progression Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a disease which affects the retina and can ultimately lead to  central vision blindness. Curently there is no treatment available for Early AMD. The study device is a laser which has been specially developed to treat retinal diseases and in this setting it is hoped it will target cells involved in the disease process and exhibit a wound healing effect which may lead to a delay or halt in the progression of AMD.  The results of the laser will be monitored by asessing clinical markers and measuring visual functions.</summary>
