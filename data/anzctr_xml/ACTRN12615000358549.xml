    <interventions>Test Product (T): Stelis Teriparatide [rh-PTH (1-34)] [teriparatide, Stelis Biopharma Pvt. Ltd., India]
Reference Product (R): Forsteo Registered Trademark (teriparatide, Eli Lilly Nederland BV, Grootslag 1-5, NL-3991 RA Houten, The Netherlands)
The volunteers will be administered 20 mcg Teriparatide from Test product or reference product through subcutaneous injection on either side of anterior abdominal wall, alternating between opposite sites in the 2 periods by trained nursing staff in accordance with the randomization scheme according to the instructions for medication administration of injection in pre-filled pen. 

The Test product Stelis Teriparatide rhPTH(1-34) is formulated as a multi-dose (28 dose) small volume parenteral containing 250 mcg teriparatide (r-DNA origin) as active ingredient, 0.41 mg Glacial Acetic Acid as buffering agent, 0.10 mg Sodium Acetate (Anhydrous) as buffering agent, 45.4 mg Mannitol as tonicity modifier, 3.0 mg Metacresol as preservative, Hydrochloric Acid Solution 10% q.s. and Sodium Hydroxide Solution 10% q.s. for pH adjustment, Water for Injection q.s. 1 mL. The sterile finished product solution is aseptically filled into pre-sterile cartridges. The sealed cartridges are then finally assembled in the pen-injector. Stelis teriparatide biosimilar is thus identical in composition and strength to the innovator reference product FORSTEO (Registered Trademark). Stelis finished product also does not contain any ingredients of animal or human origin.

The Formulation Components, intended dosage and route of administration of Stelis Biosimilar Teriparatide is identical to the innovator reference product FORSTEO.
The comparability criteria for Stelis teriparatide biosimilar is established for the finished product via a quality target product profile (QTPP). The QTPP was based on data collected on the reference medicinal product FORSTEO, including publicly available information and data obtained from extensive characterization of the reference medicinal product. QTPP formed the basis for the development of the biosimilar product and its manufacturing process.

Each of the 2 treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 4 weeks between injections in Period 1 and Period 2 </interventions>

    <concealment>This is a double blinded study. The randomization code will be provided by Pharmacokinetics &amp; Biostatistics Department to the delegated un-blinded site staff. The delegated un-blinded site staff will refer the randomization code to determine the medication to be dispensed for each subject. This will be dispensed into a suitably labeled container. 
Persons involved in this study i.e. investigator, physicians/nurses, analytical personnel, subjects will remain blinded at all times. Except for nominated individual(s) responsible for preparing the randomization code/code-break envelopes, the delegated un-blinded study staff who prepare, check and dispense the individual unit doses and drug administrator, will be the only staff who are not blind to the study drug and will  not be involved </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic concentrations and parameters will be presented descriptively using summary statistics and plots. Safety data will be summarized descriptively. All pharmacokinetic parameters, derived using non compartmental methods, and all statistical analyses will be performed using SAS v9.2.
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-inf of rh-PTH (134) in will be analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and the PROC GLM model statement will include the fixed effects of treatment, period, sequence and subjects nested within sequence. The sequence effect will be tested at the 0.10 level of significance using the subjects nested within sequence mean square from the ANOVA as the error term. All other main effects will be tested at the 0.05 level of significance against the residual error (mean square error/MSE) from the ANOVA as the error term.
Statistical tests of Analysis of variance (ANOVA), least square means for test and reference formulations, difference between test and reference formulations will be calculated for ln-transformed Cmax, and AUC0-inf Geometric least square means of test and reference formulations, its ratio, 90% confidence interval for geometric least square mean ratio will be calculated for Cmax, and AUC0-inf.
As this is a pilot study 24 subjects considered as this data will provide sufficient pharmacokinetic and safety data to plan the pivotal study. Sufficient healthy volunteers (at least 30 healthy volunteers) will be enrolled in the study to allow for at least 24 evaluable subjects who completes both the periods. Each volunteer will serve as his/her control and receive the test formulation in 1 of the study periods and the reference formulation in the other study period in a randomized fashion. No statistical calculations has been done to determine the number of subjects.</statisticalmethods>
