    <interventions>Kendall 'Trademark' AMD Foam Disc ('Registered Trademark') is a foam disk containing 0.5% polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), a broad spectrum antimicrobial that is effective up to 7-days (Covidien, Basingstoke, UK). The disc is administered as a dressing sponge which sits directly against the skin at the site of central line insertion. The disk is left in place for 7-days, unless there is a reason for removal or replacement (eg soiled dressing, treatment completed). The disk is placed by whoever inserts the catheter or by whoever changes the dressing. Adherence will be monitored by daily inspection of the site by a research nurse.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Biopatch 'Trademark' (Ethicon Inc, Somerville, NJ, USA) is a chlorhexidine impregnated disc that is designed to release 2% chlorhexidine and inhibit bacterial and fungal growth for a number of days. The disc is administered as a dressing sponge which sits directly against the skin at the site of central line insertion. The disk is left in place for 7-days, unless there is a reason for removal or replacement (eg soiled dressing, treatment completed). The disk is placed by whoever inserts the catheter or by whoever changes the dressing. The disk is currently part of the standard dressing at the research hospital. Adherence to the study protocol will be monitored by daily inspection of the site by a research nurse.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this pilot study will be based upon the requirements to assess feasibility. A sample of 50 per group will be sufficient to warrant extension to the larger trial if feasibility is established. Consequently, no statistical tests to assess differences between groups will be performed on pilot study data,  and only descriptive data will be reported. Analysis will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle, meaning all patients will be analysed in the group to which they were assigned.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A dressing containing chlorhexidine (Biopatch 'Trademark') has been introduced at the RBWH for all patients requiring a CVC. The dressing is expensive and the evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory. In related work we have some preliminary data showing that Biopatch may not be as effective as first thought in destroying potentially harmful bacteria. Another product, Kendall 'Trademark' AMD Foam Disc has shown promise and we propose to compare the two antimicrobial dressings.</summary>
