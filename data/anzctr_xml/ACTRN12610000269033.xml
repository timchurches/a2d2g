  <interventions>
    <interventions>At the discretion of their health professional, patients will be given technology to use in their homes to monitor their vital statisitics, and have this data then transmitted to a database for clinicians to review and action as necessary.  These devices may include such items as a blood pressure cuff and weighing scales, which the intervention group will be asked to use daily for up to 3 months. Patients will receive an initial triaining session, and a follow up session, on how to use the equipment, once they have consented.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care.  This is defined as best practice clinical intervention for the 3 disease-states being investigated.  This could include the use of vital sign measurement devices, but the patient data will not be electronically transmitted to a database for review, but rather retained in, for a example, a patient diary.  the researchers on the ASSET project will ensure they capture what 'usual care' entails for each of the cohorts.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Telecare involves monitoring and caring for people at a distance, such as people with long term conditions, who often need more care as their illness progresses. Telecare is a relatively new development in New Zealand and combines self-monitoring, whereby people with long term conditions monitor their symptoms to track progress, modify behaviours, or medications accordingly or assess when to seek help from health professionals.  ASSET will assess the effectiveness of a long term condition telecare intervention on Health Related Quality of Life, as assessed using the Short Form 36 (SF36) interview tool through distinct randomised controlled evaluations in Auckland and Counties Manukau as well as a formative and process evaluation of the telecare intervention in Tairawhiti.  Participants will be assessed at baseline with follow up at three (immediately post intervention) and six months (three months post intervention).  ASSET will aim to test the hypotheses that compared to conventional care in the community, telecare will (i) Increase the health related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with long term conditions; (ii) Increase time between first and subsequent hospital attendance for these people; (iii) Reduce ambulatory sensitive hospitilisations (ASH) rates; (iv) Improve the HRQoL of the primary informal caregiver; (v) Provide an economically more efficient means for the person, family / whanau, providers and funding agency to manage a persons long term condition; and (vi) Increase client and family / whanau satisfaction and sense of control. Participating patients are invited to include family/whanau.</summary>
