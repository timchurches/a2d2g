  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate all patients with cancer who were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit  at the Launceston General Hospital between 2006 and 2012.  The data from this trial will help to assess factors that may determine the survival of oncology patients who require an admission to the ICU during the course of their treatment. 
To document treatment modalities or any other related data for these patients in correlation to outcome.
To record any complications secondary to the admission to the ICU for future references.

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analysis will be descriptive and exploratory in nature. For categorical data, frequency tables will be produced including two-sided 95% confidence intervals for
proportions where applicable. For continuous data, descriptive statistics will be calculated and two sided 95% confidence intervals for means will be provided where appropriate.  Exploratory analyses might use for example, logistic regression, analysis of covariance or Cox proportional hazards regression method.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oncology and Haematology patients are at increased risk to be admitted to the ICU during the course of their treatment, especially when they present with an advanced or aggressive disease. Unfortunately there is high mortality rate among this cohort of patients. There are many factors that may play a crucial role such as presence of organ failure, intubation status, oxygen saturation and compromise to the cardiovascular system. It is important to study all these factors as well as other factors such as underlying disease and disease status in order to predict patient outcome. There are paucity of data in this regard and therefore it highlights the importance of this audit in our hospital.       </summary>
