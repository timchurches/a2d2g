  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients with lupus nephritis requiring therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide

          -  Lupus nephritis is defined according to American College of Rheumatology criteria as
             the presence of either:

               1. histological evidence from renal biopsy;

               2. persistent proteinuria of &gt;0.5 g/day or proteinuria &gt;3+ on dipstick; or

               3. cellular casts of any type. Patients will have had a renal biopsy performed to
                  determine the histological class of lupus nephritis. Therapy with
                  cyclophosphamide is typically used in patients with Class III, IV and severe
                  Class V lupus nephritis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cyclophosphamide is widely used in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases such as
      lupus nephritis. However, there is considerable variability in the response to
      cyclophosphamide treatment. Cyclophosphamide is a pro-drug that requires initial activation
      by CYP liver enzymes. Recent clinical studies have indicated a possible role of one CYP
      enzyme, CYP2C19 in this activation step. This enzyme has a genetic polymorphism (variants
      which lack functional activity) and people who have inherited these variants are poor
      metabolisers of certain drugs.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether response to therapy in a New Zealand population
      of lupus nephritis patients is determined by cyclophosphamide bioactivation (the metabolic
      phenotype) and CYP genotype.

      Currently there is no way of predicting a patient's response to cyclophosphamide. An
      understanding of the factors which contribute to the therapeutic failure in lupus nephritis
      is particularly important due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with this
      disease. There are other treatment options for lupus nephritis patients who fail to respond
      to cyclophosphamide. If successful, this study may help identify patients who are unlikely to
      respond to cyclophosphamide and thus should not be unnecessarily be exposed to the drug and
      may justify the use of newer, more costly immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate
      mofetil and rituximab.</summary>
