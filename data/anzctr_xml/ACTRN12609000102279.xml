  <interventions>
    <interventions>Unlike conventional rigid gas permeable contact lenses that are steeper in curvature in the centre and flatten towards the periphery, reverse geometry lenses are designed to have a flatter central portion and become steeper in the periphery, in order to alter the shape of the cornea in the process known as orthokeratology. Reverse geometry lenses will be worn in both eyes of each subject, but each eye will wear a different proprietary orthokeratology lens design (either Capricornia BE lens, or Paragon CRT lens) selected in a randomised manner. The participants will be required to wear the lenses overnight for 14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two proprietary reverse geometry contact lens designs will be compared in this study, one which uses an empirical fitting strategy, where the lens fit is selected on the basis of corneal topographical maps, and the other which uses a diagnostic fitting set, which relies on the clinician to evaluate fluorescein patterns beneath the lenses when in situ, in order to select the appropriate lens.  One lens of each type will be fitted to each eye of the patient (so that both eyes are fitted with lenses, one of each proprietary design).  Both lenses will be worn overnight for 14 days.</comparator>

    <concealment>The study was advertised in the University of Auckland using posters. Subjects who volunteer will be assessed to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. Subjects will be fitted with two different proprietary orthokeratology lenses, one in each eye.  Allocation of the lens type to the right and left eyes will be randomised centrally by computer.  The subjects will not know which lens is in which eye but will be advised not to swap lenses between eyes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects and lenses will be randomised using computer generated Latin squares</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To compare the short-term effects (2 weeks) of two different orthokeratology lens systems.  Orthokeratology is the application of specially designed rigid contact lenses overnight, to change the corneal shape and reversibly and temporarily reduce short-sightedness.  The purpose is to reduce your myopia with two different types of orthokeratology contact lenses and observe the changes in the eyes with advanced clinical instruments.</summary>
