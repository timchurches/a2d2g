Experimental: Unblinded Investigational Arm - Participants participated in an unblinded investigational phase of the trial prior to, and separate from, the single-blind cross-over phase of the trial. Data was collected from the his phase to aid the final development of the algorithm before proceeding to algorithm validation (ie. cross-over phase).

Active Comparator: Standard AutoSet algorithm - Participants first received therapy with the Standard AutoSet algorithm for one night, and then received therapy with the Modified AutoSet algorithm (an AutoSet device with an algorithm developed for sleep breathing parameters specific to females) the following night.

Experimental: Modified AutoSet algorithm - Participants first received therapy with the Modified AutoSet algorithm (an AutoSet device with an algorithm developed for sleep breathing parameters specific to females) for one night, and then received therapy with the standard AutoSet algorithm the following night.


Treatment: devices: Standard AutoSet algorithm
An AutoSet device with a standard algorithm developed for sleep breathing parameters that are specific to a particular gender.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and user preference of the Newport
      AutoSet for Her in female obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients.

      Efficacy will be evaluated by comparing the apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen
      desaturation index (ODI) of the Newport AutoSet for Her algorithm to a standard algorithm.

      User preference will be evaluated by subjective feedback relating to comfort, ease of falling
      asleep, sleep disturbance and feeling of being refreshed.</summary>
