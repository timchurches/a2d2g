  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1
Ultra-low dose TEL/AML/IND: telmisartan (TEL 10 mg once daily, oral tablet), amlodipine (AML 1.25 mg once daily, oral tablet), and indapamide (IND 0.625 mg once daily oral tablet) for two weeks
Or
Arm 2
Standard-low -dose LOS/AML/HCT: losartan (LOS 25 mg once daily, oral tablet), amlodipine (AML 2.5 mg once daily, oral tablet), and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT 12.5 mg once daily, oral tablet) for four weeks.

Each drug will be administered via oral tablet once daily. Adherence will be monitored by drug tablet return and diary card completion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Short-term safety of the ultra-low dose combination of TEL/AML/IND and the standard low-dose combination LOS/AML/HCT
Safety is defined as the absence of any of the following:
1.	Systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg
2.	Symptoms suggestive of hypotension (e.g. dizziness, light headedness)
3.	Clinically significant changes in ECG
4.	Clinically significant changes in blood biochemistry
5.	Any other clinical outcome for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event or suspected adverse event 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two weeks after randomisation
Adverse Events assessed at every visit through Adverse Events questioning and physical examinations (screening and End of Study visit). Symptoms are recorded daily in a diary card. Blood pressure (using Electronic sphygmomanometer) assessed at screening, randomisation and end of study visit. ECG performed at screening and end of study visit.

Common side effects occurring in 1-10% of patients include: 
	Musculoskeletal trauma, fatigue, feeling of coldness or numbness in the extremities, hypotension (low blood pressure)

Uncommon side effects, occurring in 0.1  1% of patients, of blood pressure lowering medications include:
	Weakness, increased sweating, general discomfort &amp; unease, weight gain, oedema (fluid retention), flushing (redness of the skin), palpitation, nausea, abdominal pain, allergic reactions, back pain, hot flushes, pain, chills, dry mouth, dizziness 

Rare and very rare side effects, occurring in less than 0.1% of patients include:
	Weight decrease, cold and clammy skin

The risks of a blood test include pain, a bruise at the point where the blood is taken, redness and swelling of the vein, infection, and a rare risk of fainting.

      <outcome>Change from baseline to Week 2 in systolic blood pressure</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised, parallel, open-label study for patients with hypertension, conducted by George Medicines. Ethical approval will be sought in November 2017, shortly followed by regulatory acknowledgement. 

This research project aims to understand whether a single pill containing 3 types of blood pressure lowering medications at quarter-standard doses will more effectively lower blood pressure and have fewer side effects compared to a standard dose of a single type of hypertensive medication.

This research project will assess two different pill combinations for the treatment of high blood pressure, they are:

	Ultra-low dose: telmisartan (10 mg), amlodipine (1.25 mg), and indapamide (0.625 mg) 

	Low-dose: losartan (25 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) </summary>
