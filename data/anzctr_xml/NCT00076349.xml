Experimental: 1 - open-label, single arm, clinical trial of bendamustine (SDX-105) plus rituximab


Treatment: drugs: bendamustine and rituximab
Patients will receive rituximab on the first day of a cycle at a dose of 375 mg/m2, followed on the second and third day of a cycle by SDX-105 (bendamustine) at a dose of 90 mg/m2/day of treatment. Four cycles are planned. Patients will receive a dose of rituximab alone 7 days prior to the first cycle of the combination and a dose of rituximab 28 days after the last cycle of the combination. If there is documented disease regression, a fifth and sixth cycle of SDX-105 plus rituximab may be administered.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>SUMMARY:

      This is an open label study combining Rituxan and SDX-105. Rituxan will be given on day 1
      followed by a 30-60 minute intravenous infusion of SDX-105 on day 2 and day 3. Treatment will
      repeat every 21 days (a cycle). Treatment can continue for up to 6 cycles (about 4 months) if
      tumor status improves and there are no unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed
      for up to 2 years or until disease progression.

      RATIONALE:

      Rituxan has been shown to increase the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy. The combination
      of SDX-105 and Rituxan has been effective in both the laboratory and in a recent clinical
      study with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.

      PURPOSE:

      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SDX-105 plus Rituxan in patients
      with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have relapsed after taking Rituxan.</summary>
