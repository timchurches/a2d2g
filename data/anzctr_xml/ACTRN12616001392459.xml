  <interventions>
    <interventions>See attached form for the intervention. This is a form that can be utilised by physicians to document conversations with patients and families about end of life management plans.

This form will replace the usual not for CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) form currently utilised at Cabrini hospital. All current forms will be replaced in the Emergency Department for the duration of the study by the new form that is being studied. Forms will not be replaced in other locations in the Cabrini network.

Doctors will receive face-to-face and email education about the new form in the two weeks preceding the intervention. The education will be delivered by an emergency physician (KW) in the emergency department face-to-face and will be a 5-10 minute conversation showing them the form and pointing out the sections available for use. The email will be similar, advising them that the usual forms will be replaced by the study forms with an attachment to the email including a copy of the form. There will be the opportunity for doctors to ask questions about the form face-to-face or via email. There are no educational tools other than the form, nor is there education in how to conduct a conversation about goals-of-care or resuscitation appropriateness/futility.

Only doctors will complete the forms and we anticipate using approximately 150 forms during a 12 week study period. Doctors are also able to document conversations in the regular medical notes if they prefer but there will be no other not for CPR forms available.

Adherence to using this form (rather than the usual not for CPR form) will be measured by retrospective review of all medical notes of patients enrolled in the study.

 All doctors in the ED will receive an email with the trial form attached and a 500 word description of the aim of the study. One paragraph explanation for each of the sections to be completed will be provided. Doctors will be asked to time the conversations on their phones and enter the data at the bottom of the form.

See form attached to ANZCTR registration record for the intervention</interventions>
    <comparator>Retrospective review of comparison group of patients (1 month before implementation). A group of patients matched for age/gender and SPICT status who were admitted from ED to the ward will be selected by research staff and Dr Katie Walker. The comparison group will be reviewed retrospectively for patient outcomes (length of stay; discharge or death) and evidence of discussion documentation (on the form and/or in the patient notes). The comparison group will also provide a baseline NFR rate.

The Supportive &amp; Palliative Care Indicators tool (SPICT) will be used retrospectively to identify those patients admitted via ED who were at risk of dying within 12 months. The tool identifies evidence of general deteriorating health, as well as evidence of advance medical conditions to identify those patients at risk of dying, akin to the 'surprise question' (would you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12 months). Patients determined to be at risk are those for whom goals of care discussions should be conducted, and limitations of treatment considered. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>All doctors attending the ED will be eligible for enrolment. All doctors wishing to document a Not for CPR decision will be required to utilise this form. The goals of care page is optional as are all sections individually within the form.

All forms will be sequentially numbered and a requirement of obtaining a form will be to provide the patient Universal Record number to the researchers to enable tracking of the patient records. Note that the form contains a research data entry space to record the estimated duration of the conversation and documentation of the discussion.

Doctors who use a form are eligible for semi-structured interview. All those using a form will approached face-to-face and by email to invite participation.

Interviews will be recorded and transcribed into NVivo. Data will be coded into themes and analysed by two researchers with experience in qualitative research. Any dissent will be reviewed by a third researcher. Interviews will continue until theme saturation is obtained.

The duration of consultations times will be analysed by simple descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD)

Retrospective medical review will be undertaken to determine the completion rate of each section of the form. Simple descriptive statistics will be used to analyse this data. (mean, median, SD)

No sample size calculations as this is a qualitative study. On prior experience we anticipate that at least two not-for-CPR documents are completed each day in the ED. Over a 12 week period, we anticipate that approximately 150 trial forms will be used and therefore each doctor is likely to complete at least 5 forms. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Health care delivered at the end of life should aim to deliver the outcomes desirable to the patient and family. Understanding the priorities for the outcome of care requires open and honest communication about health care options, prognosis, likelihood of survival and risks for cognitive impairment or functional decline. As prediction of death in any one admission is difficult, conversation about goals of care and undesirable outcomes should occur for those patients who are at risk of dying in the next 12 months (Gibbins, McCoubrie, Alexander, Kinzel, &amp; Forbes, 2009).

Completion of an NFR form is often the result of the conversation regarding outcomes acceptable to the patient or which may have a reasonable chance of success.   The survival to discharge outcomes for CPR in those aged 80 years and over is poor and there is significant morbidity especially in impaired cognitive function. However, the completion rate of NFR in the first 24 hours for those patients aged 80 years and over admitted acutely unwell to public or private hospitals is less than 20%. (Levinson and Mills, 2016 (in press)). The rate is significantly lower in private compared to public hospitals. Hospitals and the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine policy around NFR documentation strongly encourages discussion of resuscitation status with the patient. While NFR completion does not confirm that discussion of goals of care has occurred, absence of NFR in those who have a poor outcome from CPR (hospital inpatients aged 80+ years) is highly suggestive of an absence of goals of care discussion at least as it relates to acute deterioration and resuscitation.

There are many published barriers to end of life conversations. These include time, knowledge of the law, expertise and a desire not to rob the patient of hope.
At Cabrini there are no decision-making tools to assist with the issues to be addressed at end of life. There is a perceived need for a goals of care discussion to be documented in the patient file (personal communication senior nursing staff 4S, 3C and MET registrars) associated with the completion of NFR if appropriate to improve patient centred care and reduce futile cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 

The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility and relevance of a document to assist with the conversation about goals of care at the end of life, and to facilitate the completion of Not For Resusitation forms where appropriate in the Emergency Department at Cabrini Malvern.

The forms will be trialed over a 12 week period. At the end of this time, the forms will be evaluated for: 
Adequacy and completeness of the documentation
the utility and acceptability of the GCR forms in guiding and promoting discussion
Evaluate the interviews for themes relating to use of the forms.
Evaluation of patient outcomes (length of stay; discharge or death) and evidence of discussion documentation</summary>
