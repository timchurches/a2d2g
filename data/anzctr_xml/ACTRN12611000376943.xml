  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study with patients recruited over 1 year.  Tear drainage is measured by the drop test.  Measured aliquots of saline are placed on the ocular surface avoiding overflow for 3 minutes.  After this period, any excess fluid is quantified.  This test is performed 4 times, without punctal plugs, with both canaliculi occluded, and with one or other canaliculus occluded, in a randomised order.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When people damage their tear ducts through trauma or accident the patient may have a watery eye afterwards for the rest of their life. The doctor may decide to repair the tear duct but repairing the tear duct can be difficult and we are unsure how much function the tear ducts have after repair. We would like to measure how well the tear ducts work in patients who have undergone surgical repair. We have previously looked at healthy volunteers and have established what normal tear drainage should be, for comparison (reference in publication list below)</summary>
