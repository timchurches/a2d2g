  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Whole Body Vibration (WBV) exercise intervention group (WBV). Participants in this group will complete three 20-minute sessions of low-intensity WBV exercise each week for 24 weeks. Progression of Hz and amplitude will be dependent upon each individuals ability to tolerate the low level vibration (individual comfort and body resonance), but the starting level for all participants will be 6Hz. The WBV exercise is performed with isometric knee flexion ~20 degrees (+/- 5 deg.) which provides a dampening effect to prevent spine or head vibration. The effects of WBV will be monitored using a small health questionnaire &amp; perceived exertion scale - the results of which will be fed-back to geriatricians.
Arm 2: Simulated-WBV exercise intervention group (SIM). Participants in this group will complete three 20-minute exercise sessions each week for 24 weeks, in which they will mimic the standing on the machine (but with no vibration)
All sessions for groups 1 &amp; 2 (WBV &amp; SIM) will be supervised by University staff or trained students (all with 1st aid certification).
Arm 3: Control group (CON). No exercise intervention
All participants will continue to receive standard care.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: Bone health, to be assessed using Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (p-QCT) scans, in addition to biochemical markers of osteoblast and osteoclast activity. 

Serum Osteocalcin will be measured to quantify osteoformation (osteoblast activity), whilst bone resorption (osteoclast activity) will be measured by urinary levels of pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. These biomarkers are established measures for monitoring of bone loss, bone reformation and the effectiveness of treatments. Furthermore, whole body calcium and vitamin D levels will also be assessed, levels of which are shown to be inversely linked to rates of fracture and osteoporotic bone loss. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: Changes in cardiovascular parameters such as cardiac output, peripheral resistance,  blood pressure, heart rate, and left ventricular expulsion will be monitored throughout the study, using a FinaPress system.</outcome>

    <concealment>Following consultation with Care Home staff &amp; management, a presentation will be made to residents (including a demonstration of the WBV machine), and potential volunteers will be given information sheets. Approximately 1 week later, researchers will meet with interested volunteers, and commence pre-screening health measures. Upon collecting baseline measures, participants will be asked to choose between 3 cards (face-down) which will randomly allocate them to a group according to their selection.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The above indices provide quantitative data for comparative analysis between groups and over time (pre- and post-intervention), which can be analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and repeated-measures ANOVA for the different time points (t=0, 8, 16, 24 weeks of exercise and 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention).

Sample size was calculated based on a study of WBV effects on balance in elderly women where the measure of balance is directional control (Cheung et al, 2007). Effect size was based on mean changes of 0.6. For the probability, we considered an alpha level of p=0.05 for a two tailed test, (type I to type II error ratio of 1:2 i.e. beta=2 x 0.05 i.e. 0.1), and a power of 1- beta, i.e. Power (for two-tailed alpha 0.05) = 0.9. Using the effect size curves of Thomas &amp; Nelson (2001), the sample size required was calculated to be 252 participants (60 in each group + a 40% drop-out rate).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to examine the compliance and tolerance of low amplitude Whole Body Vibration (WBV) exercise in frail elderly both in the short (8 &amp; 16 weeks) and longer (24 weeks) term. The physiological, psychological and functional changes in balance, movement, and strength will be monitored  this will continue beyond the 24 week exercise intervention to determine any longer-lasting and detraining effects. A second aim is to investigate if WBV enhances the uptake of dietary calcium + vitamin D (Cholecalciferol) supplementation, and therefore increases bone mineral density beyond that seen with the treatment alone and could be an effective or preventative treatment for osteoporosis in old age.</summary>
