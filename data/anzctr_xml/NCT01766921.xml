  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentages Of Subjects Achieving Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Titers =40 Against A/H5N1 Strain. - The optimal aH5N1c vaccine formulation was evaluated in terms of percentages of subjects achieving HI titers =40 against homologous A/H5N1 strain, three weeks after second vaccination with either low dose or high dose of aH5N1c vaccine, according to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) criterion.
The CBER criterion for the elderly population is met if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the percentages of subjects achieving HI titer =40 meets or exceeds 60%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (day 1) and Three weeks after 2nd vaccination (day 43)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentages Of Subjects Achieving Seroconversion Against A/H5N1 Strain. - Immunogenicity was measured in terms of the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion or significant increase in HI titer against the vaccine strain, three weeks after receiving two injections of low dose or high dose of aH5N1c vaccine according to the CBER criterion.
Seroconversion is defined as, a postvaccination titer =40 in subjects with a prevaccination HI titer &lt;10; or in subjects with prevaccination HI titer =10, a minimum four-fold rise in postvaccination HI antibody titer.
The CBER criterion for the elderly population is met if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion for HI antibody titer meets or exceeds 30%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three weeks after 2nd vaccination (day 43)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects Reporting Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events, After Any Vaccination. - Safety was assessed as the number of subjects who reported solicited local and systemic adverse events following vaccination with either low or high dose of aH5N1c vaccine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From day 1 through day 7 after any vaccination.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events After Any Vaccination. - Safety was assessed using the number of subjects who reported any unsolicited adverse events, adverse events possibly or probably related to study vaccine, serious adverse events (SAEs), new onset of chronic diseases (NOCDs), medically attended AEs, AEs of special interest (AESIs), AEs leading to withdrawal from study following vaccination with aH5N1c vaccine</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 through day 387 after any vaccination</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Geometric Mean Ratios (GMR) Against A/H5N1 Strain Following 2-dose Vaccination Schedule of Either Low Dose or High Dose aH5N1c Vaccine. - Immunogenicity was measured as the GMR. The ratio of postvaccination to prevaccination HI geometric mean titers (GMTs) is reported.
The criterion is met according to the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) criterion if the geometric mean increase GMR (day 43/day 1) in HI antibody titer is &gt;2.0 for subjects &gt;60 years of age.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1; day 22; day 43 and day 387</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentages Of Subjects With HI Titers =40 Against A/H5N1 Strain - Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentage of subjects achieving HI titers &gt;40, three weeks after second vaccination with aH5N1c according to the CHMP criterion.
The European Licensure (CHMP) criterion is met if the percentage of subjects achieving HI titers =40 is &gt;60%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1, day 22, day 43 and day 387.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Percentages Of Subjects Achieving Seroconversion Against A/H5N1 Strain - Immunogenicity was assessed in terms of percentages of subjects achieving seroconversion in HI titers, three weeks after receiving two injections of either low dose or high dose aH5N1c vaccine according to the CHMP criterion.
Seroconversion is defined as a postvaccination titer =40 in subjects with a prevaccination HI titer &lt;10; or in subjects with prevaccination HI titer =10, a minimum four-fold rise in postvaccination HI antibody titer.
The criterion is met according to the European (CHMP) guideline if the percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion is &gt;30%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 22, day 43 and day 387</timepoint>
