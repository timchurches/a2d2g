  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be dosed topically with both placebo and active creams (150 micrograms) randomised to either lesional or non-lesional skin. Subjects will be dosed either once, twice a day for 2 days or twice a day for 14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo is made of the same cream composition but without the active ingrediant</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the safety and tolerability of the rHuB[beta]D2 cream in comparison to the placebo cream.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All treatment sites will be assessed by the study doctor at each clinic visit and patient asked to provide responses to tolerability questions.  For Stage 1 and 2 this will be every day for the duration of the stage.  For Stage 3 this will be approximately every second day for 14 days.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the change in the local dermatitis score SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) at the treatment sites of the rHuB[beta]D2 cream and the placebo cream between the start of treatment (day 0) and the end of treatment (day 14).  SCORAD efficacy assessed at Stage 3 approximately every second day</outcome>
      <timepoint>SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)of intensity items will be taken at each timepoint for each treatment site</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the change in the Staphylococcus aureus colonization rate at the treatment sites between the start of treatment (day 0) and the end of treatment (day 14).</outcome>
      <timepoint>For Stage 3, a bacterial swab of the affected area will be taken at baseline and Day 14 to test for Staphylococcus aureus.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the change in the colonization rate of any bacteria at the treatment sites between the start of treatment (day 0) and the end of treatment (day 14).</outcome>
      <timepoint>For Stage 3, a bacterial swab of the affected area will be taken to test for Staphylococcus aureus.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the symptomatic relief of the rHuB[beta]D2 cream and the placebo cream as assessed by the patient using a Likert scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will perform a 5-point scale to assess the symptomatic relief of all treatment sites at all timepoints.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
