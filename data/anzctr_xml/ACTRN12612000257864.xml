  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective randomised controlled study is to be conducted over 3 separate clinics to determine efficacy of PDT eze (a topically applied, naturally occurring pain receptor blocker) in managing sensory components, such as pain and discomfort, in relation to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and other causes of inflammation. The study will examine patients receiving treatment for solar dermopathy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizing standardized protocols with 5 amino-levulinic acid (5ALA). Differences in both acute and late phase pain and inflammation will be measured.
PDT eze and a placebo spray will be used on split body treatment, either arm or face, and therefore the participants are their own control. There will be 10 patients for each treatment area in each individual clinic, with a total of 60 participants included.
PDT eze and the placebo will be applied via a spray prior to treatment with PDT. Both will be applied to each participant in a split body application. Application of active and placebo treatments will be randomized and only known to clinician administering. 
Participants will be asked to give pain scores for both treatment areas on a scale of 1-10 following illumination. These will be recorded and compared to other participants ratings to determine whether PDT eze has an effect on the pain and discomfort experienced during inflammation caused by PDT.</summary>
