    <interventions>Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Treatment (radiotherapy) - Patients undergo reduced-field conformal radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.


Treatment: other: radiation therapy
Undergo 3D-CRT Undergo proton radiation therapy Undergo IMRT

    <summary>RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers radiation directly to the tumor may
      kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well radiation therapy works in treating young
      patients with gliomas.</summary>
