    <inclusivecriteria>1. =18 and =40 years-of-age

          2. Singleton pregnancy of 28 to 36 0/7 weeks gestation on the day of planned vaccination

               -  Documentation of gestational age will be based on one of the following composite
                  criteria. (Note: The Investigator should use the earliest ultrasound data
                  available to establish the study-specific gestational age dating):

                    1. Gestational Age Dating Based on First Trimester Data (data obtained =13 6/7
                       weeks): The date of the first day of the reported last menstrual period
                       (LMP) may be used to estable the gestational age if corroborated by a first
                       trimester ultrasound. If the gestational age estimation derived using the
                       LMP and the first trimester ultrasound are discrepant &gt;7 days, the
                       ultrasound will be used to establish gestational age. If LMP is uncertain or
                       unknown, the ultrasound-established gestational age estimation will be used
                       to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

                    2. Gestational Age Dating Based on Early Second Trimester Data (data obtained
                       14 0/7 to 21 6/7 weeks): The day of the first reported LMP may be used to
                       establish the gestational age if corroborated by an early second trimester
                       ultrasound (that estimates the gestational age between 14 0/7 and 21 6/7
                       weeks). If the gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and the
                       early second trimester ultrasound are discrepant &gt;10 days, the ultrasound
                       will be used to establish the gestational age. If LMP is uncertain or
                       unknown, the ultrasound-established gestational age estimation will be used
                       to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

                    3. Gestation Age Dating Based on Later Second Trimester Data (data obtained 22
                       0/7 and 27 6/7 weeks by LMP): The date of the first day of the reported LMP
                       may be used to establish the gestation age if corroborated by a later second
                       trimester ultrasound (that estimates the gestational age between 22 0/7 and
                       27 6/7 weeks). If the gestational age estimation derived using the LMP and
                       the later second trimester ultrasound are discrepant &gt;14 days, the
                       ultrasound will be used to establish the gestational age. If LMP is
                       uncertain or unknown, the ultrasound-established gestational age estimation
                       will be used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

                    4. Gestational Age Dating When the LMP is Uncertain or Unknown AND No Prior
                       First or Second Trimester Ultrasound Has Been Performed: An ultrasound
                       performed at screening within the second trimester (=27 6/7 weeks) will be
                       used to establish the gestational age of the pregnancy.

          3. Documentation of a second or third (between 18 0/7 weeks and prior to randomization)
             trimester ultrasound with no major fetal anomalies identified.

          4. Good general maternal health as demonstrated by:

               -  Medical history (including history of adverse reactions to prior vaccines and
                  allergies).

               -  Physical examination including at least vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,

                  cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal (abdominal), musculoskeletal,
                  lymphatic, and dermatologic organ systems; and documentation of fetal heart
                  tones. Note that abnormal vital signs may be repeated at the investigator's
                  discretion since these measures may be labile. Vital signs should be assessed in
                  the context of normal values for the third trimester of pregnancy (see the Study
                  Operations Manual).

               -  Clinical laboratory parameters that include:

                    -  For the first year of study conduct in any country, normal/clinically
                       insignificant blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine
                       aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin,
                       alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hemoglobin, white blood count, and platelet
                       count. Note that normal ranges for clinical laboratory parameters will be
                       based on reference ranges appropriate for the subject population under study
                       (i.e., third trimester of pregnancy) and as defined in the toxicity grading
                       scale (TGS) (see the Study Operations Manual).

                    -  For all subjects, serologic exclusion of infection with hepatitis B (HBV)
                       and C (HCV) viruses, syphilis, and HIV as documented by testing (performed
                       at the central or local laboratory) at screening or by medical records
                       during the current pregnancy.

          5. Able to understand, and both willing and physically able to comply with study
             procedures. This includes anticipation of reasonable geographic proximity to the study

          3. Grade 2 or higher clinical laboratory or vital sign abnormality. Exclusion of subjects

         21. Prior stillbirth or neonatal death, or multiple (=3) spontaneous abortions.

         22. Prior preterm delivery =34 weeks gestation or having ongoing intervention

             opinion, increase the risks of study participation to the maternal subject or the
