  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recurrent aphthous ulcer is chronic inflammatory disease without definite etiology. The effectiveness of topical antibiotics has been validated in the treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcer, such as chlorhexidine,  tetracycline, aureomycin, and  chlortetracycline. Although  they  could  dramatically  reduce  pain 
and healing time of ulceration, their side effects could not be neglected. For  these 
shortcomings, it is urgent to explore some other effective and safe antibiotics to treat 
recurrent aphthous ulcer.
Interestingly,  penicillin G  potassium, which  is  a  narrow-spectrum  antibiotic with 
known bacteriocidal effects against oral bacteria, has been proved effective and safe in  treating recurrent aphthous ulcer when  topically  applied  in America. But  no  comfirmative  trial  has  be conducted in other ethnic groups.

We  conducted  this  randomized,  double-blined,  placebo  and  blank  controlled, 
multicenter  clinical  trial,  in  order  to  clinically  determine  both  the effectiveness  and safety of penicillin G potassium  troches when  applied  topically  for  the  treatment of recurrent minor aphthous ulcer in a Chinese cohort.</summary>
