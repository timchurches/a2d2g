  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 by 2 factorial design
INTERVENTION 1:  Active manipulation of volatile anaesthesia and opioid to maximise frontal EEG alpha power.  The frontal EEG will be continuously analysed and dose-response curves created during the anaesthetic.  These will be used to guide bolus dosing of intravenous fentanyl, an opioid, and to guide the (inhaled) concentration of volatile anaesthesia administered.  The bolus doses and maximum and minimum levels will be determined in conjunction with the attending anaesthetist and will be based on previous responses in a dynamic process.

INTERVENTION 2:  Conversion from inhaled volatile to propofol (intravenous) anaesthesia for emergence from anaesthesia.  The volatile anaesthesia will be ceased at time of skin closure and propofol will be given by a target controlled infusion to an effect site concentration of 3ug/ml for at least 2 minutes and then ceased for emergence from anaesthesia </interventions>
    <comparator>Control 1:  Standard anaesthetic care without information regarding alpha power.  Typically this is based upon cardiovascular parameters and degree of surgical stimulation as judged by the attending anaesthetist
Control 2:  Standard anaesthetic emergence from volatile anaesthesia.  The volatile anaesthetic is ceased and high flow oxygen given to purge the circuit once surgery is complete.

Burst suppression alarm will be used on all participants as standard care.  One group receives intervention 1, one group receives intervention 2, one group receives both interventions and one group receives no interventions</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>To achieve statistical significance for a reduction in delirium from 16% to 8% requires 516 patients for the secondary endpoint of delirium (two-tailed alpha 0.05, beta 0.8, chi-squared test).   We aim to recruit 600 patients to account for dropouts, uncertainty regarding the predicted incidence of delirium in the study population with our protocol and to detect slightly smaller reductions in delirium, which would still be clinically significant .  We anticipate we will be overpowered for the primary endpoints of alpha power; it is unknown what constitutes a clinically important difference in the observed alpha oscillation - this study aims to determine this and whether it is subject to pharmacological manipulation during general anaesthesia</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Emergence delirium is a distressing complication of surgery and anaesthesia which is common in the elderly population.  It is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital length of stay, discharge to residential care and future cognitive decline.  From our previous work we have observed that emergence delirium seems to occur less frequency when alpha activity measured from frontal EEG lead is strong and maintained during emergence from anaesthesia.
We plan to conduct a 2 by 2 factorial study to assess the efficacy of 2 interventions which we hope may prevent emergence delirium.  Intervention 1 is the use of real-time frontal analysis and anaesthetic and opioid levels to guide anaesthesia to optimise alpha activity.  Intervention 2 is the conversion from volatile (gas-based) anaesthesia to propofol anaesthesia for the emergence (waking) phase of anaesthesia. We aim to determine if these interventions are successful in improving the observed alpha activity and subsequently reduce the incidence of emergence delirium in this high risk population</summary>
