Each volunteer will receive one of each infusion solution over 4 study days. Each study visit will be seperated by no less than 3 days.

Each study visit will last approximately 3-6 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Volunteers will act as their own control via administration of a single 0kcal/min intraduodenal infusion of saline solution, delivered at a rate of 4mL/min for 60 minutes, to enable comparison to nutrient containing infusions.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a screening visit. A series of screening questionnaires are answered by the volunteer, and a blood sample is taken for determination of ferritin levels. Eligibility is determined based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A signed informed consent form is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit using a randomisation table created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involves contacting the holder of the randomisation table (study assistant) to inform them of the subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution for infusion on each study day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ageing is associated with a physiological reduction of appetite and energy intake, which has been called the anorexia of ageing. Dietary supplementation with liquid protein preparations is now used frequently to increase energy and protein intake in older adults in both institutionalized and community-dwelling populations. Although the latter would appear a logical approach, evidence for success of increased energy intake in older individuals is limited. There is consensus that nutrient stimuli in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially in the small intestine, play a major role in the regulation of appetite and energy intake via modulation of GI motility and hormone release. Increasing our knowledge of how protein affects GI motility and hormone release is of increasing relevance in older individuals. Urgent investigation is warranted to determine the optimal load of protein that can be incorporated into their diet to assist in sparing muscle mass without reducing their appetite.
 
The study aims to characterise in healthy older individuals, the effect of different intraduodenal protein loads on energy intake, appetite, antropyloroduodenal motility, plasma concentrations of amino acids, gut hormones and glucose, and to determine the relationship between the suppression of appetite and energy intake by protein with small intestinal mechanisms.</summary>
