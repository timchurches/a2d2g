  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants (Cantonese-speaking Australians with type 2 diabetes) will be provided with a 6-session diabetes group-education (5x fortnightly 2hour session plus a 2hour follow-up session at 6-month from session 1 = over 6 months for the whole program) delivered by a multidisciplinary diabetes team (dietitian, diabetes nurse educator, physiotherapist and podiatrist).  The six sessions will be delivered in Cantonese and culturally-tailored to the Chinese people's preferred learning style based on evidence. The group-education consists of diabetes self-management information provision and participation in activities like resistance training led by the physiotherapist (using appropriate theraband individually-determined by the physiotherapist with a simple risk assessment and optional opting out). A lesson plan (see below) has been developed collectively by the health professional team with consumer consultation, to ensure consistency and enhance cultural appropriateness. To encourage attendance of all sessions, patient-participants will be presented with a certificate of participation upon completion (at session 6). 

To measure the effectiveness of the group diabetes education program, the following will be collected at session 1 (baseline), session 5 (8 week post-baseline) and session 6 (24-26 week post-baseline), and at 12 month follow-up: (1) height, weight, waist and blood pressure; (2) questionnaires regarding lifestyle habits, diabetes self-management behaviours, diabetes-related psychological distress, satisfaction with the education program; (3) blood test results (provided by participants' General Practitioner) for HbA1c and lipid profile. 

Lesson plan (aligning with the AADE7 self-care behaviours):
Session 1: Pathophysiology of diabetes, annual cycle of care (facilitator who is the dietitian) 
Session 2: Self-blood glucose monitoring &amp; medications (diabetes nurse educator) and dietary management (dietitian)
Session 3: Dietary management (dietitian) 
Session 4: Physical activity management &amp; exercise (physiotherapist) 
Session 5: Foot care (podiatrist) and diabetes related distress management (facilitator who is the dietitian)
Follow-up session: Progress discussion &amp; management of relapse (facilitator who is the dietitian) </interventions>

Data will be assessed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Significant (P&lt;0.05) changes in pre- versus post intervention outcomes will be determined using paired t-tests (2 time-points) and repeated-measures ANOVA (&gt;2 time points), or their non-parametric equivalent.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This intervention study will test the effectiveness and explore appropriateness of a Chinese multi-session culturally-tailored diabetes group education program which is designed to carefully match with the Chinese peoples preferred learning style and include Chinese-specific strategies to motivate and sustain healthy behaviour change. The research will involve recruiting 50 Chinese Cantonese-speaking people with type 2 diabetes into this study. Participants will attend a 6-session group education program delivered in Cantonese by a dietitian, physiotherapist, podiatrist and diabetes nurse. The program will then be evaluated on its effectiveness and appropriateness via pre- and post-program anthropometric and biochemical measurements, questionnaires and qualitative participant-observation. This research is expected to provide new practice ideas to enhance diabetes education, especially for the culturally and linguistically diverse populations.</summary>
