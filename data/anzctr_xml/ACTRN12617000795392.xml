  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A (probiotic group; 8-week duration): Twice-daily oral capsule of Bioceuticals MoodBiotic, containing 8 probiotic strains delivering 12 billion colony forming units (CFUs)  + no change to existing diet. Each oral capsule will contain the folowing probiotic strains:
	Bifidobacterium bifidum (Bb-06): 2 billion colony forming units (CFU)
	Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis: 1 billion CFU
	Bifidobacterium longum (Rosell-175): 1 billion CFU
	Lactobacillus acidophilus (La-14): 2 billion CFU
	Lactobacillus helveticus (Rosell-52): 2 billion CFU
	Lactobacillus casei (Lc-11): 2 billion CFU
	Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp-115): 1 billion CFU
	Lactobacillus rhamnosus (HN001): 1 billion CFU

Group B (prebiotic group; 8-week duration): High-prebiotic diet + twice-daily oral placebo (inactive) capsule. Dietary intervention involves eating 5 or more serves of prebiotic-rich foods per day. Prebiotic-rich foods are plant foods containing relatively high levels of fructans and/or galactooligosaccharides, as reported in the food-science literature. Some examples are asparagus, garlic, onion, oats, whole wheat, chickpeas, and watermelon. The remainder of the diet is subject to the participant's discretion. An online educational video (8-minute duration), prepared and delivered by an Accredited Practising Dietitian/nutrition lecturer will be shown to participants at their baseline session and a hard-copy handout provided. Content of video/handout: information on the high-prebiotic diet, suitable foods and how to introduce them into the diet, and recipe suggestions. The video and handout were specifically designed for the current study. Participants are responsible for purchasing and incorporating high-prebiotic foods into their diet. A hamper of shelf-stable high-prebiotic foods will be provided to participants at baseline, as a 'starter kit'. 

Group C (synbiotic group; 8-week duration): Combination of Group A (twice-daily oral probiotic capsule) + Group B (high-prebiotic diet) interventions

For all groups, supplement compliance will be measured by returned capsule count at 8-weeks. Adherence to allocated diet will be measured by completion of a purpose-built online dietary screener at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Group D (placebo group; 8-week duration):  Twice-daily oral placebo (inactive) capsule + no change to existing diet

Supplement compliance will be measured by returned capsule count at 8-weeks. Adherence to existing diet will be measured by completion of a purpose-built online dietary screener at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit a sample size of 128 participants (32 participants in each arm). The study is powered to detect a potential small to moderate difference between the treatment and placebo groups. Based on a two-tailed analysis with alpha=0.05, beta=0.80, and a critical F(3,124) of 2.68, 128 participants are required in total (Cohens d effect size of 0.30 or greater). Based on previous nutraceutical RCTs, attrition at the rate of 15% is expected, and to manage this, intention-to-treat analysis will be employed.

Data will be analysed using SPSS 22.0. Analysis of data will be conducted with blinding to group allocations. The primary efficacy analysis will assess average treatment group differences for the primary outcome measure (POMS total score) over the entire study period and use a likelihood-based mixed-effects model, repeated measures approach (MMRM). Results from the analysis of dichotomous data (e.g. demographics and genetic data) will be presented as proportions (e.g. Relative Risks), with 95% confidence interval, and Fishers Exact p-value where appropriate. Non-parametric statistics will be used when assumptions for parametric methods are violated. Cohens d effect sizes will be calculated. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted using a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals. Dose-response effects associated with intervention adherence will be explored utilising moderation analysis via SPSS Hayes PROCESS Macro Model 1. Mediation hypotheses will be assessed via SPSS Hayes PROCESS Macro Model 4.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To determine whether 8-week administration of dietary prebiotic foods and/or probiotic supplements reduces symptoms of psychological distress in non-clinical adults with low mood and poor diet quality, relative to placebo. Secondary aims are to measure the relationship between treatment response and changes in cognition, well-being, health-related quality of life, sleep, and bowel health, and to determine whether treatment response is mediated by changes in gut microbiota.

Hypotheses:
It is hypothesised that both probiotic and prebiotic treatments will be superior to placebo, while the synbiotic treatment will potentially be superior to all others, in the reduction of psychological distress. It is also predicted that this pattern will remain consistent for measures of cognition, well-being, quality of life, bowel health and sleep. Finally, we hypothesise that treatment response will be mediated by changes in gut microbiota (showing lower levels of psychological distress versus higher levels of psychological distress in placebo).

Design: An 8-week randomised controlled trial comparing the efficacy of a probiotic supplement versus a high-prebiotic diet versus a synbiotic treatment (probiotic + high-prebiotic diet) versus placebo in 128 healthy adults with poor mood and low dietary quality. The probiotic supplementation component will be double-blinded. Participants are community-dwelling adults aged 18-65 years who meet eligibility requirements for poor mood and low dietary quality.</summary>
