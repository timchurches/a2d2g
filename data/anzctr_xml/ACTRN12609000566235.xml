    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients that fulfil the eligibility criteria will be randomised to either 2% viscous lignocaine or the placebo mixture in labelled Bottle A and a study number will be allocated. All study drugs will be packaged in blinded containers stored in the locked ED cupboard labelled only with the study details and the study number.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be computer generated using block randomisation by the Clinical Biostatistics and Epidemiology Unit (CEBU). The randomisation will not be stratified. Sequentially numbered bottles of either study drug or placebo will be arranged according to this schedule by a pharmacist at the RCH. Once a patient has been randomised they will be given the next available study number which will equate to the next bottle (labelled Bottle A) in sequence.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at children with viral infections which create painful ulcers in the mouth. These ulcers can cause children to become dehydrated because the ulcers make drinking painful. This study aims to find out whether 2%viscous lignocaine, a numbing drug, helps children drink. 50 children will be given the drug and 50 children will be given a mixture which looks and tastes like the drug, but has no active medicine in it. The study will record how much fluid the children drink, and also look at whether or not any complications develop. This way, we hope to work out if 2% viscous lignocaine is a helpful medication for children with painful ulcers in the mouth.</summary>
