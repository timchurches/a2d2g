  <interventions>
    <interventions>Once consented participants will be randomised to one of eight conditions involving different feeding strategies. Babies will be randomized to one of eight conditions to receive either an intravenous nutrition amino acid solution or dextrose 10%, supplemental milk whilst waiting for expressed breastmilk feeds or exclusively breastmilk, and taste / smell given prior to gastric tube feeds or no taste / smell prior to gastric tube feeds. The participants will receive the allocated intervention until breastmilk feeding is fully established and the intervention is no longer required.
The eight conditions are below:
Condition 1
Parenteral nutrition, breast milk + supplemental milk to meet enteral fluid volumes,
taste/smell with tube feeds
Condition 2
Parenteral nutrition, exclusively breastmilk, taste/smell with tube feeds
Condition 3
Parenteral nutrition, breast milk + supplemental milk to meet enteral fluid volumes, no taste and smell with tube feeds
Condition 4
Parenteral nutrition, exclusively breastmilk, no taste and smell with tube feeds
Condition 5
Dextrose 10%,breast milk + supplemental milk to meet enteral fluid volumes, taste/smell with tube feeds
Condition 6
Dextrose 10%, exclusively breastmilk, taste/smell with tube feeds
Condition 7
Dextrose 10%,breast milk + supplemental milk to meet enteral fluid volumes, no taste and smell with tube feeds
Condition 8
Dextrose 10%, exclusively breastmilk, no taste and smell with tube feeds

Interventions and comparators
(i) parenteral nutrition vs 10% dextrose intravenously; (ii) supplemental milk (donor breast milk if available, else infant formula) vs only mothers own milk as available; (iii) infants exposed to smell and taste of milk prior to every tube feed vs no exposure (milk administered only via gastric feeding tube).

All babies will receive nutrition according to individual neonatal intensive care unit practices. The volume of fluids, parenteral fluid adjustments, amount of enteral feed and frequency of increases will as per clinician's discretion and no guidelines will be given around this. In addition, babies will be randomised to one of eight conditions. It is important to note that the first two interventions only apply until the baby is established on full enteral feeds with mothers own milk, which remains the primary nutritional goal. If randomised to receive smell and taste prior to tube feeds, this intervention will continue until the baby is no longer receiving any gastric tube feeds.

Parenteral nutrition: if randomised to receive parenteral the baby will receive an amino acid solution P100 (according to local hospital practice) intravenously, either by peripheral or central line as deemed appropriate. Administration of intravenous lipid is at the discretion of the clinical team, as is administration of any supplementary fluids, such as 10% dextrose. Babies not randomised to parenteral nutrition will receive intravenous 10% dextrose only (according to local hospital practice). 

Milk supplement: if randomised to receive milk supplement, the baby will receive donor breastmilk or infant formula (according to local practice) whilst waiting for mother's breastmilk to meet prescribed fluid amounts, any breastmilk the mother provides will be given to the baby in preference of formula and formula will only be used to make up any deficit as per medical team fluid prescription. Babies with a birthweight &lt; 2 Kg will receive preterm infant formula; babies with a birthweight &gt; 2 Kg will receive standard infant formula. Babies not randomised to receive milk supplement will only receive mothers breastmilk as available which is standard practice given it takes a couple of days for mother's breastmilk to come in. If the baby's birth weight is &lt; 2000g breastmilk will be fortified once receiving 5 mL every 2 hours as is standard practice in both units. As it is a pragmatic trial we anticipate that after a certain number of days some clinician's will not be happy to wait any longer for breastmilk it will then be up to their discretion on whether to start formula or intravenous nutrition depending on their "normal"practice". We do not propose any recommendations on number of days to wait as currently there is no evidence to guide practice therefore we cannot make any assumptions. The preterm infant formula will be either PreNan or Aptamil preterm formula depending on the site. The standard infant formula will change as both sites rotate there standard formula's every 4 months between Aptamil gold +1, S26 Gold Newborn and Nestle Nan Starter formula.

Taste and smell: If randomised to receive taste and smell, the baby will be exposed to the taste and smell of the milk feed prior to every enteral feed. If the baby is receiving both breast milk and supplementary formula, the smell and taste will be of breast milk if available, but if there is insufficient breastmilk, then smell and taste can be of formula.  However, if the baby is randomised to not receive supplementary infant formula then smell and taste can only be provided with breastmilk and taste should be given in preference to smell. To administer smell place 0.1  0.5 mL of milk onto a piece of gauze or cotton swab and place by the babys nose to remain in place until completion of the enteral feed. To administer taste for preterm babies give 0.2 mL of milk in a syringe on to the tip of babies tongue. Both smell and taste should be given immediately prior to administering the tube feed. 

The goal for all babies enrolled in the study is to transition to full feeds of expressed breastmilk as soon as possible.  If at any time the responsible clinician feels that any of the randomised interventions is no longer appropriate, they may withdraw the baby from the relevant intervention for clinical reasons.  They will be encouraged to discuss this with the trial Lead Investigator, Principal Investigator or another member of Steering Group before making the decision.   The baby will remain in the allocated condition group for the purposes of analysis (intention-to-treat principle).</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Unlike multi-arm, parallel RCT or comparative experiments, factorial experiments are designed to estimate main effects and their interactions. Each main effect and interaction analysis is, therefore, based upon the total sample size which is chosen to be large enough to detect all primary outcomes; having more factors does not increase total sample size. We have based our estimate on 90% power, overall type 1 error rate of 5%, alpha per main effect = 0.0167; estimated 10-15% loss to follow-up managed by multiple imputation. For interventions (i) and (ii): to detect a minimal clinically significant difference in % fat mass of 3% (lower 95% confidence interval) with a standard deviation of 4% and assuming a distance of 1% or more from the mean difference between the two groups with and without the intervention of interest requires 140 babies in the intervention and 140 babies without the intervention. The expected effect size is based on an estimated 3% increase in % fat mass in moderate to late preterm infants compared to term infants and an estimated 27% fat mass in term infants at 4 months of age. There are no good data on % fat mass beyond 4 months of age; therefore, this age has been used for the primary outcome. For (iii) To decrease time to full enteral feeds from 10 to 7 days (hazard ratio 1.43), requires 265 babies in the intervention and 265 in the non-intervention arms. Sample size is therefore 2 x 265=530. This sample size also provides &gt;80% power on a one-sided test with an alpha of 0.05 to detect a decrease in the proportion of 2 year olds surviving free from neurodisability from 80% to 70%.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our aims are to investigate the impact of different feeding strategies, all of which are in current use in NZ, on feed tolerance, body composition and on developmental outcome in MLPT babies, and to determine whether these differ by sex. We will address these aims through a factorial design randomised trial which will enable us to assess the effects of each intervention separately, whilst also exploring the effects of interactions. For the research questions being asked, this is a more appropriate and more efficient design than a multi-arm, parallel randomised controlled trial.
