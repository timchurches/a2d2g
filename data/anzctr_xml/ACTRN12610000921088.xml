  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Coherex Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion System is a permanent implant to close the orifice of the left atrial appendage and will be placed during a one hour percutaneous transcatheter intervention.  Post procedurte patients will be monitored for adverse events and in particular the occurance of thrombolic events originating from the left heart for a minimum of one year.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of major adverse events up to 45 days post-procedure.  Major adverse events are defined as life-threatening incidents as determined by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and include events such as:
1.  device embolization-assessed by imaging studies; 
2.  cardiac injury-assessed by clinical history and/or imaging studies;
3.   re-intervention, and/or device-related surgery- need based on clinical assessment;
4.  bleeding events such as pericardial effusion requiring drainage, cranial bleeding due to any source, gastrointestinal bleeding; or any other event related to the device or the procedure, which requires treatment-assessed by clinical assessment, laboratory and imaging studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>45 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of LAA occlusion at 45 and/or 180 days (+ten days) post-procedure.  LAA occlusion will be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) color flow Doppler and will be defined as absence of flow in the LAA or color flow Doppler jets less than 3mm.  The endpoint will be specified as closure at 180 days unless all of the patients are noted to be closed at the 45 day timepoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>180 days and/or 45 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary safety endpoint is the incidence of serious adverse events at 180 days and one year post-procedure.  Serious adverse events are defined as any events that result in death, are life-threatening, require in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or result in permanent or significant disability/incapacity.  All of these safety events are determined by a clinical assessment and assessed further, if necessary, by imaging and laboratory assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>180 days and one year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
1.	Procedural success, defined as successful delivery, deployment, and release of the Coherex Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion System into the LAA, and includes successful recapture and retrieval, if necessary.
2.	The incidence of LAA occlusion as measured by echocardiographic color flow Doppler jets less than 3mm by TEE at the end of the procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The end of the interventional procedure.</timepoint>

    <concealment>All candidates for LAA closure by percutaneous methods should be screened for study eligibility. A member of the research team should consult the patient’s private physician for permission to approach the patient.  If the physician agrees, a member of the research team should inform the patient about the study’s purpose and should obtain written informed consent.  Patients who meet the clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated by TEE to determine if all echocardiographic inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. Screening will not be considered complete until a patient has been determined to have an LAA with appropriate anatomy and size for placement of the Coherex Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion System.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary study objective is to verify that under normal conditions of use the Coherex Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion System is a safe and effective LAA occlusion device.  This investigation will be accomplished by:  1) implanting the device in patients with non-valvular paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent atrial fibrillation when anticoagulation is indicated for potential thrombus formation in the left atrium; 2) assessing LAA occlusion; and 3) monitoring adverse events at 45 days and/or up to one year post procedure.

The study will also be designed to demonstrate the safety of the Coherex Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion System by assessing: 1) ease of successful device insertion; 2) positioning accuracy; 3) placement stability; and 4) post-procedure adverse events.  To achieve this objective, data will be collected before, during, and after the procedure.</summary>
