  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) All the different treatment arms and doses that are administered
Group A : Subject receive 1000mg/day oral Channa striatus extract 
 Group B: Subject receive 500mg/day oral Channa striatus extract 
 Group C : Subject receive 250mg/day of placebo 
 Group D : Subject receive Glucosamine Sulphate 1500mg/day
 b) frequency and total duration of intervention. 
The frequency of investigational product consumption: each patient will be taking two capsules twice a day irrespective of their groups (total of 4 capsules/day). 
Total duration of intervention : 6 months
 c) Mode of administration : oral 
 d) Strategies used to monitor adherence/compliance:
Subject will be asked to return all the unused medication. The number of capsules issued and minus the number of capsules returned will be used to calculate the capsules taken. From this information, compliance will be calculated.
Compliance = (number of capsules taken / number of capsules required to be taken) x 100.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods> Sample size was calculated using Power and Sample Size calculation software (Dupont and Plummer, 1997) Sample size for comparing two means between treatment group (1000mg of CS extract) and placebo group were done. The parameters were as follows: 
 Level of significance = 0.05 , Power 0.9 , Standard deviation of outcome variables = 2.3 (N. Giordano et. al 2009), detectable diff in pop means (clinically sig difference in pain score between C.striatus extract group and placebo (cornstarch) group based on expert opinion) = 1.9 and the ratio between placebo group and Channa striatus extract group = 1 
The minimum required sample size was 32 and after considering the drop out rate of 20%, the sample size calculated for each group was 39. 
 Analyses will be done by using SPSS for windows version 22.0. Baseline data will be analyze using ANOVA and simple logistic regression. To determine the differences in the outcome parameters, repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANCOVA) will be used while controlling for weight and age for pain, stiffness, functional score and quality of life score. Changes were reported as estimated marginal means with its adjusted 95% Confidence Interval (CI). All reported p-values are 2-tailed with a value of less than 0.05 which is considered significant. For analgesic score and laboratory parameters ANOVA test will be used to detect the difference of the score between both groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Channa striatus is a fresh water fish belongs to the family Channidae, known as a valuable source of protein and natural remedy in traditional medicine in Southeast Asian region.Knee osteoarthritis is the leading cause of chronic disability at older age. Scientific studies have shown that Channa striatus (Haruan) extract has wound healing, anti-norciceptive and anti-inflammatory properties, thus postulated to have beneficial effects for osteoarthritis. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,  four-arm parallel comparative study of 1000mg/day oral Channa striatus extract, 500mg/day oral Channa striatus extract, placebo and 1500mg/day glucosamine sulphate among patient who had primary knee osteoarthritis. Participants are randomly allocated into one of four groups. They will received the investigational product for six months duration. They will be assessed on pain, stiffness of the knee joints, physical function, quality of life, safety measures and also consumption of analgesics at baseline, month three and month six.</summary>
