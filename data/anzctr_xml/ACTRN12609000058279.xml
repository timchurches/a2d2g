  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aimed to reduce the development of internalising disorders such as anxiety and depression by providing a brief education program for parents of preschool aged children who are at increased risk for these problems. Children were selected if they were highly shy and inhibited. Parents either received 6, 90 minute sessions providing information about how to reduce inhibition in their child, or received no intervention. It was expected that the brief intervention would result in reduced inhibition in the short term and hence reductions in anxiety and depression in the longer term.</summary>
