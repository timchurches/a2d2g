  <interventions>
    <interventions>The clinical controlled trial will comprise two sub-studies corresponding to the two populations of interest, namely carers and those bereaved by suicide. Participants within the experimental group of each sub-study will choose to undertake a six week program of counselling with a single Suicide Call Back Service counsellor through online, synchronous, text-based chat.  Participants in the control group of each sub-study will choose to receive the same six-week counselling program through telephone.  The counselling sessions will be delivered once per week for six weeks. Each counselling session will be 1 hour in duration. The counselling intervention delivered in each sub-study is the same; it is only the sample that differs between sub-studies (Sub-study 1 = comprising carers only; Sub-study 2 = comprising bereaved individuals only).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group of each sub-study will choose to undertake a six session program of counselling with a single Suicide Call Back Service counsellor through telephone. Each counselling session for both the experimental group and the control group will be 50 minutes in duration to ensure that participants groups are matched on length of exposure time to counsellors. The control group differs from the experimental group only in terms of the modality through which therapy is delivered, namely telephone (control) versus online synchronous chat (experimental).</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through the SCBS intake team, following either self-referral or referral from their treating health professional. Additionally, information advertising and describing the proposed study will be placed on the Suicide Call Back Service website.

Potential participants will be required to complete a screening questionnaire prior to participating in the study. Potential participants who are assessed as being at risk of suicide will be excluded from the trial and offered telephone counselling through the Suicide Call Back Service and appropriate referrals to local mental health services.

All participants will be required to register personal details, including full name, address, phone numbers, email address and contact details for their primary healthcare provider. This mandatory registration process for participation in the proposed study is intended to mitigate clinical risk, and to ensure that appropriate interventions may be facilitated if warranted. This mandatory registration process is inline with best practice guidelines for clinical trials of online therapy, and resembles closely the registration process for the larger Suicide Call Back Service telephone counselling service.

Participants will choose to receive a program of counselling from the Suicide Call Back Service by telephone or through online chat.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over 2000 Australians die by suicide each year, and many more are at ongoing risk of suicide. The consequences are profound for those who are caring for someone who is at risk of suicide, and for those who are bereaved by suicide.
The National Suicide Call Back Service (SCBS) is a professional mental health service that provides counselling by telephone to those at risk of suicide, those bereaved by suicide, and those who are caring for someone at risk of suicide. The SCBS has been funded to trial the delivery of its counselling service through online chat for carers and bereaved clients.
Given the rapidly burgeoning nature of the internet, an increasingly broad section of the general population can access mental health services online with ease. Literature suggests that online counselling is effective in treating a range of mental health issues. However, to date, no study has evaluated the efficacy of online counselling for carers and those bereaved by suicide.
The current study encapsulates two broad aims: 1) to examine the efficacy of counselling delivered through online, synchronous, text-based chat for carers and bereaved persons; 2) to examine the comparative efficacy of counselling delivered through telephone and online chat.
Two groups of participants, carers and those bereaved by suicide, will choose to receive a program of weekly counselling from the SCBS by telephone or through online chat. Participants will be asked to complete a number of psychological questionnaires prior to commencing therapy and following its completion. Results will be analyzed to assess if any improvements in assessed psychological domains have occurred in conjunction with the delivery of therapy.
Based on the relevant literature, it is hypothesised that both the telephone and video-conferencing counselling conditions will display simply benefits for carers and bereaved participants.  It is hoped that findings from this project will contribute to our understanding of online therapies and provide a valuable evidence base upon which to build an ongoing SCBS online counselling service.</summary>
