  <interventions>
    <interventions>The research project will involve 24 schools, 12 of which will be involved in the intervention and 12 as comparison schools. The agreement of the 12 comparison schools will be secured through a letter to each school. Four clusters of schools will be utilised in the Sydney, Illawarra, Hunter/New England and North Coast regions. This would allow a breadth of coverage across diverse socio-economic, rural, regional and urban schools. To address the geographical scope and the number of schools, we have a consortium of researchers as Chief Investigators, including academics with local knowledge and more immediate access to schools.  The Chief Investigators will act as critical friends to schools within their region to provide ongoing support and assistance to these schools over the course of the project. The participants of the Girls in Sport intervention are only those Year 8 students (in 2009) who have consented to participate. The Girls in Sport program will look different in each school. The intervention schools will receive the Girls in Sport intervention which is individualised for each school and each school develops themselves based on information that was collected in the formative stage of the project. This stage identified needs and interests of girls and teachers. For most schools, the Girls in Sport intervention will take place in the school sport period each week (approximately two hours), however, for others it will focus on lunchtime activities, physical education, before, and/or after school periods. It will take place on a weekly basis, however, the duration and frequency will differ from school to school depending on their intervention. Mostly the strategies will be implemented by the PDHPE staff, however, schools are encouraged to establish a Girls in Sport committee which includes PDHPE teachers, teachers from different faculties and girls from different year groups.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison schools will participate in their regular school sport. Comparison schools will be offered casual relief for teachers involved in the project, access to information collected from the research and funds to implement some of the strategies used by other schools at a later date. It is voluntary for these schools to implement these strategies at a later date.</comparator>

    <concealment>The NSW Department of Education and Training emailed all principals of secondary schools in NSW (N=500), calling for expressions of interest to participate in the Project. Interested schools were asked to contact the Department and then complete a profile for their school which was used to pair-match schools prior to randomization. This profile requested information about the school’s population (number of boys and girls), proportion of students from non-English speaking and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds, number and total Grades teaching experience of the physical and health education staff, and how school sport and physical education were organised in the school. Schools were then matched based on these criteria in addition to their type of school (for example, girls only, central school [found in rural areas where primary and secondary schools are combined on the one site under the same school executive], and technology high schools and their geographic location.  A member of the research team was then assigned to be a ‘critical friend’ at each school. This involved working with the school as it collected and interpreted their own data and assisting with the development, implementation, and evaluation of the school’s action plan. Within each school, all girls in Grade 8 (second Grade of secondary schooling) were invited to participate in the study. Information sheets and consent forms were distributed by staff, and students were required to return these in order to participate. If a student did not consent, they were still able to participate in the intervention activities but did not participate in data collection. The person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation was concealed by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was 'off-site'.</concealment>
    <sequence>This was a group randomized trial with school as the unit of randomization. Each matched pair of schools was randomly allocated to the intervention or control group using a computer-based random number producing algorithm. This was undertaken by a researcher independent of the project and then communicated to the research team who informed each school of its allocation. Due to the timeframe of the study, formative research was required to be conducted in the intervention schools in Term 4 (October to December 2008). This meant randomization needed to occur prior to baseline data collection.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overarching aim of the project is to investigate the impact of a NSW Department of Education and Training (DET) initiated program designed to promote girls regular participation in sport and physical activity. The research will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to: assess changes in physical activity and sports participation over the duration of the Girls in Sport (GIS) project; measure the impact of the GIS intervention on the enjoyment of physical activity, social support and self-efficacy of female students; evaluate the impact of the professional learning and participation in the intervention on teachers involved in sport and physical education at the GIS intervention schools; and evaluate the impact of GIS interventions on functional links between schools and community sport, physical activity facilities and services.</summary>
