  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sofosbuvir
Treatment: drugs - RBV

Experimental: SOF+RBV - Participants will receive sofosbuvir+RBV for 24 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Sofosbuvir
Sofosbuvir 400 mg tablet administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: RBV
Ribavirin (RBV) 200-mg tablet(s) administered orally in a divided daily dose starting at 400 mg, subsequently adjusted (range: 200 to 1200 mg in a divided daily dose) based upon a number of factors including hemoglobin value, creatinine clearance, and weight.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 12 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR12) - SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, &lt; 25 IU/mL) 12 weeks following the last dose of study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Posttreatment Week 12</timepoint>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) at 4, 24, and 48 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR4, SVR24, and SVR48) - SVR4, SVR 24, and SVR 48 were defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ 4, 24, and 48 weeks following the last dose of study drug, respectively.</outcome>

      <timepoint>Baseline; Weeks 2, 4, and 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Virologic Failure - Virologic failure was defined as on-treatment virologic failure or virologic relapse.
On-treatment virologic failure: HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment with subsequent detectable HCV RNA while continuing treatment
Virologic relapse: HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last observed on-treatment HCV RNA measurement and HCV RNA = LLOQ after stopping treatment (2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements or last available HCV RNA measurement)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Posttreatment Week 24</timepoint>

    <summary>This is an open-label, single-arm study of sofosbuvir (GS-7977) and ribavirin (RBV) in adults
      who have had a liver transplant which has become re-infected with hepatitis C. The treatment
      period is 24 weeks with up to 48 weeks of follow up. The total time in this study will last
      up to 72 weeks not including the screening visit.</summary>
