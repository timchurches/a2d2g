    <interventions>ARM 1: Patients with Type II Diabetes
After an overnight fast, a 1000 mL normal saline enema will be given by a registered nurse to cleanse the distal bowel. An intravenous cannula will be inserted into a forearm vein on each arm, one for blood sampling and the other for infusion of 25% glucose at a variable rate to maintain the blood glucose concentration = 5 mmol/L. The participant will then have the unsedated flexible sigmoidoscopy performed in the left lateral position using a flexible video colonoscope inserted first to the rectum, where four mucosal biopsies will be collected using biopsy forceps. The scope will then be advanced to the descending colon, where four additional biopsies will be collected. The colon will be perfused with a solution containing 3mg glibenclamide made up to 120 mL with normal saline (a 50 micromolar solution) At T=30 min, four additional biopsies will be collected from each site (total 16 biopsies per subject) and then the colonoscope will be withdrawn. A high carbohydrate meal with approx 45g of carbohydrates will be provided at T=120min, at which time the variable IV glucose infusion will cease and the subject will be observed for a further 6 hours with meals of sandwiches provided at 3 hourly intervals.
ARM 2 - Healthy Control
These people will undergo the same intervention and comparator treatment as those with diabetes.</interventions>
    <comparator>For both arms of the study, the 2 study visits (intervention and the comparator) will be separated by at least 1 week. 

The comparator treatment is exactly the same as the intervention treatment, however instead of the infusion of 3mg of glibencamide, a glucose solution (30 g glucose, made up to a total volume of 120 mL with water) will be infused via the endoscopic biopsy channel and continued at a rate of 4 kcal/min for 30 min. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been recently revealed that distinct mechanisms trigger the release of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the proximal and distal intestine in rodents. Stimuli for incretin release vary considerably between species, and whether such distinct proximal and distal mechanisms exist in humans has not been assessed.

Specific aims of the proposal are to:
1 - Determine the release of GLP-1 during acute colonic perfusion with glucose or the potassium ATP ion channel (KATP) inhibitor, glibenclamide, in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes;
2 - Determine the expression of glucose sensing molecules in functionally identified colonic cells, activated by glucose or glibenclamide, in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes.

We hypothesise that L-cells in the human colon can release endogenous GLP-1 following local inhibition of KATP channels. This signalling pathway may provide an avenue to augment endogenous GLP-1 release in patients with type 2 diabetes, which could potentially be used to optimise blood glucose control.
