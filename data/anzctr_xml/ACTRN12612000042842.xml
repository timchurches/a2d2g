  <interventions>
    <interventions>A routine urine sample taken for local cytology and / or urinalysis at the clinic immediately prior to an investigative cystoscopy for the monitoring of recurrent bladder cancer. An aliquot of this sample is taken for the purposes of this study.  Sample is aliquotted and preserved in stabilisation liquids and sent to lab for analysis. Aliquots will be used for urine cytology, NMP22 ELISA, NMP22 BladderChek and uRNA-2. Patient medical information is obtained. No deviation from standard care is undertaken. Patients may be asked for additional samples if they present for further scheduled cystoscopies within the duration of the study. No additional visits to clinic will be required as a result of participation in the study. Output of the study will be at the completion of patient recruitment and data cleaning and analysis. 300 patients are required for this study. Recruitment rates are variable but the recruitment window is estimated to terminate in September 2012.</interventions>
    <comparator>The single sample of urine is aliquotted into multiple tubes appropriate to the downstream test. 
Firstly a dipstick test is used to measure specific gravity, presence of white and red blood cells, and infection. 
10 mls of urine is added to a NMP22 ELISA stabilization liquid. 
NMP22 ELISA is an FDA approved IVD which detects the tumour marker Nuclear Matrix Protein 22, present at high levels in the urine of tumor patients.
NMP22 BladderChek detects the same marker but is a point of care test requiring 4 drops of urine. This test is performed at the clinical site but results are not used in clinical work up.
Urine Cytology is performed as per established protocols; Briefly, ethanol fixed samples are centrifuged to trap cells present in the sample on a membrane. The membrane is transferred to a glass slide and cells are stained prior to examination under a microscope.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve, positive and negative predictive values) of the uRNA-2 test for the detection of recurrent TCC in patients with history of urinary tract TCC in the last 5 years who have been treated according to standard practice and are undergoing routine investigative cystoscopy. The gold standard of recurrence detection to be compared with is cystoscopy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will provide a urine sample at the time of recruitment or prior to their next scheduled cystoscopy. Additional samples may be taken if the patients re-presents during the study window. No additional visit are required as a result of study participation.
Samples are analysed in batches and are not performed in time with clinical work up and are not reported to the clinician.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study focuses on patients who were diagnosed positive or had a recurrence for TCC over the past 5 years and who are undergoing a schedule of investigative cystoscopies and treatment for the possible (further) recurrence of urinary tract transitional cell cancer.  
Eligible consenting patients will provide a freshly voided mid-stream urine sample prior to cystoscopy (as per normal clinical practice). Part of this sample will be used for local cytology and other analysis as deemed clinically appropriate. The remainder will be used for dipstick analysis of specific gravity, presence of red and white blood cells and infection. Aliquots will be taken for uRNA-2, NMP22 BladerChek, NMP22 ELISA and urine cytology. 
This is a non interventional study. No deviation from patient care is undertaken. Results of the study tests are not communicated to the clinician and are therefore have no effect on patient treatment.</summary>
