    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and sh/she consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy of artesunate 4 mg/day over 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum
malaria in Kawthaung (Tanintharyi Division) in Myanmar.

Background: The artemisinin resistance is not just on the Thai-Cambodia border, but may have extended to or
emerged on the Thai-Myanmar, China-Myanmar and Cambodia-Viet Nam borders, confirmatory artemisinin
monotherapy in vivo studies and molecular fingerprinting of parasite genomes to track artemisinin resistance
(gene flow) moving around the region is even more important now. Of the data presented from these countries,
the slow parasite clearance time (PCT) following treatment with artemisinin derivatives was of greatest
concern. With combination therapy, artesunate usually provides the initial rapid decrease of PCT, with 95% of
patients clearing peripheral parasitaemia within 48 hours, hence if the PCT is slow despite the drug being in the
blood at adequate levels, this could provide evidence that it is failing.

Objective: To assess the efficacy of artesunate 4 mg/day over 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated
Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Kawthaung (Tanintharyi Division) in Myanmar.
Methods: An antimalarial drug efficacy trial will be conducted in Kawthaung (Tanintharyi Division),
Mzanmar. The participants will be febrile people &gt; 18 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum
infection. Patients will be treated with artesunate 28 mg/kg over 7 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters
will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The study will be conducted from
October to December 2010. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Myanmar in
assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and mapping the
extent of artesunate resistance.</summary>
