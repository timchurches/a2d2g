  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adolescent mindfulness intervention (.b mindfulness in schools programme). Lesson duration 40-60 minutes delivered once weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Lesson format is a mix of interactive activities, short talks and mindfulness practices. Topics include training attention, cultivating a curious, patient and friendly attitude towards experience, understanding worry, switching out of autopilot back to the present moment, learning to step back from thoughts and befriend difficult emotions, and applying mindfulness to movement. Delivered by external mindfulness teacher. A standard version of the curriculum and a modified version, with parental involvement, will be delivered and compared to a control group. The "Parental Enhanced" mindfulness group will receive the following additions: a one hour information session for parents before the trial commences, and access to a weekly you-tube clip (approx. ten minutes) that descibes the key points of the lesson and the mindfulness practices to encourage discussion with child, reinforcement of importance of homework practice, and perhaps undertaking the practices at home together. No formal adherence checks will be undertaken.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindfulness is an approach showing promise for youth, but at present the methodological quality of studies in this domain is low. This study is an extension of a pilot study and seeks to compare an 8 week mindfulness programme, the .b mindfulness in schools curriculum, with a control group and with a group receiving the mindfulness curriculum PLUS parental support (an information session and weekly updates regarding lesson content and practices taught). The inclusion of the latter is aimed at improving compliance with home practice, with evidence suggesting that this is positively related to improved outcomes. 
Hypotheses
1.	It is predicted that the primary outcome measures of anxiety, depression and weight/shape concerns will be lower in the parental enhanced mindfulness group compared to the standard mindfulness group, which will in turn be lower than in the control group at post-intervention and follow-up. 
2.	It is predicted that the primary outcome measure of wellbeing will be higher in the parental enhanced mindfulness group compared to the standard mindfulness group, which will in turn be higher than in the control group at post-intervention and follow-up.
3.	It is predicted that the mindfulness interventions (both groups) will be more effective in improving the primary outcome variables (anxiety, depression, wellbeing, and weight/shape concerns) in those with high levels of anxiety, depression, and weight/shape concerns (i.e., in those who need it most). Additional moderators will also be examined (socioeconomic status, gender, lesson length - which varies across schools) however no prediction is made as to the direction of influence for these variables.
4.	It is predicted that the parental enhanced mindfulness group will report higher levels of homework practice than the standard mindfulness intervention.
5.	It is predicted that improved outcomes in the parental enhanced mindfulness group will be mediated at least partially by level of homework practice. 
6.	No prediction is made as to which facets of mindfulness (as measured on the CHIME-Youth scale) act as mediators for improvements in outcome measures.
