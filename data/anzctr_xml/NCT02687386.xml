Experimental: Mitoxantrone packaged EDV - Mitoxantrone packaged EDV (EnGeneIC Dream Vector)


Treatment: drugs: Mitoxantrone packaged EDV (EnGeneIC Delivery Vehicle)
EnGeneIC Delivery Vehicles (EDVs) are nanocells which can be loaded with anti-cancer drugs (mitoxantrone in this study) and targeted to tumor cells. These bacterially-derived nanocells are coated in bispecific antibodies (BsAb) that recognize oncogenic receptors on the tumor cell surface. Once bound to the tumour cell, the targeted and drug-loaded EDVs are endocytosed and release their toxic payload to destroy the tumor cell.
