  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a random order patients undergo one 4 hr procedure of online predilution hemodiafiltration with acetic acid or citrate acid (Citrasate) concentrate respectively. In two weeks and in a cross-over manner they undergo the second study procedure with citrate or acetic acid respectively. Citrate concentration in Citrasate is 0,8 mmol/l.</interventions>
    <comparator>Acetic acid based concentrate will be used as a control treatment. Acetate concentration in dialysate is 3,0 mmol/l.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful finishing of HDF procedure without significant problems with blood clotting that would cause the extracorporeal circuit system exchange. </outcome>
      <timepoint>240 min of HDF procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>single pool Kt/V - HDF procedure adequacy calculated by Daugirdas formula: -ln((BUNPost / BUNPre) - (0.008 * Hours)) + ((4 - (3.5 * BUNPost / BUNPre)) * UFVol / WeightPost). 
BUN = blood urea nitrogen, post = after dialysis, pre = before dialysis, hours = hours of dialysis, UFvol = volume ultrafiltrated, weightPost = weight after dialysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>240 min of HDF procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>plasma thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) concentration during HDF procedure by Enzygnost TAT micro, an ELISA assay for thrombin-antithrombin complex determination</outcome>
      <timepoint>minute 0, 60, 120 and 240</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>transmembrane pressure (TMP) during HDF procedure - online data from dialysis monitor will be recorded</outcome>
      <timepoint>minute 0, 60, 120 and 240</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood clotting scale of dialyser after finishing HDF:
1 = no visible clots, 2 = clots in less than 30% of fibres, 3 = clots in 30-60% of fibres, 4 = clots in 60-90% of fibres, blood from the extracorporeal circuit is possible to return to patient´s circulation, 5 = clotted dialyser, it is not possible to return blood back to patient´s circulation. The evaluation of dialyser will be performed by the independent dialysis stuff. </outcome>
      <timepoint>240 min</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We want to test the hypothesis, 4 hr online predilution HDF with Citrasate is possible to be realized without manifest clotting problems even with no anticoagulation therapy. 
As a secondary outcome we want to describe coagulation cascade activation based on TAT concentration during this HDF procedure.</summary>
