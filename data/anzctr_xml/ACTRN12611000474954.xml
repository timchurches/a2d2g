  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the efficacy, measured as overall survival (OS), of elacytarabine and
investigator's choice in patients with late stage AML</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 months after last patient included in the trial.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare response rate and duration of response of elacytarabine and investigator's
choice in patients with late stage AML. 
Remission rate measured by overall response rate (ORR); i.e. complete remission(CR) and complete remission with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), Remission rate measured by CR, Remission duration analysed using cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) measured
from date of CR or CRi</outcome>

previous regimens.

b. have failed initial induction therapy, and have attained CR or CRi after
salvage therapy(ies), and then relapsed within &lt; 6 months, or
c. have attained CR or CRi after initial induction therapy and relapsed within
&lt;12 months, and failed to respond to salvage therapy(ies), or
d. have relapsed after the latest CR or CRi within &lt; 6 months
- Patients younger than 65 years should have received previous treatment with
cytarabine
- Patients must have recovered from previous bone marrow and/or stem cell
transplantation to a stage that the patient can tolerate the study treatment. There is
no restriction on number of regimens or type of treatment administered for
maintenance or consolidation during previous stages of the disease</inclusivecriteria>

symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or
uncontrolled congestive heart failure. Any NYHA grade 3 or 4.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares the safety and effectiveness of different types of chemotherapy to treat late stage acute myeloid leukaemia. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, for which you have undergone two or three previously unsuccessful chemotherapy regimens.

Trial details
In this study, participants are randomly (by chance) divided into two groups. One group will receive chemotherapy with the drug, Elacytarabine. This will be administered intravenously (into the vein) continuously for 3 days every 3 weeks. The investigator wil decide how long it is beneficial for you to receive treatment.The other group will receive one of a number of other chemotherapy regimens used to treat leukaemia. The treatment administered will be selected by the treating doctor based on your condition. 

Participants will be regularly monitored in order to determine the safety and effectiveness of treatment.</summary>
