  <interventions>
    <interventions>Implementation of a sleep management plan in ICU: This will involve educating ICU staff about the importance of sleep in the critically ill through education sessions and in-services, implementing a nightly schedule to reduce the volumes of monitors, ventilators, telephones, and pagers in the ICU, dimming the lights in the ICU and patient rooms, closing patient rooms curtains, and providing patients with eye masks and ear plugs if they wish to have them.
Education sessions will be administered by senior ICU medical and nursing staff. The intervention will take place for 4 months before data is collected again and while the after data is being collected. This will be a total of 6 months. Teaching sessions will occur for one hour, at least once a week. If on a particular week attendance by nursing staff is deemed by the investigators to be too low (less than five ICU nurses), then catch-up sessions will be scheduled on the following week for the same duration of the normal session and done in the same manner. This will be provided in group sessions. They will occur face to face during formal ICU education sessions. The adherence to the strategy will be logged through the ICU education program attendance checks 
The sleep management plan will remain in place in the ICU for the duration of the "after" data collection period.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The trial will have a sample size which comes from a dichotomous outcome from the primary endpoint. It will have alpha of 0.05, power of .8, to detect a 10% reduction in the proportion of patients that report very poor or poor quality of sleep in the ICU. It will require 210 episodes of patients being surveyed after spending the night in ICU. 
Statistical analysis will be done using chi-square analysis to detect a difference in the 2 groups. 
Secondary endpoints of light and sound levels will be analysed using student's t-test for continuous numerical data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep is a very important physiological process that helps the body heal when sick. The ICU environment is not conducive to achieving good quality sleep. Loud noise levels and bright lights during the night time are some of the things that keep patients form achieving a good night sleep.
This study will be a before and after trial where patients will be given the chance to answer a validated questionnaire about the quality and quantity of sleep that they achieved during every night spent in ICU. Sound levels and light levels will be measured inside patient rooms and at the nurses station at night. An intervention will then take place, which will be the implementation of a sleep management plan in ICU. This will include changing the culture of the unit to try and achieve low noise and light levels at night, implementing a schedule to decrease the volume of monitors and ventilators in the ICU as well as dimming and turning off lights at night. Patients will be offered eye masks and ear plugs to wear at night. Once the sleep management plan has become ingrained, a second period of data collection will take place where patient will answer the same questionnaire and noise and light levels at the nurses' station and patient rooms will again be measured. We hope to find a significant decrease in all measurements.</summary>
