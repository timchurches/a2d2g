  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Midazolam
Other interventions - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - RO7049389

Placebo Comparator: Part 1c: MAD in Healthy Volunteers (Placebo) - Participants will receive placebo matching to RO7049389 film coated tablet from Days 1 to 13 (either once a day [QD] or twice a day [BID]) and a single dose of placebo matching to RO7049389 film coated tablet in the morning of Day 14. Participants will also receive a single dose of midazolam solution (100 micrograms [mcg]) on Day -1 and Day 14.

Experimental: Part 1c: MAD in Healthy Volunteers (RO7049389) - Participants will receive RO7049389 film coated tablet from Days 1 to 13 (either QD or BID; dose and regimen will be decided based on the available PK and safety data) and a single dose of RO7049389 film coated tablet in the morning of Day 14. Participants will also receive a single dose of midazolam solution (100 mcg) on Day -1 and Day 14.

Placebo Comparator: Part 2: POM in Chronic HBV Participants (Placebo) - Participants will receive placebo matching to RO7049389 film coated tablet from Days 1 to 27 (either QD or BID) and a single dose of placebo matching to RO7049389 film coated tablet in the morning of Day 28.

Experimental: Part 2: POM in Chronic HBV Participants (RO7049389) - Participants will receive RO7049389 film coated tablet from Days 1 to 27 (either QD or BID; dose and regimen will be decided based on the available PK and safety data) and a single dose of RO7049389 film coated tablet in the morning of Day 28.

Placebo Comparator: Parts 1a and 1b: SAD in Healthy Volunteers (Placebo) - In Part 1a, participants will receive a single oral dose of placebo matching to RO7049389 film coated tablet on Day 1. In Part 1b, minimum 8 participants from Part 1a will be selected and 2 of whom will receive another single dose of placebo matching to RO7049389 on Day 16 after eating the standard United States - Food and Drug Administration (US FDA)-recommended high-fat and high-calorie breakfast.

Experimental: Parts 1a and 1b: SAD in Healthy Volunteers (RO7049389) - In Part 1a, participants will receive a single oral dose of RO7049389 film coated tablet on Day 1 in dose-escalation cohorts with a starting dose of 150 milligrams (mg). The doses for subsequent cohorts will be defined by an adaptive approach based on the safety and PK data in previously-dosed healthy volunteers. In Part 1b, minimum 8 participants from Part 1a will be selected and 6 of whom will receive another single dose of RO7049389 on Day 16 after eating the standard US FDA-recommended high-fat and high-calorie breakfast.


Treatment: drugs: Midazolam
Single dose of 100 mcg midazolam solution will be administered orally, before (Day -1) and after (Day 14) the treatment with RO7049389 or matching placebo

Other interventions: Placebo
Placebo matching to RO7049389 will be administered as per schedule described in individual arm.

Treatment: drugs: RO7049389
RO7049389 will be administered as per schedule described in individual arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is sponsor-open, investigator-blinded, participant-blinded, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study that
      will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      RO7049389 following oral administration in healthy volunteers and chronic HBV infected
      participants. The effect of food on the PK of RO7049389 and the effect of multiple dosing of
      RO7049389 on the PK of a single oral microdose of midazolam will be evaluated. The study will
      be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (1a [SAD cohort], 1b [Food-effect SAD cohort], 1c [MAD
      Cohort]) in healthy volunteers and Part 2 (Proof of mechanism [POM]) in chronic HBV infected
      participants.</summary>
