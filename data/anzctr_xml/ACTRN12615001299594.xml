  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delayed cord clamping (DCC) is slowly becoming common practice in the management of uncomplicated births in Australia, however it is unclear how the administration of maternal uterotonics such as oxytocin as part of the active management of the third stage of labour have on the newborn DCC. Oxytocin is administered prophylactically as it has been shown to significantly decrease the risk or post partum haemorrhage (PPH). PPH occurs in more than 5% of births and is most commonly caused by uterine atony, the failure of the uterus to adequately contract after birth. Oxytocin causes contractions of the uterus, which helps to reduce this risk. In Australia and New Zealand, an intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection of Syntocinon ('Registered Trademark'), a synthetic form of the hormone, oxytocin, is administered as the anterior shoulder of the fetus is delivered. There are currently no guidelines indicating how to prophylactically treat PPH during delayed cord clamping. Current standard practice of care allows for the provision of early or delayed cord clamping. however, if cord clamping is delayed a maternal IM injection of 10IU oxytocin is routinely administered with delivery of the anterior shoulder of the fetus. Therefore DCC is currently being performed under the influence of oxytocin without an understanding of the potential effects of uterotonic administration prior to cord clamping on the newborn.
This clinical trial aims to determine the effect of maternal IM Syntocinon ('Registered Trademark') administration during delayed umbilical cord clamping on neonatal arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) at vaginal birth.</summary>
