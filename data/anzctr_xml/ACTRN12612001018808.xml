  <interventions>
    <interventions>Serial measurements of haematological parameters, serum Fe biochemistry, hepcidin, multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines (via multiplex cytokine array ELISA including IL6, IL1Beta, IFNBeta, TNF) and erythropoietin levels will be undertaken in our laboratories at Fremantle Hospital. 
There will be a 1 month run-in period during which these parameters will be monitored at t=-4 weeks and t=0 weeks (When study medication will commence). Study medication will be Pentoxifylline (Trental) or matching placebo 400mg twice a day orally for 6 months.
Thereafter patients will be clinically reviewed every month with blood samples obtained monthly up to 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Forty-four anaemic CKD patients who are not on dialysis and who have not received Fe and ESA therapy will be randomized to receive treatment (n=22, PTF 400 mg twice a day) or placebo (n=22) for 6 months.The placebo  will be identical to the pentoxifylline (Trental) in taste and appearance but without the active ingredient.
ESA will be initiated when haemoglobin falls below 100 g/L in the absence of Fe-deficiency; Fe therapy will be used when SEVERE Fe-deficiency develops (ferritin &lt;100 microg/L and transferrin saturation &lt;10%) using standard protocols.</comparator>

Intolerance to methlanthines (eg. caffeine, theophylline), recent peptic ulcer, recent cerebral or retinal haemorhage and acute MI.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Suitable patients will be identified from chronic renal databases, approached in writing or by telephone and asked if they would like to participate. After opportunity to read information and ask questions, written informed consent will be obtained. Participants will attend a research clinic on a monthly basis for laboratory and clinical assessment.
The person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware to which group the subject would be allocated, because this was carried out in pharmacy department completely independent of  the other study personnel.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>90% of subjects undergoing dialysis for chronic kidney disease (CKD) require regular treatment of anaemia with iron and erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), costing in excess of $150 million per year. Anaemia results from deficient production of erythropoietin and reduced Fe absorption and utilization. The latter results from excessive production of hepcidin in response to elevated interleukin 6 (IL6) levels. Recently, we conducted a 4-week pilot study of pentoxifylline (PTF) in anaemic patients with CKD and showed it was effective at reducing serum IL6 levels and improving haemoglobin levels. In this study we will determine longer-term efficacy by administering PTF to anaemic CKD patients for 6 months.  If successful, we would recommend that therapy with PTF, which is 5% the cost of ESA therapy, could become the standard of care.</summary>
