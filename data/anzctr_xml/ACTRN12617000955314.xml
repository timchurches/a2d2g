  <interventions>
    <interventions>- brain scanning in fMRI machine at pre and post the psychological intervention (functional magnetic resonance imaging) - this took 30 minutes each time
- psychological intervention - once a week for 2 hours at the university campus (for a total of 4 week - so 8 hours) and it was face to face and  in group delivery
- the brain scans were conducted by a radiology team at an imaging service; the psychological intervention was conducted by a trained counsellor in the technique with 10 years experience in group delivery

Treatment protocols and fidelity plans for the EFT intervention were formed prior to the trial commencing by the chief investigator. The intervention involved a 4 week (2 hours per week) program, delivered by trained EFT practitioners who were registered counsellors with a minimum of 10 years' experience. The participants were taught the technique in a group setting and also received a manual which covered the material and gave homework tasks. It has previously be conducted and published in clinical trials and was based on standardised protocols (See Craig &amp; Fowlie, 1995). Acupressure points on the eyebrow, side of eye, under eye, under nose, chin, collarbone, under arm, and the top of the head were used. Treatment sessions involved direct exposure to craved foods. EFT techniques were utilised by participants focusing on a specific craving and associated emotion, rating the intensity of the craving using subjective units of distress (SUDs), initiating a set-up statement, and then completing the tapping process on the specific acupoints. The setup phrase focused on the individuals difficulties and was expressed aloud in the group, adding a voiced statement of self-acceptance. Full instructions and safeguards are described in Flint, Lammers and Mitnick (2005). Participants were encouraged to self-administer EFT outside of treatment sessions in response to cravings.

1: To ascertain the differences in brain activation (using fMRI) in response to food craving stimuli in overweight/obese adults, and compare to a control group, and
2: To investigate neural mechanisms of symptom improvements in overweight/obese adults following EFT treatment in order to conduct a larger trial.
The fMRI scans were analyses to identify brain regions activated by anticipation of food, and BOLD responses were contrasted. The questionnaires were analysed with MANOVA.  A total of 10 adults were in the intervention group and 5 in the control group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a chronic disease, and it has typically been purported to result from a range of causes including metabolic factors. But weight loss and weight maintenance are complex issues, and research indicates adults who are overweight or obese do benefit from psychological interventions to enhance weight reduction as well as behavioral approaches. Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) is one strategy and is a type of exposure therapy which includes a somatic and cognitive component for altering the cognitive, behavioural, and neurochemical foundations of psychological problems. Likened to a version of psychological acupuncture but without the use of fine needles, EFT combines components of traditional approaches (including cognitive and exposure therapy) with acupoint stimulation. There is now 10 years of EFT research for food and weight issues.  Recent research has also indicated regulation of six genes associated with inflammation and immunity after EFT, but it has not been unambiguously established how brain activation and neural mechanisms might be affected by EFT. This study had two objectives:
1: To ascertain the differences in brain activation (using fMRI) in response to food craving stimuli in overweight/obese adults, and compare to a control group, and
2: To investigate neural mechanisms of symptom improvements in overweight/obese adults following EFT treatment in order to conduct a larger trial.</summary>
