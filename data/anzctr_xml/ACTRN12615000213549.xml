    <interventions>Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy.
Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is a group program that is generally used to delay or prevent recurrence of major depression, but may also reduce depressive symptoms. The treatment combines the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and was first developed in 2000.
Mindfulness is purposeful, nonjudgmental attention to the present moment, which is developed through meditation and other practices. CBT is based upon the theory that maladaptive thoughts and behaviors lead to psychopathology; the clinician and patient identify these dysfunctional cognitions and the patient tries to change the resulting problematic behaviors.
There are similarities between mindfulness based cognitive therapy and CBT. Both treatments teach patients to identify triggers and symptoms of relapse such as anxiety and depression, and to develop a behavior plan for avoiding relapse. Other similarities include directing patients to observe their thoughts and to rate activities for the pleasure and sense of mastery they provide. 
What distinguishes mindfulness based cognitive therapy is its emphasis upon accepting dysfunctional thoughts. In contrast, CBT emphasizes changing dysfunctional thoughts by gathering evidence to dispute their validity. 
The MBCT course comprises 8 weekly sessions with each session being approximately 2 hours. The duration of the course is 8 weeks and the sessions take place in groups of 8-15 individuals. The groups will be run by experienced clinicians in psychotherapy, counselling and meditation and will have a clinician manual and a participant workbook outlining the themes and exercises for each week. Adherence is monitored by discussion of issues which may arise during practice of the techniques in between sessions.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fear of Ovarian Cancer Recurrence.
Fear of Cancer Recurrence is assessed using the 42-item FCRI, the most comprehensive multi-dimensional scale of FCR available, and suitable for patients with mixed cancer diagnoses. It has been found to be internally consistent (Chronbachs a=0.75 to 0.91 across subscales) and stable over a two-week interval (query = 0.58 to 0.83 across subscales), and has a robust factor structure. The FCRI has convergent validity with other standardised measures of FCR and discriminant validity with QOL amongst a large sample (n = 600) of Canadian cancer patients with mixed tumours. Respondents rate the degree to which symptoms or issues affect them on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all or never) to 4 (a great deal or all the time). Higher scores indicate higher FCR.</outcome>

    <concealment>Eligible patients will be invited to participate in this study at their routine follow up appointments in the private consulting rooms of three gynaecologic oncologists who are accredited at St John of God Hospitals in Subiaco and Murdoch, WA. Eligible patients will be approached in the waiting room by a clinical trial manager who will provide written and verbal information about the study. Patients who wish to participate will be asked to give their informed consent by signing a written consent form. Patients attending the Gynaecologic Oncology Outpatient Clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital will also be invited to participate in the study by a Senior Social Worker/Research Assistant who will perform a similar role as the clinical trial manager in the private sector.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine the effect of mindfulness based cognitive therapy on the fear of recurrence in ovarian cancer survivors. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, have completed all hospital based adjuvant treatment and are now disease free. Study details All participants will receive the same intervention and will involve intensive training and practice in mindfulness based cognitive therapy. Treatment is designed as an 8 week course of 2-2.5 hour small group sessions once weekly with approximately 8-15 individuals in each group. Sessions are run at locations in Shenton Park, Duncraig and East Fremantle by the Cancer Council WA, or by SolarisCare Foundation, at Sir Charles Gardner Hospital in Nedlands. Courses take place during the day and are free of charge. The groups will be run by experienced clinicians in psychotherapy, counselling and meditation and will have a clinician manual and a participant workbook outlining the themes and exercises for each week. Group members will be expected to practice skills between sessions. Participants will be asked to answer questionnaires before, during and after the group sessions to collect information on how participants are feeling.</summary>
