  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare Ga-68 EDTA PET/CT calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with results of Cr-51 EDTA. The GFR is calculated from the blood samples taken, and also from the PET scan.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single time-point</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlate assessment of differential or regional renal function with results of prior renal imaging.

    <summary>The study is comparing two different techniques to assess kidney function in patients referred to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been referred to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute for assessment of kidney function. 

Trial Details. The determination of kidney function is utilised for a wide range of clinical decision making. At Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, common clinical indications include dose adjustment for renally excreted chemotherapy agents (eg. carboplatin), determination of overall and split renal function prior to abdominal radiotherapy and monitoring of renal function during radionuclide therapy. Radionuclide techniques such as 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood clearance counting is a well-established method for estimation of GFR but requires blood samples from the patient at multiple time points and requires a well counter to accurately measure radioactivity at each time point which is not available in many nuclear medicine facilities. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers several advantages for imaging the kidneys over the conventional nuclear medicine technique. It has an order of magnitude higher sensitivity for radiotracer detection, enables dynamic tomographic (three dimensional) imaging, incorporates scatter and attenuation correction enabling accurate quantification of regional uptake and has superior spatial and temporal resolution. EDTA can be labelled with 68Ga, a positron emitting isotope which can be imaged on a PET/CT scanner. 68Ga EDTA PET/CT offers a non-invasive imaging-based alternative to 51Cr EDTA for GFR estimation. 68Ga EDTA PET/CT also has the ability to assess both overall and differential or regional renal function in a single study. Currently, many patients undergo both a 51Cr EDTA and a 99mTc-DMSA or 99mTc-DTPA to calculate overall and regional function, respectively. Although 68Ga EDTA standalone PET has been performed, there is limited experience and no data on its use in the PET/CT era or utility in comparison to 51Cr EDTA for GFR estimation. There are also no published reports, to our knowledge, using 68Ga EDTA to assess regional renal function. All participants in this study will undergo two different techniques to evaluate kidney function. This involves having an injection into a vein of a small of dose of two radioactive substances (68Ga and 51Cr-EDTA). A 20 minute PET scan is then performed looking at your kidneys. A small amount of blood is taken at 2, 3 and 4 hours.
