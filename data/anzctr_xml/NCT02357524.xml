             potential, agrees to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (e.g.

          4. Positive breath test for alcohol and/or positive urine test for drugs of abuse at
             Screening.

          5. Has a history or presence of alcohol/drug abuse within 2 years. Alcohol abuse is
             defined as regularly consuming &gt;3 units/day (21 units per week for men), &gt;2 units/day
             (14 units/week) for women. A unit is defined as a can of 4% beer (330 mL),
             approximately 190 mL of 6-7% beer (malt liquor), a glass of 40% spirits (30 mL), a
             glass of wine (100 mL).

          6. Blood or plasma donation within past 2 months.

          7. History of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar chemical structure (i.e.
             glycopeptide antibiotics) to the investigational product or any of its excipients.

          8. Participation in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other
             investigational drugs or devices within 90 days prior to enrollment and/or unwilling
             to allow at least two months before participation in another drug trial following the
             current trial.

          9. Treatment with any prescription or OTC drugs, within 2 weeks or five half-lives,
             whichever is longer, or herbal nutritional supplements within 2 weeks of screening,
             with the exception of acetaminophen/paracetamol for minor headache. Subjects will not
             be allowed to receive medications for the duration of the study (except the
             abovementioned acetaminophen/paracetamol). Birth control or other hormone replacement
             is also permitted as long as it has been taken at a stable dose for at least three
             months before the Screening Visit and remains stable for the duration of the study.

         10. Females who are pregnant or nursing or who have a positive pregnancy test result at
             screening.

         11. Males who are unwilling to practice abstinence or use an acceptable method of birth
             control during the entire study period (i.e. condom with spermicide, where locally
             available).</exclusivecriteria>
