  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Metacognitive Training Program for Psychosis (MCT) is a cost free download (http://www.uke.de).  The MCT is designed to assist people in changing their thinking patterns that contribute to delusions, which subsequently avoids relapse or reduces the impact of delusions.  Each module begins with psychoeducational elements and normalising through examples and exercises.  Pathological extremes for each cognitive bias are then highlighted and their implications for daily life discussed with case examples of people with psychosis.  Dysfunctional coping strategies such as avoidance are also highlighted. The sessions are interactive and entertaining and aim to capture participants attention, with a move away from the drill and practice approaches often incorporated with traditional Cognitive Behaviour Therapy group programs. Participants are also required to complete homework between sessions.  Module Four of the MCT program contains a brief section on emotion perception, which will be enhanced further with Emotion Recognition Training (ERT) (Marsh et al., 2013).  The aim is to enhance the effects of Module Fours brief section on emotion perception, which sensitises participants to the ambivalence of social situations.  This MCT program will be incorporated in a forensic psychiatric setting and for clarity will be called the Metacognitive Training for Psychosis  Forensic (MCT-F), which is endorsed by Professor Steffen Moritz.  The MCT-F program will run for six weeks, twice a week for one hour per session.  No more than 10 participants will be recruited into each group.   
</interventions>
    <comparator>The Waitlist Control Group are recruited from the same State Forensic Mental Health Service (SFMHS) and tested at the same time at the start of each cohort to be run through the MCT-F program.  They will be offered treatment after the first cohorts have completed the post-treatment (T2) testing.  </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>First Aim: To test the effects of a psychological intervention for delusions on reducing aggression in patients with schizophrenia and no comorbid brain injury in a forensic psychiatric setting.

Hypothesis 1:  Aggression will be reduced in patients receiving MCT-F compared to a wait-list control group.

Outcome measure: Dynamic Appraisal of Situational Aggression (DASA) (Ogloff &amp; Daffern, 2006)

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately post-treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hypothesis 2: MCT-F will reduce delusional severity and improve social functioning, and cognitive biases and deficits known to be associated with delusions and targeted by MCT-F.

Outcomes measures: 
1) Delusional severity indexed by a single score from the Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS) Delusional Subscale (Haddock, McCarron, Tarrier, &amp; Faragher, 1999)
2) Jumping to conclusions bias assessed using the beads task (see, e.g., (Phillips &amp; Edwards, 1966; Langdon, Ward &amp; Coltheart, 2010)
3) Attributional blaming bias indexed by a single score derived from the Ambiguous Intention Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ) (Combs, Penn, Wicher, &amp; Waldheter, 2007)
4) A composite measure of social-cognitive functioning derived from a test of emotion recognition (The Awareness of Social Interference Test  Revised (TASIT-R) Part One:) (McDonald, Flanagan, &amp; Rollins, 2011) and a non-verbal (i.e. picture sequencing: Langdon &amp; Coltheart, 1999) and verbal (i.e. story comprehension) test of theory of mind (see, e.g., Langdon, Ward &amp; Coltheart, 2010)
5) Quality of life indexed by the total score from the WHOQOL-BREF (WHOQOL Group, 1998) 
6) Readiness for treatment indexed by the Corrections Victoria Treatment Readiness Questionnaire (CVTRQ) (Casey, Howells, &amp; Ward, 2007)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediately post training and at 2-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Second Aim: To identify the best predictors of: 1) aggression at baseline; and 2) change in aggression following treatment.

Hypothesis 3: Lower IQ, worse cognitive and social-cognitive (i.e. emotion recognition and theory of mind) functioning, more severe psychotic symptoms, and comorbid psychopathic traits will predict higher levels of aggressions at baseline.

Potential predictors will include:
1) IQ indexed by the National Adult Reading Test (NART) (NARTR; Nelson 1982)
2) General neurocognitive capacity indexed by a single composite score from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS Update) (Randolph, 2012)
3) General symptom severity indexed by a global score from the Scales for the Assessment of Positive and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia (SAPS and SANS) (Andreasen, 1984)
4) Psychopathic traits indexed by the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale  Short Form (SRP-SF) (Paulhus, Hempill, &amp; Hare, in press)
5) Social-cognitive functioning score indexed by a single score derived from the baseline measures of emotion recognition and theory of mind (McDonald, et al.,  2011; Langdon &amp; Coltheart, 1999; Langdon, et al., 2010)
6) Readiness for treatment indexed by Corrections Victoria Treatment Readiness Questionnaire (CVTRQ) ) (Casey, Howells, &amp; Ward, 2007)
7) Engagement in the program indexed by the Intrinsic Motivational Inventory for Schizophrenia Research (IMI-SR) (Choi &amp; Medalia, 2010)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately post-treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hypothesis 4: Higher IQ, better cognitive and social-cognitive functioning, greater readiness for treatment and more involvement in the program will predict better response to treatment.

Outcome measures will be baseline levels of aggression and pre- to post-treatment change in aggression. 

Potential predictors will include:
1) IQ indexed by the National Adult Reading Test (NART) (NARTR; Nelson 1982)

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Informed consent will be obtained from each participant after they read an Information Sheet, followed by recording of demographic information and pre-treatment (T1) testing.  Basic and clinical demographic information such as age, gender, educational background and marital status, and medication will be recorded at baseline.  The DASA primary outcome measure is completed as part of service delivery by nursing staff on a 24 hour basis.  

Participants will be randomly allocated to either a treatment group (MCT-F) or waitlist control group. This will be through allocation concealment by way of sealed opaque envelopes.  Participants assigned to the MCT-F treatment group will then undergo six weeks of training while the wait-list group continues with their usual treatment on the ward. This is followed by a post-assessment immediately following the MCT-F group. The wait-list group will then be offered the program. 

The study aims to recruit 48 participants in total from the State Forensic Mental Health Service, Western Australia.  If further participants are required as a result of insufficient sample size, then these participants will be obtained from additional sites at Concord and Westmead hospitals, New South Wales, through Site Specific Ethics’ applications.  A total of 24 participants from the MCT-F treatment group will be compared with 24 participants from the wait-list group.  Participants will have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and will be referred from clinicians at the SFMHS.

Treatment will be run in groups of six to ten participants. For each treatment round, the pre-treatment assessment will take approximately two hours per participant with data for an entire cohort collected over two to three weeks.  The MCT-F treatment group will then be conducted for six weeks.  Following treatment, another two to three weeks would be required to collect the post-treatment data.  Then, participants would need to be recruited and tested for the next round of six to ten participants. Participants will be reimbursed for the time spent in the testing sessions of $15 for pre-assessment and $15 for post-assessment in line with Macquarie University’s reimbursement of participants’ policy. This is not seen as an inducement as it is not part of service practice and is for the testing sessions only.

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, Version 20.  Power analyses were performed using GPower 3.1.7.

First aim: ANCOVA is recommended to test the first aim, with the pretest scores as the covariate, the posttest scores as the dependent variable, and the two groups (MCT-F treatment group and the waitlist control group) as the independent variable.  Since no previous studies have examined the effects of MCT-F on the primary outcome measure of aggression, a power calculation is based on previous studies of the effects of similar treatment studies on the secondary outcome measures of delusional severity and social cognition. For example, a previous study testing the efficacy of MCT with a sample size of 36 schizophrenia patients reported a moderate-large effect size of d equals .68 for the intensity of delusional distress (Moritz et al., 2011), while Kurtz and Richardsons (2011) meta-analysis found a moderate effect size for improved theory of mind after social-cognitive training (d equals .46) across 19 treatment studies. Therefore, assuming a moderate effect size of d equals 0.45, a sample of N equals 48 will give power of 0.8 at a significance level of a equals .05 to test the first aim.  

Second aim: Assuming a moderate effect size of d equals 0.45, a power analysis for seven predictor variables using linear multiple regression indicates that, to achieve a power of 0.8, with a significance level of a equals .05, the minimum sample size should be N equals 40 participants.  Hence, it is suggested that the proposed sample of 48 is adequate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Aggressive behaviour in forensic psychiatric settings is frequent and problematic; its impact on patients, staff, unit functioning and mental health services is profound (Daffern, 2007, p.117).  Positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly delusions, have been found to be associated with aggressive behaviour. Central features underlying delusions include cognitive biases such as the jumping to conclusions bias, an other attributional style, theory of mind deficits and poor emotion recognition.  With a greater understanding of cognitive biases and processes underlying delusions, new targeted psychotherapies have emerged such as Metacognitive Training for Psychosis (MCT), with promising findings in psychiatric settings.  


However, the use of MCT in forensic settings has only recently begun to be examined, with beneficial effects for individuals with schizophrenia in MCT groups showing a greater capacity to consent to treatment, improved global functioning, and a greater reduction in symptoms of schizophrenia and suspiciousness than for those in the control group.  It has been suggested that decreased delusional severity and reduced suspiciousness, for example, may in turn decrease aggression in a forensic psychiatric setting.  Therefore, future research involving the use of MCT for delusions on reducing aggression in schizophrenia patients in a forensic psychiatric setting appears warranted.  


Aims of the Project
First Aim: To test the effects of a psychological intervention for delusions on reducing aggression in patients with schizophrenia in a forensic psychiatric setting.  This intervention incorporates MCT in a forensic psychiatric setting.  Furthermore, Module Four of the MCT contains a brief emotion recognition component, which is expanded to incorporate further Emotion Recognition Training, with this psychological intervention in a forensic psychiatric setting being endorsed by Professor Moritz as MCT-Forensic (MCT-F).  Second Aim: To identify the best predictors of: 1) aggression at baseline; and 2) change in aggression following treatment.   


Proposal Research Design
The first aim will employ an ANCOVA model, with the pretest scores as the covariate, the posttest scores as the dependent variable, and the two groups (MCT-F treatment group and waitlist control group) as the independent variable.  The second aim will be investigated by linear multiple regression. 


Methods
The study aims to recruit 48 participants in total from the State Forensic Mental Health Service based on the inclusion criteria.  An Information Sheet will be discussed with the participant, and informed consent will be obtained.  This will be followed by pre-treatment assessment (T1). Participants will be randomly allocated to either a treatment group (MCT-F) of six weeks training or the waitlist control group.  A post-assessment (T2) will then be conducted after training completion.  The wait-list group will then be offered the program and then the next cohort will be enlisted.  </summary>
