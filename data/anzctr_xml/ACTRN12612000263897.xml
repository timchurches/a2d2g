  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of EFV determined from blood collected over a 24-hour dosing interval in blinded samples from participants taking either EFV 600 mg or 400 mg once daily in combination with Truvada.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the safety and tolerability of EFV 400 mg versus 600 mg given once daily by between-group comparison of adverse event and serious adverse event frequency, clinical assessment and results of DASS-21 and subject experience questionnaires.
Adverse events are those commonly observed with EFV therapy and included central nervous system events such as dizziness, vivid dreams, poor of concentration. Events will be assessed by clinical examination and use of questionnaires as above.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC0-24, t1/2, Cmax, Tmax, Cmin, CL/F) between EFV 400 mg and 600 mg dosed once daily.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Safety and efficacy are key issues in antiretroviral therapy (ART) selection. Efavirenz (EFV) is an important component of combination ART in treatment naive individuals. Like many drugs, EFV demonstrates inter-individual differences in its efficacy and tolerability. The Encore1 study provides an opportunity to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK)(processes by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body) of EFV in blood samples collected over a 24-hour dosing interval in participants receiving either standard 600 mg or reduced 400 mg dose EFV once daily. This sub-study will investigate the relationships between EFV dosage, EFV plasma concentrations, toxicity and virological efficacy. EFV concentrations in dried blood spots and matched plasma and will be evaluated to determine the utility of dried blood spot measurements in measuring EFV plasma concentrations. Measurements dried blood spots could potentially be a cheap and easy alternative to measurements in plasma. Dried blood spots can be easily collected from venous blood or fingerprick, do not need plasma separation and potentially need less stringent storage conditions during shipment.
