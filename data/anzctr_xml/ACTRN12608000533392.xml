  <interventions>
    <interventions>A manual therapy approach consisting of high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) manipulation (either manual or mechanically assisted techniques), mobilization and/or supporting soft tissue therapies: various stretching and soft tissue massage techniques to the spine, pelvis and extremity. The intervention was administered to players during the week and not on match days. There was no set time frame for the duration of each manual therapy session, with each being patient specific in duration. Treatment scheduling was also pragmatically determined. The minimum scheduling adhered to was: 1 treatment per week for 6 weeks followed by 1 treatment per fortnight for 3 months and 1 treatment per month for the remainder of the season (3 months). Both the intervention and control group continued to receive the standard club medical, paramedical and sports science management including medication, manipulative physiotherapy, massage, strength and conditioning and rehabilitation as directed by club staff, which acted as the control.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevention of hamstring injuries. The injury definition was a "any physical or medical condition that prevents a player from participating in a regular season (home and away) or finals match". The injury surveillance was conducted weekly. Injury diagnoses were determined by club medical staff who were blinded to group allocation using either clinical features of injury, advanced imaging or both at their discretion with blinded club recorders completing the injury surveillance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A weekly injury surveillance conducted for the duration of the home and away season and finals series (approximately 6 month duration).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevention of non-contact knee injuries and lower limb muscle strains. The injury definition was a "any physical or medical condition that prevents a player from participating in a regular season (home and away) or finals match". The injury surveillance was conducted weekly. Injury diagnoses were determined by club medical staff who were blinded to group allocation using either clinical features of injury, advanced imaging or both at their discretion with blinded club recorders completing the injury surveillance.</outcome>

    <concealment>Players completed a self-reported questionnaire at their training location prior to randomisation. The questionnaire consisted of the validated and reliable McGill Pain Questionnaire (short form) (MPQ-SF) for low back pain (LBP), the 39 item Health Status Questionnaire (SF-39) as well as self reported questions on knee and hamstring injury history (incidence during the previous month, 6 months, year, 2 years, greater than 2 years, not at all). At each of the two clubs after completion of the baseline questionnaire, players were randomly allocated into one of two groups such that allocation was concealed using central randomisation by computer. Eligible players were stratified by age and hamstring injury history within these strata as these are the most recognized predictors for injury. Randomization was completed within each club to prevent an element of randomness in a clubs injury profile each season impacting on the results of the study. After all subjects at the 2 clubs had been allocated the two groups at both clubs club were then randomly allocated to either the intervention or control with a coin toss.</concealment>
