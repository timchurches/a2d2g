  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and
      PK of multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of APL-2 in subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal
      hemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not received treatment with eculizumab in the past.

      An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of multiple SC
      doses of APL 2 when administered to PNH patients.</summary>
