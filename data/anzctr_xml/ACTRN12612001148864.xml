  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this pilot study, the intervention will be carried out for 6 months but the main assessments will only occur at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months.
The Intervention is a supportive educational intervention for caregivers. It will be in four parts and delivered in a sequential manner:
1. An initial telephone assessment of current unmet needs of the caregiver by research nurse. In the pilot study this will occur after registration and in the intervention study after randomisation to the intervention group. This should take 20 minutes.
2. 7-14 days later, a single home visit where the research nurse will provide support and education around the issues that have arisen in the telephone assessment and baseline survey of unmet need. The research nurse will also deliver the information folder specified below. It is expected that these home visits may take 60-90 minutes.
3. Caregviers will be given a tabbed supportive and educational information resource file which is specifically tailored for the caregiver as appropriate for their identified unmet needs. As new needs are identified, further information sheets will be supplied to the caregiver to insert into their resource folder.
4. Ongoing monthly telephone support and assessment of new needs as they arise. These will commence a month after the delivery of the intervention. These telephone assesments should take about 10 minutes unless prolonged by the participants.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High grade glioma (HGG) is a term used to encompass grade III anaplastic astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastoma multiforme. This is a rapidly terminal, progressive, and significantly debilitating group of diseases which robs patients of function, cognition, and personality, making this a highly distressing disease for patients, families and carers. In addition to the general cancer related caregiving issues, the impact of the disease on the patients ability to function leads to reduced quality of life, increased stress and carer burden for their caregiver . The diagnosis of a brain tumour is particularly stressful for carers because the prognosis is dire and life expectancy short. These carers report increased stress and distress levels and decreased quality of life compared to carers of patients with cancers with a good prognosis. There are more than 200 problems and burdens identified by caregivers, which fall under several categories including: physical health problems, social problems and information needs, emotional problems and burdens related to responsibilities and impact on daily life.
Psychosocial interventions for caregivers in a range of situations have been developed with various aims including improving caregiver understanding and ability to care, self-efficacy, quality of life, stress reduction, and improving communication and relationships in the family. There is a paucity of information regarding the role or effect of interventions addressing the unmet needs of caregivers of patients with HGG.
Thus far this group has carried out two investigations into the experience and needs of patients with HGG and their caregivers. The first was a qualitative study of the needs of patients with HGG and their caregivers. Caregivers described a time of rapid change and a steep learning curve where they struggled with caring for partners with major disabilities and not knowing where to seek additional support or assistance (Halkett et al. 2010; McConigley et al. 2010). The second was a quantitative study (SCGH HREC 2006-146) which examined the experiences of 100 patient-carer dyads at three time points during the disease trajectory: during combined chemoradiotherapy, and 3 and 6 months later. 31% of caregivers reported moderate distress (DT score 5-6) and 31% reported extreme distress (score 7-10). Caregivers also
reported significantly more distress than patients (mean 5.1 vs. 4.1; paired t test p=0.01). Caregiver distress was associated with higher scores on the general health questionnaire (r=0.61, p&lt;0.001). The top 5 moderate/high caregiver unmet needs were: 1. accessing prognostic information; 2. accessing financial support and government benefits; 3. accessible hospital parking; 4. impact of caring on usual life; and 5. reducing stress in the patients life. These preliminary results will be presented in a poster at COSA in November 2012.
The development of our intervention is based on our preliminary data and the identification of several key components including the caregivers preparedness to care, sense of control, competence, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression and distress, social support, information, a sense of reward, meaningfulness, positive emotions, optimism, respite and relationship with the care-receiver. Our intervention is currently in the development phase and is aimed to cover all these areas. We are seeking support and advice regarding the development of the intervention from a variety of sources including medical oncologists, neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, palliative care physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, experienced representatives from Carers WA and COGNO, as well as consumer representatives. The purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of this supportive-educational intervention for caregivers of patients with HGG.</summary>
