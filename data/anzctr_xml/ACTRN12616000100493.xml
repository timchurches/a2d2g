    <studytitle>ART &amp; DEMENTIA: Does an art program enhance wellbeing and markers of neuroplasticity in people with dementia?</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised controlled trial to assess whether a 10 week combined gallery-facilitated and at-home art program, Art &amp; Dementia, can affect changes in neuropsychological markers of visuospatial functioning, as well as improvements in ratings of quality of life, mood and carer burden, in older adults with dementia.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention of interest for this trial is a 10-week gallery-facilitated community art program, Art &amp; Dementia, developed by the Museum of Contemporary Art in conjunction with Alzheimer's Australia. Those participants assigned to the art program intervention will complete 5 fortnightly face-to-face gallery-facilitated sessions (approx 2 hours per session) at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA), alternated with 5 fortnightly at-home sessions (approx 1 hour per session), over a 10-week period. At-home sessions will be directed by the participant via at-home packs provided by the MCA containing creative and discussion exercises. Gallery-facilitated sessions will be administered by an art educator and gallery access staff, and will occur in small groups. Sessions will include both art viewing/education, and creating art with mixed medias. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by MCA's program coordinator via gallery attendance logs, as well as self-monitored by fortnightly art diaries provided by the MCA.</interventions>
    <comparator>Those randomised to 'waitlist control' condition will not participate in the art program immediately, rather will be instructed to continue their 'activities as usual' for the 10 week period. Following completion of follow-up assessment and research involvement they will be invited to attend the next available art program intake.  </comparator>

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be automatically randomised upon completion of consent, eligibility screening, and baseline assessments. This will be done off-site by the study coordinator (central administration). Allocation concealment will be achieved using a computerised and customised randomisation schedule. The fully itemised procedure allows for full replication and can accommodate stratification and specification of block sizes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised at the time of baseline assessment using a randomly generated number sequence allocated by a blinded researcher not involved in trial data gathering, assessments or treatment. Randomisation will be undertaken using permuted blocks and stratified by cognitive function severity, as defined by MMSE scores of equal or below 24, and above 24.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory study with a group where the effects are likely to be quite heterogenous and improvements expected to be relatively small, due to the disease stage. Thus, based on our previous work, we have allowed for ~10% attrition and expect a small effect size improvement in the treatment group given the profile of this particular group. However this work is novel and within this pilot study we seek to determine the actual effect size difference between groups. The outcomes of this study will be used to power a larger more rigorous randomized controlled trial.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a pilot randomised proof-of-concept trial that aims to identify potential cognitive markers by utilising a 10-week social and creative, gallery-facilitated "Art &amp; Dementia" program to examine its relationship with memory and learning tasks in adults with dementia. Specifically, we hope to ascertain whether: a) there are clinical predictors of benefit associated with an art program, b) there is improvement in visuospatial cognitive skills associated with an art program, and c) an art program is associated with improved wellbeing and reduced carer burden. We will compare the efficacy of this program to a waitlist group.</summary>
