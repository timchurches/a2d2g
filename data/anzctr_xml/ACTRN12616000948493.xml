  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention Group:
Timeframe: Within 120 hours of ICU admission until ICU discharge (28 days maximum) post ICU admission (whichever occurs sooner)

Program: In addition to usual standard of care physiotherapy interventions the intervention group will complete daily (Mon-Fri) additional progressive lower limb in-bed cycling using a bedside cycle ergometer (MOTOmed Letto 2) for 30-minutes . 
Patients who are sedated or in a state of low arousal will cycle continuously and passively for 30 minutes at a cadence of 20 rpm. 
Once the patient is able to follow commands they will be asked to cycle actively. The cycle ergometer will be adjusted to facilitate progression of intensity throughout the sessions (within safe limits, specified in stopping criteria). A physiotherapist with experience in prescribing exercise programs for critically ill patients will adjust the intensity of the in-bed cycling intervention based on the patients' physiological parameters and muscular endurance. 
This will enable the patient to cycle in-bed either passively or actively (as able) with assistance from the cycle ergometer. 
The patients cardiorespiratory and cardiovascular values will be monitored throughout the exercise intervention. 
Patients will be progressed to exercise at the highest level of resistance that they tolerate whilst maintaining physiological values within pre-specified stopping criteria.
In-bed cycling sessions will continue until the patient completes a minimum of 5 cycle in-bed cycling sessions.
In-bed cycling sessions will continue in the acute hospital ward after discharge from ICU if the patient is discharged from ICU prior to completing 5 in-bed cycling sessions.
In-bed cycling sessions will continue until ICU discharge (28 days maximum), the maximum number of in-bed cycling sessions that could be completed is 20. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group (standard care):
Participants in the comparator group will receive usual physiotherapy interventions whilst an inpatient in intensive care. Physiotherapy interventions will be implemented by the usual treating physiotherapists in the unit and typically include respiratory physiotherapy and exercise interventions inclusive of sitting on the edge of the bed, sit to stand transfers, sitting out of bed and walking. 

Both groups will receive usual , medical, nursing and allied health care in the ICU and elsewhere in the hospital following discharge from the ICU. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics and generalized linear mixed models will be used to examine the effect of group allocation (intervention vs. control) on the primary and secondary outcomes. As this is a randomised trial we do not plan to adjust for potential confounders (e.g., age, gender, comorbidities), but will compare the characteristics of the sample by treatment group and may adjust if a potential confounder differs greatly between groups). 
Given the repeated measures design, a sample size calculation has estimated this sample will have 80% power to detect a 2.9% between group mean difference in cross sectional area change of Rectus Femoris; assuming alpha 0.05, standard deviation of 6%, and correlation of 0.5% between assessments after taking into account a drop-out rate of up to 20% . Data will be analysed and reported using an intention to treat analysis, 
Additional analysis: A per protocol analysis may also be conducted (as a secondary or sensitivity analysis) if substantial variations from the intended treatment protocol are observed. If conducted, per protocol analysis will comprise participants who adhere to the protocol and received at least 80% of training sessions (minimum of 4 sessions). 

The following sub-analyses are planned:
Analysis of muscle wasting examining the association with: number/ severity of vital organs assessed to have dysfunction/failure utilising a Sequential Organ Failure Score (SOFA); severity of illness on admission to ICU utilising APACHE II and APACHE III data; rectus femoris muscle cross sectional area at initial assessment.; number of days to a patient commences active activity; sedative and paralytic medications.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Critically ill patients often require prolonged mechanical ventilation for periods greater than 48 hours. It has been identified that skeletal muscle wasting occurs early and rapidly during the first week of critical illness. Despite international recommendations to commence activity as early as possible with critically ill patients it has been identified that exercise interventions are rarely initiated when a patient is on mechanical ventilation. This leads to prolonged immobility and may contribute to the development of ICU Acquired Weakness (ICUAW).

A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will compare outcomes of critically ill patients who receive standard physiotherapy (control group) and those who complete additional in-bed cycling intervention sessions. This will enable comparison of outcomes to assist clinicians to determine if additional in-bed cycling sessions may be beneficial with critically ill patients.

Objectives:
To determine:
(1)	if in-bed cycling in addition to standard care is effective in reducing the rate of rectus femoris (RF) cross-sectional area (CSA) atrophy and intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) in patients requiring &gt; 48 hrs of mechanical ventilation compared to standard care;
(2)	whether in-bed cycling in addition to standard care improved functional and cognitive outcomes in patients requiring &gt; 48 hours of mechanical ventilation compared to standard care.

Trial Design: Two (parallel) arm, preliminary randomised control trial with assessor blinding.

In summary, this study aims to examine if addition of an in-bed cycling intervention with critically ill patients reduces the loss of thigh muscle mass. Also to examine if in-bed cycling improves functional and cognitive outcomes post intensive care discharge.</summary>
