  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will consume daily two sachets of a commercial arginine powder (Arginaid [Registered Trademark]; Nestle Medical Nutrition) giving a final dose (from the two sachets combined) of 9 grams of arginine, 310 mg of vitamin C, and 180 IU (81 mg) of vitamin E in total for a 4-week week period on top of their normal diet. 

At baseline, and at weeks 2 and 4 corresponding to outpatient clinic visits, patients will have measurements of the foot ulcer size and depth taken as well as their overall health status to assess the rate of healing over 6 weeks. Non-nutrition foot ulcer care will be kept constant during the study period according to standard clinic protocols.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will consume their normal diet. Both groups will receive standard dietetic intervention independent to which group they are allocated in accordance to normal nutritional assessment and interventions that occur as a routine part of a patient's attendance at the outpatient service.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Healing rate of the foot ulcer is the primary outcome measure of the study. Wounds will be measured using the IWGDF PEDIS system. The system classifies foot ulcers according to five categories: perfusion, extent/size, depth/tissue loss, infection and sensation and changes in these parameters over time will allow a quantitative measure of wound healing.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Study eligibility will include a confirmed diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and a foot ulcer with an International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF)  PEDIS classifications (as listed below) of at least 4 weeks duration.
1.	Perfusion: Grades 1-3
2.	Depth: Grades 1-3
3.	Infection: Grades 1-3

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients with a Grade 4 infection rating according to the IWGDF PEDIS classification system will be excluded as systemic signs will usually require hospital admission. Patients with phenylketonuria, sepsis, chronic renal failure, malignancy, and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, will be excluded for health and safety reasons. Individuals receiving hydroxyurea or greater than 10 mg prednisolone or 1.5 mg dexamethasone per day will also be excluded as these drugs can impact on the rate of healing of diabetic foot ulcers. Individuals using insulin to manage their diabetes will also be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited through the High Risk Foot Service Clinic at Northern Health and randomised to either the control group or intervention group. All patients eligible to participate in the study will have the procedures, risks and inconveniences explained to them and will be asked to provide informed consent either in writing or verbal (for patients unable to write).</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomised into the intervention or control group by order of enrolment which will occur by block randomisation. The order of the block allocation sequence will be determined before the beginning of the study by sorting a list of random numbers generated by a computer program, assigned to each of the randomisation blocks in numerical order and using sequences as the allocation order of the study. The randomisation procedure will be performed by a member of the research team located off-site and not directly involved in participant recruitment. As each patient is enrolled, they will advise the research team of the treatment allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic foot ulcers are a common consequence of diabetes, which occur as a result of the vascular and neurological complications associated with the disease, as well as opportunistic infections and inadequate wound healing. The most recent prevalence estimates suggest that between 4 and 10% of individuals with diabetes have foot ulcers.

Recent clinical research has focussed on the dietary conditionally essential amino acid arginine and its role in wound healing. Published research has shown that it offers a benefit in the healing of pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores). Little in the way of human studies using clinically relevant models examining the effect of arginine supplementation on diabetic foot ulcers have been conducted. If the same rate of diabetic foot ulcer healing can be achieved with arginine supplementation as seen with pressure ulcers, then this would have important management implications in treating this condition.

This project aims to assess by means of a randomised-controlled trial, the healing rate of diabetic foot ulcers in patients with diabetes attending a hospital outpatient clinic who are consuming an arginine-containing nutritional supplement versus patients who are only receiving standard nutritional care.</summary>
