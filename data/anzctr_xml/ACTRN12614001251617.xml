  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment comprises a new manualised psychological program specifically for separation anxiety disorder in adults. The therapy utilises techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy, attachment-related interventions and positive psychology. Participants in the intervention group will receive 8 weeks of individual treatment with an intern psychologist for one hour per week.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The expected 12-month prevalence rate of separation anxiety disorder in the population is 1.9%, as shown in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a population survey of 9282 respondents in the United States (Shear 2006).
The population of Randwick City area aged 18 or over is 76 169 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2011), suggesting an estimated pool of 1447 people in that area with separation anxiety disorder.
We aim to obtain a sample of 80 people with separation anxiety disorder over a period of two years (n = 40 in the treatment group, and n = 40 in the control group), which is feasible given this data.  
In order to detect a 30% reduction in symptoms, we would need to be able to achieve an effect size of 0.64.
Johnston et al (2011), in a similar trial of psychological therapy, achieved moderate to large effect sizes ranging from .76  1.44 using a sample of 46 people in each of three groups (two treatment and one control group), while investigating the effectiveness of two different methods of administering psychological treatment for anxiety disorders.  Thus a sample of 80 people (40 treatment and 40 control) should be sufficient to detect any differences between treatment and control groups with medium (0.5) to large effects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to evaluate the efficacy of a manualised psychological treatment for adults with Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD). SAD has only recently been accepted as legitimately occurring during adulthood in the DSM-5. As such, no evidence-based treatments have yet been trialed to address this debilitating condition. We hypothesise that adult subjects diagnosed with SAD who receive 8 sessions of specialized psychological treatment  will report lower levels of anxiety, greater symptom improvements, and less  impairments in their day-to-day life after treatment, compared to a a group who do not receive the treatment for 8 weeks. Project outcomes will indicate whether this treatment program is useful in reducing symptoms and distress caused by separation anxiety disorder.</summary>
