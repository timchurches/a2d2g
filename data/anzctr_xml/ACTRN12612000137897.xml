  <interventions>
    <interventions>For early stage unfavourable disease: 4 cycles of ABVD plus 30.6Gy IF-XRT (extended field radiation therapy)

Adriamycin at 25mg/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Bleomycin at 10,000 IU/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Vinblastine at 6mg/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Dacarbazine at 375mg/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Nivestim at 300 microgram subcutaneous on days 4-8 and 15-19 of a 21 day cycle

CT restaging after chemotherapy should take place 2 weeks of the end of chemotherapy with irradiation ( 30.6Gy IF-XRT in 17 fractions at 5/week using 1.8Gy daily dose) beginning after recovery of blood counts (ANC &gt; 1.0 x 109/L, platelets &gt; 75), 4 weeks if possible but at most 6 weeks after the end of chemotherapy.

For advanced stage: 6-8 cycles of ABVD

Adriamycin at 25mg/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Bleomycin at 10,000 IU/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Vinblastine at 6mg/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Dacarbazine at 375mg/m2 intravenous on day 1 and 12 of a 21 day cycle
Nivestim at 300 microgram subcutaneous on days 4-8 and 15-19 of a 21 day cycle

Advanced stage patients who are in CR or Cru after interim CT restaging (i.e. after 3 or 4 cycles) are to receive 6 cycles whereas those with ongoing response between interim CT restaging and CT staging after 6 cycles should go on to receive a further 2 cycles of ABVD to a total of 8 cycles.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate whether giving standard chemotherapy treatment more quickly can be done safely and will be more effective in treating patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 16-60 years and have been diagnosed with either early stage unfavourable or advanced stage Hodgkin Lymphoma. 

Trial details
The current standard therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma involves receiving a four drug chemotherapy regimen called 'ABVD' every fourteen days. ABVD is an abbreviation for the four drugs used (A=adriamycin, B=bleomycin, V=vinblastin, D=dacarbazine). This chemotherapy is generally well tolerated. A full cycle of therapy involves ABVD given on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day (=4 week) cycle. In this trial, all participants! will receive the exact same four drug combination (ABVD) but given on days 1 and 12 of a 21 day (=3 week) cycle. A growth factor called Nivestim will be given to accelerate the recovery of the body's normal blood cells from the effects of ABVD and thus allow the chemotherapy to be given more quickly than usual. Participants will undergo between 4 to 8 cycles of treatment depending on response. 

Participants will be regularly assessed over a period of up to 5 years to determine the safety and efficacy of this accelerated chemotherapy regime.</summary>
