    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on the Response Assessment by the Independent Review Adjudication Committee (IRAC) - PFS was calculated as the time from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause during the study, which ever occurred first based on the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria (IMWG). Those who withdrew for any reason or received another anti-myeloma therapy without documented PD were censored on the date of their last response assessment, prior to receiving any other anti-myeloma therapy. Censoring rules for PFS: - No baseline assessments and no progression or death documented within the 2 scheduled assessments; Death within the lst two assessments without any adequate response assessment; Progression documented between scheduled assessments; Death between adequate assessments; no progression; study discontinuations for reasons other than PD or death; new anti-myeloma started prior to PD; death or PD after an extended lost to follow-up time period (2 or more missed scheduled assessment's).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health Utility Index Score - EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 3 levels of response: No problem (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions into a single utility index score. EQ-5D index values range from -0.59 to 1.00 where higher EQ-5D scores represent better health status. A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement in health status and better health state.</outcome>
