  <interventions>
    <interventions>40 patients will be recruited for this study. All patients will have an Endobarrier device inserted.  Endobarrier insertion occurs endoscopically by trained endoscopists and  is fluoroscopically assisted for delivery to just below the pyloric sphincter where the device will settle and attach to the mucosa.  The procedure takes approximately 45 minutes.

Following recruitment the patients will be randomised to either have an Endobarrier device inserted immediately (20 patients-Group ETG-0) or to be treated with standard, conservative weight loss management. Those that did not immediately have a device inserted will be randomised again after 6 months. Half of these patients will then have a device inserted immediately (10 patients-Group ETG-6) or continue with standard conservative management for a total of 12 months before the device is inserted (10 patients- Group ETG-12) .  The Endobarrier device will be removed after a maximum insertion period of 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>50% of participants receive standard nutritional care for 6- 12 months prior to device insertion.  Standard nutritional care involves patients being seen at 3 monthly intervals by the Accredited Practicing Dietitian for the trial for 1 hour indvidualised dietary advice for dietary modification to improve diet quality and promote weight loss (calorie control).</comparator>

Microbial DNA extractions from snap-frozen samples will be undertaken using previously established methods.  Extracted DNA will be amplified using barcoded primer sets that target one of the hypervariable regions of the gene encoding 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A treating investigator will open an envelope corresponding to the patientâ€™s sex and determine their treatment number. This number will correspond to a randomly generated list of numbers and its corresponding group allocation, (A or B.)  This process will be repeated for group B with a repeated randomisation at 6 months for those without a device inserted. At this time a stratified (correcting for sex) block randomisation into 2 equal groups will occur using the same envelope method. </concealment>
    <sequence>Eligible patients will be randomised into two groups (A and B) according to a stratified block randomisation scheme. Stratification will be based on sex as this is likely to be an important variable that should be corrected for to achieve treatment balance. This ensures that the cumulative number of assignments to each treatment arm will be balanced. Two groups of sealed envelopes divided by sex will contain the numbers 1 to 20.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to obtain an understanding of mechanisms of action and the biological and psychosocial effects of an Endoluminal Bariatric Intervention (Endobarrier-DJBS) in an obese diabetic population.

Hypothesis:
Implantation of the Endobarrier device will reduce: 
1.	Body weight as compared to the baseline values and compared to control interventions,
2.	Intraluminal digestion of triglycerides as measures by the 13C triglyceride breath test in patients with EB device as compared to baseline and controls;
3.	Fasting insulin and fasting glucose during the intervention and improvement will be greater in actively treated subjects.
In addition the implantation of the Endobarrier device will:
4.	Alter the mucosal and stool microbiome,
5.	Improve liver function and parameters of fibrosis (elastography, blood tests, liver biopsy ).
6.	Improve cardiopulmonary reserve and exercise capacity,
7.	Improve quality of life, self-image, anxiety and depression will improve in actively treated subjects as compared to baseline.
