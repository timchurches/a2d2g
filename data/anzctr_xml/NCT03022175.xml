Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: SPR741 - SPR741 is a novel chemical entity known as a potentiator that specifically interacts with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria to increase the membrane's permeability. This increase in permeability allows Gram-positive antibiotics to enter and kill the cell.
SAD cohorts: Subjects will receive single doses of SPR741 over 60 minute IV infusion. Planned doses to be studied are 5, 15, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg.
MAD cohorts: Subjects will receive SPR741 over 60 minute IV infusion three times a day (TID). Four dose groups will be studied. Doses will be determined by assessing SAD cohort data.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - The placebo used during this study is normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for injection).
SAD: Subjects will receive single infusions of placebo (0.9% sodium chloride for injection) over 60 minutes.
MAD: Subjects will receive TID infusions of placebo over 60 minutes for 14 days


Treatment: drugs: SPR741
SAD: Double-blind dosing will occur in cohorts 1 through 8. Six participants will receive single doses of SPR741. The dose escalation steps may be altered following review of the safety data upon completion of each cohort.
MAD: The Safety Management Group will evaluate the safety and tolerability data obtained for the participants in Cohorts 1-5 to determine the appropriate dose level of intravenous q8h dosing of SPR741 to be utilized in the first cohort (Cohort 9) in the MAD. Dosing will commence on the morning of Day 1. Three doses will be administered per day at approximately 8 hours apart. Daily dosing will continue for a total of 14 consecutive days.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
0.9% sodium chloride for injection. SAD: Two participants in each cohort will receive matching placebo. MAD: Two participants in each cohort will receive matching placebo.

               2. Triplicate ECGs without QTcF interval duration greater than 450 msec obtained as
                  an average from the triplicate screening and pre-dose Day 1 ECGs after at least 5
                  min in a fully supine quiet rest;

               3. Hemoglobin/hematocrit, white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count greater
                  than the lower limit of normal range of the reference laboratory;
