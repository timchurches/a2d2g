  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Cardiva Champion VCS consists of a sterile disposable catheter containing a deployable extravascular collagen patch and a clip.  The Champion VCS is intended to seal a femoral arterial access site at the end of any procedure that uses a 6French or 7 French cathether to access the femoral artery. This is a one time use device. The procedure of deploying the collagen patch takes less than 3-5 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy endpoint is the time to achieve arterial hemostasis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Index procedure and 30 day Follow-up post procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary safety endpoint is the rate of major complications and the secondary safety endpoint is the rate of minor complications.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Index procedure and 30 day Follow-up post procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary efficacy endpoint is time to ambulation</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ability of the subject to walk 20 feet without evidence of arterial re-bleeding from the access site.  The time to ambulation will be measured in hours from the time the Champion catheter is removed until the subject is able to ambulate.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to discharge.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to discharge is measured from the time the Champion catheter is removed to hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The time to eligibility for hospital discharge</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time to eligibility for hospital discharge is measured from the time the Champion catheter is removed to the time, in the judgment of the investigator, that the subject was eligible for hospital discharge based on institution?s standard of care.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Cardiva VCS consists of a sterile disposable catheter containing a deployable extravascular collagen patch and a clip.  The Cardiva VCS is intended to seal or close the femoral arterial access sites while reducing time to hemostasis (stop the bleeding process) and time to ambulation (when a person can walk) in subjects who have undergone diagnostic or interventional endovascular procedures.</summary>
