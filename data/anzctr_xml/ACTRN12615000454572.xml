  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention period is 7 weeks.
Daily dose of 20g of milk protein concentrate consumed in 200ml of water. subjects will log the consumption of their supplement. during the entire study 
subjects will be provided with breakfast and dinner daily and a nutritionist will give advice on lunch foods to ensure they are consuming 1.0g/kg/day of protein exclusive of the supplement.
During the first week of the study subject's diets will be controlled but they will not consume the supplement or placebo. During the following two weeks they will undergo unilateral lower limb immobilization using a knee brace and will consume the supplement or placebo. During the next two weeks the brace will be removed and they will be asked to take 10,000 steps per day which will be tracked by an accelerometer, they will continue with the supplement or placebo. For the final two weeks of the study subjects will continue to take 10,000 steps per day and will also complete a total of 6 lower body resistance training sessions. Training session will take approximately 30 min in consist of 4 sets preformed to fatigue at 80% of estimated one repetition maximum for both the leg press and leg extension exercise. each session will be supervised at a one-one ratio with a trained investigator. They will continue with the supplement or placebo.   </interventions>

The study was powered based 20% +/- 5% decease in knee extension torque following immobilization and was powered to find a 50% attenuation of muscle torque loss. 80% power was used and alpha was set at 0.05.  This resulted in a subject number of 15 per group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>all subjects complete a 7 week protocol with a dietary intake 1.0g/kg/day of protein. The subjects are free living for the first week, undergo unilateral lower limb immobilization for the following two weeks. the next two weeks subjects are remobilized and encouraged to take 10,000 steps per day. for the final two weeks subjects preform resistance training thrice weekly. subjects are randomized to consume 20g of milk protein or placebo dairying following the free living phase. 

The purpose of this study is to determine if supplemental protein can attenuate muscle and strength loss during immobilization or enhance the degree of muscle and strength regain.

It is hypothesized that supplemental protein will reduce the degree of muscle and strength loss during immobilization and enhance the rate of muscle and strength recovery.          </summary>
