  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: 5:2 Diet  2 consecutive days per week of calorie reduction to 600 calories per day (Optifast Registered Trademark meal replacement for the 3 main meal a day) followed by 5 days of eating to appetite.

Arm 2: Calorie Restriction Diet  moderate (30%) reduction of calories based on baseline energy requirements. This will be calculated for each participant  using their weight, height, age, gender and will follow current Australian Dietary Guidelines. The advise will be provided in a 1 hour session with a Registered Nurse at baseline. an example meal plan will be provided which will outline the breakdown of food serves. This will be based on the entries provided in a Food and Activity Diary which will be completed between the Screening and Randomisation visit.


Participants from both groups will be monitored for hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis and diabetes treatment will be adjusted as required by the Research team.

Both diets will be followed for a 12 week period.

During the treeatment period, adherence to the study diets will be monitored by way of a Food and Activity Diary which will be completed prior to each face-to-face study visit.

      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: The change in HbA1c assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: One year after randomisation with an interim analysis occurring at 13 weeks (ends of active intervention). 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: The change in weight 

Bodyweight measurements will be taken in the fasted state to the nearest 0.1kg in light clothing and without shoes using standard scales. 

Waist circumference will be measured at each face to face study visit using a flexible tape, midway between the lower costal margin and super iliac crest during a period of expiration.  Measurement will be recorded to the nearest 0.1cm. 

Fat mass, free fat mass and energy expenditure will be measured in the fasted state at Baseline and Weeks 13 and 52. Fat mass and free fat mass will be assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: One year after randomisation with an interim analysis occurring at 13 weeks (ends of active intervention).
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: The change in macrovascular risk factor profile (lipids, blood pressure)

Blood pressure will be measured during these visits in a sitting position, after 5 minutes of rest, using a standard syphygmomanometer. Two readings will be taken and the mean result recorded.

Bloods will be collected to assess the lipid profile.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At randomisation, patients will be allocated to a study (ID) number which will be used for the duration of the study. Study (ID) numbers will be sequential so the recruited patients will receive the next available patient number (eg. 1000, 1001, etc). Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of the two study arms using a random allocation table. This table will be developed before commencement of the study. The allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation scedule who will be "off site</concealment>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All data analyses will be performed using the SPSS statistical software package.

The primary endpoint of the study was the change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 13. Change from Baseline will be analysed using a normal linear regression model with treatment, and baseline HbA1c as covariate. A non inferiority limit of 0.4% will be applied. A sample size was calculated assuming difference of 0.4% HbA1c between groups at 12 months (7.4% vs 7.0%) with a standard deviation of 1.0% with an alpha of 5.0% and a beta of 80.0%.

ANOVA will be used to compare all patients on IF and CR diet with respect to changes in parameters of glycaemic control body-composition, neuroendocrine and gut hormone levels, cardio-metabolic health and similarly the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overarching hypothesis is that a weight loss strategy using an intermittent fasting approach will be more efficacious than a conventional 30% calorie restricted diet approaches in the context of diabetes. The overall aim of the project is to compare the safety and metabolic effects of weight loss via an intermittent fasting protocol versus a standard daily calorie restriction protocol in overweight and obese adult subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</summary>
