    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At each centre, patients will be sequentially allocated a patient number.
All syringes will be prepared by the site clinical trial pharmacist according to the randomisation schedule, each syringe will be numbered according to the pre-determined randomisation code and labeled as ketamine/placebo 100, 300 or 500mg. All syringes will look identical in volume and colour to protect the blinding irrespective of the contents.
All new in-patients under the care or shared care of the palliative care team will be screened by the study nurse for their suitability to enter the study. The study nurse will ask the consultant in charge for permission to approach potentially eligible patients. This referral will be recorded within both the CRF and the patient clinical file.
Screening
If patients are suitable for entry and prepared to consent to the study, they will undergo baseline assessments and assessment of eligibility criteria and commence study the following morning. A screening log will be kept of all potentially eligible patients including the reasons for non entry.
At all times, from eligibility screening to completion of the study, all study staff are unaware of the treatment allocation. Allocation is concealed from the investigator at the time of the participant inclusion in the trial, the allocation is determined by contacting the site pharmacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatment for each patient will be allocated according to a block randomisation  schedule held by the central registry in a 1:1 ratio. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation to each code. The central registry will supply strata tables to each site pharmacy.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of the pain-killing drug ketamine in people with widespread cancer who are receiving palliative care and have difficult cancer pain that does not respond well to opioid drugs. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have widespread cancer and are receiving palliative care, and have difficult cancer pain that does not respond well to opioid (morphine-like) drugs. 

Trial details 
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive five days of treatment with increasing doses of ketamine given under the skin (sub-cutaneously), and the other will receive a non-active compound (placebo) also given under the skin. Blood samples will be collected. The study will assess pain control, quality of life, side effects from ketamine, and reduction in the need for usual pain medicines. The study nurses and the doctors and nurses in the ward will monitor all participants closely for any unexpected problems and to ensure that pain is managed appropriately. Ketamine may be helpful for pain related to cancer, especially pain resulting from nerve damage. However studies to date are incomplete and evidence is needed to support continued clinical use. It is hoped that after this study, if ketamine is proven safe and effective in difficult cancer pain, it will become more easily available for Australian cancer patients.</summary>
