  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chronic, randomized, parallel design study over 12 weeks, with 4 intervention groups: 1-placebo
2-fibre supplement (12grams of psyllium, three times daily for a total of 12 weeks; mixed with water and taken before breakfast, lunch and dinner)
3-Healthy eating plan according to the Australian Dietary guidelines (ad libitum (followed according to the participant's discretion) healthy eating plans for all meals and snacks for 12 weeks,  was  based on the dietary guidelines for Australian adults (2002). 
4-fibre supplement (psyllium) plus Healthy eating plan according to the Australian Dietary guidelines</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo consisted of breadcrumbs plus flavouring (12grams of bread crumbs was taken three times daily for a total of 12 weeks; mixed with water and taken before breakfast, lunch and dinner)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved fasting blood lipid, lipoprotein profile, glucose and insulin response was measured by blood analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fasting blood samples taken at 0, 6 and 12 weeks. Analysis of lipids, lipoproteins, glucose and lipids were conducted using different biochemical kits.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved blood pressure after 12 weeks. Blood pressure will be measured by research assistant using Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) measured on the left arm of participants with an automated sphygmomanometer (Dinamap ProCare). Subjects will be rested in a supine position before and during measurements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at 0, 6 and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of overweight/obesity is currently exploding with over 60% of Australian adults in this category, leading to a rapid increase in diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is evidence that adding fibre to the diet can improve cardiovascular and diabetes related risk factors although there is little research on fibre consumed as a supplement with both a normal diet and a healty diet.</summary>
