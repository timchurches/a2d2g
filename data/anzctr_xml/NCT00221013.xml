Treatment: surgery: "augmented" CRRT regimen
We randomly assigned critically ill patients with acute kidney injury to receive CRRT in the form of post-dilution continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) at 25 ml/kg/hr (lower intensity) or 40 ml/kg/hr (higher intensity) of effluent flow.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. The treating clinician believes that the patient requires CRRT for acute renal
             failure.

          2. The clinician is uncertain about the balance of benefits and risks likely to be
             conferred by treatment with higher intensity or lower intensity CRRT.

          3. The treating clinicians anticipate treating the patient with CRRT for at least 72
             hours.

          4. Informed consent has been obtained

          5. The patient fulfils ONE of the following clinical criteria for initiating CRRT:

               -  Oliguria (urine output &lt; 100ml/6hr) that has been unresponsive to fluid
                  resuscitation measures.

               -  Hyperkalemia ([K+] &gt; 6.5 mmol/L).

               -  Severe acidemia (pH &lt; 7.2).

               -  Urea &gt; 25 mmol/liter.

               -  Creatinine &gt;300 micromol/L in the setting of ARF.

               -  Clinically significant organ oedema in the setting of ARF (eg: lung).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Patient age is &lt;18 years.

          2. Death is imminent (&lt;24 hours).

          3. There is a strong likelihood that the study treatment would not be continued in
             accordance with the study protocol.

          4. The patient has been treated with CRRT or other dialysis previously during the same
             hospital admission.

          5. The patient was on maintenance dialysis prior to the current hospitalisation.

          6. The patient's body weight is &lt;60 kg or &gt;100kg.

          7. Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially
             increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this study.</exclusivecriteria>
