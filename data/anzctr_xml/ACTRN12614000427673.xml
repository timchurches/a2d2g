  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be participation in interactive computer based activities using the kinect system and software designed for stroke rehabilitation for up to 50 minutes up to 5 times per week during inpatient rehabilitation stay (2-8 weeks). Sessions will be supervised by a physiotherapist or occupational therapist, and attendance recorded. The software records duration and activities particpated in. 	This will be in addition to usual care 1;1 treatment on the ward by the ward physiotherapist</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control condition will recieve usual care 1;1 treatment on the ward by the ward physiotherapist and participate in a circuit style physical activity program that currently runs on the ward, so that the two groups will be matched for activity level.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasability will be determined using a suite of scales for enjoyment, pain, fatigue, exertion and benefit
1. PAES
2. VAS pain
3. VAS fatigue
4. RPE (borg)
5. Perceived benefit scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored on a daily basis throughout the 8 week duration of therapy.  as well at the end of the trial the SUS (System Usability Scale) will be administered</timepoint>

      <outcome>Activity using an actipal accelerometer worn on the thigh for one week</outcome>
      <timepoint>one week at the start of therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved Physical functioning using a suite of tests;
1. upper limb function using the MAS and box and block test
2. balance using sitting balance test, functional reach (in sitting if required), lateral reach, postural sway and step test
3. mobility using timed up and go and 10 meter walk</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients admitted to the rehabilitation ward a during the trial period will be screened for inclusion by a senior neurological physiotherapist. Eligible patients will be given information about the project and if they are interested, a research assistant (physiotherapist) will be contacted to provide further information.  Written consent will be obtained before participation in the project. A physiotherapist or occupational therapist from another ward will perform the pre- testing before randomisation and in post testing will not be provided with information regarding group allocation. Group allocation will be concealed using consecutively-numbered opaque envelopes, opened after completion of assessment in the presence of the participant</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation into intervention or control group will occur using a computer-generated random number schedule with variable block sizes. Generation of the randomization sequence will be generated by a researcher not involved in recruitment or assessment. Group allocation will be concealed using consecutively-numbered opaque envelopes, opened after completion of assessment in the presence of the participant. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Feasability will be described using qualitative methods and report on the outcome measures of enjoyment, perceived benefit, fatigue and exertion and system usability.
For the outcome measures of activity and the functional measures collected during the RCT we will describe the participants changes in balance and mobility using  t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare normally and non-normally distributed data respectively. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare changes over time and between group changes in data for the outcome measures. The level of significance will be set at 0.05.

A previous Pilot study on feasibility for technology in stroke rehabilitation has used a sample size of 40 participants (Bower, ANZCTR). Data for sub-acute stroke population is available for Forward Functional Reach Test mean (SD) data 25.6 (7.4)cm from Outermans (2010).   A clinically relevant difference of 3.7cm would require a sample size of 63 (p less than 0.05, power 80%).   74 will be recruited to allow for a 15% drop out rate.</statisticalmethods>
