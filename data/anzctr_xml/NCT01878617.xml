  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Historically, medulloblastoma treatment has been determined by the amount of leftover disease
      present after surgery, also known as clinical risk (standard vs. high risk). Recent studies
      have shown that medulloblastoma is made up of distinct molecular subgroups which respond
      differently to treatment. This suggests that clinical risk alone is not adequate to identify
      actual risk of recurrence. In order to address this, we will stratify medulloblastoma
      treatment in this phase II clinical trial based on both clinical risk (low, standard,
      intermediate, or high risk) and molecular subtype (WNT, SHH, or Non-WNT Non-SHH). This
      stratified clinical and molecular treatment approach will be used to evaluate the following:

        -  To find out if participants with low-risk WNT tumors can be treated with a lower dose of
           radiation to the brain and spine, and a lower dose of the chemotherapy drug
           cyclophosphamide while still achieving the same survival rate as past St. Jude studies
           with fewer side effects.

        -  To find out if adding targeted chemotherapy after standard chemotherapy will benefit
           participants with SHH positive tumors.

        -  To find out if adding new chemotherapy agents to the standard chemotherapy will improve
           the outcome for intermediate and high risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors.

        -  To define the cure rate for standard risk Non-WNT Non-SHH tumors treated with reduced
           dose cyclophosphamide and compare this to participants from the past St. Jude study.

      All participants on this study will have surgery to remove as much of the primary tumor as
      safely possible, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The amount of radiation therapy and
      type of chemotherapy received will be determined by the participant's treatment stratum.
      Treatment stratum assignment will be based on the tumor's molecular subgroup assignment and
      clinical risk.

      The participant will be assigned to one of three medulloblastoma subgroups determined by
      analysis of the tumor tissue for tumor biomarkers:

        -  WNT (Strata W): positive for WNT biomarkers

        -  SHH (Strata S): positive for SHH biomarkers

        -  Non-WNT Non-SHH, Failed, or Indeterminate (Strata N): negative for WNT and SHH
           biomarkers or results are indeterminable

      Participants will then be assigned to a clinical risk group (low, standard, intermediate, or
      high) based on assessment of:

        -  How much tumor is left after surgery

        -  If the cancer has spread to other sites outside the brain [i.e., to the spinal cord or
           within the fluid surrounding the spinal cord, called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]

        -  The appearance of the tumor cells under the microscope

        -  Whether or not there are chromosomal abnormalities in the tumor, and if present, what
           type (also called cytogenetics analysis)</summary>
