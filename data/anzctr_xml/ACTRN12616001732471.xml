  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive a single clinic-based appointment with a nurse during the weeks following the birth of their child. During this appointment all mothers will complete a questionnaire comprised of a 4-item parenting problems scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Mothers who score &gt;7 on the EPDS and report at least one problem on the 4-item parenting problems questionnaire will be recruited to the study. Mothers in the intervention arm will be assigned to an online group comprised of 20 mothers of similar-aged infants. They will be provided with access to an internet based program for a four month period (when their child is aged 2-6 months). The app is an extension of that used in the New Technology for New Mums trial (ACTRN12613000204741) and encourages mothers to exchange information and mutual support and to seek help from their nurse moderator when necessary. Mothers will be able to access the app at any time. Sections of the app, such as the 'Resources' component, have been enriched and content includes both Parenting resources and self-guided modules to help reduce depressive symptoms. Resources will be posted for discussion twice per week, and mothers can post their messages in "Chat', and complete related 'Activities'. Nurses will also direct mothers to the 'Resources' during group discussions. Mothers will have the option of privately messaging their Nurse, although they are made aware that the Nurse in only online every few days. Intervention adherence and fidelity will be assessed using system measures such as number of logins, posts to 'Chat', and number and type of resources accessed. Mothers will also complete a questionnaire about their experience with the app. Strategies to improve adherence and fidelity include Nurses contacting mothers directly by phone when, in their clinical judgement, they consider it necessary, and also, methods of reporting problems within the app itself.  Mothers in the intervention will also have access to standard care services.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive 'Standard Care' which involves a standard home-based health check in the weeks following the child's birth. These mothers can then access the normal range of services available in South Australia. The normal services include face-to-face, nurse moderated group support and/or access to a range of  community-based resources. Alternatively, mothers can choose to receive no further support. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test the effectiveness of a 4-month nurse-moderated, group-based internet intervention for mothers experiencing mild to moderate levels of depression. The intervention will be delivered to mothers of infants aged 2-6 months and outcomes will be evaluated when infants are aged 8 months and 12 months. Approximately 160 mothers and infants will be recruited, half of whom will receive the internet based program, whilst the remaining families will receive standard care. The outcomes for the project include maternal depressive symptoms, maternal caregiving, parenting competence, service utilisation, and intervention quality.</summary>
