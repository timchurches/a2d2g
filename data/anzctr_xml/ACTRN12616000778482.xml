  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, simple, and safe computer-based intervention that requires behavioural responses from participants (i.e., pressing one of two buttons). CBM specifically targets attentional and interpretative biases associated with anxiety, dysphoria, and depression. CBM operates through implicit learning systems.

In this trial two forms of CBM will comprise the intervention, CBM-A (attentional modification) and CBM-I (interpretive modification).

During CBM-A participants will be repeatedly exposed to pairs of emotional faces. Each face pair includes one face displaying a negative emotion, and one face portraying a non-negative emotion.  The presentation of each face pair lasts 500 ms. After each face pair has been presented, a probe is presented in the same spatial position where one of the faces was located. Participants are asked to indicate the shape of each probe by pressing a square or a circle on a response box. The time taken for participants to discriminate the identity of the probe is recorded. In the active CBM-A condition, designed to reduce attention to negative information, and expected to result in subsequent reduction in symptoms of depression, probes always appear in the position of non-negative faces.

During CBM-I, participants will be repeatedly exposed to single ambiguous words (e.g. 'cane') for 1000 ms on the computer screen, followed by a pair of words. In each word pair, one word will be semantically related to either a negative or benign meaning (e.g. 'hit' or 'furniture') of the cue word, and one semantically unrelated word (e.g. 'cloud'). Participants will be asked to indicate whether the semantically related word appeared on the left or right side of the computer screen by pressing the left or right button on a response box. The time taken for participants to discriminate the location of the semantically related word is recorded. In the active CBM-I condition, designed to reduce negative interpretation of ambiguous information, and expected to result in subsequent reduction in symptoms of depression, the semantically related word will always present a benign meaning.

In this trial, each CBM session will last approximately 30 minutes: 15 minutes each for CBM-A and CBM-I. Over the course of the trial the CBM sessions will take place during office hours as follows: Week 1  daily, Week 2 - 3 times, Weeks 3 to 12  fortnightly, Weeks 13 to 26  monthly (total of 16 sessions over 6 months). The CBM sessions will be delivered on a local PC station at the study centre under supervision of a trained research officer. The first session will also comprise initial baseline assessment of primary and secondary outcome measures.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition will follow the same procedure as described for the active intervention group, except for the following minor changes. During  the CBM-A control condition, probes will appear with equal frequency in the location of non-negative and negative faces. During the CBM-I control condition, the semantically related words will portray a benign or negative meaning with equal frequency. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is common in people with Alzheimers disease (AD) and their carers and is a frequent cause of distress and reduced quality of life (QoL). Pharmacological treatment is modestly effective in treating major depression, although this is largely ineffective in those with milder depression (subsyndromal depression - SSD) and in people with dementia ,and is frequently associated with unacceptable side effects. It is therefore essential that we are able to identify safe and easily accessible therapies for these debilitating symptoms.
Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a simple, novel and safe intervention that targets attentional and interpretative biases associated with anxiety and depression. CBM has been shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in younger adults but studies in people with cognitive impairment and their carers are lacking. Our preliminary research has indicated that CBM is well tolerated by people with AD and could be easily accessed at home, making it a potentially invaluable intervention for depression in this population.
The aims of this study are to determine; The effect of CBM in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in AD, the effect of CBM in improving mood in carers of people with AD, and the effect of CBM on QOL of people with AD and their carers. People with AD and their carers (dyads) will be randomly assigned to an active or control CBM intervention in a 2 x 2 double-blind, parallel design. The intervention will be conducted over 6 months. For AD participants and carers, change in severity of depressive symptoms, and change in QoL, after 12 weeks, will be outcomes of primary interest. For AD participants and carers, change in severity of depressive symptoms after completion of treatment at 26 weeks, and incidence of major depression at 6 months, will be secondary outcomes of interest. Burden of care as reported by carers at 12 and 26 weeks will also be a secondary outcome of interest.
Dementia is a common condition and is frequently associated with a diverse range of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety. Our current understanding of the cause and management of these symptoms is far from optimal. The proposed study trials a simple and safe treatment that could be easily implemented into everyday clinical practice. This study will provide high quality evidence for the efficacy of CBM in improving the quality of lives of people with AD.</summary>
