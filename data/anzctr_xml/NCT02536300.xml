    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Idelalisib

Experimental: Idelalisib 150 mg - Participants will receive idelalisib 150 mg twice daily. Based on the 8-week blinded independent review committee (IRC) response assessment, participants may be discontinued from the study or may receive blinded or open-label idelalisib 150 mg twice daily.

Experimental: Idelalisib 100 mg - Participants will receive idelalisib 100 mg twice daily. Based on the 8-week blinded IRC response assessment, participants may either be dose escalated to open-label 150 mg twice daily or maintain blind and continue on idelalisib 100 mg twice daily.


Treatment: drugs: Idelalisib
