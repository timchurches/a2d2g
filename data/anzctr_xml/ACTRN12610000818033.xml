  <interventions>
    <interventions>The experiment consisted of a pre-training and a post-training evaluation.  For a period of 4 minutes between both evaluations, two groups will be trained. Only one training session will be applied. The supine training group should be performed in infants while in the supine position on a mat. For the seated training group, the examiner should sit comfortably with the trunk supported, with the legs slightly apart, with hips and knees around 120 degrees and 50 degrees respectively. On your knees should be placed a small pillow and, on this, the infant's head. This will encourage the infant to remain face to face with the examiner, with his neck in semi-flexion, facilitating the alignment between head and trunk, and hands at the midline.</interventions>
    <comparator>The infants in the control group were not stimulated and will remain in his mother's lap for 4 minutes. But even without  training, infants will be evaluated on seated and supine positions.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to verify the effect of seated and supine training on on spatio-temporal parameters of reaching in fullterm infants. It is understood that the development of manual reaching in infants may be influenced by practice. It is believed that especially after the onset of reaching in infants, when the infant still has not practiced skill intensive, specific training can affect their kinematic parameters of reach. This fact may help understanding of how the adaptation process is guided by the body's sensorimotor experiences during the onset of reaching in infants.</summary>
