  <interventions>
    <interventions>DUR-928 (powder for constitution): 30 mg/mL DUR-928 solution after constitution with sterile vehicle solution.
Placebo: sterile vehicle solution. The sterile vehicle solution contains hydroxypropyl betadex in phosphate buffered water. 
Each subject will receive a single dose of either active DUR-928 or placebo. The constituted DUR-928 solution, or placebo vehicle, is appropriately diluted with glucose 5% intravenous solution to prepare the infusion solution. The dose will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion. The doses of the intervention are described below per cohort:
Cohort 1: 50 mg/100 mL DUR-928 or placebo (vehicle solution) administered over 2 hours via IV infusion
Cohort 2: TBD* mg/100 mL of DUR 928 or placebo (vehicle solution) administered over 2 hours via IV infusion 
*Note: Dose level for Cohort 2 will be determined after review of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data of Cohort 1 and will not exceed 300 mg. 
Study participants will take part in only one cohort. All study participants will be confined to the study unit for the treatment period. Study staff will administer all doses.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo: sterile vehicle solution. The sterile vehicle solution contains hydroxypropyl betadex in phosphate buffered water.
Each subject will receive a single dose of either active DUR-928 or placebo according to the intervention they are randomised to. The dose will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single, ascending intravenous (IV) doses of DUR-928 in healthy volunteers. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Routine vital sign measurements (blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR] and respiratory rate [RR]) will be measured at screening, Day -1, pre-dose, 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose, and at trial completion (Day 7). Temperature measurements will be measured at screening, Day-1, pre-dose, 48 hours post-dose initiation and at trial completion (Day 7).
Continuous telemetry monitoring will be initiated pre-dose and continue throughout intravenous infusion of study drug (at least 2 hours post-dose).
Physical examination will be performed at screening, Day -1, and at trial completion (Day 7). The physical exam done on Day -1 will be abbreviated.
Safety Laboratory tests (Chemistry, Hematology, Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and Urinalysis) will be drawn at screening, Day  1, 24 and 48 hours post-dose, and at trial completion (Day 7).
All adverse events will be collected from Day -1 and continues through to trial completion (Day 7).
Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained from subjects at screening, Day -1, pre-dose, and at approximately 1, 2 and 48 hours post-dose initiation.  Additional ECGs may be obtained if clinically indicated.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the pharmacokinetics of DUR-928 in plasma following administration of single, ascending intravenous doses in healthy volunteers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The following PK parameters will be assessed - Cmax, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Terminal elimination rate constant, AUC0-last, AUC0-t, AUCinf, %AUCexp, T1/2, Vz/F, CL/F.
Blood samples will be collected for analysis of plasma concentrations of DUR-928 and 25 hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) up to 48 hours after initiation of study drug administration.  The samples will be collected at pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post study drug initiation. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine any dose limiting adverse drug effects following single ascending intravenous doses of DUR-928 in healthy volunteers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are no known systemic, dose-related or serious adverse reactions to DUR-928 when given as an oral solution to healthy volunteers in doses up to 1000 mg or when given as an intramuscular injection to healthy volunteers in doses up to 300mg. Hypersensitivity reactions have not been observed to date
Possible adverse reactions to the intravenous infusion of DUR-928 may include pain or discomfort at the infusion site.  Any other adverse events will be recorded on a standard case report form and will be followed until resolution.
Timepoint: Adverse events are collected for the duration of the study; from Day -1 to the study completion visit (Day 7).

    <concealment>2 cohorts of 8 subjects will be dosed with a 3:1 randomisation ratio -  6 subjects receiving DUR-928 and 2 subjects receiving placebo. The dose will be provided to blinded subjects by study staff in a blinded fashion.
A central randomization schedule will be generated by the INC Research Head of Biometrics personnel â€“ who will have no further involvement in the study. The central Randomization schedule will be provided only to the site pharmacy staff (unblinded) who will be exclusively responsible for preparing the doses. Subjects will be assigned a randomization number in sequential order, as their eligibility is confirmed, by blinded site staff (who have no access to the Randomization schedule).</concealment>

    <designfeatures>2 cohorts (8 subjects per cohort) will be given a single intravenous infusion of DUR-928 or placebo. For each cohort, subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio - 6 subjects will receive active (DUR-928) and 2 subjects will receive placebo. Cohort 2 continues only after the safety assessment of Cohort 1. 16 subjects in total will be enrolled.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Safety  Safety will be evaluated by assessment of clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations including vital signs, and ECGs, and by the documentation of all spontaneously reported adverse events. Safety will be summarised by dose level.
Pharmacokinetics  Plasma concentration data of DUR-928 and its metabolite at each dose level will be used to calculate relevant pharmacokinetic parameters.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will summarized by dose level, using descriptive statistics.
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no power or sample size calculations have been performed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at how safe and well tolerated a new drug called DUR-928 is when given as an intravenous infusion to healthy volunteers. The study will look at the study drugs safety and tolerability when given as a single dose at 2 different dose levels. The pharmacokinetics of DUR-928 will also be studied; this is done by measuring the amount of DUR-928 in the blood at different times throughout the dosing periods, allowing us to evaluate how DUR-928 is handled by the body (for example how quickly it gets into the blood stream). </summary>
