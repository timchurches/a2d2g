  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 12 week multi-faceted podiatry treatment consisting of foot orthotics; foot and ankle exercises performed both in the clinic and on a daily basis at home; and education and advice concerning appropriate footwear, analgesia, weight management and general physical activity. These are explained in more detail below:

Foot orthotics: prefabricated device with (a) a first ray cut out unless pain is exacerbated, or (b) a morton's extension if pain is exacerbated with the cut out. People with a FPI score &gt;7 will also have a varus wedge added. After a familiarisation period, participants will be advised to wear their orthotics as much as possible each day, however at  a minimmum, they will be advised to wear them for at least 6 hours every day.
Exercises: Performed twice daily for an approximate duration of 20 minutes each, and including (a) Isometric flexor hallucis strengthening (push toe in to ground) performed 10 x 10 seconds, (b) mobilisation performed by first metatarsophalangeal joint distraction (one minute) and glides (one minute), (c) plantar foot massage using a ball for 5 minutes
Advice delivered by the podiatrist during each participant's initial clinical visit (approx 10 minutes). This will include advice on analgesia (a maximum of 4 g/day of paracetamol if needed), weight management (general advice and dietitian referral if needed) and physical activity (30 minutes on most days) will be provided and reinforced with an Arthritis Australia booklet).

Treatment adherence will be self-assessed in a log book and participants will be sent reminder emails by a research assistant.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a proof of concept study designed to generate important feasibility, safety and efficacy data to be used to inform a future large randomised controlled trial. Using confidence intervals to help determine samples size for pilot studies, samples between 10-15 have been suggested to be adequate. Thus we have selected a sample size of 15 individuals per group, or 30 participants in total.

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the effect of each treatment over time (pre/post) on pain and functional outcome measures, with group allocation as the fixed factor and corresponding baseline outcome values as covariates. Alpha will be set at 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this proof of concept study is to investigate a multi-faceted podiatry intervention in people with symptomatic first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis. 

Specific aims are:

1.	To determine the feasibility, safety and perceived patient response to a multi-faceted podiatry intervention in people with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis.
2.	To investigate the efficacy of a multi-faceted podiatry intervention on pain and self-reported function compared to usual care in people with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis.

People with first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis will receive either the podiatry intervention or usual care of analgesia and advice, and feasibility data, as well as changes in pain and function will be assessed after 12 weeks. </summary>
