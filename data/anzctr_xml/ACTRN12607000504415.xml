  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nil interventions.  It is a questionnaire based study only.  The questionnaire asks questions about the information people received about fertility, sexuality and vaginal Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD).  It also questions whether women had problems with these issues and whether these problems were effectively resolved.  There is only one questionnaire for participants to complete.  It will be posted out to eligible women (women who are at least 6 months post transplant). This will take participants 15 - 20 minutes to complete.  If the questionnaire is not returned within 4 weeks a reminder post card will be sent out.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the impact that a transplant specific gynaecology service for women has for women undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation in the areas of fertility, sexuality and vaginal graft versus host disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study to be completed by 2010.
The study consists of a single questionnaire.  I am hoping that the required number of participants will have completed the questionnaire by then and I will be analysing the data and writing up the research.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sexuality and fertility concerns confront men and women post allogeneic haematolpoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Surviving a transplant is much more likely today due to better supportive care and better medications. Improving the lives of people who have had transplants is increasingly the main focus of ongoing care.  Many of the problems that occur after a transplant are related to graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD can affect the vagina and is an important post transplant adverse event.  This study uses a questionnaire to formally evaluate how a structured gynaecology service for women who have had a transplant assists in the prevention and early treatment of this complication.  It will also assess the information needs of women in order that better resources might be made available to women in this area of currently unmet need.</summary>
