  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will enrol patients with maximally resected (via transurethral resection (TURBT)
      non-metastatic muscle invasive bladder cancer, who either wish to attempt bladder
      preservation therapy or are ineligible for cystectomy. Patients must have adequate organ
      function and performance status to receive cisplatin based chemoradiotherapy, and no
      contraindications to the use of pembrolizumab. The study will enrol 30 patients to be treated
      with pembrolizumab and radiotherapy.

      All patients will be planned to be treated with 64Gy of radiation therapy in 32 fractions
      over 6 weeks and 2 days. All patients will receive cisplatin 35mg/m2 IV concurrently weekly
      with radiation therapy for 6 doses total. Pembrolizumab will commence concurrently with
      radiation and be given 200mg IV every 21 days, continuing until the 12 week cystoscopy and
      assessment.

      Surveillance cystoscopy will be performed 12 weeks after the commencement of
      chemoradiotherapy, and assess the rate of complete response to therapy. A safety follow up
      visit will occur 4 and 12 weeks post cystoscopy. From week 31 survival follow up will
      commence with clinical assessment, cystoscopy and CT staging performed at intervals until 5
      years.

      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of combining pembrolizumab
      with chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint assessed will be safety, as defined by a
      satisfactorily low rate of unacceptable toxicity (G3-4 adverse events or failure of
      completion of planned chemotherapy and radiotherapy according to defined parameters). The
      secondary endpoint will be efficacy, as assessed by complete response rate of the primary
      tumour at first post chemoradiotherapy cystoscopic assessment. Exploratory analysis will
      include assessment of tumour histopathological, molecular, genetic and immunological
      parameters.

      It is expected that it will take two years to accrue the required 30 patients.</summary>
