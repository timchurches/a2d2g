  <interventions>
    <interventions>CF subjects will have 2 study days on which they will consume a high fat/ carbohydrate pancake at approximately 8.30am after fasting from both solids and liquids from 10pm the previous evening.  The study days will be separated by at least 24 hours so no residual 13C Na-octanoate is present at the time of the second study. 

The pancake in the CF group will either be: (1) with pancreatic enzymes [1 generic capsule filled with 50,000U lipase] or (2) placebo without pancreatic enzyme replacement [1 generic capsule filled with microcellulose prepared by the pharmacy].
 
Pancreatic enzyme replacement
In the CF group the enzyme replacement will be double blinded and the order of the studies (one with and one without enzyme replacement) will be randomised.  The capsules will be given by a medication cup so that any difference in weight and feel cant be distinguished. Creon Forte/placebo capsules will be provided on the day of the study and will be taken at the start of the meal by the CF subjects.  

Insulin administration
CF subjects who are normally on insulin will administer their ultrashort insulin analog (novorapid) before the ingestion of the meal at time -15minutes, via subcutaneous injection or an insulin pump. 

Pancake
Each subject will consume the pancake within 5min. t = 0 is defined as the time of meal completion. The standard pancake (70g of Greens (Trademark) Pancake and Pikelet Mix mixed with 100mL water and cooked with 10g butter; total of 13.5 g fat, 44.2g of carbohydrate, 252 Calories) will be modified to increase the fat content to 40g by replacing some of the H2O with polyunsaturated oil. This represents the high fat diet prescribed to CF subjects and will maximize the effect of pancreatic enzymes. 

After consuming the pancake CF subjects will undergo a gastric emptying breath test and measurement of incretin hormones over 4 hours.</interventions>

      <outcome>Evaluate the relationship of postprandial glycaemia with gastric emptying and incretin response in young people with cystic fibrosis

Assessments:
Gastric Empyting:
13C labelled Na-octanoate (100mg) will be added to each pancake. Samples will be analysed for 13CO2 using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. 13CO2 excretion rate will be used to calculate gastric emptying using a non-linear regression model as co -investigators have described.

Blood samples: Incretin hormones/insulin/glucagon/glucose
Blood glucose concentration will be measured immediately using a glucometer (Medisense Companion 2), and the remainder of the sample will be placed in EDTA tubes containing aprotinin on ice. Plasma will be separated and samples stored at -70 degrees C for subsequent analysis of plasma insulin, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP using established assays at Royal Adelaide Hospital.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gut emptying is of central importance to blood glucose levels after meals and is a major determinant of overall blood glucose control in diabetes. Blood glucose levels and insulin release after meals are also influenced by secretion of hormones from the gut in response to a meal. The gut hormones stimulate insulin secretion in response to raised blood glucose levels. However fat, rather than carbohydrate may be the most potent stimulus for gut hormone release. 

We aim to measure the effect of gut emptying and gut hormone release on high blood glucose levels  in youth with cystic fibrosis (CF). We will determine whether the adequate replacement of pancreatic enzymes improves blood glucose levels after meals in youth with CF. Our findings for gut hormone release will inform investigation of potential therapies, eg. free fatty acid therapy, to prime gut hormone release to reduce the impact of high blood glucose levels on the complications associated with CF. 

Hypothesis : In young people with CF
i) Gut emptying of a high fat/carbohydrate meal will be abnormally rapid.
ii) Abnormal emptying will be associated with high blood glucose levels after a meal and reduced gut hormone secretion  and insulin responses.
iii) These abnormal responses will be normalised by pancreatic enzyme supplementation.</summary>
