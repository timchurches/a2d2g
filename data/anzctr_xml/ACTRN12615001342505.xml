  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients outcomes following 1st metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint arthrodesis for hallux rigidus  will be measured using a self-reported questionnaire of patient concerns using open ended questions, and the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle (AOFAS) Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal (MTP-IP) scale. Participants will be assessed at two weeks, 6 weeks and three months following surgery.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to assess patient satisfaction with surgery.   Patients will be free to respond to questionnaires without the restriction of closed-ended questions. The questionnaire was designed specifically for the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients participating in the study will be questioned two weeks post surgery, 6 weeks post surgery and 3 months after surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative complications including symptomatic hardware removal, metatarsalgia or clawing, non union and interphalangeal joint pain can also be established as a result of the post operative questionnaire.  The questionnaire was specifically developed for this study to enable patient to provide open answered responses.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Changes in mean AOFAS scores before and after surgery will be analysed using paired t-test on GraphPad software.  The level of significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Since no other study of this kind has been performed we can not calculate the appropriate sample size for this study.  Based on out bio-statistician's recommendations we estimate that 100 patients will be sufficient to appropriately power our statistical analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hallux Rigidus is the most common arthritic condition of the foot, causing pain and stiffness of the 1st metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.  Consideration of surgical management following failure of nonoperative treatment is based on multiple factors including age and activity level of the patient, as well as the severity of the arthritis.  An arthrodesis of this joint is regarded as the gold standard for treatment of end stage hallux rigidus.  The goal of this procedure is to relieve pain and improve functional status.  Our study aims to collect information regarding the outcomes of surgery from a patients perspective.  This information will allow surgeons to ensure that patients are fully informed of the implications of surgery. </summary>
