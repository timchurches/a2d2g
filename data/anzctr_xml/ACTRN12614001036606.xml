    <interventions>Exercise and stress inoculation therapy (SIT). SIT: A physiotherapist will provide 6 sessions (1 per week) of SIT, teaching strategies to assist participants in managing acute stress responses. In the first session this will include an educational session about the effects of acute stress following an injury. At subsequent sessions additional strategies will be utilised including progressive muscle relaxation and breath control exercises, simple cognitive behavioural skills to encourage positive coping, and reduce avoidance behaviours, and problem solving skills. SIT consists of three phases: 1. Identify and understanding stress. Identifying specific stressors and how these impact on pain, behaviour, emotions, physical performance and thoughts.  2. Developing skills for managing stress such as relaxation, problem solving and helpful coping self-statements. Participants will practice these skills on a weekly basis with home practice (once/day). The duration of the home practice will be dependant on the participants.  It is anticipated that some participants make take longer to complete the home practice than others. 3. Applying skills in various stressful situations to develop tolerance and confidence. All intervention sessions will be for a maximum of 50 minutes.

Participants will be provided with a specific app called Stressmod which will be available through the Apple app store and the Android play store to assist with their required daily practice of the taught skills. As part of Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), a complementary smart phone application has been created. StressMod is a mobile application that helps users learn and practice relaxation and stress management techniques. Compliance will be monitored by logging the use of the app. The home practice will take a maximum of 5-10 minutes/day. 

Exercise:The 6-week exercise program will be carried out under the supervision of the physiotherapist (2 sessions in weeks 1-4 and 1 session in the weeks 5 and 6).The exercise program will comprise specific exercises to improve the movement and control of the neck and shoulder girdles as well as exercises to improve eye/head co-ordination. The exercises will be tailored by the physiotherapist for each individual participant. The exercises are of a low load nature and are designed to be pain free. At the same time, the physiotherapist will guide the participants return to normal activities. The program begins with a clinical examination of the cervical muscles and the axio-scapular-girdle muscles and includes tests that assess ability to recruit the muscles in a coordinated manner, tests of balance, cervical kinaesthesia and eye movement control and tests of muscle endurance at low levels of maximum voluntary contraction. The specific impairments that are identified are then addressed with an exercise program that is supervised and progressed by the physiotherapist. This specific treatment program focuses on activating and improving the co-ordination and endurance capacity of the neck flexor, extensor and scapular muscles in specific exercises and functional tasks, and a graded program directed to the postural control system, including balance exercises, head relocation exercises and exercises for eye movement control. Participants will also perform the exercises at home, once/day. Written and illustrated exercise instructions will be provided. A log book will be completed by participants to record compliance with the exercises. Duration of exercises at home will depend on the exercises prescribed by the physiotherapist and the ability of the participant to perform these exercises but will be no longer that 15 minutes/day.

    <concealment>Allocation will occur immediately following the baseline assessment. At this time, an independent (un-blinded) researcher will select the next envelope in the box, record the participant’s randomisation number and then open the envelope. In this way concealment of allocation and blinding of baseline measures is ensured. Participants will be considered to have entered the study at the time that the envelope is opened. The independent researcher who randomised the participant will then arrange the initial appointment with the treatment provider site within one week of randomisation. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The effect of treatments will be analysed separately for each outcome utilising linear mixed models with time as a repeated factor. Correlation over time within participants, and correlation with clinical potential confounders (e.g. important prognostic factors) will be accounted for in the model. The effect of potential confounders on the results obtained in the analysis will be examined. Any potentially confounding variable will be retained if its inclusion changes the estimated treatment effects by a clinically relevant amount. Estimates of the effect of the intervention will be obtained by constructing linear contrasts comparing the mean change in outcome from baseline to each time point between the treatment and control groups, with adjustment for the other variables. 
Sample size: We are interested in detecting a clinically important difference between the two interventions, given that baseline values for each group are statistically equivalent as a result of the randomisation. Based on a two-sided t-test a sample of 86 (43 per group) will provide 80%  power to detect a significant difference at alpha 0.05 between the group means of 10 points on the 100 point NDI (assuming a SD of 16, based on our pilot data and data from recent trials ). Effects smaller than this are unlikely to be considered clinically worthwhile.  Allowing for a 15% loss to follow up by 12 months, we would require 50 subjects per treatment group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, measured in terms of pain and disability, of the integrated addition of an intervention aimed at modulating early stress responses (SIT) to a standard physiotherapy exercise approach for individuals with acute whiplash injury. The second aim is to investigate the effectiveness of integrated SIT and physiotherapy exercise in decreasing post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and depression.

It is hypothesised that: 

* In individuals with acute whiplash, SIT integrated into a physiotherapy exercise program will be more effective than exercise alone where effect is measured in terms of pain related disability. That is, individuals in the SIT and exercise group will experience statistically significant, greater improvements in self-reported pain and disability than the exercise only group immediately following the 6 week block of treatment. These improvements will be sustained at the 6 month and 12 month follow-up. 
* The effect of SIT integrated into physiotherapy exercise will also be greater than that of physiotherapy exercise alone where effect is measured in terms of post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, depression, pain catastrophising and fear of movement. In other words, participants who receive SIT intervention will exhibit improved coping strategies, reflected by statistically significant reductions in psychological parameters listed above.
