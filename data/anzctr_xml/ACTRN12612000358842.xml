  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiac rehabilitation programs have been proven to improve a range of cardiovascular and psychosocial risk factors in cardiac patients; however, the decline in sustained exercise in post-cardiac rehabilitation patients suggests the need for interventions to both maintain physical activity as well as offsetting the risks of future cardiac incidents. Evidence supports the use of yoga highlighting strong adherence rates to yoga exercise and significant improvements in stress, depression, anxiety and physical aspects of health in a range of healthy and clinical populations. 
This current study aims to determine whether a standardised yoga intervention will improve stress, anxiety, depression, cardiovascular function and cognitive function in post-cardiac rehabilitation patients. This is a 16 week randomised control trial using a range of psychological and physical tests to determine the effects of a 12 week yoga intervention and whether beneficial effects persist 4 week after the end of the intervention.</summary>
