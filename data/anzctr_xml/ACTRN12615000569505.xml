  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Pilot study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing four formulations of isotretinoin with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, isotretinoin is a medicine that is used to treat severe forms of acne.

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulations of isotretinoin, 1 x 40 mg capsule (T1, T2 and T3) on one occasion each and the innovator formulation of isotretinoin, 1 x 40 mg capsule on one occasion with each dose separated by a one week washout period.  The intervention for this trial is the test formulations of isotretinoin.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with each dose).
Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after each dose.
Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorized water or food intake and for personal safety.  
Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 12 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance and for 24 hours after dosing.
Participants will be monitored for adverse events throughout the study.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed.  Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 12 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of the participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing.

Each dose will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature.  Medication  must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure that the medication has been taken as directed. </interventions>
    <comparator>Single dose, crossover study whereby each participant receives the test formulation of isotretinoin (1 x 40 mg) on three occasions and the innovator formulation of isotretinoin (1 x 40 mg) on one occasion with each dose separated by a one week washout period.  The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator formulation of isotretinoin.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) of the three test formulations relative to that of the reference formulation.  All plasma samples will be assayed for isotretinoin using one fully validated LC/MS/MS method.  Validation will be conducted to comply with FDA guidelines.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis.  Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points.</outcome>
