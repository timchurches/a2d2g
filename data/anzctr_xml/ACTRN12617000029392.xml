  <interventions>
    <interventions>Half the participants (randomly allocated) will complete a brief intervention in regards to pre-event rumination. The intervention will be administered individually. The advantages and disadvantages of pre-event rumination will be elicited and any erroneous advantages cognitively challenged and reappraised. Intervention is structured but tailored to reflect an individuals unique concerns. Once it is clear to the participants that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and that they have control over the rumination process, participants will then be instructed to not engage in pre-event rumination, in regards to the upcoming speech task they have been instructed to complete in a few days time (i.e., to ban pre-event rumination). Intervention will be delivered by a registered psychologist, will be delivered face-to-face, and will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The intervention will be video recorded with a subset analysed by a second research to assess fidelity. 

four days following the intervention, all participants complete a 3 minute speech task on a topic of their choosing. The speech task is filmed to allow two independent judges to appraise it for performance at a later time point. No feedback is provided to the participant regarding performance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Negative rumination is a key maintaining factor in social anxiety disorder and the current study seeks to advance the limited literature on pre-event rumination in social anxiety. Given the lack of research investigating the effects of specific interventions on pre-event rumination, it is imperative to trial strategies that may reduce the frequency of pre-event rumination in individuals with social anxiety. This will have the positive benefit of assisting an individual with social anxiety to not enter a social situation in a negative self-focused processing mode and anticipating failure. One such strategy that has previously been suggested, but yet to be determined as efficacious, is instructing individuals with social anxiety to ban rumination as it serves no adaptive purpose for them. Additionally, the temporal pattern of pre-event rumination is unclear and determining this will assist in understanding this process for individuals with social anxiety and also make clearer when future interventions should be trialled.  Specially this study aims are to investigate:
1.	The effects of a brief intervention that instructs individuals to not engage in negative pre-event rumination.
2.	The temporal pattern of pre-event rumination and determine optimal time points for future interventions to be delivered.     
The present study hypothesises that: 
1.	Individuals with social anxiety disorder whom receive the brief intervention will report reduced negative pre-event rumination before a planned speech task, compared to a control group, and thus will report reduce state anxiety in relation to a speech task.
2.	While it is suggested that frequency, uncontrollability, severity, and distress of pre-event rumination will increase in linear fashion in the days before the planned speech task, the lack of research regarding the experience of pre-event rumination for individuals with social anxiety precludes a firm hypothesis.
