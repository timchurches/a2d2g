    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tocilizumab
Treatment: drugs - Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
Treatment: drugs - Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Treatment: drugs - Oral corticosteroids

Experimental: Tocilizumab - Participants received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks till the end of the study (up to 7 years, 7 months). In addition, participants may have also received disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and oral corticosteroids at the discretion of the investigator.


Treatment: drugs: Tocilizumab
For participants weighing &gt; 100 kg, the maximum dose of tocilizumab was 800 mg. Tocilizumab was supplied as a sterile solution in vials.

Treatment: drugs: Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs included methotrexate, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, parenteral gold, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, and leflunomide. These drugs could be used alone or in combination, except for the combination of methotrexate and leflunomide, which was not allowed.

Treatment: drugs: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Participants could be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs up to the maximum recommended dose throughout the study. The choice and doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were at the discretion of the investigator.

Treatment: drugs: Oral corticosteroids
Oral corticosteroids (= 10 mg/day) were permitted during the study.

      <outcome>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index Score at Baseline and Weeks 24, 48, 108, 156, 204, and 264 - The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. To calculate the overall score, the patient must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The HAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28) From Baseline to Weeks 24, 48, 96, and 264 - The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatic arthritis (RA) and includes swollen and tender joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH) status. The index is calculated with the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × v(TJC28)) + (0.28 × v(SJC28)) + (0.7 × log(ESR)) + (0.014 × GH), where TJC28 = tender joint count and SJC28 = swollen joint count, each on 28 joints. GH = a patient's global assessment of disease activity in the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm visual analog scale (left end = no disease activity [symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms], right end = maximum disease activity [maximum arthritis disease activity]). When ESR equaled 0 mm/hr, it was set to 1 mm/hr. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. A negative change score indicates improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Were Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28) Responders at Weeks 24, 48, 108, 156, 204, and 264 - A DAS-28 responder was defined as someone who met the European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] criteria of a good or moderate response. A change of the DAS-28 score from Baseline was used to determine EULAR responses of good, moderate, or no response. For a post-baseline score = 3.2, a change from baseline of &lt; -1.2 was a good response, &lt; -0.6 to = -1.2 was a moderate response, and = -0.6 was no response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 3.2 to = 5.1, a change from baseline of &lt; -0.6 was a moderate response and = -0.6 was no response. For a post-baseline score &gt; 5.1, a change from baseline &lt; -1.2 was a moderate response and = -1.2 was no response. A good response could not be achieved for post-baseline scores &gt; 3.2.</outcome>

A change of the DAS-28 score from Baseline was used to determine EULAR responses of good, moderate, or no response. For a post-baseline score = 3.2, a change from baseline of &lt; -1.2 was a good response, &lt; -0.6 to = -1.2 was a moderate response, and = -0.6 was no response.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Clinically Relevant Improvement in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score at Weeks 24, 36, 48, 108, 156, 204, and 264 - The FACIT-F is a 13-item participant self-report questionnaire that assesses fatigue over the previous 7 days by scoring each item on a 5-point scale (0=Not at all, 1=A little bit, 2=Somewhat, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much). An overall FACIT-F score was obtained by summing the scores of all 13 items. The overall score ranged from 0 to 52. A lower score indicates less fatigue. A clinically relevant improvement in the FACIT-F score was defined as a = 5-point increase from Baseline.</outcome>

The Physical Component Summary (PCS) score summarizes the subscales Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, and General Health. The Mental Component Summary (MCS) score summarizes the subscales Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. Each score was scaled from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating better HRQoL. A clinically relevant improvement in the Physical and Mental Component Scores of the SF-36 was defined as a = 5-point increase from Baseline.</outcome>
