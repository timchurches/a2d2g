    <interventions>Signposts for building better behavior (Signposts). The Spanish version includes a workbook translated to Spanish with permission from the Parenting Research Centre, Victoria, Australia, and the module "Dealing with a Head Injury in the Family translated with permission of Damith Woods. Two Signposts certified practitioners reviewed the translation to assure that the content was accurate. The parents are able to take notes during the sessions and a sheet listing the key concepts of the session is provided. The provider is a clinical neuropsychologist and a certified Signposts practitioner. The content per session is the following: Introduction, dealing with a head injury in the family and measuring your child behavior (Session 1); Systematic use of daily interactions (Session 2); Replacing difficult behavior with useful behavior (Session 3); Planning for better behavior (Session 4); Teaching your child new skills (Session 5); Dealing with stress and your family as a team (Session 6). Signposts is a manualized parenting program that aims to develop skills in parents to improve behavior. Signposts promotes parental self-regulation because the parent chooses the goals, measures and monitors the child behaviors, chooses the strategies and evaluates the effectiveness. This parenting program is delivered in 6 face to face weekly sessions of 2.5 hours each. The sessions are delivered in groups of a maximum of 8 parents. The intervention is conducted at Iskalti-Condesa, one of the clinics of Iskalti Centre of Psychological and Educational Support. This clinic is close to the center of Mexico City and is well equipped to conduct neuropsychological assessments and provide the intervention program. To improve intervention adherence a checklist with the topics of each session is included and filled by the certified practitioner who delivers the program. </interventions>
    <comparator>The participants in the control group receive an information sheet  specifically designed for this study with strategies for challenging behaviors and weekly phone calls during 6 weeks done by a psychologist. The phone calls are designed for the parents and aim to imrpove academic skills of the child. Each phone  call lasts approximately 15 minutes. During the phone calls exercises which aim to improve academic skills, such as maths or reading are suggested. The academic skill is chosen based on the area of main concern of the parent.

    <statisticalmethods>We calculated the sample size in order to detect a difference of 0.8 SD between the two treatment arms, with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.80.  Allowing for an estimated 20% lost to follow-up, we therefore aim to recruit a total of 66 participants, Descriptive analysis of pre-intervention child, parent and family characteristics will be conducted to explore the characteristics of families enrolled. Comparisons of continuous measures will be made using independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U tests (depending on the distributions of the samples). Chi squared tests will carry out between-group comparison of categorical variables.

Intervention efficacy will be assessed by comparing the outcomes of the groups at post-intervention assessment and follow-up  assessment using an independent t-test or its non-parametric equivalent, depending on the distribution of the samples. Potential confounds (e.g., social risk) and moderators (e.g., child age, time since injury) will be explored. As secondary analysis linear regressions will be completed to identify predictors of intervention outcome. Both completed and intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted. The level of significance for all analyses will be 0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with acquired brain injury (ABI) present with challenging behavior. and their families present with high levels of stress. Poor self regulation is the core deficit of challenging behavior. The aims of this study are to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of an intervention (Signposts for building  better behavior) which has been adapted to Mexican population in improving behavior and self-regulation (SR) in Mexican children with ABI compared to telephone support. To investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of the intervention in improving parenting skills, parent self-efficacy, quality of parent child-relationship and decreasing parental stress in parents of children with ABI compared to telephone support. Our secondary aims are (1) to explore the impact that parent characteristics (depressive and anxiety symptoms, social risk, family burden and self-regulation) have on the intervention outcomes; (2) to investigate if parenting and child-behavior changes are maintained 3 months after the intervention.  

We hypothesize that on completion of the Signposts intervention, and at 3-months post-intervention: (i) parents of children with ABI will report improved child behavior and SR compared to those in the telephone support group; (ii) parents of children with ABI will report reduced stress, improved parenting skill and parent self-efficacy compared to the telephone support group; (iii)parenting and child-behavior changes will be maintained. 

This is the first study that will evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a parenting program for Mexican parents of children with ABI. </summary>
