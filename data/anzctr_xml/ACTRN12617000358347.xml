  <trial_design>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Screening will occur when subjects come for their usual visit to their treating physician. The patient will have an initial consultation with a study renal physician to discuss study participation. This will include a preliminary eligibility check. Randomisation will occur on the day that trial consent is obtained or within 1 month of consent being obtained. 

Fluid kits will be numbered and allocated on randomsiation. The fluid treatment allocation lists will be prepared by the unblinded trial statistician, and will be programmed into the central web-based randomisation system. This will maintain the allocation concealment for all users of the randomisation system and those handling the medication, including participant, phyisican, study other healthcare providers, outcome assessors and the central clinical research associate.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed using an external web-based system, accessed via the ANZDATA registry real time entry system. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to either Plasmalyte or 0.9% saline using an adaptive minimisation method. Minimisation will be based on factors associated with DGF and graft outcomes, including: a) Transplant centre, b) Deceased donor status (DBD, DCD), c) Machine perfusion (No, Yes), and d) Australian Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) tertile. The KDRI is a composite measure of donor quality based on eight donor characteristics known at the time of transplantation.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The effect of treatment, Plasmalyte versus saline, on the composite primary outcome will be analysed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for potential confounding due to donor and/or recipient characteristics will be performed using ordinal logistic regression. Patient and donor characteristics used in the dynamic allocation algorithm, deceased donor status (DBD, DCD), machine perfusion (No, Yes), and KDRI tertile, will be tested for subgroup effects. Treatment differences between subgroups defined by these variables will be assessed via tests of interaction (treatment by subgroup) using ordinal logistic regression.

The effect of treatment on secondary outcomes will be analysed using statistical methods appropriate for the type of outcome. Secondary outcomes are variously binary, count, and time-to-event. Treatment groups will be compared on binary secondary outcomes using logistic regression. Count outcomes will be analysed with Poisson regression models. If there is under- or over-dispersion, residuals will be examined to determine the most suitable model (e.g., quasi-Poisson regression, negative binomial regression). Continuous outcomes will be compared using linear regression or an appropriate non-parametric test if assumptions are not met. Mortality and graft survival will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log rank test. 

Analyses will be by intention to treat; participants will be included in the intention to treat analysis if they are randomised and receive a deceased donor kidney transplant within 48 hours of randomisation. Participants whose transplant does not proceed will be excluded, although they are eligible to be included at a later date if they are re-randomised and transplant proceeds. 

Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group. Depending on the amount and type of data, differences between treatment groups on adverse events may be tested by binary logistic or Poisson regression.

All analyses will be described in a detailed statistical analysis plan made publicly available before data analysis commences and treatment allocations are unblinded.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delayed or slow graft function (DGF), i.e. the requirement for dialysis, or poor kidney transplant graft function early after transplantation, affects 20-50% of deceased donor kidney transplants, and increases the risk of graft failure and mortality. DGF reflects acute kidney injury caused by ischaemia-reperfusion injury during transplantation, and is driven by donor, recipient and transplant factors. 

Intravenous fluids are a critical, albeit inexpensive, aspect of care that impacts early transplant function. Currently, isotonic sodium chloride (normal or 0.9% saline) is standard of care at the majority of transplant centres. However, 0.9% saline may be harmful due to its high chloride content relative to plasma, which causes metabolic acidosis and may promote acute kidney injury, and thus DGF. Studies of low-chloride balanced solutions versus normal saline in transplantation have shown reduced acidosis, but have been too small to show differences in transplant outcomes. 

The BEST-Fluids study (Better Evidence for Selecting Transplant Fluids) is a clinical trial investigating the difference between two standard practice fluids (Plasmalyte and normal saline) used before, during and after surgery in improving the lives of people who have a kidney transplant.

The primary outcome investigates the duration of DGF (participants who require dialysis) and the rate of recovery of the kidney transplant graft function. Secondary outcomes include graft function, survival, and cost-effectiveness. This trial will show if Plasmalyte is better to normal saline in kidney transplantation, may result in cost savings and will rapidly translate into clinical practice.</summary>
