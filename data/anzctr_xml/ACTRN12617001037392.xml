    <interventions>Theory based intervention to improve diabetes self care behaviors and HbA1c
The intervention will be designed based on the Information Motivation Behavioral Skill model to address patients diet, physical activity and foot care information, motivation, and behavioral skills deficits. Intervention foci will be derived from an extensive review of the literature and lengthy conversations with experts in the field.
The intervention group will receive one session of intervention which will last three hours and the intervention will be conducted in the National Center Of Diabetes in Yemen by the researcher (MBBS, MPH) who is responsible to implement this intervention. All participants in the intervention group will be allocated into small subgroups consisting of twenty participants and each subgroup will be assigned to a specific day The intervention session will include all Information Motivation Behavioral Skills model elements. The Information Motivation Behavioral Skills model is one of recently developed models that provide a framework for a brief health promotion counseling. According to the IMB model improved glycemic control, is function of; individuals information about diabetes self-care behaviors, motivation to engage in self-care implementation &amp; behavioral skills for performing the specific acts involved in self-care activities. 
The intervention will include information related to the diet, physical activity and foot care. The researcher will use power point presentation to deliver the information. The researcher will use the discussion to enhance motivation to perform diabetes self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity and foot care). The discussion will include asking open-ended questions, affirming desirable behaviors and negotiating goals that are realistic and attainable. The researcher will use role play technique to give the participants behavioral skills training on how to monitor carbohydrates, integrate physical activity into their lifestyle and how to take care of their feet.

    <comparator> The control group will receive the usual care, which include a combination of medical treatment, physician monitoring and an optional education session about healthy diet. The control group will be in waiting list to get the intervention which will be at the end of the study after post test data collection. This mean they will receive the intervention 6 months after enrollment. </comparator>

Self-care behavior will be assessed with the 11-item Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) scale (Toobert, Hampson, &amp; Glasgow, 2000).

      <outcome>Diet information:  Information about diet self-care will be measured by 21 items the first 8 items will assess participant's understanding of the impact that carbohydrates have on blood glucose levels, and the importance of eating consistent, controlled amounts of carbohydrates to stabilize blood glucose levels throughout the day. The remaining 13 items will assess participants' knowledge of the types of foods that contain carbohydrates. This measure was developed in a previous study by Osborn (2006).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to develop, implement and evaluate the effect of Information Motivation Behavioral Skills model intervention on diabetes self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity and foot care) and HbA1c among patients with type2 diabetes in the National Center of Diabetes in Yemen. 
Hypothesis:
1- The Information Motivation and Behavioral Skills model intervention will significantly improve the information, motivation and behavioral skill for (diet, physical activity and foot care) and the diabetes self-care behaviors (diet, physical activity and foot care) in the intervention group at six months compared to the control group.
2- The Information Motivation and Behavioral Skills model intervention will significantly decrease the HbA1c in the intervention group at six months compared with control group.
