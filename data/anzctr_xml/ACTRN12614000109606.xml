  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in each of two treatment conditions will receive therapy based on principles of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia. Treatment will be provided by a Psychologist, Clinical Psychologist, or Provisional Psychologist.
1. Sleep restriction: reducing time-in-bed to 30 mins less than the usual average total sleep time. This will be achieved by shifting the child's usual bed time later by 30 minutes.
2. Bedtime restriction: reducing time-in-bed to match usual average total sleep time.
In both of these interventions, participants will attend two therapy sessions (one week apart, 1 hour on each occasion) and will implement their given schedule for a period of two weeks. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored using a 7-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control participants will attend two therapy sessions (one week apart, 1 hour on each occasion). They will receive psycho-education (e.g., information about sleep architecture, REM sleep, circadian rhythms) and implement a regular &amp; consistent bedtime schedule. This will be achieved by calculating their average time-in-bed across the baseline week, and then planning a schedule that involves being in bed for that amount of time each night (using a bed time and rise time that works for their household). This schedule will be implemented for a period of two weeks.
Adherence to the planned sleep schedule will be monitored using a 7-day sleep diary and wrist actigraphy.  Treatment will be provided by a Psychologist, Clinical Psychologist, or Provisional Psychologist.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine if treatment for insomnia also reduces anxiety in school-aged children. Compared to children in the control group, we expect children in both treatment groups to show improvements in sleep and anxiety, with greatest improvements expected for the "moderate" treatment group.</summary>
