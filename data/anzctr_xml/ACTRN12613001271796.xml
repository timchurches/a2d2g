  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to find out whether having a depressed mood or inadequate postoperative pain control are associated with the development of a stiff and painful shoulder following shoulder surgery. 

Surgery to the muscles and tendons (rotator cuff) of the shoulder and surgery to the end of the collar bone (clavicle) are common procedures. However one complication that occurs is the development of a stiff painful shoulder in the first 3 months of the postoperative phase. A number of factors have been associated with the development of postoperative shoulder stiffness. It has been suggested that depressed mood and postoperative pain are associated with the development of postoperative shoulder stiffness but this area has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to look at the relationship between postoperative pain, depressed mood and the development of postoperative shoulder stiffness and determine whether either depressed mood or postoperative pain are important predictors of and possible management targets to decrease the rate of postoperative shoulder stiffness. 

The study will involve 100 to 200 participants who will all be patients of A/Professor Simon Bell undergoing rotator cuff or clavicular surgery
