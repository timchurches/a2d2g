    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic similarity between CBT124, EU Avastin(Registered Trademark) and US-Avastin(Registered Trademark) after a single IV infusion of 1 mg/kg in healthy male subjects detected using serum samples.
The PK parameters will be derived using noncompartmental methods. The actual
sampling times (mentioned in the timepoints below) will be used in the PK parameter calculations. The primary PK parameter - Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-inf)</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK blood samples will be collected at pre-infusion (or 0 hour, collected within 1 hour prior to the start of the infusion), 0.75 hours from the start of infusion (plus or minus 2 min), the end of infusion (0 hours post end of the infusion plus or minus less than or equal to 2 min [which is approximately 1.5 hours post start of infusion]) at 3 hours (plus or minus 5 min), 6 hours (plus or minus 15 min) and 12 hours (plus or minus 15 min) from the end of infusion, and at 24 hours (Day 2) (plus or minus 1 hour), 48 hours (Day 3) (plus or minus 2 hours), 72 hours (Day 4) (plus or minus 3 hours), 168 hours (Day 8) (plus or minus 8 hours), 336 hours (Day 15) (plus or minus 8 hours), 504 hours (Day 22) (plus or minus 1 day), 672 hours (Day 29) (plus or minus 1 day), 840 hours (Day 36) (plus or minus 1 day), 1008 hours (Day 43) (plus or minus 2 days), 1176 hours (Day 50) (plus or minus 2 days), 1512 hours (Day 64) (plus or minus 3 days), 1848 hours (Day 78) (plus or minus 3 days), and 2280 hours (Day 95) (plus or minus 4 days) post start of infusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The tools to test secondary PK parameters (these are different from the primary PK parameters) are as below:
*Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-t)
*Maximum observed concentration (Cmax)
*Time to maximum observed concentration (tmax)
*Terminal half-life
*Terminal rate constant 
*Volume of distribution at steady state
*Systemic clearance 
The parameters AUC0-inf and AUC0-t will be calculated using the linear-up/log-down
methodology. Additional PK parameters may be determined if deemed appropriate..

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the safety of new formulation of bevacizumab called CBT124 and bioequivalence when compared to two already marketed formulations, one approved in US and other in EU. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are an adult healthy male aged 18 to 50 years (inclusive). Study details Participants will be randomised (allocated by chance) to either a test formulation or one of the two marketed formulations of bevacizumab. Drugs will be administered intravenously once only. The study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) (the levels of drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD) (what the drug does to the body) and immunogenicity (bodys immune response) of the three drugs. In order to measure this, blood samples will be collected at various points after treatment has been given. </summary>
