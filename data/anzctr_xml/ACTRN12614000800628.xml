  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a 12 week, e-health enabled, structured health promotion intervention targeted at improving health related quality of life and reducing chronic disease risk factors in women previously treated for haematological, breast and gynaecological cancers. All women in the intervention arm will receive health education material, including a Program Journal (in the form of an interactive iBook), and access to an interactive web interface. The iBook will encourage women to bring together the various components of the health education provided and incorporate them into their lives over a 12-week period. The iBook includes a weekly exercise planner, where women are encouraged to plan ahead for their exercise in the following week. Participants will receive access to self-directed resources (via the website) and personal consultations (via videoconference) with a nurse. Three individual, virtual 30 minute consultations at 0, 6 and 12 weeks will be provided by a registered nurse trained in the intervention. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The extended CONSORT statement for RCTs will be adhered to when reporting. Baseline measures and participant characteristics will be initially compared to assess for imbalances and differences between groups. Baseline and within-group differences over time will be assessed for all variables of interest using paired t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Primary endpoint (HRQoL): Between group differences at 12 and 24 weeks will be analysed using a linear mixed model and the difference in variables of interest at 12 and 24 weeks of HRQoL. Secondary endpoints: Linear mixed models will be used to analyse secondary outcomes such as energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intake, body fatness, levels of physical activity, alcohol and smoking, after determining the change score in each variable of interest. Secondary stratification analysis by BMI and sociodemographic variables will also be performed. Logistic regression models will be used to examine predictors of quality of life including baseline quality of life, age and socio demographic variables. This includes exploring the rurality of the women according to the classifications of  highly accessible, accessible, moderately accessible, remote and very remote location suggested by the ARIA classification.

To estimate the required sample size, a greater than five point difference on the FACT-G total score is associated with meaningful differences on clinical and subjective indicators[37]. To achieve 90% power and a 95% confidence interval (a=0.05), the two study arms would require 215 participants each, assuming a standard deviation of 16 and an observed difference of 5 units after the 12 week intervention. Assuming 10% attrition and 15% non-responders the minimum sample size required for each group is 268, with a total sample size of 536.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Women's Wellness after Cancer Program (WWACP)  will determine the effect of a 12 week, e-health enabled program, on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in women who have received treatment for breast, blood, or gynecological cancer. Those who are eligible to join the study are women aged 18 years or above who have completed surgery, chemotherapy, and / or radiotherapy within the past 12 months. Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in the intervention group are are given access to an e-health enabled, structured health promotion program which will include an interactive iBook and website containing health information, planning and goal setting, and three personal conferences with a nurse via video-conferencing. 
Participants in the control group will receive usual care which includes only that information and support that is given as part of usual practice through their usual clinic visits. Participants from both groups will be asked to complete questionnaires before the program begins (0 weeks), at 12 weeks, and again at 24 weeks, in order to determine the effect of the program on HRQoL
