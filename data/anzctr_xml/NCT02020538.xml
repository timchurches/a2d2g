  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Low-chloride perioperative intravenous fluid strategy

Placebo Comparator: Chloride-rich IV fluid - The chloride-rich strategy will include 0.9% saline as the perioperative crystalloid of choice with 4% albumin as the perioperative colloid of choice.

Active Comparator: Chloride-poor IV fluid - A low-chloride strategy of perioperative IV fluid will include PlasmaLyte 148 or Hartmann's solution as the crystalloid of choice with 20% albumin as the colloid of choice.


Other interventions: Low-chloride perioperative intravenous fluid strategy
The low-chloride perioperative IV fluid strategy will include the use of PlasmaLyte 148 or Hartmann's solution as the crystalloid of choice and 20% albumin as the colloid of choice.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This primary aim of this study is to test the impact of a strategy of perioperative
      chloride-restriction through intravenous (IV) fluid therapy on the incidence of acute kidney
      injury after cardiac surgery.

      A prospective, open-label, single-centre 4-period sequential study of varying strategies of
      perioperative IV fluid composition will test the hypothesis that a perioperative protocol for
      the administration of chloride-poor intravenous fluids compared to chloride-rich intravenous
      fluids will reduce the incidence of AKI after adult cardiothoracic surgery.</summary>
