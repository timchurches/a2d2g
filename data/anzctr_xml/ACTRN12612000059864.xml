  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study has a single (PART 1) and repeat (PART 2) application component.

PART 1 will consist of three groups of 15 participants, each receiving a single application of a TPM/O Investigational Product.  Participants will be enrolled to receive a single application of one of three dosing regimes (2 type A patches, 3 type A patches or 3 type B patches) that will be applied for 3 days with a subsequent 3 days in-house during which time participants will be monitored while the TPM/O is washed out. Participants will stay in-house for a total of 7 days.

Results from PART 1 will be analysed to determine the dose selected for repeat dosing.

Participants that undertake the single application part, will not be eligible to participate in the repeat application part.

PART 2 will consist of one cohort of 20 participants each receiving repeat applications of the selected TPM/O.  Participants will receive 7 applications of TPM/O that will be applied every 3 days for a total of 21 days with a subsequent 6 days in-house during which time participants will be monitored while the TPM/O is washed out. Participants will stay in-house for a total of 28 days.

Two patches (patch A and B) will be tested with differing strengthes of oxycodone and excipients. Participants will have either 2 or 3 patches applied by a member of the unit staff to the upper torso area.  The patch will remain on the skin for 3 days</interventions>
    <comparator>PART 1 (single application): will consist of three groups of 15 participants, each receiving a parallel single application of  one of three dosing regimes (2 type A patches, 3 type A patches or 3 type B patches).

PART 2 (repeat application): will consist of one group of 20 participants each receiving repeat applications of the selected TPM/O patch.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterise the pharmacokinetic profiles of oxycodone delivered transdermally using TPM/O patches in various dosing regimes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic profile will be assessed through collection of blood samples at various time points during each 3 day patch application and during the wash out period. 

A total of 40 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed in PART 1 (single application).  The blood samples will be collected prior to patch application and then at the following times points 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 72, 74, 76, 80, 84, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 136 and 144 hours post dose.

A total of 70 blood samples will be collected from each participant and analysed in PART 2 (repeat application).  The blood samples will be collected prior to patch application and then at the following times points 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 76, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 136, 144, 148, 152, 156, 160, 168, 176, 184, 192, 200, 208, 216, 228, 240, 252, 264, 276, 288, 300, 312, 324, 336, 348, 360, 372, 384, 396, 408, 420, 432, 444, 456, 468, 480, 492, 504, 508, 512, 516, 520, 528, 536, 544, 552, 564, 576, 588, 600, 624 and 648 hours post dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of transdermally delivered oxycodone from TPM/O patches using various dosing regimes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The safety and tolerability of transdermally delivered oxycodone from TPM/O patches will be determined by collection and assessoment of the following parameters; 
- laboratory samples: will be collected at screening, check-in, on-study (every 3 to 6 days) and follow up visit.  
- vital signs: will  be assessed at screening, during check-in and eligibility confirmation, prior to patch application, 6hrs after patch application and then at 12hr intervals until discharge.  Vital will also be assessed at the follow up visit.
- ECGs: will be collected at screening, check-in, and follow up visit.  
- physical examination: will be collected at screening, check-in, Day 1, discharge and follow up visit.  
- skin irritation: will be assessed after each patch has been removed.
- patch adhesion: will be assessed daily 
- participants will be regularly questioned regarding any changes experienced in their health and administration of any concomitant mediation.</timepoint>
