  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is called Falls Arent Us and aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a
      customised falls prevention program for people aged 60 and over who were presented to the
      hospital Emergency Department following a fall and being discharged home. Recruitment for
      this randomized controlled trial has commenced in late December 2002 from several major
      public hospitals in the western, southern, and northern parts of Melbourne Metropolitan
      Region. Consented participants will receive a comprehensive falls risk assessment within one
      week of being discharged home from the Emergency Department and at twelve month following
      this initial assessment. Their falls risks will be monitored for twelve months through a
      falls diary. Following randomization, participants in the intervention group will receive a
      customised falls prevention program in addition to the usual care being put in place from the
      hospital Emergency Department.</summary>
