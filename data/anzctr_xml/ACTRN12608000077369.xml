    <concealment>A simple random sample of 205 out of 410 patients consecutively booked for surgery were assigned as trial participants using a lottery method. Each patient had an equal probability of being assigned as a trial participant and each was assigned independently. Opaque envelopes were used.
Participants were then randomised into treatment groups by lottery method, by opaque envelopes, with each participant having equal probability of being allocated to either treatment group and each was assigned independently.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this trial was specifically aimed at answering the research question: For the general cataract population, does the use of partial coherence interferometry improve postoperative outcomes compared with current generation applanation ultrasound biometry, as measured by postoperative refractive error, by increasing the accuracy of calculation of the intraocular lens power.</summary>
