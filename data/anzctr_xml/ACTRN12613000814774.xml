    <interventions>Assessing those that have been treated with early thoracotomy versus those that have had either fibrinolytic or video-assisted thoracotomies, or just simple drainage and antibiotics. The duration of observation is the total admission for each individual episode of pneumonia and pleural empyema.</interventions>
    <comparator>Controls are the reported standards of care from the national Thoracic Society, which do not advocate for early thoracotomy. The options for treatment in the controls are early thoractomy, fibrinolytic therapy, video-assisted thoracotomy, or simple drainage and antibiotics. Some may receive a combination of these. In Townsville, the standard is early open thoracotomy for reasons discussed in the paper. The source and period of the control data are the published reports from the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, with a paper by the Empyema Network in 2011 reporting on their recent experiences, and a position statement also from 2011.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The National society quotes an incidence of 0.7% of all pneumonias, based on data compiled from metropolitan areas. We are seeing empyema much more commonly in this in our children with pneumonia, presumably due to duration of illness prior to admission and alternate microbiological causes. We have seen 45 cases in 3 years present and be managed with a strategy different to the guidelines, and we will compare our results with a time matched cohort from other centres.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pneumonia, an infection of the lung, is a common reason for admission to hospital, and worldwide is still the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years. Relatively rarely, a complication of this is infected fluid surrounding the lung, termed an empyema. Empyemas are very rare in metropolitan areas, but anecdotally are more common in rural and remote regions. This is currently unreported. This audit will help us to find out exactly how many children are at risk, and which mode of management appears to confer the shortest hospital stay and with minimal complications.</summary>
