  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchial asthma is among the world's most prevalent diseases. Roflumilast is a novel, orally
      active, selective enzyme inhibitor (phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor), which has shown
      effectiveness in the treatment of asthma.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of roflumilast taken orally together with
      low dose inhaled corticosteroids on lung function. Roflumilast will be administered at one
      dose level once daily together with inhaled corticosteroids at one dose level twice daily.
      The study duration consists of a baseline period (2 to 6 weeks) and a treatment period (24
      weeks). The study will provide further data on safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      roflumilast.</summary>
