             encephalopathy, reduction below normal limits of serum albumin, or prior liver biopsy
             demonstrating significant fibrosis, specifically = Metavir 3 fibrosis

          -  Subjects with serological evidence of HIV who have CD4 counts = 200/mm3. Subjects who
             are HIV-positive and stable, with an adequate CD4 count (&gt; 200/mm3) and undetectable
             viral load (&lt; 50 gc/mL) measured twice in the six months prior to enrollment, on an
             antiretroviral drug regimen are eligible to enroll.

          -  History of inhibitor against FIX

          -  Anti-AAV8 antibody titers = 1:5

          -  History of chronic infection or other chronic diseases which the investigators
             consider to constitute an unacceptable risk

          -  Subjects who have participated in a previous gene therapy research trial within one
             year of enrollment

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational drug within
             six months of enrollment

          -  Any other condition that would not allow the potential subject to complete follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study or, in the opinion of the investigator,
             makes the potential subject unsuitable for the study</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hemophilia B is a bleeding disease in males due to very low levels of coagulation factor IX
      (FIX) in the blood. The current treatment is intravenous injection of FIX clotting factor
      concentrates, in response to bleeding. This study will focus on the severe, most common type
      of hemophilia B. This study plans to use a virus called adeno-associated virus (AAV), which
      in nature causes no disease, and can be engineered to deliver the human FIX gene (AAV8-hFIX19
      vector) to liver cells, where FIX is normally made. This study will use the AAV8-hFIX19
      vector.</summary>
