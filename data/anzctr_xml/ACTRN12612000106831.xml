  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study was performed the investigation of vestibular evoked myogenic potential in a young population with normal hearing. The examinations was conducted in only one day for each participant. The sample consists of 78 young adults. All data collection will take place over 1-year period. The vestibular evoked myogenic potentials will be captured in 156 ears of young adults with normal hearing, in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the ipsilateral way through the averaging of 100 stimuli-tone bursts, frequency of 1000 Hz, intensity 95 dB HLN approximately for two hours. We used a specific equipment for capture potentials named EP25 of interacoustics.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Normative values for test of balance. Audiometry tests were conducted to assess the presence of changes in hearing. Thus, we selected subjects with normal hearing to be submitted to the examination of vestibular evoked myogenic potential. These tests were done in one day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The tonal audiometry and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials were performed on only one day for approximately two hours. The examinations of 78 patients, ie the complete sample was conducted during one year.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The analysis of the audiometry and potencial evoked myogenic potential were performed after data collection. Thus, the audiometry was carried out only to select the sample of normal individuals. So, after this, the subject was submitted to the vestibular evoked myogenic potentials exame. The potential was analyzed by tracing the demarcation of waves on the computer screen. Thus, we observe the parameters of latency and amplitude of these waves.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The tonal audiometry and vestibular evoked myogenic potentials were performed on only one day for approximately two hours. The examinations of 80 patients, ie the complete sample was conducted during one year.</timepoint>
