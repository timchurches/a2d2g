    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - CP-690,550
Treatment: drugs - Methotrexate
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: CP-690,550 and methotrexate - Open-label tofacitinib tablet and blinded methotrexate capsule

Placebo Comparator: CP-690,550 and placebo - open-label tofacitinib tablet and blinded matching placebo for methotrexate capsule


Treatment: drugs: CP-690,550
During the open-label run-in phase (Day 1 to Week 24), all subjects will receive one tablet open-label tofacitinib MR 11mg orally QD and open-label methotrexate capsule(s) orally every week at prior stabilized dose.
During the double-blind phase, subjects who are randomized to the treatment arm will receive the same dosage of tofacitinib and methotrexate as describe above.

        Have a score of 6 or greater on the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League
        Against Rheumatism Classification Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis at and/or prior to
        Screening Visit.

          -  Have =4 tender/painful joints on motion and =4 swollen joints (28 joint counts) at
             both Screening Visit and Baseline Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Have moderate to severe disease activity as defined by CDAI&gt;10 and DAS28-4(ESR) =3.2
             at Baseline Visit.

          -  Have taken an oral MTX treatment regimen (15-25mg/week) continuously for at least 4
             months prior to the screening visit and has taken a stable weekly dose of oral MTX
             with supplemental folic acid or folinic acid for at least 4 weeks prior to the
             baseline visit (conversion from parenteral MTX to oral MTX will require stabilization
             of the treatment regimen for at least 1 month).

          -  Subjects must screen negative for active tuberculosis or inadequately treated
             tuberculosis infection (active or latent).

    <summary>This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib modified release
      formulation (11mg QD) versus tofacitinib modified release formulation plus continued
      methotrexate treatment in subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who are
      insufficiently responding to their stable dose of methotrexate treatment.</summary>
