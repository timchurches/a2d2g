  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves recruiting participants over 18 years of age to a 10 week, randomised crossover intervention.

Each participant will be exposed to two diets, lasting four weeks each; a high dairy diet, and a low dairy diet. These diets are separated by a two week period where the participants will resume their habitual diets.

Screening:

Participants are weighed, height is measured, and an oral glucose tolerance test is given to determine their glucose tolerance. Participants are also instructed to provide a 3 day weighed food record to this visit.

Arm 1

The high dairy diet consists of consuming 4-6 serves of dairy per day, with at least two of these serves being yoghurt.  There are no restrictions on the fat content of the dairy, and dairy products are not supplied by the investigators. The participants are compensated for their grocery expenses.


Arm 2
The low dairy diet requires participants to eat just 0.5 serves per day.

After each four week period, participants will undergo two insulin sensitivity tests, and a pulse wave velocity test. 

The first insulin sensitivity test is the Low Dose Insulin and Glucose Infusion Test, or LDIGIT. It involves infusing a small amount of insulin (25mU/kg body weight/hr), and glucose (4mg/kg/min) into a fasting patient, and taking blood samples at regular time points to assess serum glucose, insulin and c-peptide levels.

The second test is the hyperglycaemic clamp, involving the infusion of glucose into a participant, where the serum glucose level will be held at 10mmol/L, and blood samples will be taken at regular time points to assess serum glucose and insulin levels, and c-peptide response.

Finally, pulse wave velocity will be assessed in the participant to determine an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease after consuming high and low dairy diets. A blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper thigh while the participant lies in the supine position, and a pulse probe is placed on the carotid pulse site. The cuff automatically inflates, and a computer records and calculates the resulting pulse wave velocity.

To ensure compliance to the intervention, participants meet with the investigator halfway through each diet, and weighed food diaries are prepared. The investigator then assesses the diaries, and makes suggestions to aid the participants with compliance. Participants are required to remain weight stable during this intervention, and so it is necessary for them to remove foods that have similar energy content to the extra dairy that they are adding into Arm 1 of the study. In Arm 2 of the study, participants are required to substitute in foods with similar energy content to account for the dairy removed from the diet. A guide is provided for both arms of the study for participants to refer to, and also includes suggestions for including more dairy into the diet.

A serve of dairy is defined as

 * 1 cup or 250ml of milk (fresh, UHT, reconstituted powdered milk )
* 40g, equivalent to 2 slices, or 4x3x2cm cube of hard cheese (eg cheddar)
* 1/2cup or 120g ricotta cheese
* 3/4 cup or 200g of yoghurt</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants come to a clinical trial facility fasting (after they have read the information sheet, and have agreed to participate), where they are weighed, have their height measured, and are subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test to determine their glucose tolerance. Before this test, a finger prick is performed, and a blood glucose reading is taken. After consuming a 75g dose of glucose, another finger prick blood sample is taken 2 hours after consuming the 75g glucose dose.

The participant is enrolled into the study after signing the consent form (obtained prior to performing the oral glucose tolerance test, where they once again read the information sheet), and a diet is assigned to them by flipping a coin. A guide describing how to remove or incorporate diary into their diets is given to them, and a verbal explanation of how many serves they are required to eat in each diet. A start date for their diet is given, and in the next few days, a check-up appointment is scheduled for two weeks into the diet.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are investigating how a high diary diet (compared to a low dairy diet) will affect insulin sensitivity in normal weight, and overweight/obese people with normal/impaired glucose tolerance.

There is evidence that dairy may affect insulin sensitivity, but currently the studies that perform dairy interventions in a diet are conflicted. There is therefore a need to design and perform dairy study that may help argue the case for our population eating more dairy in order to prevent developing type II diabetes.

Hypothesis: eating higher amounts of dairy each day for four weeks will improve insulin sensitivity.</summary>
