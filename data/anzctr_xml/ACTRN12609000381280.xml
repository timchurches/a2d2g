  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants recruited in the study will have had a liver biopsy as part of their routine standard of care in the past 3 months. Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard in determining the stage of liver disease.Transient elastography and a serum fibrosis marker(hepascore) will be evaluated against biopsy results. Transient elastography(T.E)- liver stiffness which equates to liver fibrosis will be measured using T.E. T.E is an ultrasound like device which is placed over the liver and sends a vibration through the liver.The quicker the vibration passes through the liver the more fibrosed (or stiff) the liver is. It is a painless procedure lasting 10 minutes approximately.There are no associated adverse events.A total of 3 fibroscan sessions will take place on each patient.The first at baseline(within 4 weeks of liver biopsy) then at 12 months,then at 24months. Readings are measured in kilopascals.
Blood samples will be taken first at baseline then at 12 months,then at 24months for hepascore, a serum fibrosis marker. Hepascore results will be correlated with liver biopsy result at baseline and then monitored over the 24 month period for alteration.
According to best practice participants may be commenced on antiviral medications if indicated by their liver biopsy (standard of care). These oral medications will include tenofovir,lamivudine,entecavir and adefovir as is common practice. The decision to start medication and which medication to start will be in no way influenced by the study.At the 12 and 24 month period we compare fibroscan and serum fibrosis markers among the various medication groups(if any).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To prospectively evaluate the impact of antiviral therapy over time on progression of liver fibrosis using Fibroscan and serum markers of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients  who go on to treatment with oral anti-viral agents will  be followed  12 monthly for two years with annual Fibroscan, liver function tests, Aspartate Transaminase (AST), full blood examination, total cholesterol and Hepascore test to estimate the progression of fibrosis over time and the relationship of this to antiviral therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 12 and 24 months from recruitment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the accuracy of fibroscan and non-invasive serum markers for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis when compared to liver biopsy in individuals with Hepatitis B. Fibroscan categorises liver fibrosis according to Kilopascal (Kpa) score(F0-1&lt;7.5,F2 &gt;7.5 &lt;9.5 ,F3 &gt;9.5 &lt;13.5,F4&gt;13.5),where F is the stage of fibrosis. These readings equate to the metavir(F) liver biopsy grading system.Using liver biopsy as the gold standard results will be compared to assess for accuracy of fibroscan for predicting liver fibrosis.Serum fibrosis markers will be assessed in a similiar manner.Using sensitivity and specificity we will attempt to validate these non invasive techniques using Area Under the Reicever operator curves.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured at baseline only.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To prospectively evaluate the effect of insulin resistance on liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
At the time time of initial fibroscan fasting serum insulin and glucose will be taken to establish the presence or absence of insulin resistance. This result will be correlated with degree of liver fibrosis</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured at baseline only.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic hepatitis B virus infection(HBV) affects 400 million people worldwide. It leads to 1.2 million deaths annually. An individual's prognosis when affected by the disease is related to it's severity.Patients who have cirrhosis as a result of HBV have high rates of complications such as liver cancer and gastrointestinal bleeding.Patients with advancing disease therefore have a more compelling need for treatment ,thus accurate evaluation is essential.
Liver biopsy up until now has been the gold standard for evaluation but it has many complications(incuding bleeding and death),contraindications and error .It is not suitable for serial assessment.
A new device that has been developed in this regard is  fibroscan.Fibroscan measures liver stiffness which equates to liver fibrosis(disease). It does this by transmitting a wave impulse through the liver.The faster the wave travels the more fibrosed the liver is.It is a  non-invasive and painless procedure much like an ultrasound.
Blood markers to assess liver fibrosis are also available but have not been well evaluated in patients with HBV.
We propose to recruit 250 participants with chronic HBV from several Melbourne hopitals who are undergoing liver biopsy as part of their routine care.Participants will be required to fill in a detailed questionnaire in order to evaluate further their liver disease .Within 4 weeks of the biopsy a fibroscan will be performed along with blood tests helping to assess the degree of liver fibrosis.
We willl compare the results of these non-invasive tests with liver biopsy results to review the diagnostic accuracy of fibroscan and blood fibrosis markers. We will also follow the participants for 2 years with annual fibroscans and blood tests to estimate progression of fibrosis and the affects of anti-viral medication on fibrosis.We also hope to assess the role of insensitivity to the body's natural insulin production to progression of liver fibrosis in patients with HBV  by simply measuring fasting blood insulin and glucose levels and comparing these to the liver biopsy results.Insulin insensitivity has been confimed as an independent risk factor for liver fibrosis in a previous study of Hepatitis C patients,this has not yet been shown in a Hepatitis B population.</summary>
