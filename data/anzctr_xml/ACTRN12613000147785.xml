  <interventions>
    <interventions>The mindfulness intervention will include formal and informal mindfulness techniques, and psycho-education about the relationship between chronic pain and the mind and the body. Intervention-group participants' will be seen in a group format for one hour a week, for 6-weeks. 
The intervention group sessions will be facilitated by a provisionally registered psychologist. Formal mindfulness techniques will include a) a sitting breathing meditation, b) a body scan meditation, and c) a three-minute mini-meditation. Non-formal mindfulness techniques will include activities from daily living - such as drinking a cup of tea or coffee. Psycho-education will involve describing aspects of the biopsychosocial model of pain, and elucidating the relationship between thoughts, emotions, and responses (physical and behavioural).     </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proposed pilot study's purpose is to explore the viability of a mindfulness meditation intervention in a sample of older-adults residing in a residential aged-care home who have chronic pain. It is hypothesised that for those older adults in the intervention group, mindfulness meditation will have a beneficial effect and decrease these older-adults scores on measures of pain and depression, while also demonstrating a tendency for increased post-study scores of acceptance and awareness.</summary>
