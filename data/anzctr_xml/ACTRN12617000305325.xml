  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments:

1)Berocca Performance (registered trademark)
2)Placebo: Matched for appearance, taste and smell. 

Treatments will be administered in the form of effervescent tablets. 

Participants will be instructed to take one tablet daily, dissolved in a glass of water (approx 200 ml) for a duration of 28 days. Treatment adherence will be monitored by the use of a compliance log which participants will take home with them and record the time at which they take their tablet every day.  If for some reason they miss a dose, they will be instructed to make a note of this in the log.  In addition to the compliance log, participants will also be required to return all unused tablets at the completion of the study so that the experimenter can confirm that the number of tablets they have taken is in agreement with their log. The count of returned treatments will be used for compliance where these measures disagree.

Each daily dose of Active treatment (Berocca Performance) contains:

Vitamin C	500mg
Thiamine Monophosphoric acid ester chloride	18.54mg
Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) 15mg
Nicotinamide (B3/niacin) 50mg
Vitamin B5 23mg
Vitamin B6 10mg
Vitamin B12 0.01mg
Folic Acid (Vitamin B9) 0.4mg

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on the reported eta squared =.11 obtained from a previous trial with this intervention in a similar population (White et al., 2015), we anticipate a medium to large effect size for this outcome (f=.352). At an alpha rate of .05, the study would require 66 participants, a total of 33 per treatment arm to obtain power =.80 in detecting this effect size. Accounting for drop-outs and other data loss, the study will recruit 40 participants per treatment arm, thus a total n=80.

The primary analysis will be done on the per protocol population. All participants selected for analyses must have completed the whole study and have a suitable level of compliance. Any participants with data that inexplicably varies widely from the rest of their treatment group will be excluded from analyses. Screening of data will be completed while blind to treatment allocation, as part of a blind data review meeting.

Primary analysis of outcomes will examine scores for cognitive, mood, cardiovascular and nutritional status measures, using ANCOVA analyzing between groups effect of treatment on post-treatment scores, using baseline scores as a covariate. The impact of additional baseline variables, including fruit and vegetable intake, will also be studied by including as a covariate in outcome analysis. Post-hoc analysis will be conducted where appropriate using Bonferroni correction. 

For the functional brain activity outcome, primary analyses will pursue Regions of Interest defined from pilot data obtained during the previous trial (see White et al., 2016, doi: 10.3389/fnagi.2016.00288), including bilateral parietal regions, supplementary motor and frontal areas. Follow-up whole-brain analysis of treatment effects will utilize second-level random effects 2 x 2 ANOVA including visit (baseline, post-treatment) and treatment group (placebo, Berocca), with subject included as a factor in the design matrix. Whole-brain analyses will be conducted using a Family-Wise Error corrected threshold of p&lt;.05 to control for multiple comparisons.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of 4 weeks of supplementation with a multivitamin and mineral preparation on brain activity and health as measured by cognitive function, mood, and nutritional status. 
The study will recruit healthy adults, aged 18-40 years, who will attend two testing sessions, one baseline and one after 4-weeks supplementation. During testing sessions participants will complete a series of common assessments including nutritional status, mood and cognitive assessment. A sub-sample will go on to complete an MRI assessment to explore changes in brain activity.
 
The trial will test the predictions that 28-days treatment with the active multivitamin/mineral intervention will result in improved mood, increased functional brain activity, and improved cognitive performance under cognitive demand, when compared to those receiving placebo.</summary>
