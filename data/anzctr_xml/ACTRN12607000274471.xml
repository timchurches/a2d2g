  <interventions>
    <interventions>Primary Care physicians will identify patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and will administer questionnaires and refer to the research team or the practice nurse for assessment of upper airway function, other anthropometric instruments, and allocation of a single channel home based sleep apnoea monitoring device ( Flow Wizard, DiagnoseIT, Australia) and in hospital polysomnography in random order. Subjects will receive both polysomnography and home testing within a four week period. The questionnaires and anthropometric instruments as well as upper airway function using the Forced Oscillation Technique will be administered over 30 minutes by research staff upon enrolment. The in hospital polysomnography will be performed on a single night and the home based study will be performed over three nights at home.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To validate a diagnostic algorithm that would combine information from questionnaire, biometric clinical data, upper airway function and the results from a portable diagnostic device for use in the primary care setting.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Determined at the conclusion of the trial.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the utility of the above algorithm in different patient subgroups for example according to sex, ethnicity, different disease groups such as cardiac and respiratory disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be determined at the conclusion of the trial.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Subjects presenting to the general practitioner (GP) with suspected or possible sleep apnea will be asked to participate, and undergo the components of the index test (questionnaire instruments, anthropometric testing and the home based portable monitor) and the reference standard in-laboratory polysomnogram in random order. All tests will be performed within a 4 week period. The results will not be communicated to the participant or the treating physicians until all components have been performed. The participants will then be referred to a sleep specialist to have the results of the polysomnogram discussed, and appropriate management instituted outside of the study, as dictated by usual clinical practice.</summary>
