  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Oxaliplatin
Treatment: drugs - Capecitabine
Treatment: drugs - Bevacizumab
Treatment: drugs - Leucovorin
Treatment: drugs - 5-Fluouracil
Treatment: drugs - Irinotecan

Experimental: Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Participants - Participants will undergo Phase A followed by Phase B. Participants will receive bevacizumab in combination with XELOX regimen (every 3 weeks) or mFOLFOX regimen (every 2 weeks) until first disease progression or the occurrence of an unmanageable toxicity or withdrawal from the study, in Phase A. Upon documented first disease progression, participants will continue receiving bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI (every 2 weeks) until second disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, or withdrawal from study, in Phase B.


Treatment: drugs: Oxaliplatin
Participants will receive oxaliplatin 85 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenous (IV) on Day 1 of every 2 weeks cycle during alternative phase A treatment or 130 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of every 3 weeks cycle during Phase A treatment.

Treatment: drugs: Capecitabine
Participants will receive capecitabine 1000 mg/m^2 per oral (PO) twice daily on Days 1-14 of 3 weeks cycle.

Treatment: drugs: Bevacizumab
Participants will receive 7.5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 every 3 weeks (Phase A treatment) or 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 every 2 weeks (Alternative Phase A treatment and Phase B).

Treatment: drugs: Leucovorin
Participants will receive leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 every 2 weeks. Investigators may elect to chose low dose of leucovorin (either 20 mg/m^2 or 50 mg total dose).

Treatment: drugs: 5-Fluouracil
Participants will receive 5-fluouracil loading dose of 400 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m^2 continuous IV infusion over 46 hours Day 1.

Treatment: drugs: Irinotecan
Participants will receive irinotecan 180 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 every 2 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, prospective, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the relationship of
      the markers of inflammation and progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with
      previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. The study consists of two phases: Phase A
      treatment: oral capecitabine plus infusional oxaliplatin (XELOX) plus bevacizumab, or
      modified infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin (LV) and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) plus
      bevacizmab administered until first disease progression. Participants will then continue with
      Phase B treatment: infusional 5-FU, LV and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab until second
      disease progression. The anticipated time on study treatment is 4 years.</summary>
