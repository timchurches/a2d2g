  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: EPIC group
The EPIC group will receive a 22G 8cm long catheter, inserted by a paediatric anaesthetist in theatre after completion of the relevant surgical procedure. Catheters will be inserted into a peripheral vein of the upper arm or forearm, and remain in situ for for the duration of treatment, catheter failure, or up to 30 days (as recommended by the manufacturer).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: PC group
The PC group will receive standard IV cannulae, sized according to the judgement of the anaesthetic team, and will be managed as per routine hospital policy. Cannulae will be inserted in the forearm or hand, and remain in situ till failure, or up to 3 days.</comparator>
