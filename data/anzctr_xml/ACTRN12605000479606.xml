  <interventions>
    <interventions>This single patient (n of 1) IMET is a randomised, double-blind, cross-over comparison of gabapentin and placebo within an individual patient.  We will do an initial open label trial to see if gabapentin is effective, and for dose finding. Once the dose has been decided (see medication section), we will use two week treatment periods, with measurement in the second week, allowing for wash out.  There will be 3 pairs of 2 week treatment periods, making a total of twelve weeks. The order of drugs in each cycle will be determined by random allocation.  The choice of initial therapy will be balanced in blocks of four, to ensure that equivalent numbers start the IMET on each of the two drugs.  Patients and practitioners will all be blinded to which treatment the patients are taking.  Product information about gabapentin will be provided to the patient at the beginning of the study. The patient will keep careful track of their symptoms by recording them in a special diary.  If at any time during the study the patient feels worse, that treatment period can be terminated, and they can go on to the next treatment period. Upon the completion of the study, the timing of the active treatment will be revealed.  After looking at the symptoms recorded, the doctor and patient decide together whether gabapentin was of greater benefit than placebo.  If the patient chooses, they can then continue on the drug, confident that it is effective.</interventions>

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>To assess activities of daily living.

Descriptive information to be collected on each patient includes age, sex, duration of chronic pain, previous therapy, type of neuropathic pain, what areas are affected, and concomitant pain therapy. Each patient will complete:
- A prestudy questionnaire.  The patients will nominate a maximum of four activities from the questionnaire that are most affected by their pain.  Where several areas may be a problem, the patients will be asked to nominate one most severely affected (marker) area.  If this is not possible, they will be asked to make global ratings of their pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Prestudy and at entry.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The degree of patient confidence in the efficacy of their current pain medication will be assessed.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Any adult patient with a clinical diagnosis of chronic neuropathic pain, defined as pain due to damage or dysfunction involving the peripheral or central nervous systems, and including phantom limb pain, poststroke pain, causalgia, postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, and complex regional pain syndrome. Pain needs to be of at least 3 months' duration, of sufficient severity to warrant consideration of long-term gabapentin use, in the opinion of the attending medical practitioner.  Many such patients may already be on gabapentin. </inclusivecriteria>
