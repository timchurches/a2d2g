  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Study designed to include up to 12 patients who completed treatment in study

          -  Have developed any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities while participating
             in study ACH471-100 that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for the study or put the patient at undue risk.

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant during the study or
             within 90 days of study drug administration or patients with a female partner who is
