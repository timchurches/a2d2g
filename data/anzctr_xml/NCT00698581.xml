  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Cumulative Exit Rate at 112 Days After the Beginning of the Baseline Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Tapering Phase - The cumulative exit rate was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods and was based on the duration between start of the Evaluation Period (EP) and the earliest date the first exit criterion was met for each subject. Subjects completing the EP without meeting an exit criterion were censored on Day 112. The primary comparison was BRV 50 mg/day vs a historical control. The upper limit of the 2-sided 95 % Confidence Interval for the estimate was compared to the historical lower bound estimate of 0.722.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the main treatment for epilepsy; however, only a limited
      number of AEDs are approved for use as monotherapy. The objective of this study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of Brivaracetam (BRV) in the conversion of partial onset seizure
      patients from combination treatment to monotherapy</summary>
