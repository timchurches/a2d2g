             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  The subject is unable to refrain from travelling to countries with a high prevalence
             of infectious (especially parasitic) disease from when the first dose is administered
             until the expected washout period is complete (plasma levels below LLQ) or the last
             follow-up visit, which ever is later</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two part study. Part I is designed to test single doses of GSK678586A in healthy
      volunteers. Part II is designed to test repeat doses (two doses) of GSK679586A in patients
      with mild asthma. Both parts are designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and the way
      the body absorbs GSK679586A when given by intravenous infusion (through a vein in your arm).</summary>
