  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single, 90 minute, 3kcal/min ( 270kcal total load) intraduodenal infusion of each of the following treatments in random order: a) Intact Whey Protein, b) 18% Whey Protein Hydrosylate, or c) free amino acid solution. Appetite sensation questionnaires (VAS) and blood samples will occur at t= -15 min, 0 (start of infusion), 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 &amp; 120 (after completion of the buffet meal). A buffet meal will be provided at the end of infusion and the participant has 30 minutes to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices white bread, 4 slices brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions manyonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and 14g milky way chocolate bar. Each volunteer will receive one of each infusion solutions on each of the 3 study days. Each study visit will be separated by no less than 3 days and no more than 10 days.</interventions>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A questionnaire is answered by the volunteer, based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and eligibility is determined.  A signed informed consent is obtained and study dates are established. 

Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit, using a randomisation table which was created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involved contacting the holder (study assistant) of the randomisation table to inform them of the next subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution on each study day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been designed to investigate how the extent of hydrolysated protein effects gut motility, gut hormones and appetite sensations. Volunteers are required to visit the clinic on 3 occassions no less than 3 days apart. Visits will last for approximately 5 hours. A long flexible tube will be inserted through an anaesthetised nostril and passed through into the small intestine to monitor stomach and small intestinal contractions. Through this tube, a protein solution will be infused into the small intestine over a 90 minute period. Blood samples will be taken (through a cannula, which is a long flexible tube inserted into a vein) and questionnaires on appetite sensations will be completed every 15 minutes. At the end of the 90 minute solution infusion, a buffet meal will be provided. This meal will be consumed over 30 minutes until the volunteer is confortably full.</summary>
