    <interventions>Participants will undergo an 8-week baseline period to document their seizures and the medications they are taking to treat their epilepsy. Following the baseline period, participants will receive one of three treatments as indicated below: 
- Treatment A: ZYN002  CBD 195 mg every 12 hours, or
- Treatment B: ZYN002  CBD 97.5 mg every 12 hours, or
- Treatment C: placebo every 12 hours
for 12 weeks. 

Participants will have their dose reduced by 50% at Week 13 and another 50% (only participants receiving Treatment A) at Week 14, with no further treatment administered from week 15.

ZYN002 or placebo gel will be applied to the skin of both the right and left shoulder and/or upper arms. 

Participants will bring used and unused sachets to each visit for site to check treatment compliance. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size of 60 participants per treatment group is sufficient to have a power of 88% to detect a difference between active and placebo. To account for a possible screening failure rate of 15%, a total of 210 participants should be enrolled to ensure there will be 180 participants to randomize.
There will be one planned interim analysis when approximately 120 participants (67% of planned sample size) have completed the trial. 
Efficacy:
All participants who receive at least one dose of study drug and have at least one post-baseline seizure assessment will be included in the efficacy analysis. The primary analysis, based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, will be performed on seizure frequency. Pairwise comparisons of the two active treatments (Treatment A and Treatment B) to placebo (Treatment C) will be made using least squares (LS) means. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
All participants who receive at least one dose of study drug and have plasma concentration obtained from at least one of the three Maintenance Period evaluations will be included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, coefficient of variation, geometric mean [plasma concentration]) for plasma concentrations and elapsed time will be presented by treatment group at nominal blood sampling times.. 
Safety Analyses: 
All participants who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analysis. AEs will be tabulated by treatment group and classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA).  For each preferred term, the two active groups will each be compared to the placebo group with a Fisher Exact test. Additionally, AEs will be tabulated overall (total number of AEs and total number of patients with AEs).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the effectiveness, safety, tolerability and blood levels, of twice daily ZYN002, in addition to regular seizure medication, for 12 weeks in 180 adults with partial onset seizures.  This will be done by analysing a daily seizure and skin irritation diary, drug levels in the blood at various times following drug administration, and side effects. Skin at the application sites will be checked to see if there is any irritation or reactions present after applications. 

Who is if for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 70 years, have epilepsy with partial onset seizures and are currently on a stable regimen of AED(s). 

Study details: This study will investigate two doses of ZYN002 compared to a placebo gel (a treatment with no active ingredients which looks like the real thing but it is not).  This study is double-blind which means you and your study doctor, together with the study staff will not know whether you are receiving ZYN002 or placebo gel.  

What does study participation involve? Your participation in the study includes a screening visit; a baseline period of up to 8-weeks; a 12 week study treatment period; dose reduction at Week 13 and 14; and an end of study (EOS) visit at Week 15. Participants should fast prior to four study visits. Participants will be instructed to record their seizure frequency and type in their daily diary.
During the baseline period, participants will record seizures in the daily diary, and blood samples will be collected at two visits. During the treatment period four clinic visits are required for: blood sampling; review of daily diary, medications, AEs and skin irritation; measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate and temperature ; suicide risk; and possibly, a brief physical and neurological exam, pregnancy tests (females only, if applicable) and an ECG. Participants withhold their morning application until after blood sample collection at these visits. Two additional clinic visits are also required for blood sampling. Additional out-patient visits may be required if there is skin irritation present at the application site.
