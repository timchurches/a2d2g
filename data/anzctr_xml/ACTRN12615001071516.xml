    <interventions>Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed or suspected sepsis who were treated with dexmedetomidine as a part of their care while admitted to the Austin Hospital between November 2013 and June 2015.  All data will be retrieved from the participants medical record and with the duration of the observation period to include the duration of ICU stay and hospital admission.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care sedation participants involves the administration of sedative medications to facilitate mechanical ventilation.  Standard care in the SPICE III trial directs clinicians towards avoiding dexmedetomidine unless deemed clinically necessary.  The SPICE III trial registration number is NCT01728558 (Trial from ClinicalTrials.gov).  All data will be retrieved from the participants medical record and with the duration of the observation period to include the duration of ICU stay and hospital admission.  Data will be collected from 1st November 2013 to 31st August 2015.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analysis will be performed using STATA.  We will perform descriptive and inferential statistics to help describe of participants.  In addition, we will use simple statistical tests that will include comparisons using Chi-square tests for equal proportion with results reported as numbers, percentages (%), and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Continuously normally distributed variables will be compared using student t-tests and presented as means (95% CI).  We plan to perform multivariable logistic regression analysis on all outcomes repeated measures ANOVA where applicable.  A two-sided P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered evidence of a significant difference in the study outcomes.  Significance was set at 0.05 for all comparisons unless otherwise stated.

Based on previous studies, to detect a 30% difference in NA infusion rates between groups, with an expected standard deviation (SD) of 25% and a test power of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of 80%, a sample size of 15 individuals per group will be required.  To take into account the possibility of incomplete data recording, we will analyse 40 patients admitted to our intensive care unit.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stabilizing the circulation of critically ill patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic can be complicated by a phenomenon called catecholamine hyposensitivity, which leads to a decreased effect of vasoactive drugs. Massive release of endogenous catecholamines like adrenaline and noradrenaline in the setting of sepsis can cause down-regulation and de-sensitization of alpha-1 receptors making the vasculature less responsive to catecholamines. 

Interestingly, animal studies found that high doses of central alpha2-agonists like clonidine and dexmedetomidine increase vasopressor responsiveness in a septic shock model.

In view of the potentially deleterious effects of adrenergic overstimulation and receptor desensitization more research about the effect and use of alpha-2-agonists in clinical doses and critically ill patients is warranted. 

In the critical care setting, the alpha-2-agonist clonidine has become an established drug for the management of conditions with a high sympathetic activity and it is also commonly used as a supplementary sedative agent. Dexmedetomidine has anaesthetic and analgesic properties and has much higher a2-receptor selectivity than clonidine. Like clonidine, dexmedetomidine is used for sedation in adult critically ill patients.

In view of the potential benefits of dexmedetomidine in septic patients, we aim to conduct a retrospective cohort study of the haemodynamic effect of dexmedetomidine compared to standard care sedation in septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit of the Austin Hospital.
