    <interventions>The study consists of 1 test group.
A gel containing Tocopheryl phosphate mix in combination with approximately 9 mg of oxycodone (TPM/O).
TPM/O will be applied and covered using an occlusive patch to 50 healthy volunteers for a series of nine consecutive 24 hour exposures, every day.</interventions>
