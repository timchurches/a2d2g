  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to inform the future clinical development of the two
      investigational agents in ER+ breast cancer, LEE011 (CDK4/6 inhibitor) and BYL719 (PI3K-alpha
      inhibitor).

      This is a multi-center, open-label Phase Ib study. The Phase Ib dose escalation will estimate
      the MTD and/or RP2D for three regimens: two double combinations, LEE011 with letrozole and
      BYL719 with letrozole, followed by triple combinations of LEE011 + BYL719 with letrozole
      (Arms 3 and 4).

      The Phase Ib dose escalation part will be followed by Phase Ib dose expansions to further
      characterize the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary clinical anti-tumor activity of the
      combinations. Optional crossover for patients who have progressed while on dose escalation or
      dose expansion with doublet treatment on Arms 1 or 2 to be treated with the triplet
      combination (Arm 3) after the determination of the RP2D for Arm 3; is no longer permitted
      after protocol amendment 6.

      Approximately 250 adult women with ER+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      will be enrolled.</summary>
