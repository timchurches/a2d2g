  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:

      This prospective trial seeks to investigate the efficacy of a financial incentive in
      increasing the uptake and completion of the HBV vaccine series among people who inject drugs
      (PWID). Using a randomised controlled trial design, the investigators will offer the 3 dose,
      accelerated HBV schedule to eligible PWID allocated to either a standard of care or incentive
      condition. Participants allocated to the incentive condition will receive a small incentive
      payment after the second and third dose of the vaccine. It is hypothesized that the
      proportion of participants who complete the vaccine series in the incentive payment arm will
      be higher compared to the non-incentive payment arm (standard of care).</summary>
