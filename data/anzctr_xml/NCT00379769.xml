Experimental: rosiglitazone in addition to background metformin - Participants inadequately controlled on background metformin (MET) were randomised to receive rosiglitazone (RSG), in addition to MET. RSG was initiated as a 4 mg once daily dose and was increased to a maximum dose of 8 mg per day as required to achieve a target HbA1c of less than or equal to 7.0 percent.

Experimental: rosiglitazone in addition to background sulfonylurea - Participants inadequately controlled on background SU were randomised to receive, in addition to SU, RSG. RSG was initiated as a 4 mg once daily dose and was increased to a maximum dose of 8 mg per day as required to achieve a target HbA1c of less than or equal to 7.0 percent.

Active Comparator: Sulfonylurea in addition to background metformin - Participants inadequately controlled on background MET were randomised to receive, in addition to MET, a sulfonylurea (SU) (glibenclamide, gliclazide, or glimepiride). The SU was gradually increased to the maximum permitted dose (glibenclamide 15 mg per day or miconizied equivalent of 10.5 mg per day; gliclazide 240 mg per day; glimepiride 4 mg per day) as required to achieve a target HbA1c of less than or equal to 7.0 percent.

Active Comparator: Metformin in addition to background sulfonylurea - Participants inadequately controlled on background SU were randomised to receive, in addition to SU, MET. MET was gradually increased to the maximum permitted dose of 2550 mg per day as required to achieve a target HbA1c of less than or equal to 7.0 percent.

CV death= no unequivocal non-CV cause (sudden death, death from acute vascular events, heart failure, acute MI, other CV causes, and deaths adjudicated as unknown cause). MI event=hospitalization + elevation of specific cardiac biomarkers above the upper limit of normal + cardiac ischemia symptoms/new pathological electrocardiogram findings.

      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Bone Fracture Event - Overall and by Gender: Observational Follow-up - The observational follow-up was designed to collect data concerning cancer and bone fractures in RECORD participants during a 4-year period after the end of the main RECORD study. At the end of the main study, all study medication was stopped. Participants were not provided with study medication in the observational follow-up; instead, anti-diabetic treatment was prescribed at the investigator's discretion. A bone fracture event is defined as one or more fractured bones occurring on the same date and that had the same Higher Level Group Term (HLGT) for fracture location, per participant.</outcome>

At the end of the main study, all study medication was stopped. Participants were not provided with study medication in the OFU. A bone fracture event is defined as one or more fractured bones occurring on the same date and that had the same Higher Level Group Term (HLGT) for fracture location, per participant. An SAE is defined as any event that is fatal; life threatening; disabling/incapacitating; results in hospitalization (excluding elective surgery or routine clinical procedures); prolongs a hospital stay; is associated with a congenital abnormality; cancer; is associated with an overdose. In addition, any event that the investigator regards as serious or that would suggest any significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may be associated with the study procedures should be reported as an SAE.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a phase 3b, multicentre, randomised, open label, parallel group study. A 4-week
      run-in period will be followed by a median of 6 years of treatment with study medication in
      addition to continuation of background glucose lowering therapy. Patients inadequately
      controlled on background metformin will be randomised to receive, in addition to metformin,
      either rosiglitazone or a sulfonylurea(glibenclamide, gliclazide or glimepiride) in a ratio
      of 1:1. Patients inadequately controlled on background SU will be randomised to receive, in
      addition to SU, either rosiglitazone or metformin in a ratio of 1:1. Equal numbers of
      patients receiving background metformin and SU at entry will be entered into the study.</summary>
