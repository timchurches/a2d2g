    <interventions>An online mental health and wellbeing program for same-sex attracted youth aged between 18-25 years. The program includes 7 brief modules containing mental health and wellbeing information and exercises based on cognitive-behaviour therapy.  The modules contain generic information and information and exercises specific for the symptoms participants endorse in an online assessment, which screens for generalised anxiety, obsessions and compulsions, posttraumatic stress, specific fear, social anxiety and depressive symptoms. It is recommended to participants that they spend an hour a week over 8 weeks reading through the online modules and practising offline exercises.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will go to www.anxietyonline.org.au in response to advertising. They will first read an information statement and if they wish to take part they provide online consent. They will then be taken through a set of pre-program questionnaires. At this stage, participants who have reached the cut-off score of at least one symptom of anxiety or depression will move on to the random allocation stage. Randomisation will be computer generated and then allocation to one of the two groups occurs. Participants will be advised on their computer screen of which group they have been allocated to.</concealment>
    <sequence>An automated computerised randomisation system will be built to generate the random sequences of group allocation. This will be based on a permuted blocked randomisation method to allow for stratification of gender, ensuring that equal gender numbers are allocated to each of the two conditions.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Participants in the intervention group receive the intervention after completing the pre-program assessment, which they can do at any time while the trial is open for recruitment. Participants in the intervention group receive the intervention group 20-weeks after completing the pre-program assessment. Therefore, participants will complete the program at different times over the course of the study depending on when they register.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to develop and evaluate an online mental health and wellbeing program for same-sex attracted youth (SSAY) aged between 18-25 years. The program will deliver symptom-relevant material across multiple mental health symptom categories, where relevant, so as to present individual users with an integrated mental health and wellbeing program that respects their individuality, and acknowledges the reality and frequency of co-occurring mental health problems. The mental health symptoms covered will include depressive symptoms, generalised anxiety, panic, obsessions, compulsions, post traumatic stress, specific phobia and social anxiety. In addition, participants will receive access to a module that provides psycho-educational information about suicide. By using the results of an automated online screening questionnaire, the program will tailor content based on participants' current symptom presentation and their gender. We will evaluate the outcomes and user acceptability and satisfaction of the mental health and wellbeing program with approximately 76 SSAY (recruiting about 200 initially to allow for attrition). A randomised controlled trial will be conducted, with assessments at pre-program, post-program and 3 month follow-up. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive the mental health and wellbeing program with treatment as usual or a 20 week delayed access control with treatment as usual.</summary>
