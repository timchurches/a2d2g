  <interventions>
    <interventions>Initiation of amphotericin B deoxycholate on day 4 (early initiation or treatment A) .
Fourth day of fever (38.3 degrees Celsius or more), i.e., persistent fever (i.e., despite being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics).
Administration method: First, these patients will receive 1 L of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%) intravenously for 1 hour. Then, they will receive  1 L of  5% dextrose in water (D5W) plus 1 mg/kg daily of amphotericin B deoxycholate plus one vial (10 mL) of Multiple Vitamins for Infusion (Dextrevit Registered Trademark) given by slow infusion (12 hours). The 12-hour infusion is a combination of the D5W, amphotericin B deoxycholate and Multiple Vitamins, which are all given once daily. Amphotericin B deoxycholate will continue for at least 48 hours after the patient is afebrile and his absolute neutrophil count is 500 cells/mm3 or more. The latter decision will be made by the research team. A team member will also monitor adherence on a daily basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Initiation of amphotericin B deoxycholate on day 6 (delayed initiation or treatment B). These patients will receive placebo the fourth and fifth day.
Placebo administration will be as follows: First, these patients will receive 1 L of normal saline (NaCl 0.9%) intravenously for 1 hour. Then, they will receive  1 L of  5% dextrose in water (D5W) plus one vial (10 mL) of Multiple Vitamins for Infusion (Dextrevit Registered Trademark) given by slow infusion (12 hours).

    <statisticalmethods>Based on a previous report (Malhotra et al, 2014), sample size was calculated using comparisons of means. Calculation was performed using alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20, and two tails. A total sample size of 24 (12 in each group) would be required to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between groups. Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, the total sample size was increased to 30, as follows: N = n / (1-z%), where N is the adjusted final sample size, n the calculated sample size, and z% the dropout expected rate.
Data distribution will be assessed with the use of KolmogorovSmirnov test. Continuous variables will be compared using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The continuous  variables will be presented as mean +/- SD or median (25, 75), The Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare categorical variables. The categorical variables will be presented as frequency and percentage. Statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS v.20 (SPSS Inc. Software, Chicago, Illinois, USA), and a p-value below 0.05 (p&lt;0.05) will be considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A large proportion of health care facilities in developing countries does not have the diagnostic armamentarium necessary to undertake a complete preemptive therapy for high-risk patients with persistent neutropenic fever. Likewise, the use of liposomal amphotericin B is limited by its cost. Therefore, we designed this study to determine the optimal time for starting empirical antifungal therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate in high-risk patients with persistent neutropenic fever, which could provide a timely resolution of symptoms and potentially a reduction in mortality. This is a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Eligible patients will be randomized on the fourth day of fever to treatment A (early therapy) or B (delayed therapy). In treatment A, amphotericin B deoxycholate will be initiated on the fourth day of fever. In treatment B, placebo will be initiated on the fourth day of fever and, on the sixth day, the latter will be switched to amphotericin B deoxycholate. The primary outcome will be the time to fever resolution after the start of amphotericin B deoxycholate.</summary>
