  <interventions>
    <interventions>If participants are randomly allocated to the intervention group, treatment will be based on the manual Individual and Group Metacognitive Therapy for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (Rees &amp; van Koesveld, 2009). This manual will be reviewed and modified in study 1 (development of the programme and website) in order to be used as an online self-help programme. The programme will be provided through the website 'the OCD-Doctor-Online'. A time period of six weeks will be allocated to all participants to complete the program (a total of 10 modules). At the end of each module, a number of questions will be asked to ensure that participants completely understand the content of that module. It is anticipated that each module will take approximately 1 hour to complete. In order to ensure that participants complete modules in the correct order, modules will not be available until questions from the previous modules have been completed.</interventions>
    <comparator>If participants are randomly allocated to the control group, progressive muscle relaxation training will be administered online. Progressive muscle relaxation training has been successfully used in controlled trials as a credible comparison condition (e.g. Fals-Stewart, Marks, &amp; Schafer, 1993; Twohig et al., 2010). 
Participants will be provided with audio exercises weekly (15-30 minutes) for 6 weeks to teach them specific progressive muscle relaxation techniques. They will also be allocated homework to practice these exercises a minimum of once a day (15 minutes - 30 minutes). 

After study 2 (implementation and evaluation of the program) is complete, participants in the control group will be provided with access to the online MCT programme if they wish.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Obsessive-compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R). The 18-item self-report questionnaire assesses several symptoms of OCD. Items on the self-report questionnaire refer to experiences that many people may have in their everyday lives. The scales assesses how much each of these items have distressed or bothered the participant in the past month.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, following the completion of each module, Post-test (immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Symptom Checklist. Is used to indicate whether or not the individual has specific types of obsessions or compulsions. It will be used to determine if particular obsessions or compulsions, or both, have reduced following treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, Post-test (immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales - 21 (DASS-21). The 21-item self-report questionnaire is used as a quantitative measure or symptoms relevant to depression, anxiety and stress.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, Following the completion of each module, Post-test (immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Metacognitions Questionnaire - 30 (MCQ-30). The MCQ-30 evaluates the role that metacognitions play in clinical diagnoses and may also be used as part of metacognitive therapy. A high score on the MCQ-30 indicates that the participant has a stronger belief about hte importance of control, as well as the negative consequences associated with intrusive or unwanted thoughts.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, Post-test (immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire - 18 (Q-LES-Q-18). The self-report scale measures general quality of life and specific life domain levels of enjoyment and satisfaction. The specific life domains include: physical health, subjective feelings, leisure time activity, social relationships, and satisfaction with medication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, Post-test (immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychiatric diagnostic Screening Questionnaire (PDSQ). A brief self-report scale consisting of 126 items which are designed to screen for symptoms of 13 different DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, Post-test (immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Suicidality section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The suicidality section of the MINI classifies participants into four groups: no suicidal risk, low suicidal risk, moderate suicidal risk, and high suicidal risk.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test (to screen for suicidal risk), Weekly, Post-test (Immediately following the intervention), 6-week follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A number of inclusion and exclusion criteria apply. Once participants have gone through the screening process and are found to be eligible to participate in the research study, they will be randomly allocated to either intervention or control group. Random allocation will be conducted by computer generated software (Saghaei’s [2004] Random Allocation computer software version 1.0). All measures are self-administered online. The researchers will therefore have no knowledge of the condition to which the participant will be allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method used to generate the sequence in which subjects will be randomised will be a simple random allocation procedure. The researcher will use Saghaei’s (2004) Random Allocation computer software version 1.0 to generate randomised number lists. The researcher will correspond with a statistician from Curtin University of Technology to ensure equal group sizes. Correspondence with a professional programmer will help to incorporate the randomisation software into the website to randomly allocate participants to groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating anxiety disorder. Given the strong demand for psychotherapeutic services, effective and reliable treatment for OCD is not always readily available. The aims of this research are to (1) develop an online self-help metacognitive therapy (MCT) programme for OCD, and (2) implement and evaluate the self-help MCT programme in an online controlled trial. A minimum of forty participants with symptoms of OCD will be recruited through the World Wide Web via snowballing throughout Australia. Participants will be randomly allocated to either control group or intervention group. Access to either the self-help MCT programme (intervention) or the progressive muscle relaxation training programme (control) through the website (the OCD-Doctor-Online) will then be granted. Participants will be required to complete each module of the programme before carrying onto the next. Participants will be administered several instruments measuring symptoms of OCD, depression, anxiety and stress, quality of life, and metacognitions at pre-test, post-test and at 6-week follow-up. If statistically significant reductions in OCD symptoms are found in this study it will justify the completion of further effectiveness and efficacy research and will potentially provide an important alternative treatment option for people diagnosed with OCD.</summary>
