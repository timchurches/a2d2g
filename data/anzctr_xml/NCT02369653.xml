  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a blood thinning drug called Apixaban
      versus no administration of a blood thinning drug, in preventing blood clots in children with
      leukemia or lymphoma. Patients must be receiving chemotherapy; including Pegylated
      L-Asparaginase and have a central line (a catheter inserted for administration of medications
      and blood sampling).</summary>
