    <interventions>Other interventions - Application of the"Men continue and HER DOO2" rule

Experimental: 1 Discontinue OAT or AAA - Patients classified as being at low risk of recurrent VTE by the "HER DOO2"rule.
If the clinical decision rule indicates that a patient is at low recurrence risk (&lt;3% per year); anticoagulant therapy will be withdrawn and the participant will then be followed for 1 year for any VTE recurrence and/or bleeding.

No Intervention: 2 Observation arm - Men and patients classified as being at high risk of recurrent VTE by the "HER DOO2"rule.
If the clinical decision rule indicates that a patient is at high recurrence risk then the decision to continue or discontinue anticoagulant therapy will be left to the discretion of physicians and patients as per current standard of care and this decision recorded. High risk patients (females classified as being at high risk of recurrent VTE by the CDR, and all males) will then be followed as an observational cohort for 1 year for any VTE recurrence and/or bleeding.


Other interventions: Application of the"Men continue and HER DOO2" rule
Consecutive patients will have the"Men continue and HER DOO2" rule applied by the attending physician between 5 - 12 months after treatment for a first unprovoked objectively proven major VTE.
"Men continue and HER DOO2" rule: all men continue oral anticoagulants and women with 2 or more of the following features after 5-7 months of OAT should continue oral anticoagulants:1) HER - any Hyperpigmentation, Edema and Redness of either lower extremity, 2) Vidas D-dimer =250ug/L, 3) Obesity - BMI =30 kg/m2 and 4) Older age - Age =65 years.

    <summary>The main objective of this study is to verify whether a new clinical decision rule
      identifying patients diagnosed with unprovoked blood clots who have a low risk of recurrence
      can safely stop oral anticoagulant therapy after 5-7 months of treatment.</summary>
