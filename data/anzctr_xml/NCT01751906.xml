    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Target Lesion Failure (TLF) at 1 year, non-inferiority (NI) against the control. - TLF is defined as composite of Cardiac Death, Myocardial Infarction (per protocol-defined MI definition), attributable to Target Vessel (TV-MI), or Ischemic-Driven Target Lesion Revascularization (ID-TLR).
Sample size of 1900 subjects is required for the study (2:1 randomization); 1267 subjects for Absorb BVS arm and 633 subjects for XIENCE arm. Assuming a 5% dropout rate approximately 2,000 subjects will be required
The ABSORB III primary endpoint of TLF at 1-year follow up will be analyzed for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and the per-treatment evaluable (PTE) populations. The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population. The non-inferiority hypothesis testing will be performed using a non-inferiority test statistic by Farrington and Manning. Non-inferiority of Absorb BVS to XIENCE will be established if the p-value for the non-inferiority test is less than 0.025.</outcome>

             vessel during the last 12 months. Prior PCI within the non-target vessel or any
             peripheral intervention is acceptable if performed anytime &gt;30 days before the index

         12. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or
             severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., human
             immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). Note: corticosteroids are
             not included as immunosuppressant therapy.

         13. Subject has previously received or is scheduled to receive radiotherapy to a coronary
             artery (vascular brachytherapy), or the chest/mediastinum.

         14. Subject is receiving or will require chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., coumadin,

         15. Subject has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3.

         16. Subject has a documented or suspected hepatic disorder as defined as cirrhosis or
             Child-Pugh = Class B.

         17. Renal insufficiency. NOTE: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be based on

             etc.).

         20. Extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 6 French sheath insertion.
             Note: femoral arterial disease does not exclude the patient if radial access may be
             used.

             includes completion of Patient Reported Outcome instruments.

         23. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet
             completed its primary endpoint.

         24. Vulnerable population.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          1. One or two de novo target lesions:

               1. If there is one target lesion, a second non-target lesion may be treated but the
                  non-target lesion must be present in a different epicardial vessel, and must be
                  treated first with a successful, uncomplicated result prior to randomization of
                  the target lesion.

               2. If two target lesions are present, they must be present in different epicardial
                  vessels and both must satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria.

               3. The definition of epicardial vessels means the LAD, LCX and RCA and their
                  branches. Thus, the patient must not have lesions requiring treatment in e.g.
                  both the LAD and a diagonal branch.

          2. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated
             or quantitatively assessed % diameter stenosis (DS) of = 50% and &lt; 100% with a
             thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow of =1 and one of the following:
             stenosis = 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g. fractional flow reserve, stress
             test), unstable angina or post-infarct angina.

               1. Lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with RVD by visual
                  estimation of = 2.5 mm and = 3.75 mm.

               2. Lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with length by visual
                  estimation of = 24 mm.

               3. For Lead-In subjects with 3.0x18 mm Absorb BVS: lesion(s) must be located in a
                  native coronary artery with RVD by visual estimation of = 2.75 mm and = 3.25 mm.
                  The lesion length by visual estimation is = 8 mm and = 14 mm.

        Angiographic 

        All exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion(s) or target vessel(s).

          1. Lesion which prevents successful balloon pre-dilatation, defined as full balloon
             expansion with the following outcomes:

               1. Residual %DS is a maximum of &lt; 40% (per visual estimation), = 20% is strongly
                  recommended.

               2. TIMI Grade-3 flow (per visual estimation).

               3. No angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure).

               4. No dissections National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grade D-F.

               5. No chest pain lasting &gt; 5 minutes.

               6. No ST depression or elevation lasting &gt; 5 minutes

          2. Lesion is located in left main.

          3. Aorto-ostial right coronary artery (RCA) lesion (within 3 mm of the ostium).

          4. Lesion located within 3 mm of the origin of the Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD)
             or left circumflex artery (LCX).

          5. Lesion involving a bifurcation with a:

               1. side branch = 2 mm in diameter, or

               2. side branch with either an ostial or non-ostial lesion with diameter stenosis &gt;
                  50%, or

               3. side branch requiring dilatation.

          6. Anatomy proximal to or within the lesion that may impair delivery of the Absorb BVS or
             XIENCE stent:

               1. Extreme angulation (= 90°) proximal to or within the target lesion.

               2. Excessive tortuosity (= two 45° angles) proximal to or within the target lesion.

               3. Moderate or heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion. If IVUS
                  used, subject must be excluded if calcium arc in the vessel prior to the lesion
                  or within the lesion is = 180°.

          7. Vessel contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images or by IVUS or OCT.

          8. Lesion or vessel involves a myocardial bridge.

          9. Vessel has been previously treated with a stent at any time prior to the index
             procedure such that the Absorb BVS or XIENCE would need to cross the stent to reach
             the target lesion.

         10. Vessel has been previously treated and the target lesion is within 5 mm proximal or
             distal to a previously treated lesion.

         11. Target lesion located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to any
             arterial or saphenous vein graft.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The ABSORB III RCT is a prospective randomized, single-blind, multi-center trial. It is the
      pivotal trial to support the US pre-market approval (PMA) of Absorb Bioresorbable Vascular
      Scaffold (BVS).

      The ABSORB III includes additional two trials i.e. ABSORB III PK (pharmacokinetics) sub-study
      and ABSORB IV RCT trial which are maintained under one protocol because both trial designs
      are related, ABSORB IV is the continuation of ABSORB III and the data from ABSORB III and
      ABSORB IV will be pooled to support the ABSORB IV primary endpoint. Both the trials will
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Absorb BVS.</summary>
