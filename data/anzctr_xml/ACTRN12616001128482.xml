  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be conducted using a randomised crossover design with four treatments: low energy dense savoury preload (around 50 kcal with monosodium glutamate (MSG) and inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP)), low energy dense sweet preload (around 50 kcal with sucralose), high energy dense savoury preload (around 250 kcal with MSG and IMP), and high energy dense sweet preload (around 250 kcal with sucralose).
 
All potential participants will be asked to attend a screening session after a 10-hour overnight fast for consenting and screening procedures. Some basic anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, waist and hip circumferences will be taken. Body composition will be measured using Tanita BC-418 machine and BODPOD. Blood pressure will be taken using an automated blood pressure monitor. After the screening visit, participants will be asked to attend four test sessions, with a minimum of five-day washout period between the test sessions. 

On each test day, participants will be asked to consume a pre-package study breakfast outside Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC) between 8 am and 9 am. The study breakfast consists of a packet of Milo, an apple, a packet of biscuit, and a muesli bar. Participants will be asked to arrive at CNRC three hours after breakfast (between 11 am and 12 pm), where they will be provided with a study preload which must be consumed within a 15-minute time period. The preload is made up of soup with ingredients such as yam, sweet potato, corn, and snow fungus. Participants will be provided with an ad libitum lunch an hour after the commencement of preload consumption, where they are allowed to consume as much or as little as they wish until they feel comfortably full. Food consumption will be supervised by research staff. Fingerprick blood samples will be obtained at baseline (prior to preload consumption), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes after commencement of preload consumption. Participants will be asked to complete an appetite-rating questionnaire at the same time points. All participants will be asked to complete a physical activity questionnaire and one-day diet record a day before their test day and the actual test day.

    <comparator>This will be a randomised crossover study where participants will act as their own control. This study consists of four treatments: low energy dense savoury preload (around 50 kcal with MSG and IMP), low energy dense sweet preload (around 50 kcal with sucralose), high energy dense savoury preload (around 250 kcal with MSG and IMP), and high energy dense sweet preload (around 250 kcal with sucralose). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy compensation, i.e. energy intake during an ad libitum lunch meal. Ad libitum intake of the lunch meal will be measured by weighing the leftovers on the plate. Energy compensation will then be calculated. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Ad libitum lunch. On each test day, participants will be asked to consume a study preload in mid-morning and they will be provided with an ad libitum lunch an hour later, where they are allowed to consume as much or as little food as they wish until they feel comfortably full.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood glucose response. Fingerprick blood samples will be obtained prospectively for blood glucose measurement. Blood samples will be collected directly into cuvettes for analysing blood glucose concentrations using a Hemocue Glucose 201 Analyser (Helsinborg, Sweden).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fingerprick blood samples will be collected at baseline (prior to preload consumption), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes after commencement of preload consumption.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satiety response. During each test session, participants will be asked to record their appetite (e.g. hunger, thirst, desire to eat, prospective consumption, fullness, etc.) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to rate their appetite every 15 minutes for the first hour after commencement of preload consumption and every 30 minutes for the subsequent two hours, nine timepoints in total. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Questionnaires on individual characteristics, food choice and preference (Composite) will be used to determine whether the degree of energy compensation could be explained by these variables. These questionnaires will include Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Body Perception Questionnaire, Intuitive Eating Scale, Dietary Practice Questionnaire, Food Choice Questionnaire, Food Preference Questionnaire, and Power of Food Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaires at baseline.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on our previous study looking at blood glucose response to liquids in a similar population group (Tey et al., 2016), it has been calculated that in order to have 90% power at the two-sided 0.05 level to detect a difference of 30% in total AUC for glucose between the treatments, 25 participants will be required with full data. Allowing for an approximate 20% dropout rate, 30 participants will be required at baseline.

Baseline characteristics of the participants will be presented as arithmetic means and standard deviations. Linear mixed models with a random participant effect to account for the underlying correlation between the repeated measures will be used to examine the effects of energy density and taste quality on energy compensation, glycaemic response, and appetite. Two-sided P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant in all cases.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain type of cancers. It poses a large global economic burden, costing billions of dollars annually for healthcare and productivity losses. The consumption of low energy dense foods has the potential to reduce total energy intake and aid in body weight management. In addition, recent studies suggest that taste qualities of a meal (e.g. savoury or sweet) may play a role in satiation and food intake. Therefore the objective of this randomised crossover study is to examine the effects of consuming preloads that differ in energy density (low or high) and taste quality (savoury or sweet) on postprandial glucose response and energy compensation among Asians. The proposed study will provide novel insights regarding the glycaemic and satiety responses to high energy-dense and low energy-dense foods and the role of taste quality in modifying these responses.
