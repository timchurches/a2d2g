    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the Glycaemic index of Manuka honey - 10 healthy individuals consumed honey (25g of available carbohydrate in 200 ml of water) in a fasted state. Blood glucose levels were recorded at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 mins and the area under the blood glucose curve was calculated. All 10 participants took five different honeys and a glucose standard on six different days (with randomised allocation of samples).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Five high methylglyoxal (460-667 mg/kg) Manuka honey samples were selected from different
      geographical locales around the North Island of New Zealand and tested for glycaemic index
      (GI) in 10 healthy volunteers in a single-blinded, randomised study. Participants were fed
      honey containing 25g of available carbohydrate in 200 ml water and the blood glucose
      responses measured (area under the curve; AUC) and compared to that of 25 g of available
      carbohydrate from glucose.</summary>
