  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multi-centre prospective evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of treosulfan and metabolites after intravenous administration prior to blood or marrow transplantation. The exact dose, dosing schedule and infusion duration of treosulfan will be as specified in the protocol by which the patient is being treated. This is an observational study with no control group. Patients will be followed for up to 5 years post transplant.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will establish the pharmacokinetics of treosulfan in a large population of 60 children. Total exposure to treosulfan and metabolites (area-under-the-concentration-versus-time curve, AUC) and other pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined for each individual using the blood concentrations. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured after a single dose.
The time points for children less than 20 kg are prior to the infusion start, then at 5 min, 30min, 3h, 5h and 7h after the infusion end. The time points for children greater than 20kg are prior to the infusion then at 5 min, 30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h and 10 h after the infusion end.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Data about the patient (e.g. age, weight, height, surface area, renal function, liver function, laboratory values, concomitant medications, diagnosis) will be collected to allow an assessment of the factors that contribute to the variability in treosulfan pharmacokinetics. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Collected prior to the treosulfan dose, on study enrolment. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will examine the association between exposure to treosulfan (AUC) and the incidence of Grade 3+ transplant-related toxicities.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Toxicities (e.g. renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal toxicity, mucositis, haematological toxicity), Graft versus Host Disease) will be followed up to 100 days post transplant. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 4. We will examine the association between exposure to treosulfan (AUC) and transplant outcome, including survival, relapse and engraftment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Survival, engraftment and disease response will be followed until five years post transplant.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involves measuring the blood levels of the medication, treosulfan, to improve the way we adjust the dose in children. 
Who is it for?
Children and adolescents with either malignant or non malignant (genetic) diseases can join this study if they are receiving the medication, treosulfan, prior to undergoing blood or marrow transplantation. 
Trial details
A series of blood levels will be collected after the treosulfan dose to see how well their body breaks down and gets rid of the medication. This study does not replace other studies, but simply investigates key medication widely used in the treatment of children's cancer. Participants will be studied for several years after the study to monitor their health. 
This study will define the best way to adjust the dose of the drug, treosulfan, a key medication in blood or marrow transplantation conditioning regimens. Too much causes toxicity and too little risks the disease being more likely to return.
