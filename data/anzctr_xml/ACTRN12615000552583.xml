  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, non-invasive, painless technique which has the capacity to temporarily alter cortical excitability and has been shown to improve working memory performance. In this study it is delivered to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and Parietal cortex.  

This study employs a randomised, crossover design where participants take part in three separate treatment sessions at least 72 hours apart. Each session involves administration of either active tDCS (either over the DLPFC alone, or DLPFC and parietal cortex), or sham tDCS. 

Specifically, participants will receive:

a) Anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (1.5 mA, 15 minutes)
b) Anodal tDCS over the DLPFC and bilateral parietal cortices (1.5 mA, 15 minutes)
c) Sham tDCS either over the DLPFC or DLPFC and bilateral parietal cortices (counterbalanced, 15 minutes)</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is: Sham tDCS (15 minutes). In the sham treatment, tDCS stimulation is ramped-up to 1.5 mA, held at this intensity for several seconds, then ramped down to 0 mA. This technique generates a sensation on the scalp akin to active tDCS, but does not produce any tangible changes in cortical excitability. Sham stimulation will be delivered over either the DLPFC alone (50% of participants), or DLPFC + PPC (50% of participants), with each participant being randomly  assigned to one of these two groups. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>tDCS involves the application of a very weak electrical current to the scalp, which acts to modulate the excitability of underlying cortical neurons, thereby altering their function.  tDCS is both safe and painless, and can induce changes in brain function which are measurable for over an hour after the cessation of stimulation. In order for tDCS to be optimally utilised, however, research which directly compares different stimulation parameters is greatly needed.  

To date, several studies have demonstrated the capacity for tDCS to enhance performance during working memory (WM) tasks when it is applied over prefrontal brain regions (e.g., DLPFC). However, despite encouraging initial results, tDCS has thus far only been able to produce modest levels of cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals. One way of potentially improving the effectiveness of this technique would be to apply it concurrently over a combination of brain regions known to be involved in WM.  

Therefore, this project specifically aims to compare the effects of tDCS delivered over either the left DLPFC alone, or the left DLPFC in combination with the left parietal lobe. Simultaneous stimulation of prefrontal and parietal brain regions will be achieved using a multifocal high-definition stimulation montage which allows for accurate stimulation of two independent cortical targets. The parietal brain region was chosen as the additional stimulation site due to its known involvement in WM. Both behavioural (WM performance) and neurophysiological (EEG, TMS-EEG) data will be utilised to assess the effectiveness of this technique.
