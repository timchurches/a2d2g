  <interventions>
    <interventions>Perioperative analgesia:
Intravenous arm of the trial:
1 g paracetamol
40 mg parecoxib
20 mg oxycontin orally in the post anaesthesia care unit

IV paracetamol and IV parecoxib are given by the attending anaesthetist after delivery of the neonate, prior to the parturient leaving the operating theatre to be managed in the Postoperative Care Unit (PACU). IV paracetamol is given over 10 minutes, whereas IV parecoxib is often given as a push.

As per this study protocol, there are no specific analgesic requirements, however, it is usual practice for the anaesthetist to chart on the patient's medical chart, either Targin or Oxycontin 10-20 mg twice daily and paracetamol 1g four times daily as a regular dose. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), either ibuprofen 400 mg three times daily or diclofenac 100 mg three times daily is charted either as a regular dose, or as required, oxycodone 5 - 10 mg as required is charted and occasionally tramadol 50 - 100 mg four times daily as required is charted as well.  All of these medications are given once the patient has left PACU and is being managed on the ward.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control (standard treatment). Initial perioperative analgesia via the rectal route:
1 g paracetamol PR
100 mg diclofenac PR
30 mg oxycodone (Proladone) PR

All of the above medications are given PR by the obstetrician at the completion of the caesarean section, immediately prior to transfer to PACU.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>From the patient's medication chart the total opioid consumption for the first 48 hours post caesarean section is compiled. If the patient received morphine or fentanyl, in addition to the medications listed previously, these are converted into oxycodone equivalents. Likewise, if the patient received tramadol, this is converted into oxycodone equivalents, such that the total opioid consumption for the first 48 hours may be summated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients are usually discharged on day 3 post caesarean section, with the day of surgery being day 0.  All of their opioid requirements from the time of surgery up to and including midnight of day 2, post procedure are determined. On occasion, patients are discharged earlier (day 2 post caesarean section) and in this case, all of their opioid requirements up to and including the time of discharge are determined.  Note however, that if the patient is discharged home with ongoing opioids for analgesia, these opioids are not included in the total count. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual analogue pain score at time of discharge from hospital</outcome>
      <timepoint>The visual analogue pain score is assessed by the primary investigator before 08.00 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital.  On those occasions when patients were discharged home one day early, the domicillary midwives assessed the visual analogue pain score in the patient's house in the morning of the day that they would have normally been assessed by the primary investigator.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Current pain intensity at time of discharge by the placement of a tick beside the word in a vertical list of words that describes present pain intensity (PPI) from no pain to excruciating where:
0 = No pain
1 = Mild
2 = Discomforting
3 = Distressing
4 = Horrible
5 = Excruciating</outcome>
      <timepoint>The present pain intensity (PPI) score is assessed by the primary investigator before 08.00 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital.

      <outcome>Patients determination of their worst pain experienced since caesarean section, as determined by a visual analogue scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Determination of the patient's worst pain is assessed using the visual analogue pain score by the primary investigator before 08.00 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital.  On those occasions when patients were discharged home one day early, the domicillary midwives assessed the patient's worst pain score using the visual analogue pain score in the patient's house in the morning of the day that they would have normally been assessed by the primary investigator.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain on discharge as assessed by the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The pain on discharge is assessed using the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire by the primary investigator before 08.00 on day 3 post procedure, immediately prior to discharge from the hospital.  On those occasions when patients were discharged home one day early, the domicillary midwives assessed the patient's pain using the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire in the patient's house in the morning of the day that they would have normally been assessed by the primary investigator.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Prior to undertaking this randomised controlled trial, an audit was undertaken at our Insititution for the month of March 2014, in which the total 48 hour opioid use for parturients who received intraoperative IV analgesia was determined.  An average of 137.3 mg with a standard deviation of 27.7 mg was determined. Using these values and a pre-determined clinical significance of 20% reduction in opioid requirements for the intravenous group compared to the per rectum group, the estimated sample size was determined assuming a 95% confidence interval and 80% power.  The calculated sample size was 17 per group ie 34 patients in total. Assuming that patients may be lost to follow up and or non-compliance of either treatment, it was decided to enroll 50 patients into either group, thus a total sample size of 100 patients.    </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, opinion amongst obstetric anaesthetists is divided as to whether an intravenous (IV) route is superior to the per rectum (PR) route for perioperative mangagement of post caesarean section pain.  An audit of the mean total 48 hour opioid requirements post caesaren section was undertaken at The Northern Hospital during March 2014. This did not reveal a difference in the mean opioid requirement between the two different routes of analgesia administration.  Despite this, there is a significant increased cost associated with the use of IV analgesia. It has been estimated that for every 4,000 deliveries, by not using IV analgesia, a cost saving of $20,000.00 will result.

Therefore, we wish to conduct a randomised controlled trial, using current Australian TGA approved medications and formulations, in line with current obstetric anaesthesia practice to determine if the IV route provides superior analgesia.  As such, we would expect to find a 20% decrease in total 48 hour opioid consumption when the IV route is compared to the PR route. Statistical anlaysis of the prior audit has determined that we will need to recruit 50 women into each arm of this trial.
