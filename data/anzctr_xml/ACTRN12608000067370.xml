  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty millilitres of long acting local anaesthetic or placebo is instilled around the femoral nerve on the side of the fractured neck of femur. Distal pressure is applied to ensure the local anaesthetic spreads upwards in the fascial plane to involve the obturator nerve and lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh. Ultrasound guidance of the needle is used to ensure accurate injection, while minimising the risk of damage to the nerve or injection of local anaesthetic into the blood vessels. Aseptic technique is used.Patients will receive either 0.5% bupivacaine or normal saline. These will be pre-prepared so that medical and nursing staff and patients will be blind as to whether the local anaesthetic or placebo is injected. Bupivacaine is slow acting and therefore does not sting on injection as rapid acting lignocaine does.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo  patients will be randomised to receive either 20ml of 0.9% saline which is expected to have no analgesic effect (placebo) or 20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine (local anaesthetic)The method of administration  by ultrasound guided injection under aseptic conditions will be identical for placebo and local anaesthetic.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be informed of the study by one of the nurses and given an information sheet. If interested in participation, one of the doctors who would perform the procedure will explain further and obtain consent for inclusion. The consent form includes an abbreviated mental test (score greater than seven required) and a separate three question assessment of capacity to consent. Numbered syringes will be prepared in advance by the pharmacy department. These will all contain either 20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine or 20ml of 0.9% saline. The syringes will not be marked regarding their contents. These are both clear, colourless liquids with no odour and minimal discomfort on injection. They will be stored in refridgeration in the Emergency department for up to 4 weeks. The contents of each syringe will only become known to investigators in the analysis of data, well after the 16 hours of follow-up for each patient. The researcher taking the next syringe from refridgeration will have no way of knowing which solution it contains.</concealment>
    <sequence>The pharmacy department will make up the syringes in batches of 20 â€“ each containing 10 of saline and 10 of bupivacaine. These will be numbered with a computer generated random number. The list with details of which syringes contained which solution will be kept secret until after data on primary and secondary outcomes is collated. The randomisation process is done prior to preparation of the syringes.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is of pain relief for people with a broken hip (fractured neck of femur) in the period between arriving at the Emergency Department and having an operation. Standard treatment of pain is by injections of morphine as required. This study will look at injecting long acting local anaesthetic to the nerves which supply the hip. An ultrasound machine will be used to accurately place the injection. It is hoped that this will give better pain relief than morphine alone with less side effects of nausea and drowsiness. The local anaesthetic is expected to last about 18 hours. This will cover the period from the Emergency Department to Operating Theatre for many patients. Doctors, Nurses and Patients will not know whether local anaesthetic or a saline placebo has been injected. All patients will be given as much morphine as is necessary to control their pain.</summary>
