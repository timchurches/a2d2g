  <interventions>
    <interventions>A aged care facility staff member will apply 1ml of pure essential lavender oil to the participant's forearm on 3 occasions over one week. In the following week the participant will be exposed to the comparator treatment on 3 occasions.</interventions>
    <comparator>A aged care facility staff member will apply 1ml of Jojoba (neutral)/placebo oil to the participant's forearm on three occasions over one week. In the following week the participant will be exposed to the active treatment on 3 occasions.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One or two physically agitated behaviours will be recorded as present or absent during one minute intervals over a 90 minute period. The target behaviours will be established by interviewing an aged care faciltity staff member who is familiar to the participant using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations will commence 30 minutes prior to intervention and continue for 60 minutes post intervention. For each minute the presence or absence of the chosen target behaviours will be recorded.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Affect</outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations will commence 30 minutes prior to intervention and continue for 60 minutes post intervention. For each minute the predominant type of affect is recorded.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical and verbal agitation</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of each week over the 2 week intervention period, the frequency of physical and/or verbal agitation will be noted by an interview with a staff member from the aged care facility using the CMAI.</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A participant needs to be in the aged care facility for at least 3 months, have a history of dementia, and be stable re: medical, psychologicial and medication regime.  Also agitated (physical behaviours) should occur several times an hour on a daily basis and are not associated with nursing activities ie Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).  The behaviours are also not due to pain, physical illness, depression or psychosis.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will use an efficient, economical design with random allocation to treatment or control conditions followed by cross-over.
The allocation of the treatment arms will conducted by an independent senior researcher who is not involved in the determining a subject's eligibility for inclusion to the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation is conducted by an experienced, independent Research Fellow who is not associated with the eligibility, observations or outcomes of the study. Participants are exposed to lavender or control condition in a random order (A-B or B-A).   The senior researcher will generate random numbers using Microsoft Excel Random Generator software. When the participant falls due for randomisation she will allocate to sequence A-B if the number is even and B-A if odd.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>To ensure the staff member is blinded to the smell of the condition, the facility staff member will apply a masking cream to his/her top lip and wear a nose clip before applying the oil.  The researchers will also be blinded to the condition by ensuring they also regularly apply a masking cream prior to and during the observation period.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project is investigating the effectiveness of pure, high strength lavender oil in reducing physical agitiation in persons with dementia who are residing in aged care facilities.  If our results demonstrate the efficacy of lavender oil it will potentially provide a safer and more pleasant treatment option for agitation rather than reliance on pharmacology alone</summary>
