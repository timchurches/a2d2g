    <studytitle>Too much, too soon? The impact of treatment-focused genetic testing in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, will those who receive educational materials about treatment-focused genetic testing experience outcomes (including anxiety, depression, decisional conflict, knowledge of treatment-focused genetic testing, uptake of genetic testing and/or surgery choice) that are no worse than in patients who undergo standard familial cancer centre consultation only.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A brief pamphlet about treatment-focused genetic testing (TFGT) for breast cancer will be posted to women allocated to the intervention group once the baseline questionnaire is complete (about one week after diagnosis). Information covered includes:
- what is TFGT
- why do TFGT
- how the test is done
- implications of test results</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard familial cancer centre consultation. This normally occurs about two weeks after diagnosis and takes about one hour. Topics that may be discussed include breast and ovarian cancer risk, genetic testing, the implications for self and family.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Through a non-inferiority trial we will test the hypothesis that patient outcomes (anxiety, depression, decisional conflict, knowledge of treatment-focused genetic testing, uptake of genetic testing and/or surgery choice) will be no worse in the intervention group compared to the control group. Anxiety and depression will be assessed using the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, decisional conflict will be assessed using the validated Decisional Conflict Scale, knowledge will be assessed using a purposely developed 10 item questionnaire that has been piloted, and uptake will be acertained from medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At diagnosis, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 58 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Women who opt for treatment-focused genetic testing will have a higher uptake of bilateral mastectomy compared to data from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Breast Cancer Audit on over 12,000 women with early breast cancer diagnosed annually. Medical records will be accessed retrospectively to obtain data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after diagnosis</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Women aged between 18 and &lt;50 years with early or locally advanced breast cancer will be eligible if they exhibit at least one of the following risk features:
1. A strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, that is There are now (with the new diagnosis) three or more close relatives on one side of the family with breast or ovarian cancer OR There are now (with the new diagnosis) at least two close relatives on one side of the family with breast or ovarian cancer PLUS a high-risk feature (breast cancer diagnosed before the
age of 40, bilateral breast cancer, breast  and ovarian cancer in the same woman, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, breast cancer in a male relative)

OR

2. No or minimal family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer AND presence of Bilateral breast cancer AND/OR Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry AND/OR Triple negative breast cancer (oestrogen and progesterone receptor and Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative tumour)</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Women who have already had genetic counselling at a Familial Cancer Clinic (FCC) and/or testing will

    <concealment>Eligible women will be invited to the study by their treating breast surgeon (if possible) at their post-operative consultation when results and treatment plan are discussed. Women will be told that the study is comparing different methods of patient education about treatment-focused genetic testing (TFGT), in which they will also be offered the opportunity to undergo TFGT.Women will be made aware that a decision about whether or not to have TFGT is not urgent, but may be most useful if undertaken before a decision is made to have radiotherapy. Preliminary verbal consent to participate in the study and to be contacted by telephone by the Research Co-Ordinator (RO) will be sought by the surgeon.Women will be offered a choice of completing web-based or mailed hard copy questionnaires. Women who agree to participate in the study will be asked to complete the 1st questionnaire. On receipt of the completed baseline questionnaire, women will be randomised to either the intervention (EM) or the control (standard FCC consultation) group using a standard randomisation program, thereby ensuring allocation concealment. Blinding of staff to the allocation status of each patient is not possible; however, procedures will be put in place to minimise, and monitor for,  potential bias.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at different ways of presenting information to women who are considering whether to have genetic testing around the time they are diagnosed with breast cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are a woman who has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, and you have a high risk of inherited breast cancer and you are interested in genetic testing. 

Trial details 
Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive information about treatment-focused genetic testing (TFGT) in a face-to-face standard care consultation at a familial- cancer clinic (control), while the second group (intervention) will receive a brief educational pamphlet. Participants take part in four surveys assessing outcomes over 12 months. All participants will be offered the opportunity to have genetic testing and to discuss their results with a genetics specialist. 

The study aims to find the best way to deliver information about TFGT because this testing may be offered more routinely in the future and the results can influence treatment, including the type of surgery undertaken.</summary>
