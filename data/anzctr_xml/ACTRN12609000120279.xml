  <interventions>
    <interventions>18F-Fluoride PET/CT is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging examination which involves intravenous injection of an isotope tracer (with a dosage of 7.0 mCi +/- 10%) followed by a whole-body scan of approximate 20 minutes (with the patient in the supine position). The participant will receive this examination one time which will take a total duration of less than 2 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence or absence of bony metastasis as assessed by histological proof and/or clinical follow-up by the attending professional oncologist at out-patient clinic every 3 months with the aid of related imaging examinations such as X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and traditional bone scan (which is different from the 18F-Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as described in the intervention field) at the attending professional oncologist's discretion</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed every 3 months post-intervention until 1 year for each participant (this outcome is not measured at baseline)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study is to assess the accuracy and impact of a new examination (18F-Fluoride PET/CT) for detecting bony metastasis in cancer patients with high risk of bony metastasis or suspicious/equivocal findings for bony metastasis by conventional studies. The hypothesis to be confirmed in the current study is that the new examination (18F-Fluoride PET/CT) is beneficial for these patients and can give clinical oncologists more accurate diagnosis.</summary>
