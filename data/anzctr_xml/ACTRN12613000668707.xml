    <interventions>Resourceful Adolescent Parent Program (RAP-P) plus Routine Care. RAP-P is a strengths-based family education program developed to build resilience and promote positive mental health in adolescents. This interactive psycho-education program consists of four x 2 hour face-to-face sessions with a therapist that were conducted weekly or fortnightly depending on parents availability to attend. The sessions involve an introduction to, and information about self-injurious behaviour , identification of parental strengths, information and strategies around adolescent development, and the provision of strategies to promote family harmony and manage conflict. Those undergoing the RAP-P also receive Routine Care as per the control group. Routine care consisted of any intervention deemed necessary by the adolescents treating team other than the family intervention program trialled in this study. This includes combinations of crisis management, safety planning, individual psycho-education, non-specific counselling, supportive therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy and pharmacological treatment. The duration of the intervention phase was 4-8 weeks depending on session frequency with a follow-up assessment taking place 6 months after the intervention. </interventions>
