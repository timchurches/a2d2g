  <interventions>
    <interventions>This pilot study will utilise a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of omega-3 supplementation in 50 men who have been convicted of violent crimes in NSW.  Upon entry into the study, participants will be randomised into either the treatment (n=25) or placebo (n=25) arm of the study. 

Treatment
Participants enrolled in the study will take 5 x 1gm capsules orally per day for three months.  Those receiving the active treatment will receive 5 x 1g fish oil capsules, containing a total of 3000mg LC-omega-3 FA (2000mg EPA, 1000mg DHA) taken once daily for 3 months.

Adherence will be assessed using both direct questioning by the research assistant, pill counting, and erythrocyte omega-3 content based on blood omega-3 levels. Participants will be required to return empty medication packs at the follow-up assessments (6 and 12 weeks) and asked to provide a blood sample at baseline and 12 weeks for measurement of omega-3 content in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids. Participants will also be asked during the follow-up phone calls how many days they have missed taking their capsules.  Participants will also be asked to return the capsules at each face-to-face meeting with the research assistant, the remaining number of capsules will then be counted.
 </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo

The placebo capsules hold the equivalent amount of oil to the fish oil capsules (1g/capsule) but are negligible LC-omega-3 FAs.  All capsules will be matched in appearance, 
and are encased with an enteric coating which is extremely efficient at dampening the flavour of the contents. </comparator>

    <concealment>This pilot study will utilise a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial of omega 3 supplementation in 50 men who have been convicted of violent crimes in NSW.  Upon entry into the study, participants will be randomised into either the treatment (n=25) or placebo (n=25) arm of the study. The randomisation and manufacturing of capsules will be by a TGA-approved manufacturer of clinical trial products. Research assistants interviewing and administering the capsules will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Allocation will be concealed by numbered containers, randomisation by computer, and the holder of the allocation schedule is off site.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed by a TGA approved manufacturer of clinical trial products. Permuted block randomisation will be used to allocate subjects into different groups (treatment arms).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were based on several studies conducted in populations highly comparable to our proposed sample. Gesch (2002), Hamazaki (1997, 2005) Hallahan (2007).  Stong empirical evidence of 24 substance abusers in a community based sample demonstrated statistical significance to medication adherence. (Buydens-Branchey)</statisticalmethods>
