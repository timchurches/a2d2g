      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Virologic Failure - Virologic failure was defined as:
On-treatment virologic failure:
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA = LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently = LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)

Confirmed HCV RNA = LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at last on-treatment visit</outcome>

    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (EpclusaÂ®; SOF/VEL) with ribavirin (RBV) for 24 weeks
      in adults with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who participated in a prior Gilead
      sponsored study and did not achieve sustained virologic response (SVR).</summary>
