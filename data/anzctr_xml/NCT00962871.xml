    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Early Changes in Viral Sequence Associated With Viral Suppression - Viral sequence data was obtained from the first 10 participants enrolled in Study but on analysis of the data, numerous low frequency deviations from the HBV consensus sequences were observed in the 454 SLX sequence data which were not replicated in data obtained from routine Sanger sequencing. These sequence deviations did not correspond to a temporal pattern consistent with selection of mutations following HBV treatment. Moreover, they could not be reliably distinguished from sequencing artifacts. It was also revealed that complete genome coverage was not obtained due to errors in the design of the primer sequences. For these reasons, further sequence analyses were not performed for the remaining treatment population.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, randomized, parallel-arm study will assess the early immunologic response in
      treatment-na√Øve Asian male patients with chronic hepatitis B after initiation of treatment
      with Pegasys or tenofovir or Pegasys plus tenofovir. Patients will be randomized to one of 4
      cohorts to receive either Pegasys (360mcg subcutaneously weekly) or tenofovir (300mg orally
      daily) or both or no treatment for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks on study treatment, patients may
      opt to receive standard of care treatment with Pegasys. Target sample size is &lt;50.</summary>
