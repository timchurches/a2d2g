  <interventions>
    <interventions>STUDY POPULATION:
All non-cardiac surgery patients with an in-hospital episode of new-onset post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF) (i.e. admitted to hospital in sinus rhythm; no AF history); AND reversion or successful cardioversion to sinus rhythm prior to discharge; AND age &gt;or= 40 years. Patients must be able to provide informed consent. Patients will be excluded if they are non-English speaking; or have insufficient cognitive capacity for the consent and interview process; or are unable to be contacted in the post-discharge period

INTERVENTION:
All consenting patients will receive approximately 10 minutes of AF education from the research cardiac nurse, during their inpatient stay. The education will be one-on-one, and will specifically cover what AF is, the associated health risks (particularly stroke), AF symptoms, and AF treatment. Patients will be offered the choice of either a 2-page education handout from the Australian Atrial fibrillation Association (i.e. AF Fact sheet: http://www.atrialfibrillation-au.org/files/file/Publications/02082013%20AFA%20Australia%20Atrial%20Fibrillation%20-%20(P).pdf); or a more detailed 15-page handout from the Australian National Heart Foundation (https://heartfoundation.org.au/images/uploads/publications/CON-175_Atrial_Fibrillation_WEB.PDF).

Participants will also be provided with a handheld smartphone ECG device called the Kardia (AliveCor) Heart monitor which is an approved medical device (ARTG Identifier 208100). The Kardia Heart monitor is a special cover that attaches to a smartphone, which enables a single lead ECG reading to be taken using an application on the smartphone. Participants will be taught how to record their own ECG recording. 

Following hospital discharge, participants will commence recording an ECG ~5 times/day, continuing for four weeks. Recordings will be spread out through the day at times suitable to the participant (e.g. Immediately before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep). Participants experiencing symptoms possibly due to AF (including palpitations, dizziness and syncope) will record these in a diary and perform additional ECG recordings.

Each ECG will be analysed by the validated on-device algorithm to give them a rhythm diagnosis. If possible AF is diagnosed, the participant will take additional ECG recordings, and contact their treating doctor for review as soon as practicable. Each ECG recording automatically transmits to a secure server. All ECG data on the server are coded for each participant and therefore are not identifiable by a third party. The research assistant will review each ECG and the algorithm diagnosis, and will contact participants to ensure they have appropriately followed up any abnormal ECGs with their treating general practitioner. 

FOLLOW UP:
A follow-up assessment will be performed 4 weeks post hospital discharge. On completion, a letter summarising the participants specific outcomes will be sent to their treating doctors. The participant will also be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews to explore their experience using the handheld ECG and factors related to future sustainability. All participants will receive a final follow-up phone call at 3 months.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified from the surgical wards by the research assistant.  The research assistant will assess eligibility against the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and approach all eligible participants during their in-patient stay. The study and the commitment involved will be clearly described in lay terms. Potential participants will be afforded every opportunity to ask questions about the study without prejudice, and to choose whether or not to participate. Participation in the study is entirely voluntary and choosing not to participate will not in any way affect any future treatment. There are no rewards or incentives for participation in the study. 

The participant will be enrolled into the study after the informed consent process has been completed. 

As this is a pre-post study and all participants will receive the intervention, there will be no randomisation and the study will not be blinded.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary analyses will be conducted using SPSS for Windows (Version 22.0). New episodes of AF will be expressed as true positives divided by total number screened with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Chi-squared tests will be used to compare new cases by gender and to identify associations between AF incidence and age-group or AF risk factors.  AF knowledge level will be compared pre- and post-intervention using paired t-tests. Continuous variables will be reported as means +/- standard deviations (SD), and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. Within subject differences between baseline and follow-up will be analysed using Wilcoxon signed ranks tests for non-parametric variables (two tailed p&lt; 0.05 considered significant). 

As the primary outcome is feasibility and acceptability, a power calculation was not performed. A sample size of 50 participants (with POAF) was chosen to maximise the probability of reaching data saturation during thematic analysis of the interviews and during review of process measures such as reasons for declining participation. Analysis will be limited to complete cases to avoid artificially increasing precision around the estimates by imputing values or carrying baseline values forward. As the study is a pilot study no interim analyses are anticipated. Interview data will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using general interpretive methods. Transcripts will be reviewed independently for general themes by two researchers and consensus reached.

QUALITATIVE: A detailed process evaluation will be undertaken to better appreciate factors that might influence sustainability beyond the trial setting.  After each participant completes the program, a process evaluation will be performed related to participants experiences with the iECG. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted addressing the ease of use of the iECG, and the benefits and challenges of the program. The process evaluation interview will be audio-taped to ensure accurate transcription of the information, with the written consent of the participant. The audio recording will be transcribed verbatim in a non-identifiable form and the recording deleted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common abnormal heart rhythm occurring after surgery. Post-operative AF following cardiac surgery is associated with adverse outcomes including death, prolonged hospital stay, and increased risk of severe stroke both pre- and post-discharge. 

Postoperative AF after general surgery has been little studied, and is potentially more important given the estimated 200 million procedures carried out annually worldwide. Postoperative AF patients, discharged home in normal heart rhythm, have 5 times the stroke risk of those without postoperative AF. After cardiac surgery, patients frequently attend cardiac rehabilitation, and are routinely followed by cardiac surgeons and cardiologists. The same support and oversight is seldom available after non-cardiac surgery,

We predict that if AF recurrence is identified early after discharge, strokes can be prevented by effective treatment. Currently, monitoring for recurrence falls mostly on the patient recognising AF symptoms. Unfortunately, AF recurrence is largely asymptomatic or has non-specific symptoms confused with normal recovery after an operation and therefore unlikely to be identified by the patient.

We hypothesise that patients can self-identify early recurrent postoperative AF post-discharge, by taking multiple daily recordings for a month using a simple handheld smartphone ECG which provides an accurate, immediate AF diagnosis. Before commencing a larger expensive trial it is necessary to test the feasibility of the intervention, and provide an estimate of the rate of symptomatic and asymptomatic postoperative AF recurrence after general surgery. Results from this feasibility study will inform and refine the design of a larger intervention study.

The primary aims of this study are to provide data regarding the feasibility of patient self-monitoring for AF recurrence post discharge using an iECG, including acceptability and compliance with the intervention. The secondary end-points relate to the incidence of post-operative AF following non-cardiac surgery, and the incidence of AF recurrence following discharge.

This cross sectional feasibility study will recruit 50 patients with new-onset post-operative AF following non-cardiac surgery, who have returned to normal sinus rhythm prior to discharge. These participants will be provided with a handheld smartphone; and will record an ECG ~5 times/day, for four weeks. 

Participants experiencing possible AF symptoms will keep a diary of these and perform additional ECG recordings. Each ECG is analysed by the on-device algorithm. If possible AF is diagnosed, the participant will take additional ECG recordings, and contact their treating doctor for review as soon as practicable. The research assistant will review each ECG and the algorithm diagnosis, and will contact participants to ensure they have appropriately followed up any abnormal ECGs.</summary>
