  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a viral infection of the skin most common on the body, arms, and legs. About one in six children aged one to ten years are infected at some time with MC. Individual lesions go away on their own but only after 6 months to 5 years. Treatment is not always necessary but may be sought for a variety of reasons such as bleeding, secondary infections, itching and discomfort, or for social reasons. There are several treatments, but they are not very effective and can also be painful and expensive. There is some evidence that manuka honey may be beneficial although it has never been studied in this condition before. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of topical manuka honey treatment with simple observation in a group of children with MC</summary>
