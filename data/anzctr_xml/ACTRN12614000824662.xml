    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics for primary outcome measure.  Results will be stratified according to volume of fluid administered (nil, 20ml/kg, 40ml/kg, &gt;40ml/kg) to determine if there is attenuation in response with larger cumulative volumes of fluid administered. Percentage change in stroke volume will be plotted over time and median duration of effect calculated. Secondary outcomes- IVC collapsibility index prior to fluid bolus administration will be calculated and compared with the percentage change in stroke volume following fluid bolus therapy. Lung ultrasound score will be compared pre and post fluid bolus administration, and compared to respiratory outcome at 24 hours. Change in vital signs following fluid bolus administration will be calculated. Pearson correlation co-efficient will be used to determine the correlation between total volume of bolus fluid administered and change in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and capillary refill) and change in respiratory status (respiratory rate, respiratory effort, and lung ultrasound score) before and after fluid bolus administration. Pearson correlation co-efficient will also be used to determine the correlation between median change in stroke volume and change in vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and capillary refill) and change in respiratory status (respiratory rate, respiratory effort, and lung ultrasound score) before and after fluid bolus administration. To detect a 10% change in stroke volume (estimated standard deviation of 20%) with a power of 80% and a type 1 error rate of 0.05, by using a 2-sided t-test, we calculated that 48 patients would be required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>: This PhD study is an observational cohort study of fluid resuscitation in children with severe sepsis. The primary aim is to determine the effect (both in size and duration) of fluid bolus therapy on stroke volume in children with severe sepsis. Secondary aims include: the ability if IVC ultrasound to predict fluid responsiveness; the ability of lung ultrasound to detect early harms from fluid bolus administration; and the correlation between fluid bolus administration and changes in vital signs. </summary>
