  <interventions>
    <interventions>Vapour (steam) is infused into a targeted emphysematous lung segment for approximately 3-10 seconds. Up to 3 lung segments from one lung lobe, either the right or left upper lobes, will be treated in one procedure. Patients will receive a prescribed amount of vapour (target vapour dose) delivered to the identified lung segments of 10 calories per gram of lung tissue. The total time of the BTVA procedure is expected to be&lt; 45 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: Pulmonary function via Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) equal or greater than 12% as measured by plethysmography and spirometry</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: Quality of Life (QOL) via St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) improvement equal or greater than 4 point score reduction</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: The occurrence and frequency of serious and non-serious adverse events following BTVA treatment. Examples of adverse effects may include respiratory infection and increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) related symptoms. These are measured by blood analysis and occurrence of multiple patient symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be assessed at Week 1, Week 2, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12 following BTVA treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulmonary Function: increase in functional residual capacity (FRC); decrease in total lung capacity (TLC), decrease in residual volume (RV); increase in carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity (DLCO). These outcomes will be assessed by plethysmography and spirometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in exercise capacity as assessed by the 2-minute walk test following BTVA treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in dyspnoea score by the modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC) following BTVA treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evidence of lung volume reduction by radiograph and/or computerized tomography (CT) scan following BTVA treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 and 6 months following BTVA treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
