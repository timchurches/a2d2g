    <interventions>Colchicine 0.5mg tablet taken orally each day for the duration of the trial, It is expected that some participants randomized earlier in the trial will receive treatment for up to 5 years, whereas others randomized later in the trial will likely be on the trial medication for 2 years. In an intention to treat trial, participation continues until the requisite number of primary events have occurred or earlier, should a participant choose to cease the trial medication or the DSMB suggest that the trial be ceased for any other reason    
Adherence will be determined by questionnaire every 6 months at the time of collection of the new supply of the trial medication, No serum levels of colchicine metabolites are being measured</interventions>

Open label run in period: Participants who are enrolled in the study will trial open label colchicine for 30 days to determine their tolerance to therapy. During this time the Cardiologist and the participant know that active treatment is being administered

Randomization: Only patients who are tolerant of therapy will be randomised into the study. Randomisation will be double blinded. The names of participants who are tolerant to therapy will be allocated to either study arm by the holder of the allocation schedule who is off site at the central administrative office located in the Heart Research Insistuite.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>LoDoCo2 is an event-driven trial powered to detect a 30% reduction (HR 0.7) in the primary composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal acute coronary syndrome and non-fatal ischemic stroke. This effect size is beyond the upper limit of the confidence interval of the HR of the initial LoDoCo trial (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 - 0.59) but still clinically meaningful.  Based upon these assumptions, and an expected annual primary event rate of 3.5% in the control group, it is estimated that 331 primary events will need to accrue in order to detect such an effect with &gt;90% power (two sided alpha level of 0.05).  The trial aims at 4700 screened patients, leading to 4230 randomised (divided over both continents) and an expected mean follow-up of 3 years

Data analysis:
Summary statistics Summary statistics, including mean and standard deviation will be calculated for all baseline characteristics by treatment arm. All time to event outcomes will be calculated in days by subtracting the date of randomisation from either: 1) the date of event or death; or 2) the trial termination date for those patients not experiencing the defined event. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. The intention-to-treat analysis will include all randomised subjects and all events during the time from randomisation to the trial termination. The trial termination will be fixed by the DSMB as described above. The time-to-first-event for all outcomes will be presented using a KaplanMeier plot.  The primary efficacy outcome will be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model including treatment group coded as control or colchicine. Other outcomes will be analysed similarly. In addition, the primary analysis can be stratified by baseline characteristics
