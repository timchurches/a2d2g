  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Optimal management of chronic mechanical neck pain (CMNP) still represents a challenge for both clinician and researchers. Based on the current literature, it could be argued that optimal intervention may not exists because of the lack of accepted causative mechanisms of CMNP. Rehabilitative management of CMNP patients is usually performed in an outpatient facility, and is often based on a prescription-oriented (Pr-O) therapy. With this term, we intend the use of different therapeutic modalities (e.g. exercise, manipulation, physical therapies) usually prescribed at first medical referral on the basis of actual physical status, and never changed and/or adjusted during the whole treatment period. As a possible counter-party, a patient-oriented (Pa-O) therapy would ideally be scheduled for each patient at the beginning of each therapeutic session and based on his current physical status, thereby being similar to that prospected for severe disabilities, such as post-stroke hemiplegia. We hypothsize that a Pa-O approach may be more effective, in terms of pain management, than a Pr-O one in CMNP suffers.</summary>
