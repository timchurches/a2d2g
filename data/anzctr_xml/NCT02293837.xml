  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease. Based on previous research, study
      doctors think that giving medicines to affect the immune system soon after diabetes is
      diagnosed may stop, delay or decrease the destruction of beta cells, resulting in better
      glucose control.

      Researchers believe that tocilizumab could have some effect on the cells in the immune system
      that are thought to be involved in the development of type 1 diabetes. This study will test
      whether tocilizumab can help preserve or delay destruction of remaining beta cells in people
      recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes.</summary>
