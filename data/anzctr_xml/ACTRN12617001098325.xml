  <interventions>
    <interventions>This comparative effectiveness trial will compare two different classes of footwear:

Flat flexible shoes- selected from commercially available footwear, that fulfill previously published criteria for flat  flexible shoes (Paterson et al, 2017, Osteoarthritis &amp; Cartilage). These criteria are: 1) heel height of less than 15mm; 2) shoe pitch of less than 10mm; 3) absence of arch support or motion control; 4) have "minimal" rigidity (Barton et al. 2009, J Foot Ankle Res); and 5) weigh 200g or less (+/-10%). Measurements are based on a size 9 US Men's and size 9 US Women's. Participants in this group will choose two pairs of shoes from a selection of available shoes that fulfil the above criteria. As footwear manufacturers frequently change shoe models from season to season and year to year, we expect that shoes readily available at trial commencement will cease to be available during the course of the trial, or will be relaunched/rebranded with a different shoe name. In such instances, shoes will be replaced by a similar pair of commercially available shoes that fulfil the listed criteria.

Stable supportive shoes- selected from commercially available footwear, that fulfil previously published criteria for stable supportive shoes (Paterson et al, 2017,Osteoarthritis &amp; Cartilage). These criteria are:  1) heel height of greater than 30mm; 2) shoe pitch of greater than 10mm; 3) presence of arch support or motion control; 4) have "rigid" rigidity (Barton et al. 2009, J Foot Ankle Res); and 5) weigh more than 300g (+/-10%). Measurements are based on a size 9 US Men's and size 9 US Women's. Participants in this group will choose two pairs of shoes from a selection of available shoes that fulfil the above criteria. As footwear manufacturers frequently change shoe models from season to season and year to year, we expect that shoes readily available at trial commencement will cease to be available during the course of the trial, or will be relaunched/rebranded with a different shoe name. In such instances, shoes will be replaced by a similar pair of commercially available shoes that fulfil the listed criteria.

The shoes will be provided at the University of Melbourne Human Movement Laboratory by one of the researchers experienced in the fitting shoes for participants in a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be asked to wear any combination of their 2 pairs of study shoes for at least 6 hours per day for the study duration of 6 months.

Participants will be provided with an information sheet regarding how to get used to wearing the shoes and will also complete a log book once per month where they will record the number of hours each day they wore each pair of their study shoes for a one week period (the fourth week of the month).</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated to either 1) Flat Flexible shoes; or 2) Stable Supportive shoes. Prior to randomization, participants will not be told about the types of footwear being investigated in the study, nor the hypotheses under investigation to reduce bias. Once allocated to a group, participants will also not be told the distinguishing features of their shoes in comparison to the other group.

A researcher not involved in recruitment, enrollment or collection of primary/secondary outcome measures, will allocate participants to a group, using a computer program.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be prepared by the biostatistician stratified by Kellgren &amp; Lawrence (KL) x-ray grade (3 or 4). The schedule will be stored on a password-protected website (REDCap) maintained by a researcher not involved in either participant recruitment or administration of primary/secondary outcome measures.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We aim to detect the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) on primary outcomes between groups (1.8 (out of 10) for NRS pain and 6 (out of 68) for WOMAC function). We assume between-subject SDs of 2.7 and 11.4, and baseline to 6-month correlations of 0.21 and 0.39 for pain and function respectively (data from our footwear trial in similar sample). Using ANCOVA adjusted for baseline score, we need 46 per arm to achieve 90% power to detect MCID in pain and 65 per arm for function. Allowing for 20% attrition, we will recruit 82 people per arm (n=164).

A biostatistician will analyse blinded data. Main comparative analyses between groups will be performed using intention-to-treat. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data. For the primary hypothesis, differences in mean change in pain and function (baseline minus follow-up) will be compared between groups using linear regression modelling adjusted for baseline values and the stratifying variable of KL grade. Similar analyses will be conducted for continuous secondary outcomes.  Improvement based on global change will be compared across groups using risk differences, calculated from fitted logistic regression models. A sensitivity analysis will estimate treatment effects assuming full adherence, using a two-stage least squares approach. Effects of patient characteristics on outcomes will be explored by including relevant terms in models. Standard diagnostic plots will be used to check model assumptions. 

To assess whether the effect of shoe type on the primary outcomes is moderated by any of KL grade, Foot posture index (FPI) score, body mass or baseline score on the KOOS patellofemoral pain and OA subscale, appropriate interaction terms between randomised group and each of these variables will be included in regression models for the primary outcomes, for each potential effect modifier separately. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis is a major problem in Australia and there is no cure for the disease. Non-drug strategies that help people to self-manage the condition are needed. Different types of shoes influence forces acting across the knee joint. We know that increased knee forces can contribute to the knee pain associated with knee osteoarthritis, and that high forces can increase the risk of the disease worsening over time. It is recommended that clinicians provide advice on appropriate footwear for people with knee osteoarthritis. However, there is little evidence from clinical trials to determine which shoes are best for self-managing knee osteoarthritis.

We are conducting a research study to compare two classes of readily available off-the-shelf shoes on knee osteoarthritis symptoms. To do this, we will allocate people via a random process into two different groups. Participants in each group will be provided with 2 pairs of different shoes to wear daily for 6 months. To ensure that this is a fair and unbiased evaluation, we will not disclose the differences in the shoe classes between the two groups until the end of the study. There will be an equal number of participants in each group, and participants will not be able to choose which group they are in.

The findings of this study will help determine which shoes are best for people with knee osteoarthritis and will guide clinicians in providing appropriate evidence-based footwear advice for their patients. The findings of this study will be published in medical journals and be presented at conferences.</summary>
