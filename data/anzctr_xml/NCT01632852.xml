Experimental: CSL362 - See Intervention Description


Other interventions: CSL362
CSL362 is humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha chain of the interleukin 3 receptor (IL3Ra; also known as CD123) and is optimised for enhanced activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via natural killer cells.
CSL362 is a sterile solution for injection and will be administered by intravenous infusion to subjects in sequential, escalating dose level cohorts, at doses up to 12.0 mg/kg. CSL362 will be administered every 14 days for a total of 6 infusions per subject. The 6 infusions for each individual subject will contain the same dose of CSL362.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) - Number of subjects reporting any AEs and the severity of those AEs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the first treatment (Day 1) up to approximately Day 106</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation - Number of participants with DLT.
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:
A non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or worse.
A hematological toxicity grade 3 that does not recover to baseline within 14 days.
A hematological toxicity grade 4 or worse according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the first treatment (Day 1) up to approximately Day 106</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters - PK Parameters comprise:
Area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) from time point zero (before dosing):
to the time point at which the analyte first returns to baseline (AUC0-last)
to a meaningful time after infusion (AUC0-y)
extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-8).
The maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax).
First time to reach maximum concentration in serum (Tmax).
Terminal serum half-life (t 1/2)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before each infusion and: at 6 time points within a week after infusion 1, at 1 time point within a week after infusions 2 to 5, at 5 time points within a week after infusion 6, and once at the final visit, approximately 5 weeks after infusion 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects developing antibodies against CSL362</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the first treatment (Day 1) up to approximately Day 106</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
