      <outcome>Attendance for cardiovascular risk assessment to the patient's GP
An attendance slip is generated when the risk assessment is performed by the GP.  The slip is collected by research staff during regular visits to particpating practices.
The risk assessment is confirmed when the medical record of consenting patients are audited 3-9 months after patients attend for their risk asessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome is assessed when it occurs. Patients are allowed 6 months in which to attend their GP for a risk assessment.  The visit is confirmed by a medical record audit that occurs within 3-9 months of the visit.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Concealed allocation
Practice databases were searched to identify patients aged 40-75 years without diagnosed heart disease.  GPs reviewed the patient list to exclude those with serious illness, language barriers, or any other reason at the discretion of the GP.  The list was further limited to include only one patient per household, by alternately selecting a male or female patient from a shared address. Within each practice eligible patients were allocated a number between 1 and 150 using a random number table.   
An independant researcher at a central location determined that patients with numbers 1-60 were assigned to the intervention arm. Patients with numbers 61-150 were assigned to the control arm. Assignment was weighted to the control arm (3:2) because a lower participation rate was expected in this arm. 
 Patients were sent a letter of invitation to participate in the trial, and to attend their GP for cardiovascular risk assessment.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this pilot trial is to explore the effectiveness of a patient incentive for attendance for cardiovascular risk assessment in general practice.  Our hypothesis is that a patient incentive will be effective in encouraging attendance for cardiovascular risk assessment in general practice.  Strategies to increase attendance for risk assessment are a first step toward improved prevention of heart disease in general practice.</summary>
