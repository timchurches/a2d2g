  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will undergo Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) followed by total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 12 months later or after 20% loss of baseline body weight if this occurs earlier.
LAGB is a single procedure that involves placing a silicone band around the top of the stomach. The band has a balloon on its inner surface. The balloon is connected by tubing to an access port placed under the skin.  Saline can be injected into the port to make the band tighter or removed to make it less tight. Doing this assists with  control of appetite. If the band is adjusted optimally, there should be very little hunger, there is loss of interest in food and a tendency to eat less amounts, less often. The procedure is performed laparoscopically, sometimes known as keyhole surgery. It is performed under a general anaesthetic and takes about 30 minutes.
TKA is also a single surgical procedure whereby the diseased knee joint is replaced with artificial one. The knee is a hinge joint which provides motion at the point where the thigh meets the lower leg. During a total knee replacement, the end of the thigh (femur) bone is removed and replaced with a metal shell. The end of the lower leg bone (tibia) is also removed and replaced with a channelled plastic piece with a metal stem. Depending on the condition of the kneecap portion of the knee joint, a plastic "button" may also be added under the kneecap surface. The procedure is performed under either a general or spinal anaesthetic and takes about 1 hour</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be a composite of (i) death from any cause; (ii) peri-operative complications (medical or surgical); (iii) post-operative complications (medical or surgical) that result in a delay in discharge, eg: fracture, neuropraxia, sepsis, nosocomial infection, myocardial infarction, bowel obstruction, venous thrombo-embolic event (VTE), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), renal failure; (iv) wound complications (breakdown, infections, haematomas, dehiscence); (v) joint infections (Centres for Disease Control definitions applied); and (vi) unplanned procedures and/or readmissions in the first 12 months following TKA.
The processes for identifying outcomes will be conducted by a Project Research Officer who will be blinded to the intervention allocation. Active surveillance for outcomes will comprise the following:
-Recording of data regarding patient demographics (sex, age and country of birth), co-morbidities, and anaesthetic and surgery details on the day of surgery. 
-Attendance at all unit ward rounds to capture complications and readmissions
-Attendance at X-ray meetings to capture technical complications of surgery
-Review of all medical records on patient discharge and follow-up at each outpatients review
-Recording of alignment of all post-operative full-leg standing radiographs
-Phone calls to participants at 3-monthly intervals
-Retrieval and review of records from other healthcare institutions as required 
The Project Officer will collate information on all possible primary outcomes of interest for review by an outcomes verification panel comprising at least 4 independent clinicians blinded to the patient's intervention allocation. The panel will include at least 2 peri-operative physicians and 2 orthopaedic surgeons. Ascertainment of outcomes will be undertaken according to review against strict criteria (to be determined and endorsed by the panel).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Arthroplasty and Bariatric Surgery (ABS) study intends to examine the clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness of preceding total knee replacement (TJR) with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).
This will be a 4 year multi-institutional randomized controlled trial in severely obese patients with end stage osteoarthritis.  The study will recruit 120 severely obese people with osteoarthritis who are on the waiting list for TKR and randomly allocate them to receive the current standard of care for TKR or a combination of LAGB followed by TKR.  We plan to measure weight loss, pain and function, quality of life and complications, as well as the cost effectiveness of a strategy that combines LAGB +TKR, compared to TKR alone. Participants will all be followed for one year at which time the benefits in terms of, weight loss, clinical and health improvements, adverse events and costs would be measured.</summary>
