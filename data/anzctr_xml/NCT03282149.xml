  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female, between 18 and 90 years of age, inclusive

          2. Sufficiently severe osteoarthritis of the knee to require/have recommended knee
             replacement surgery or be unsuitable for knee replacement surgery based on
             co-morbidities or orthopedic considerations; be free of local or intra-articular
             infection

          3. Symptomatic disease because of osteoarthritis, defined as one or more of the following
             Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) scores:

               1. a worst pain of at least 6 at any time during the preceding week (based on scale
                  of 0 to 10, with 10 representing "pain as bad as you can imagine").

               2. a worst stiffness of at least 6 at any time during the preceding week (based on a
                  scale of 0 to 10, with 10 representing "stiffness as bad as you can imagine").

          4. Stable analgesic regimen during the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          5. Inadequate pain relief (mean &gt;5 mean on Brief Pain Inventory-Severity Scale) lasting 3
             months.

          6. In the judgment of the Investigator, acceptable general medical condition

          7. Life expectancy &gt;6 months

          8. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, and those &lt;1 year post-menopausal, must be
             practicing effective methods of birth control such as hormonal methods (e.g., combined
             oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives), double barrier methods
             (e.g., condoms, sponge, diaphragm) or total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse
             for a minimum of 1 month before study drug administration and agree to continue
             prevention methods for 3 months after participation in the study is completed.

          9. Male subjects who are heterosexually active and not surgically sterile must agree to
             use effective contraception, including abstinence, for the duration of the study and
             for 3 months after the study is completed.

         10. Have suitable knee joint anatomy for intra-articular injection

         11. Willing and able to return for the follow-up visits

         12. Able to reliably provide pain assessment</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Hypersensitivity, allergy, or significant reaction to any ingredient of the study
             drug, including double-stranded DNA, mannose, and sucrose

          2. Scheduled knee replacement within 4 months

          3. High peri-operative risks which in the judgment of the investigator preclude a safe
             knee injection procedure (e.g., cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, infection)

          4. Current treatment with immunosuppressives (steroid therapy or other strong
             immunosuppressant)

          5. History of immunosuppressive therapy; steroids in the last 6 months

          6. Currently receiving systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy for malignancy

          7. Clinically significant hepatic disease as indicated by clinical laboratory results &gt;3
             times the upper limit of normal for any liver function test (e.g., aspartate
             aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase)

          8. Severe anemia (Grade 3; hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL, &lt;4.9 mmol/L, &lt;80 g/L; transfusion
             indicated), uncontrolled coagulopathy (Grade 1, prolonged activated partial
             prothrombin time (aPTT) &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN) to 1.5xULN), or bleeding
             diathesis, Grade 1 white cell counts (lymphocytes &lt; lower limit of normal (LLN) -
             800/mm3; &lt;LLN - 0.8 x 10e9 /L, neutrophils &lt;LLN - 1500/mm3; &lt;LLN - 1.5 x 10e9 /L)

          9. Positive serology for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C
             virus within 4 weeks of commencing the study

         10. Significant neuropsychiatric conditions; dementia, major depression, or altered mental
             state that in the opinion of the Investigator will interfere with study participation

         11. Current treatment with systemic antibiotics or antivirals (EXCEPTION: topical
             treatments)

         12. Current treatment with anticoagulants, other than low-dose aspirin, prescribed for new
             onset of symptoms in 3 months before screening visit.

         14. Known or suspected history of active alcohol or intravenous/oral drug abuse within 1
             year before the screening visit

         16. Use of any investigational drug or device within 1 month before enrollment or current
             participation in a trial that included intervention with a drug or device; or
             currently participating in an investigational drug or device study.

         17. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, could compromise the
             safety of the subject, the subject's ability to communicate the study staff, or the
             quality of the data</exclusivecriteria>
