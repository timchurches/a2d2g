  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves two elements: Screening and Intervention. 

In order to identify participants who are experiencing emotional disorders and who will benefit from the treatment, a two stage screening process will be carried out. Injury survivors will first be screened face to face 1 week post injury using the Posttrauma Adjustment Scale in order to identify those who are at risk of developing emotional disorders. This will be carried out during their admission to the trauma service. Participants identified as 'at risk' will then be screened again over the telephone at 4 weeks post injury using the MINI Neuropsychiatric Inteview 6.0 to determine whether they meet criteria for one or more emotional disorders. Those who meet this criteria will then proceed to the intervention phase of the study.  

The active treatment in the intervention phase is 'The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders' (UP). The UP is a psychological intervention which targets the shared underlying processes of emotional disorders, such as cognitive distortions, emotional avoidance, maladaptive emotion driven behaviours and emotional dysregulation. It is a face to face therapy delivered by a trained clinician over 10-14 weekly 60 minute sessions. The number of weeks of face to face therapy is dependent on the clinician's assessment of the patient's needs and how many aspects of the protocol are relevant to their clinical presentation. The treatment has 8 modules and the protocol allows for flexibility in the number of sessions taken to complete each module to accommodate differences in patient presentation.  </interventions>

    <concealment>Allocation to treatment condition will be conducted by a researcher who is independent to the study. The trial manager will provide a list of eligible participants and the independent researcher will then inform the trial manager of the allocated treatment conditions. Only the trial manager and treating clinicians will be aware of the participant conditions. All assessments from this point will be conducted by a research assistant who is blind to the treatment conditions. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition using a computer generated randomisation schedule (stratified by age and gender), using permuted blocks of random sizes.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Hypothesis 1: The primary hypothesis (individuals receiving UP-EI will be more likely to lose their diagnoses than UC) will be examined by calculating an odds ratio effect size (with 95% confidence interval) between the two conditions for the number of individuals who no longer meet diagnostic criteria for any disorder at the post-treatment and 6 month follow-up assessments. Hypotheses 2-4: In order to assess the effect of treatment on (a) depression, anxiety, and PTSD, (b) temperament and emotion regulation, and (c) disability and quality of life, a series of conditional latent growth curve models will be estimated whereby slope factors are regressed onto a dummy code variable representing treatment condition (UC = 0, UP-EI = 1). Separate LGM will be conducted for each outcome, examining changes across both the acute treatment phase and follow-up period. For these models, the intercept of the LGM will be centred on the pre-treatment assessment (i.e., first slope loading fixed to 0). The mean and variance of the slope factor in these models will reflect the total change in, and individual differences in change in, each outcome. In addition, for hypothesis 3, we will conduct a series of parallel process LGM to examine how changes in temperament and emotion regulation relate to changes in the primary symptom severity outcomes (depression, anxiety, and PTSD). 

SPSS sample power calculations based on treatment response in our previous trials suggest a sample size of n = 94 is required to detect a 35 point difference in the proportion of participants who meet diagnostic criteria for at least one disorder at follow-up (i.e., 30% of UP-EI and 65% of UC retain diagnosis), with power set at 80% and p set at .01. Monte Carlo simulations conducted in Mplus 7.11 indicated that a sample size of n = 94 would also provide sufficient power for examining hypotheses 2-4. 

A total of 1650 will be recruited into the study. Since the study involves a 2 stage screening process, this is then anticipated to lead to 115 people being eligible for the treatment phase of the study, thus meeting our target sample of 115 for this phase. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traumatic events, such as serious injury, interpersonal
assault or natural disaster have a high lifetime incidence. In
the aftermath of such an event, individuals may develop emotional disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, Anxiety Disorders or Depressive disorders). Many trauma survivors develop multiple emotional disorders and can
therefore present for treatment with complex difficulties. This demands psychological interventions that are flexible
and applicable across disorder types. Such approaches, termed 'transdiagnostic treatments', have been developed
for use across emotional disorders. The aim of this project is to conduct the first randomised controlled trial testing
the efficacy of the early delivery of a psychological treatment known as the 'Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic
Treatment of Emotional Disorders' in (i) reducing the prevalence and severity of emotional disorders and (ii) lowering disability and raising quality of life in a sample of severe injury survivors. Based on our earlier work, a two stepped screening process will identify patients eligible for the treatment component of the study. The first step is to screen 1650 injury patients for risk of developing an emotional disorder during their acute hospitalisation stage using the Posttrauma Adjustment Screen. The second step is to reassess patients identified as  at risk (n= 900) four weeks after injury to assess for emotional disorders meeting diagnostic criteria using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Of these, we expect the sample will comprise 115 participants who meet diagnostic threshold for at least one anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder or PTSD four weeks after they have sustained a traumatic injury and who take up the offer of treatment. These participants will be randomly allocated to either an (a) Treatment (Unified Protocol early intervention/UPEI)
or (b) Control (usual care  UC) group. The treatment condition will consist of 10-14 weekly therapy sessions using the 'Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders' with a trained clinician. Participants will be assessed using self report questionnaires to determine types of emotional disorders and severity of symptoms at:
(a) pre treatment, (b) mid treatment, (c) post treatment and (d) six months follow up. Quality of life, disability, perceived control and problematic emotion regulation strategies will also be measured at all three time points.</summary>
