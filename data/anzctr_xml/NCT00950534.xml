  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - INSULIN GLARGINE (HOE901)
Treatment: drugs - Oral Anti Diabetics (OAD)

Experimental: General Practitioner initiation with insulin glargine - Patients will be prescribed insulin glargine by their Investigator and they will be taught how to administer insulin glargine according to Australian guidelines. Patients will be treated for 24 weeks.

Active Comparator: Usual standard of care - Patients will be treated by their Investigator with the usual standard of care for 24 weeks (e.g., OAD dose titration, addition of a second or third OAD, or referral to an endocrinologist)


Treatment: drugs: INSULIN GLARGINE (HOE901)
The dose of insulin glargine will be titrated toward a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) target of 5.5 mmol/L. Treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) prescribed before study entry may continue (except Sitagliptin, Acarbose, Rosiglitazone)

Treatment: drugs: Oral Anti Diabetics (OAD)
Patients treated with the usual standard of care (OAD dose titration, addition of a second or third OAD or referral to an endocrinologist) until optimal doses are reached to maintain a FPG of 5.5 mmol/L

    <summary>The primary objective is to demonstrate the improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
      levels after general practitioner (GP) initiation and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) with insulin glargine compared with their usual clinical practice.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate the importance of GP initiation of insulin glargine
      for the treatment of T2DM.</summary>
