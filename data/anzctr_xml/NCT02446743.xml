    <summary>The purpose/aim of this study is to assess 1) the long-term persistence (4 to 7.5 years after
      the last dose) of bactericidal activity following primary vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ in
      adolescents [who previously participated in parent studies V72_41 (NCT0142384) and V72P10
      (NCT00661713)] and 2) the kinetics of immune response following booster vaccination with
