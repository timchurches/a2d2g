  <interventions>
    <interventions>This intervention will be delivered by trained primary care nurses in the general practice setting. The purpose of the intervention is to deliver consistent evidence-based dietary messages to the patient by the primary health care team. The focus of the intervention is to provide patients (and their family/whanau) with an understanding of the principles of healthy eating, so they are empowered and able to make good dietary choices. That is, the dietary advice will not be prescriptive. The pragmatic intervention package, designed and trialled in collaboration with primary care providers has six components:
1. Health Professional Training and Support
Primary care nurses will undertake an intensive half-day training course on the nutritional management of prediabetes. The course is both theoretical and practical. The dietary content of the course will be based on the 2004 Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes evidence-based guidelines for nutritional approaches to the treatment and prevention of diabetes mellitus. (These guidelines were successfully translated into clinical trial setting in the LOADD study.) Dietary assessments in the primary care setting using a New Zealand modified version of Starting the Conversation:Diet, internal and external factors affecting food choices, culture, behaviour change and effective communication of dietary information will be included in the course. The course will be delivered by study investigators with input from an experienced local dietitian, and experienced primary care nurse. A training manual will provide reference material, as well as research protocols. A 2-hour update course will be run at 6-months. 
A locally-based dietitian will be available by email and phone to answer any queries or discuss specific clinical cases. The dietitian will also arrange monthly clinical case review meetings for 6 months at each practice. Both the primary care nurses and dietitian found that dietitian support and guidance was only required for up to 6 months. A research nurse  will visit participating practices monthly to review intervention delivery processes and to provide support and advice, as needed, in order to maximise intervention fidelity. Fidelity will be reviewed at monthly practice visits, and components of the intervention delivered and resources provided for each participant at each intervention visit will be recorded as part of the integrated clinical data collection system. 
All participating primary care nurses will be instructed on standard practices for measuring anthropometry and blood pressure. Practice equipment will be calibrated.    
2. Individual Patient Education
All eligible participants will be offered an initial 30 minute individual dietary session with the primary care nurse. They will be asked to complete a brief dietary assessment (Starting the Conversation:Diet modified to the New Zealand context.) on arrival at the practice, prior to their appointment. They will be encouraged to bring family/whanau to the session. Two to three goals will be determined and they will be given individualised dietary advice tailored to their situation based on a set of structured questions and the brief dietary assessment. They will be provided with standard Be Active Everyday advice, that is, 30 minutes of physical activity of moderate intensity on most, if not all, days of the week. Fifteen minute follow-up sessions will be arranged at 1-2 weeks, 5-6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months with a 30 minute review at 6 months. Ongoing follow-up will be provided at 3-monthly intervals for a weigh-in and to provide brief targeted dietary advice and support. 
3. Goal Setting &amp; Key Messages
Two to three individually tailored dietary goals determined between the primary care nurse and patient (based on the structured questions and brief dietary assessment) will be incorporated into the general practice patient management systems (PMS). These messages will facilitate opportunistic targeted advice and guidance by GPs, thus reinforcing information provided at primary care nurse dietary consultations. The goals/messages will be reviewed and updated accordingly at primary care nurse appointments. 
4. Nutritionally supportive primary care environment
The dietary information provided in pamphlets, magazines and posters in participating general practice waiting rooms will be reviewed, and updated so that consistent appropriate dietary messages are reinforced within the primary care environment.
5. Community-based group education
Community group education sessions will be offered and attendance at all six sessions will be encouraged. The purpose of these community group education sessions will be to provide generic nutrition knowledge and advice, (for example, food label reading), problem solving skills and peer group support. The sessions will be delivered by trained lay people. Each group session will last 1-1.5 hours. Referrals to the community group education sessions will be made at the 1-2 week intervention appointment.
6. Written Resources
The main written patient resource used will the Diabetes New Zealand Diabetes and healthy food choices pamphlet.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes can be prevented through lifestyle modification, but the prevalence continues to increase worldwide. In New Zealand testing for diabetes and prediabetes is recommended as part of cardiovascular risk assessment, but primary care based lifestyle advice needs to be more effective if prediabetes is to be well managed, and cases of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) prevented. Prediabetes is a high risk state for both T2DM and cardiovascular disease, therefore regression to normal glucose metabolism is clinically important. Although of clinical relevance, few studies have examined factors that predict regression from prediabetes to normal glucose metabolism, and these have been retrospective. It is not clear which factors influence achievement of normal glucose metabolism. A prior feasibility study demonstrated that our structured prediabetes intervention tool can be delivered within busy primary care and it is deemed to be better and more effective than the previous unstructured approach. We now need to know how well the intervention works and what predicts regression, in a real world setting on a larger sample of patients before it is widely adopted.
We seek to determine if there are clinically important and modifiable differences between those with prediabetes who regress to normal glucose metabolism at 6 months, and those who do not, following participation in a structured primary care nurse-delivered prediabetes dietary intervention. We also aim to quantify the number of T2DM cases at 2 years in participants who regressed to normal glucose metabolism at 6 months compared with the non-regressors.
The two main outcome measures are glycated haemoglobin (a measure of blood glucose control) and weight. Other outcome measures will include body mass index, waist circumference, social support score, behavioural change score. The study setting will be general practices in the Hastings and Napier urban zones. Non-pregnant men and women aged &lt;70 years with prediabetes and overweight or obese who are not prescribed metformin will be eligible to participate. A sample of 400 people will be required to answer the study questions. The intervention will be delivered by trained primary care nurses who will provide consistent goal-focussed evidence-based dietary messages to the patient (and their family/whanau).The pragmatic intervention package has six components: 1) Health Professional Training and Support, 2) Individual Patient Education, 3) Goal Setting &amp; Key Messages, 4) Nutritionally supportive primary care environment, 5) Community-based group education, 6) Written Resources. Routine clinical data will be collected by primary care nurses. Additional study-specific data will be collected through validated questionnaires (eg social support) and blood sample (eg insulin) by a study research nurse. Statistical methods will be used to identify predictors of regression to normal blood glucose at 6 months.</summary>
