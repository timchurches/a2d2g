  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Neurostimulation device implantation

Experimental: Neurostimulation for chronic pain - Neurostimulation (spinal cord stimulation with or without peripheral nerve stimulation of the trunk) for chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs.


Treatment: devices: Neurostimulation device implantation
Study subjects will undergo a screening-trial of neurostimulation using the Boston Scientific Corporation Precision Spectra neurostimulation system and may proceed to permanent implantation in the event of a successful screening trial.
Treatment will include spinal cord stimulation and may also include peripheral nerve stimulation, based upon the physician's subject-specific treatment plan.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with treatment - First of 2 co-primary endpoints. It is measured on a 7-point choice of degree of satisfaction scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with treatment - Second of 2 co-primary endpoints. It is measured on a 7-point choice of degree of satisfaction scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>365 days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with treatment - Collected on a 7-point choice of degree of satisfaction scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>180-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global impression of change - Global Impression of Change (GIC) will be assessed by patients, investigators and caregivers. GIC is a comparison to baseline and will be evaluated by rating the global impression of change using a seven-point scale: ("very much improved" to "marked worsening")</outcome>
      <timepoint>180-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall pain intensity - Subjects will rate their overall pain on a 0-10 numerical rating scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through 365-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain relief responder rate - A "responder" is defined as a subject who reports =50% reduction in baseline pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through 365-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disability - Disability will be assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index v2.1a</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through 365-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global impression of change</outcome>

      <outcome>Pain-related medication use</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through 365 days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage overlap of painful areas with stimulation-induced paresthesia (drawings) - Overlap will be assessed using subject-completed drawings of pain and neurostimulation-induced paresthesia (tingling)</outcome>
      <timepoint>From 90-days through 365-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage overlap of painful areas with stimulation-induced paresthesias (verbal) - Overlap will be assessed by subject estimation</outcome>
      <timepoint>From 90-days through 365 days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient treatment preference - Subjects who end up utilizing the full capacity of the implantable system will compare treatment from baseline through 90-days post permanent implantation with treatment from 90-days through 365-days post permanent implantation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through 365-days post permanent implantation</timepoint>
