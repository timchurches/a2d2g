  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Ellipse MAGEC Spinal Bracing and Distraction System is comprised of a sterile single use spinal rod that is surgically implanted using appropriate commercially available fixations components (i.e. pedicle screws, hooks, and/or connectors).  The system includes a non-sterile hand held External Remote Controller that is used at various times after implant to non-invasively lengthen or shorten the implanted spinal rod.  The implanted spinal rod is used to brace the spine during growth to minimize the progression of scoliosis.  The rod includes a small internal magnet which allows the rod to be lengthened by use of the External Remote Controller.  The MAGEC device is approved for commercial use in New Zealand and also is CE-marked.

The duration of the implant procedure is approximately 1.5 - 2.5 hours, depending on the surgeon's preferred construct.

The duration the device remains in place is prescribed by the physician and differs per patient.  The device may remain in the patient for up to 5 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Magnitude of curve progression compared to baseline (through follow up period) until skeletal maturity.  This outcome is assessed via x-ray analysis of the spinal Cobb Angle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 1-Week, 3-Month, 6-Month, 9-Month, 12-Month, 18-Month, 24-Month, 30-Month, and 36-Month Postoperative Visits</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiographic evaluation of coronal and sagittal balance compared to baseline</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 1-Week, 3-Month, 6-Month, 9-Month, 12-Month, 18-Month, 24-Month, 30-Month, and 36-Month Postoperative Visits</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life assessment via the SRS-30 Scoliosis Questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 3-Month, 6-Month, 12-Month, 24-Month, and 36-Month Postoperative Visits</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of Rib Hump prominence throughout follow up to baseline.  This outcome is assessed via physical examination and measured with a Scoliometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 1-Week, 3-Month, 6-Month, 9-Month, 12-Month, 18-Month, 24-Month, 30-Month, and 36-Month Postoperative Visits</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Expected compared to actual device lengthening.  This outcome is assessed by comparing expected lengthening values as indicated by the External Remote Controller to actual device lengthening via radiographic measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1-Week, 3-Month, 6-Month, 9-Month, 12-Month, 18-Month, 24-Month, 30-Month, and 36-Month Postoperative Visits</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse Event Profile.  Possible adverse events include: device malfunction, wound pain, back pain, skin problems, infection, sensitivity to metal or metal allergies, neurological deficit, construct failure, paralysis, decompensation, flat-back syndrome, bone failure, and unacceptable junctional kyphosis.  Adverse events are assessed at every subject visit to the site via physical examination and radiographic evaluation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 1-Week, 3-Month, 6-Month, 9-Month, 12-Month, 18-Month, 24-Month, 30-Month, and 36-Month Postoperative Visits</timepoint>
