  <interventions>
    <interventions>Brief attentional bias modification will be delivered in a laboratory setting. Undergraduate students will be trained to pay less attention to pain-related words (either sensory pain or affective pain) in a computer task. Participants will also complete questionnaires, a computer task to measure interpretation biases (i.e. interpreting ambiguous stimuli as pain-related), and an acute experimental pain task. There is only one experimental pain task: the cold pressor, described as follows:

Two water tanks manufactured by Thermoline Scientific Australia were used to conduct the cold pressor task. Each tank was comprised of a 20L circulating water bath chamber (model TLWB-30), immersion cooler (TIC-400) and a heat circulator (TU-3). In order to ensure participants initial arm temperature was controlled for, they were firstly asked to submerge their arm up to the elbow for 30 seconds in the warm tank, with a maintained temperature of 37degrees C ( plus or minus 0.5). Following this, they submerged the same arm up to the elbow into the tank of cold water, maintained at 5 degrees C(plus or minus 0.5). Research in the past indicates the cold pressor task produces the Lewis Effect, whereby pain is produced by vasodilation of the blood vessels due to warm water, quickly followed by vasoconstriction due to cold water.</interventions>
    <comparator>Training attention towards pain-related words (either sensory or affective pain).  As with the experimental group, control participants will also complete the same questionnaires, a computer task to measure interpretation biases (i.e. interpreting ambiguous stimuli as pain-related), and an acute experimental pain task (the cold pressor).

120 participants will be recruited, to allow for a final sample of 104 participants with drop-outs accounted for. Power analyses are based on our prior studies (e.g. McGowan et al., 2009). The effect size for a difference between the ABM group and control was large. Based on this estimate, 26 participants in each group should be sufficient to detect changes at 5% significance with a power of 80%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to explore the effect of pain-related attentional bias modification on the interpretation and experience of acute pain, and on psychological variables. Participants will complete the the questionnaires, then a computer based interpretation bias task, followed by the attentional bias modification. They will then then complete the interpretation bias task again, and finally the experimental pain tasks.</summary>
