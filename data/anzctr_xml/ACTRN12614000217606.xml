  <interventions>
    <interventions>Artemether-lumefantrine will be administered orally twice daily to patients for 3 days.  Adult patients (35kg and above) will receive dosage of 80 mg artemether and 480 mg lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days.  For patients from 25 to 35 kg the dosage is 60mg artemether and 360 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days. For patients from 15 to 25 kg the dosage is 40mg artemether and 240 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days.
For  patients from 5 to 15 kg the dosage is 20mg artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine twice daily for 3 days.
The first dose will be administered at the health centre by a study nurse or clinician. Every day morning doses of medicine on day 0, 1and 2 will be administered under the supervision of a qualified staff. The subsequent second dose on each day will be given at home by a parent or guardian and will be monitored by study personnel through mobile phone call or home visits if the parent/guardian is not reachable by mobile phone. All the doses will be administered after meals. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study end-point is the classification assigned to a patient. Valid study end-points include: treatment failure, completion of the follow-up period without treatment failure, loss to follow-up, withdrawal from study, and protocol violation. At all times, the well-being of the   patient will take priority over his or her continuation in the study.Treatment outcomes will be classified on the basis of an assessment of the parasitological and clinical outcome of antimalarial treatment according to the latest WHO guidelines.  Thus, all patients will be classified as having early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response. </outcome>
      <timepoint>A standard physical examination will be performed at baseline (day 0 before dosing) and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42. A complete medical history, demographic information and contact details will be taken at baseline.</timepoint>
