  <interventions>
    <interventions>Young people who drink regularly will be invited to use a new mobile phone game application, 'Ray's Night Out', over a one month period, to increase their knowledge of harm minimisation strategies for alcohol consumption.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate changes in attitudes toward alcohol, knowledge and application of harm minimisation strategies and alcohol use following use of the eTool. A field trial will be conducted to determine the outcomes of the eTool on young people's attitudes to alcohol and knowledge of behaviours for safe alcohol consumption, as well as further information on the usability of the app. Young people will be given the eTool to trial for one month, during which time the eTool will collect information about their usage (including the number of times it was used; the date, time and duration each session of use), the sections of the eTool accessed and data entered into the app . This includes the number of drinks they typically consume on a 'fun', 'relaxed' and 'crazy' night and the number of drinks they can consume before hitting their 'stupid line' for drinking (the point at which a fun night out gets messy). At the end of the app young people are asked to re-enter the number of drinks they typically consume on a 'fun', 'relaxed' and 'crazy' night after receiving feedback on their night out with Ray, the red panda who is the character in the game. Research follow ups on young people's attitudes to alcohol, knowledge of behaviours for safe alcohol consumption and alcohol use is collected at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months follow up.</summary>
