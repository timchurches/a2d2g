    <interventions>IBCSG 25-02 / BIG 3-02 (TEXT) is being conducted internationally by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG).  The study is coordinated in Australia and New Zealand by the Australian and New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group (ANZ BCTG).

This trial will evaluate the worth of ovarian function suppression (achieved by long-term use of GnRH analogue) plus exemestane compared with GnRH analogue plus tamoxifen for premenopausal women with steroid hormone receptor positive early invasive breast cancer.  Patients may either receive no chemotherapy or commence chemotherapy at the same time that GnRH analogue is initiated.

IBCSG 25-02 / BIG 3-02 (TEXT) is an international, multicentre, randomised phase III clinical trial of 1850 premenopausal  women who have had histologically or cytologically confirmed, receptor-positive primary breast cancer.
 
Women will be randomised in a 2-arm design to receive one of the following:

a. Ovarian Function Suppression (triptorelin) + Tamoxifen
b. Ovarian Function Suppression (triptorelin) + Exemestane


All treatment will be for 5 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm A - Tamoxifen as the control treatment: 20mg given orally daily until 5yrs from date of randomisation, unless relapse or intolerance should occur earlier. Triptorelin 3.75mg given by intramuscular injection every 28 days for 5 years from randomisation, unless relapse or intolerance should occur earlier or surgical oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation is subsequently performed.</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease free survival (DFS) - defined as the time from randomisation to local (including recurrence restricted to the breast after breast conserving treatment), regional or distant relapse, contralateral breast cancer, appearance of a second (non-breast) primary tumour, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Causes of death without cancer event between the treatment arms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Causes of death without cancer event between the treatment arms will be assessed during four interim analyses and one final analysis. the target number of events for the final anlaysis is 396, and interim anlayses will be planned after 99 (25%), 158 (40%), 237 (60%) and 317 (80%) events have been observed.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has shown that exemestane works better in postmenopausal women because their ovaries are no longer producing oestrogen.  TEXT will determine if suppressing ovarian function in premenopausal women (i.e. reducing oestrogen production) will allow exemestane to work in the same way as it does for postmeopausal women.  This trial is designed for participants who should receive ovarian function suppression from the start of their adjuvant breast cancer treatment.</summary>
