  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a single 1 hour session, upright and supine arterialised capillary blood gases and simple bedside spirometry will be performed for each participant. In addition, neck, waist and hip measurements will also be obtained. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels and severity of oxygen desaturation will also be recorded throughout the duration of the single overnight sleep study.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Spirometry will be performed after 5 minutes of sitting upright and again after 5 minutes of lying flat during the daytime assessment period. The forced expiratory time (FEV1) and forced and slow vital capacities will be assessed using a spirometer. </timepoint>

      <timepoint>Measured while lying flat and standing upright during the daytime assessment period. These measurements will require less than 10 minutes to complete using a flexible tape measure.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to identify obese patients who are at risk of developing Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) by investigating the relationship between daytime measures (including supine hypercapnia (elevated carbon dioxide levels when lying flat), distribution of body fat, and lung volumes) with the presence of hypoventilation during sleep.

Hypothesis:

Supine hypercapnia is a useful marker for identifying sleep hypoventilation, an early sign of the development of OHS.
