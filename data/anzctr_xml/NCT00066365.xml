  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - sargramostim
Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery

Experimental: Group 1 (unilateral recurrence) - Sargramostim and thoractomy - Patients receive initial inhalation therapy inhaled sargramostim (GM-CSF) twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every other week every 14 days for a total of 2 courses. Patients undergo surgical procedure thoracotomy on day 22. Beginning on day 29, or as soon as possible thereafter, patients begin post-thoracotomy inhalation therapy for up to 12 additional courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

Experimental: Group 2 (bilateral recurrence) - Sargramostim and thoractomy - Patients may be enrolled on study either before or after the first thoracotomy procedure. For the first thoracotomy, patients undergo surgical procedure unilateral thoracotomy. Patients receive initial inhalation therapy inhaled GM-CSF, as soon as possible after recovery from first thoracotomy, twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every other week every 14 days for a total of 2 courses. Patients undergo surgical procedure contralateral thoracotomy on day 22. Beginning on day 29, or as soon as possible, patients begin post-thoracotomy inhalation therapy as above for up to 12 additional courses. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.


Other interventions: sargramostim

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Inhaling aerosolized sargramostim before and after surgery may interfere with the
      growth of tumor cells and shrink the tumor so that it can be removed during surgery.
      Sargramostim may then kill any tumor cells remaining after surgery. This may be an effective
      treatment for osteosarcoma that has spread to the lung.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well inhaled sargramostim works in treating
      patients who are undergoing surgery for the first recurrence of osteosarcoma that has spread
      to the lung.</summary>
