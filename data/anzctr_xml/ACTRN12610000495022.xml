    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will recruit subjects with symptomatic knee OA by using a combined strategy, including collaboration with general practitioners, specialist rheumatologists, and orthopaedic surgeons, as well as advertising through local media. 

Allocation concealment will be ensured by the used of identical inert placebo, and the use of a central automated allocation procedure (consecutively numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes will be used), with security in place to ensure allocation data cannot be accessed or influenced by any person. Thus the randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be double blind.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation of participants will be based on computer generated random numbers.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Observational evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may have a role in the causes of osteoarthritis (OA) and there are biologically plausible mechanisms to explain this.  There is, however, no evidence which shows that intervening with vitamin D supplementation can slow the progression of OA. This study will compare knee OA structural changes in patients receiving vitamin D supplementation with those receiving a placebo. Use of MRI will provide sensitive measures of knee OA changes.</summary>
