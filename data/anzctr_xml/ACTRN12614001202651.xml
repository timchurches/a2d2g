  <interventions>
    <interventions>Six months of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for at least 4 hours per night.  CPAP works by blowing air into the pharynx during sleep thereby raising the air pressure sufficiently to hold the airway open.
This treatment will be administered via a mask around the mouth and nose.  The dose setting for each patient is set by the CPAP device that uses an algorithm to set the optimal dose.  This dosage will be monitored by the Sleep Unit.
Compliance will be monitored remotely by downloading the data cards used in the CPAP device.</interventions>
    <comparator>A comparison will be made between baseline and measures after six months of CPAP treatment on a battery of cognitive tests, number of microsleep events during a 50 min continuous tracking task, and cerebral perfusion in people with moderate OSA.
Baseline measures of microsleep number and cerebral perfusion will also be compared against data from a group of participants without OSA collected in a previous study.
The controls consisted of 13 females and 6 males (M age = 50 range 41 to 81, who were found not to have OSA following a level 2 polysonography.  Their data was collected 2013.   </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of behavioural microsleeps during a 50 min continuous tracking task following six months of CPAP treatment compared with number of behavioural microsleeps at baseline and those without OSA.
Microsleeps are identified by correlating periods of non-activity identified by reviewing tracking performance data with obvious overt signs of drowsiness identified from synchronized  eye-vidoe with tracking data.  The target used in the tracking task moves randomly without any flats spots.  Therefore any flat spots in performance represent unintentional non-response.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be referrals from the Christchurch Hospital Sleep Unit who have been assessed as having moderate OSA and do not require urgent treatment.  Sleep Unit staff will make the initial approach.  Those who indicate a willingness to participate will be contacted by the Study Coordinating Investigator who will provide detailed information concerning the study and confirm inclusion criteria are met and no exclusion criteria apply.  Provided informed consent is given, an offer to participate will be made.  All participants accepted into the study who have moderate OSA will be assigned to the treatment group.
Comparative baseline microsleep and cerebral perfusion data from those without OSA and who have consented for their data to be used in further studies, is available from a previous study.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a longitudinal study of n=20 people with moderate OSA and n=20 controls without OSA (collected in a previous study). Unpaired t-tests will be used to compare microsleep propensity and cerebral perfusion at baseline between controls and moderate OSA (80% power for detecting an effect size of = 0.69).  Correlation analysis will be used for OSA severity and microsleep propensity, cerebral perfusion, and cognitive test scores at baseline and at 6 months (80% power for detecting a correlation = 0.42).  A repeated-measures ANOVA will be used for changes in microsleep propensity and cerebral perfusion for within- and between-group interactions from baseline to 6 months between mod OSAs and controls (80% power for detecting an effect size = 0.20). Unpaired t-tests will be used to compare microsleep propensity and cerebral perfusion at 6 months, between controls and mod OSAs (80% power for detecting an effect size of = 0.73).  Paired t-tests will be used to compare microsleep propensity, cerebral perfusion, and cognitive test scores pre- and post-CPAP treatment in mod OSAs (80% power for detecting an effect size of = 0.58).  In general, moderate to large effect sizes (0.50.8) need to be observed to provide clinically relevant results.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate brain structure, cerebral blood perfusion, cognition, and microsleep propensity at baseline and following 6 months of CPAP treatment in people with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

We hypothesize that:
(1)	CPAP treatment will improve cerebral perfusion while awake at the 6-month follow-up.
(2)	There is a relationship between OSA-related decreased cerebral perfusion and cognitive impairment.
(3)	CPAP treatment will reduce microsleep propensity.</summary>
