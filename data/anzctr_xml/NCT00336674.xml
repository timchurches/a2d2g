Active Comparator: DV001 - Recombinant human intranasal insulin formulation in a buffered solution of benzalkonium chloride and glycerol presented in multi-dose nasal spray devices with actuators (Pfeiffer) designed to deliver 100ul spray doses to nasal mucosa. The product is formulated at a dose strength of 1100 IU / mL (40mg/mL) manufacturing formulation. The product will be self administered by eligible participants as two 100 microlitre spray doses per nostril. Treatment will be administered daily for 7 consecutive days then on one day each week for 12 months. Participants will be followed until they develop diabetes or until 5 years after the last participant has been randomised (maximum period of follow up is expected to be 10 years.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Placebo insulin carrier solution of benzalkonium chloride and glycerol presented in multi-dose nasal spray devices with actuators (Pfeiffer) designed to deliver 100ul spray doses to nasal mucosa. The product will be self administered by participants as two 100 microlitre spray doses per nostril. Treatment will be administered daily for 7 consecutive days then on one day each week for 12 months. Participants will be followed until they develop diabetes or until 5 years after the last participant has been randomised (maximum period of follow up is expected to be 10 years.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In people with type 1 diabetes the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because
      the body's immune system has attacked and destroyed the beta cells. It is thought that
      exposure of the mucous membranes to insulin may cause act like a vaccine effect whereby
      protective immune cells are stimulated and these then counteract the "bad" immune cells that
      damage the beta cells. This study aims to determine if intranasal insulin can protect beta
      cells and stop progression to diabetes in individuals who are at risk.</summary>
