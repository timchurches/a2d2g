    <interventions>Behaviour - Energy Voucher
Behaviour - No intervention : control arm

Experimental: Voucher - Receive the intervention ("Energy Voucher") the first winter enrolled in the study. The intervention is a electricity voucher and a short pamphlet describing how to work out how much heat the voucher can buy.

Other: Control - Receive the intervention the second winter enrolled in the study (thus "No intervention : control arm"). The intervention is a electricity voucher and a short pamphlet describing how to work out how much heat the voucher can buy.


Behaviour: Energy Voucher
Receive the intervention the first winter enrolled in the study. The intervention is a electricity voucher and a short pamphlet describing how to work out how much heat the voucher can buy.

Behaviour: No intervention : control arm
Do not receive the money or pamphlet in the initial study year

    <summary>Aim

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether fuel subsidies reduce exacerbations of COPD
      among people aged over 55, and therefore whether providing such subsidies is a
      cost-beneficial policy initiative.

      The Warm Homes for Elder New Zealanders Study enrolled community-dwelling people aged over 55
      with moderate or worse COPD. Prior to the study commencing the houses were insulated (if
      feasible, &amp; the house-owner agreed). Data were collected on the health and energy use of the
      participants.

      The households randomly assigned to the "early" intervention group had a subsidy to their
      power account their first winter in the study. The subsidy was the intervention and was
      designed to enable the participants, if they chose to do so, to keep their house warmer
      during the winter.</summary>
