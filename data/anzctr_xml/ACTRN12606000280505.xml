  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised contriol trial: 3 billion Lactobacillus acidophilus LAVRI-A1 in maltodextrin (Probiomics, Australia) per day (or placebo) from birth to 6 months. This is given as a sachet of dried powder which is mixed with water and administered orally. 

The rate of development of allergic disease will be compared between these groups at 12 months, 2 years and 5 years - as indicated below.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo contains maltodextrin alone and looks / smells like the "active" preparation.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To aim of this study is to investigate the effects of probiotic supplementation for the first 6 months of life in infants at high risk of allergic disease. The study has been designed to determine if this intervention reduces the risk of developing allergic sensitisation (determined by allergy skin testing) and allergic disease (such as food allergy, atopic dermatitis and asthma) in early childhood. The participants and investigators remained blind to the intervention throughout the follow up period.</summary>
