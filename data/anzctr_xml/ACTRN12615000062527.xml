  <interventions>
    <interventions>Investigational products will be administered once orally (with approximately 1 week wash-out between investigational products). Participants will consume a different treatment each testing day. Each product consists of a powdered drink mix, which is to be dissolved in 500ml of water prior to consumption.

The intervention will be consumed at the testing centre by healthy volunteers while under researcher supervision

The following products will be investigated:

ErgGo MOM contains:
Green tea extract (130mg including 13mg of caffeine)
Quercetin (100mg)
Enzogenol (50mg)
Magnesium (50mg)
L-Theanine (25mg)
Niacin (20mg)
Vitamin B6 (2mg)
Vitamin B12 (400mcg)
Maltodextrin plus stevia (sweetener) and natural flavour/colour
Citric Acid, Gum Acacia, Guar Gum, Xanthan Gum

ErgGo POP contains:
DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol, 200mg)
Green tea extract (130mg including 13mg of caffeine)
Quercetin (100mg)
Caffeine (87mg)
Enzogenol (50mg)
Magnesium (50mg)

Any known or suspected food allergies (this would cover all ingredients in the investigational product).

All treatments are presented in identically appearing plain packaging, differing only by a participant and visit number. 

To assist with blinding, all treatments are matched for taste and appearance. 

Eligible participants are assigned the next sequential participant/randomisation number in the format starting 001, 002.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS v21. The primary analyses will involve repeated measures ANOVA on change from baseline data for each Cognitive Demand Battery (CDB) measure. At each cycle of the CDB, the scores will be compared across each of the three treatment groups using planned comparisons, correcting for multiple comparisons. Planned comparisons will compare each active treatment group with that of placebo. Similar statistical tests will be used to analyse the remaining outcomes. All tests of significance, unless otherwise stated, will be performed at alpha = 0.05, two-sided.

A sample of 24 participants is required to complete the crossover protocol. Assuming a medium effect size (d = 0.3), which is based on previous literature in this area, this number will give 80% power to detect a significant (p &lt;0.05, two tailed) difference between treatments (G* Power v3.1). A sample of 30 participants (15 females and 15 males) will be recruited to account for participant withdrawal.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether acute supplementation with either of two nutraceutical combination formulas (ErgGo Mom and ErgGo POP), relative to placebo, reduces self-rated mental fatigue associated with performing cognitively demanding tasks.</summary>
