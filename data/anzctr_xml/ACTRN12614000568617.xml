  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of access to 'Memory Box' - an individualised multimedia interface device, which contains photographs, movies, family video messages, and music that is personally relevant to each individual. The participants will have access to Memory Box for 24 hours per day for a period of 4 weeks. They will receive weekly 30 minute training sessions to assist them in using the device, plus the research team will visit weekly to ensure the device is operating correctly and address any issues in using the device. Facility staff and visiting family members will also assist participants in using the device, with details about this assistance provided to the research team at the end of the intervention. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored using an automated log of usage of the device, which is built into the program. At the end of the intervention, the amount of time each participant has used each type of media will be extracted from the device. 

As this is an nonpharmacological intervention, no 'wash-out' period is required between the intervention and control conditions. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase in quality of life, measured using the Quality of life in Alzheimers Disease (QOL-AD; Logsdon et al., 1999), a brief, 13-item measure that is administered to the resident using an interview format and to a staff member using a questionnaire. Where the resident is unable to complete the self-report (e.g., some participants with moderate dementia), only the informant section will be used. The items cover multiple domains (relationships with friends and family, physical condition, mood, etc) of concern to people with dementia. We will use the adaptations for individuals in residential aged care settings described in Edelman et al. (2005). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 4 weeks after baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in agitation associated with dementia, measured using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI; Cohen-Mansfield et al., 1989). This is a widely-used informant-rated measure of the frequency with which a person with dementia manifests 29 agitated behaviours over a one week period (modification from the original two week period). A minimum of two staff members will collaborate in completing the scale, based on findings of improved reliability using this technique (Moniz-Cook et al., 2001). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 4 weeks after baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in symptoms of depression, measured using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (Alexopoulos et al. 1988), administered in interview to both the resident and a staff members, with final scores reflecting the clinical judgement of the assessor</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 weeks after baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in symptoms of anxiety, measured using the Rating for Anxiety In Dementia instrument (Shankar et al., 1999), which involves an interview with a member of care staff and a patient interview. The structured interview guide for this rating scale reported by Snow et al. (2012) will be employed. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 weeks after baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in level of carer burden reported by aged care staff, measured using a version of the Burden Interview, modified for use with professional carers (Sourial et al., 2001). Two staff members will each complete the instrument and a mean score calculated. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 4 weeks after baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction with Memory Box, through a semi-structured interview and brief scale designed specifically for this study. Satisfaction data will be collected from each participant, a staff member and a family member at the end of the intervention. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the 4 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility data - including amount of support required to operate Memory Box, difficulties experienced in using Memory Box. This will be assessed using a semi-structured interview with each participant, a staff member and a family member. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>(i) Aims of the project
Aged care residents with dementia present with high rates of agitated behaviour and lowered quality of life, which is associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, and carer burden. While research has demonstrated that personalised activities and stimuli (such as favourite music and audio recordings of family members) can help in addressing these behaviours, people with marked dementia are often unable to access them without the direct assistance of family or staff carers. Our team has designed a device that provides easy access to personalised multimedia, including photographs, music, videotaped family greetings and movies on a portable device. In this project, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of this device in reducing agitated behaviour and improving quality of life among aged care residents with dementia and also examine its feasibility for routine use. 

Hypotheses:
(1)	Participants who receive the personalised multimedia interface device will have decreased severity and frequency of agitated behaviour and improved quality of life relative to their scores during the control period. 
(2)   Participants who receive the device will also report lower levels of depression and anxiety. 
(2)	Aged care staff will perceive their carer role as less burdensome during the period when the resident receives the device than during the control period. 

In addition, our feasibility study will (i) determine what level of support from staff and families is required for participants to use the device; (ii) establish patterns of use over a one month period; and (iii) determine levels of satisfaction with this novel approach.
