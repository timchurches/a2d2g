  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have already been implanted with a commercial trial spinal cord stimulation leads will have their implanted leads temporarily connected to a new spinal cord stimulation and recording system. The new system will record nerve responses from the spinal cord stimulation and use those responses to automatically control the stimulation. Patients will be tested in 1 or 2 sessions of up to 4 hours each during their usual trial stimulation period of 4-7 days. Different stimulation paradigms will be tested within subject, crossing-over between automatic control and standard manual control, with a duration in each arm of several minutes up to an hour, with no washout period. Each stimulation paradigm will be tested during various posture changes. 
The aims of the study are:
1. To determine if the nerve response to stimulation recorded from the spinal cord can be used to maintain the stimulation at a constant and comfortable level for the patient.
2. Measuring from the spinal cord to optimise the stimulator settings automatically.
3. Determine different stimulation patterns to provide pain relief without the patient feeling the stimulation.
4. To determine if a patients pain can be detected from the nerve signals measured in the spinal cord.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard manual control of stimulation, requiring the patient to manually control the strength of stimulation with a handheld controller during different postural changes. The manual control treatment will be conducted within subject, within the same session as the automatic control treatment, with duration of several minutes to an hour and no washout between treatments</comparator>
