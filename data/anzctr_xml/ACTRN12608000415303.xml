  <interventions>
    <interventions>A one hour education class is provided to the treatment group covering the importance of exercise and safe return to exercise / activity post acute cardiac incident. 

This is combined with a short, patient specific, low intensity, monitored exercise program (including warm up, walking program and cool down), that is provided on one occasion after the education session. This intervention takes 5 to 15 minutes depending on the medical status of the patient. The focus of this session is to educate patients in appropriate exercise intensity and components of an exercise program in the first three weeks after an acute exacerbation of coronary heart disease.

The intervention is delivered on one occasion, and includes both hospital inpatients and patients recently discharged from hospital (within one week).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment is provided to the control group. This group does not receive education about how to begin to exercise after an acute event relating to coronary heart disease, how to monitor or progress an exercise program. They are reviewed by a cardiac rehabilitation co-ordinator who provides education about modification of cardiovascular disease risk factor and referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. This is a once only review that is completed prior to discharge home.</comparator>

Participants who will require open heart surgery as a result of their current admission 3. Participants who are unable to complete the outcome measures due to english as a second language or with pre-morbid cognitive impairment 4. The participant requires inpatient rehabilitation prior to discharge home 5. The participant is unable to complete the physical outcome measures due to a limitation in functional status (e.g.unable to ambulate without assistance of one or more people with their usual gait aid).</exclusivecriteria>

Each group (inpatients and outpatients) is then randomly allocated into treatment and control groups via computerised sequence generation.

Stratification was included in an attempt to create equal numbers of 'inpatients' and 'outpatients' in each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been developed to assess the impact of a short (once only) education program for patients admitted to an acute hospital because of coronary artery disease. We are investigating whether early education about the importance of exercise and how to safely begin exercise after a 'heart event' will improve physical status, quality of life and confidence in completing physical activity in the early stages after acute hospitalisation. We are also investigating whether people participating in this program will be more likely to engage in cardiac rehabilitation after hospital discharge - a program that has been shown to improve function, quality of life and mortality in people with coronary artery disease.</summary>
