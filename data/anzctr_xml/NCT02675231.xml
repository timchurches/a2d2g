Experimental: Abemaciclib + Trastuzumab + Fulvestrant - Abemaciclib given orally every 12 hours (Q12H) of a 21-day cycle; plus trastuzumab intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of the cycle then a maintenance dose IV infusion on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle; plus fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on day 1, 15 and 29 and then once every 4 weeks thereafter.

Experimental: Abemaciclib + Trastuzumab - Abemaciclib given orally Q12H of a 21-day cycle; plus trastuzumab IV infusion on Day 1 of the cycle then a maintenance dose IV infusion on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle.

Active Comparator: Trastuzumab + Standard of Care Chemotherapy - Trastuzumab IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle then a maintenance dose IV infusion on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle plus standard of care single agent chemotherapy of physician's choice administered according to product label.
