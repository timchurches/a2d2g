    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be voluntarily recruited for the study via General Practitioner, Rheumatology and other health care professional surgeries (physiotherapists, chiropracters, masseurs etc). They will then be medically assessed by the study Rheumatologist for inclusion / exclusion criteria. Once enrolled, participants will be randomly allocated to placebo or active intervention groups by allocation of coded clinical supplies (supplied by Merck). The allocation code will be kept in  sealed envelope by the study Pharmacist, meaning that all investigators will be blinded to  group allocation until after data analysis. The only exception would be in case of serous adverse even, in which case only the study Pharmacist will access the decoded data for that subject alone.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to better understand the way in which painful osteoarthritis affects different people and whether an anti-inflammatory medication such as Arcoxia (etoricoxib) can help to modify this pain. The study will use questionnaires and tests of pain sensitivity to identify arthritis sufferers with more widespread, nerve-type pain and then to investigate whether a daily dose of Arcoxia is more effective than a placebo pill in reducing these symptoms and improving functional movements.

The study will also be comparing the same test results of a small group of subjects without knee pain.</summary>
