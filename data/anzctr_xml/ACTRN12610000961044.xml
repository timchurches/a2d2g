  <interventions>
    <interventions>EMA401 Sodium Salt will be administered as two single oral doses  of 100 mg EMA401 equivalent (4 x 25 mg capsules) on the same day with a 10 hour interval between doses, for a total daily dose of 200 mg. The treatment phase of the study will last for 1 day.
All subjects will be required to fast for at least 10 hours overnight prior to the first dose. The second dose will be administered 10 hours later.  Subjects will be allowed a light lunch between the first and second dosing occasion. Each dose will be administered with a minimum of 240 mL of non-carbonated water.  All subjects will consume no food until 4 hours post-dose.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of EMA401 in healthy elderly subjects, following two oral doses of EMA401 sodium salt, with a ten (10) hour interval between doses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A total of twenty-five (25) blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4 and 6 hours post-dose for the first dose, and at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose for the second dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety and tolerability of EMA401 in healthy elderly subjects, following two oral doses of EMA401 sodium salt, with a ten (10) hour interval between doses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The treatment phase of the study will last for 1 day. A single oral dose of 100 mg will be administered in the morning followed by a second oral dose of 100 mg 10 hours later. In this study, subjects will be confined to the study centre from the evening of Day -1 until the last pharmacokinetic blood sample is taken on the evening of Study Exit (Day 3), 48 hours post the second dose. During this time vital signs, physical examination, clinical laboratory determinations and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) readings will be performed. All subjects will be monitored for adverse events and concomitant medications for the duration of the study. All information received between consent and Study Exit (Day 3) will be recorded in the case report form.</timepoint>
