  <interventions>
    <interventions>The antibiotic course will be stopped when the patient's symptoms have substantially subsided.  The investigators will advise the patient when to stop antibiotics, based on symptoms scores assessed daily while taking antibiotics.  The criteria for stopping antibiotics, based on a symptom severity score of 1 (very mild) to 10 (most severe) will be all of the following:
1. More than 3 days after onset of symptoms
2. Symptom score 2 or less for feverishness (chills, sweats) and pain
3. Symptom score 3 or less or back to baseline for loss of appetite, body ache, skin symptoms/signs (redness, heat, swelling - if skin infection), urinary symptoms (dysuria, frequency - if urinary infection), cough improving (if chest infection), less than 50% volume of purulent sputum (if chest infection), less than 50% volume of nasal discharge or post-nasal drip (if sinus infection)
4. The patient feels ready to stop antibiotics. 

Adherence will be checked each day during antibiotic treatment. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The GP or ED doctor will contact the study team with a possible recruit.  The doctor will prescribe antibiotics according to local protocols (which are highlighted and promoted for patients treated during the study period).  Patients interested in being included in the study will be given written information then contacted and visited to discuss being in the trial.  Subjects will be randomised to either symptom-based or standard antibiotic duration according to pre-generated sequences.  Allocation will be performed by the principal investigator and will be concealed from the GP, patient and research assistant until it has been determined that the patient meets the criteria for the trial and has consented to being part of the trial. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When a doctor prescribes antibiotics, the usual advice is to finish the course.  Instead, patients often stop taking the antibiotics when they feel better.  This trial is designed to find out which strategy is better for a variety of mild to moderate infections treated in the community.  
More and more information now shows that shorter courses of antibiotics work as well as longer courses for many mild to moderate infections and that success can be predicted by certain symptoms of infection going away.  A shorter course of antibiotics is likely to cause fewer side effects and less resistance.  A longer course of antibiotics, in those who are slow to get better, may prevent the infection coming back.  
This is the first randomised trial we are aware of that formally tests whether it is best to finish a course of antibiotics or stop when the symptoms have substantially gone away.  we hypothesise that a symptom-based duration of antibiotic treatment will be equal or more effective than a standard course, with equal or less antibiotic consumption and treatment-emergent adverse effects.
