  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multicenter natural history study aims to expand the network of clinical research
      centers in FA, and to provide a framework for facilitating therapeutic interventions. In
      addition, this study will lead to the development of valid yet sensitive clinical measures
      crucial to outcome assessment of patients with Friedreich's Ataxia. This study will support
      genetic modifier studies, biomarker studies, and frataxin protein level assessments by
      building a sample repository.</summary>
