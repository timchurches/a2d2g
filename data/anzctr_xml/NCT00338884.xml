      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Overall Confirmed Objective Response (OR) - OR = subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) persisting &gt; = 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A PR was defined as a = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</outcome>
