Treatment: drugs - Rifampin
Treatment: drugs - Itraconazole

Experimental: 1 - 


Treatment: drugs: PF-02341066
Escalating doses of PF-02341066 will be administered orally on a continuous dosing schedule. Doses to be evaluated will range from 50 mg to 2000 mg/day administered either once or twice a day. A treatment cycle is considered to be 28 days (or 21 days depending on the cohort).

Treatment: drugs: Rifampin
600 mg QD administered from Cycle 1, Day 16 to Cycle 2, Day 1 (14 days of dosing) in combination with PF-02341066.

Treatment: drugs: Itraconazole
Multiple Dose Design: 200 mg QD administered from Cycle 1, Day 1 to Cycle 1, Day 16 (16 days) in combination with PF-02341066.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PF-02341066 may work in cancer by blocking the cell growth, migration and invasion of tumor
      cells. PF-02341066 is a new class of drugs called c-Met/Hepatocyte growth factor receptor
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors. This compound is also an inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma
      kinase (called ALK) tyrosine kinase and ROS receptor tyrosine kinases. This research study is
      the first time PF-02341066 will be given to people. PF-02341066 is taken by mouth daily.</summary>
