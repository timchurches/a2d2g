  <interventions>
    <interventions>The day after the study visit 1, visit 3 and visit 5 participants start 3 week supplementation of their normal diet with 1 of the 3 treatments. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal discomfort, the fiber supplementation will be gradually built up over the first 7 days, to a maximum of 3 beverages/day providing a total of 16g fiber/day. As a further precaution only 1 sachet will be consumed with each meal to spread fiber delivery across the day e.g. a single sachet with each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner).  During the build-up on days 1-3, 1 sachet/day taken at breakfast, on days 4-6, two sachets/day with one taken at breakfast and another at dinner; then for days 7-21 three sachets/day with one taken at breakfast, lunch and dinner. All treatments are administered as a beverage, prepared by the participant on the day from a sealed sachet of powder mixed with water. The amount of boysenberry is 48 g containing 16 g of fiber is to be mixed with a minimum of 350 mL of water. The amount of inulin is 42 g containing 16 g of fiber is to be mixed with a minimum of 350 mL of water. Participants will be asked to keep all of the used sachets plus any unused sachet. Our research staff will monitor the participant by telephone three times a week. There will be a minimum of three-week wash-out period in between the treatments.</interventions>
    <comparator>Boysenberry is compared with inulin, and maltodextrin is the placebo. The amount of inulin is 42 g containing 16 g of fiber is to be mixed with a minimum of 350 mL of water. 42 g of maltodextrin containing no fiber is also  to be mixed with a minimum of 350 mL of water. Only 1 sachet will be consumed with each meal to spread fiber delivery across the day e.g. a single sachet with each meal (breakfast, lunch and dinner).  During the build-up on days 1-3, 1 sachet/day taken at breakfast, on days 4-6, two sachets/day with one taken at breakfast and another at dinner; then for days 7-21 three sachets/day with one taken at breakfast, lunch and dinner. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Energy intake at the ad lib lunch meal is the primary outcome. Sample size has been calculated using the primary endpoint of energy intake at the ad libitum lunch meal.  The power calculations have used the assumptions of outcome differences of 400kJ, equivalent to a change of 10 percent in an individual consuming a typical lunch intake of 4 MJ/day (=4000 kJ/day). In order to inform as to the within-person standard deviation, numbers corresponding to the smallest (686kJ) and largest (990kJ) standard deviation from the previous trial were used. 
Paired data (cross-over)  continuous outcome (EI)
Anticipated standardised effect = [anticipated difference in outcome 400kJ]/[sd of difference of outcome variable measured on two occasionsestimated from previous studies]
In order to detect an outcome difference of 5% (500kJ) as significant at P&lt;0.05 
(i) = 400/686 = 0.73    80%=17 subjects; 90%=22 subjects
(ii) = 400/990 = 0.51    80%=33 subjects; 90%=42 subjects
Machin, D. et al.  Sample Size Tables for Clinical Studies, 3rd Edition, 2008.

The model based upon an estimated error variance taken from the previous study could be larger (or smaller) than previously observed &amp; hence the actual probability of detecting the effect is uncertain. Using the 80% confidence interval (worst case scenario) the number of subjects required is estimated to fall between 17-33 subjects. Based on these calculations, 20 participants will be recruited.

    <summary>Background: Berryfruits supplementation is predicted to be able to activate satiety mechanisms which may suppress both hunger and food intake.
Objective: The aims of the research are to determine whether berryfruits supplementation suppresses appetite, decreases the amount of food intake, and causes short-term
weight loss.
Design: This will be a 3-treatment cross-over intervention study comprising 20 overweight postmenopausal women. The study will compare two types of dietary fiber (boysenberry, inulin) and a non-fiber placebo (maltodextrin) supplementation. Each treatment will be self-administered 3 times a day for a 3 week period, separated by a minimum 3 weeks break.
Participants will take part in a 4-month study, with 6 study visits to the Human Nutrition Unit.
Outcome variables: Throughout the study visits, ratings of hunger, fullness and appetite related sensations will be measured via questionaires at various time intervals. Blood samples will also be collected different time points throughout the day for appetite hormones measurements. Energy intake will also be measured from the buffet
lunch meal where they can eat as much as they want until comfortably full. In addition, participants will be asked to complete a 3-day food record prior to each study visit to see whether their hunger is changing. Participants will also be asked to take fecal sample prior to each study visit for analysis of short chain fatty acids and microorganisms to investigate whether the berryfruit drinks are altering bateria in their colon.</summary>
