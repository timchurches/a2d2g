  <interventions>
    <interventions>Provision of a smartphone mobile phone application to assist in smoking cessation. The application is accessible via the iTunes or Google Play store to registered trial participants who have been randomised to receive the intervention and will be available for 6 months. The application has a range of features to assist with smoking cessation including SMS motivational messages at a frequency customised by the participant, educational tips on health improvements associated with smoking cessation, access to smoking cessation counselling support via Quitline and a social engagement function where participants are able to challenge other people to quit smoking related actions. Participants are free to use the app as much or as little as they choose. Usage will be assessed through data extracted from the software platform at the end of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual health care will be provided by the participant's usual healthcare provider. This consists of brief intervention smoking cessation advice, recommending smoking cessation therapies such as nicotine replacement therapy and access to counselling support through services such as Quitline.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported continuous abstinence as assessed by either face to face or telephone interview and verified by carbon monoxide breath analysis.
This is defined as no more than five cigarettes smoked in the past week at 4 weeks follow-up AND no more than five cigarettes smoked since the start of the abstinence period at 6 months of follow-up. A carbon monoxide metre breath test at 6 months of follow-up of &gt;8 represents recent tobacco smoking.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks and 6 months post randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported point prevalence of abstinence as assessed by either face to face or telephone interview and verified by carbon monoxide breath analysis. Point prevalence abstinence is defined as no more than five cigarettes smoked in the past 7 days. A carbon monoxide metre breath test at 6 months of follow-up of &gt;8 represents recent tobacco smoking.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks and 6 months post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported continuous abstinence since the start of the abstinence period as assessed by either face to face or telephone interview and verified by carbon monoxide breath analysis.
This is defined as no more than five cigarettes smoked since the start of the abstinence period (as reported by the participant) and will be assessed at 6 months post randomisation. A carbon monoxide metre breath test at 6 months of follow-up of &gt;8 represents recent tobacco smoking.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported 28 day abstinence as assessed by either face to face or telephone interview and verified by carbon monoxide breath analysis. This is defined as no more than five cigarettes smoked in the 28 days prior to the 6 month follow-up visit. A carbon monoxide metre breath test at 6 months post randomisation of &gt;8 represents recent tobacco smoking.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous studies the abstinence rate is assumed to be double that of the control arm. 1000 participants would be needed to detect a 5% absolute difference (ie: 10.0% vs 5.0%; relative risk 2.00), assuming a 15% loss to follow-up, 2a=0.05 and 80% probability of detecting a significant difference with p values &lt;0.05 judged as significant. This study will be a pilot RCT in which 200 participants will be recruited to assess feasibility, resource considerations, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness data to inform a future, adequately powered trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial will test whether a smartphone app, when combined with usual smoking cessation support services, will double smoking abstinence rates at 6 months for Aboriginal people trying to make a quit attempt.

This study will be a pilot randomised controlled trial involving approximately 200 Aboriginal smokers. Data will be collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months by a project officer who is blinded to group allocation. Eligible participants are consenting Aboriginal people (aged over 16 years), with access to an Android or iOS phone and who are willing to make a quit attempt in the next month.</summary>
