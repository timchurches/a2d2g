  <interventions>
    <interventions>It is proposed to evaluate a selenised dairy product (Tatura Bio Se®, TMI Victoria) in a human intervention study with regard to  its safety and influence on selenium status, using plasma and rectal biomarkers. 
A group of &gt;50 year old volunteers considered at-risk for colon cancer by virtue of age and/or other standard risk factors. 
Particpants will commence with a wash out period of 2-4 wks instructing them not to add selenium products to their diet
10 participants will be allocated Se Milk Protein Concentrate 150µg/d and a different group of 10 will be allocated Selplex 150µg/d at the same time i.e to run in parallel
Each participant will undertake a follow on wash out period of 6 weeks. 
Blood samples will be taken every 2 weeks throughout the intervention and wash out periods
Rectal pinch biopsies will be performed for bowel tissue samples at the beginning and end of each intervention and at the end of the follow-on washout period.</interventions>
    <comparator>It will be compared for its efficacy and bioavailability with a selenium yeast (Sel-plex ?,Alltech) product.</comparator>
