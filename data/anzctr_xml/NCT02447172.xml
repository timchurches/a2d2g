             following clinical manifestations of a moderate or severe infection based on the
             Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for the "Diagnosis and Treatment of
             Diabetic Foot Infections" (CID 2012; 54:132-173) (IDSA guidelines):

          -  has = 2 manifestations of inflammation (local swelling or induration, erythema, local
             tenderness or pain, local warmth, purulent discharge (thick, opaque to white or
             sanguineous secretion)

          -  has = 1 of the following characteristics: erythema &gt; 2cm, or involving structures
             deeper than skin and subcutaneous tissues (e.g. abscess, osteomyelitis, septic
             arthritis, fasciitis) For patients with multiple infected ulcers, the ulcer with the
             highest Diabetic Foot Infection Wound score (DFI score) must be on or below the
             malleolus and all infected ulcers must be completely coverable using no more than 4
             sponges (sponges cannot be cut).

             dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses, or normal Doppler wave forms, a toe blood

          -  Has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to bovine collagen.

          -  Has an ulcer infection which, based upon the patient's known history of
             hypersensitivity and/or as otherwise in the opinion of the investigator, cannot be
             adequately treated with at least one of the empiric systemic antibiotic regimens
             allowed by this protocol.

          -  Has an ulcer associated with prosthetic material or an implanted device.

          -  Has received any systemic or topical antibiotic therapy for any reason within 7 days
             of randomization unless it was administered to specifically treat the infected
             ulcer(s) and only within 36 hours of randomization.

          -  Requires or is likely to require treatment with any concomitant topical product or
             wound therapy before the first follow-up study visit.

             the study, in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Has a history of myasthenia gravis or other neurological condition where gentamicin

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase 3, randomized, controlled, blinded, multicenter study conducted in 3 parallel
      cohorts of diabetic patients with at least 1 infected foot ulcer. Patients will be randomized
      to receive 1 of 3 study treatments; systemic antibiotic therapy and standard ulcer care with
      either (A) daily application of a gentamicin-sponge, (B) daily application of a
      placebo-sponge or (C) no-sponge, in the ratio 2:1:1. Patients will be treated for
      approximately 28 days and return to the clinic weekly for safety and efficacy assessments.
      After completing treatment, patients will return to the clinic for scheduled follow-up visits
      approximately 10, 30, 60 and 90 days after treatment is stopped.</summary>
