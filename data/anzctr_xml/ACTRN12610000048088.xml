  <interventions>
    <interventions>Health education DVD: narrative 10min Cartoon video. Content: story about a boy who gets infected with STH because of unhygienic bahaviour. Key messages: 1) symptoms of the disease. 2) where and how can children get infected. 3) how can disease be prevented. DVD will be shown twice in October 2010 and twice in March 2011 at each of the 30 intervention schools. The Albendazole treatment will take place twice, once after the baseline parasitological survey in October 2010 and once after the folow-up parasitological survey in June 2011.
Albendazole treatment of positives: a single oral dose of Albendazole (400mg) according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment:
Traditional health education material: textbook-based general hygiene education and wallposters in school. Frequency of textbook based teaching: twice per semester, schoolyear 3-6, total of one year intervention. Wallposter: permanent during intervention.

Albendazole treatment of positives: same as for intervention group</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child's knowledge on infection risk of soil-transmitted helminth will be assessed with baseline and  follow-up questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Knowledge will be assessed at baseline and up to one month following the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in infection risk behaviour will be assessed with standardised behaviour observation at school during 10 days before and after intervention. Behaviour observation involves teachers observing schoolchildren's behaviour at school. With the help of an observation form the teachers assess whether the schoolchildren are 1) wearing shoes, 2) washing hands after toilet and before eating, 3) eating raw fruit and vegetables, 4) drinking unboiled tapwater, 5) defacating outside latrines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>infection risk behaviour will be assessed at baseline and daily up to 10 days following the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Soil-transmitted helminth infection rate will be assessed by follow-up parasitological stool tests using Kato-Katz thick smear to count the parasite eggs per species.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Soil-transmitted helminth infection rate will be assessed once at baseline and once after the intervention. Infection rate assessments will be carried out within one month after the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary purpose of the study: To find out whether educational videos targeting intestinal worm prevention at school widens the students' knowledge and changes their behaviour, resulting in fewer STH infections in Hunan Province, China.
The following hypothesis will be tested: 
-The intervention groups knowledge on intestinal worms transmission, symptoms, treatment and their disease awareness/notion will increase. 
-The intervention groups infection risk behaviour will change more significantly such that the risk of intestinal worm re-infection decreases. 
-Less intestinal worm re-infections will occur in the intervention group due to the video. 
With the help of questionnaires, behaviour observations and parasitological stool examinations, the effect of the video will be tested in 30 intervention schools (video shown) and compared with the outcome in 30 control schools (video not shown).</summary>
