  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vorinostat is a drug (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor [HDACi]) administered orally that has
      been approved in United States for the patients with cutaneous Tcell lymphoma (CTCL) who have
      progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies.

      In the early period of treatment with vorinostat, some patients may experience low platelet
      counts. Therefore this study will be examining the combination of these two medications
      (Vorinostat and eltrombopag) to assess if eltrombopag can overcome the low platelets during
      treatment with vorinostat.

      Eltrombopag is a drug administered orally designed to mimic the protein thrombopoietin, which
      causes the body to make more platelets. Eltrombopag has been registered in Australia and
      approved overseas to treat patients with chronic ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura) a
      disease where patients destroy their own platelets very rapidly and thus develop low platelet
      count) but it is not registered and it is not yet known whether eltrombopag can increase
      platelet counts in patients treated with the HDACi.

      The aim of this project is to test whether Vorinostat and eltrombopag can be safely combined,
      and to test whether they are effective in participants with T-cell lymphoma involving the
      skin or patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma
      (MZL), or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)

      A total of 25 people with Cutaneous T cell lymphoma/ CTCL, marginal zone lymphoma, follicular
      lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma will be recruited in this study.</summary>
