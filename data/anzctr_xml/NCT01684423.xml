    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)
Treatment: drugs - Active comparator
Treatment: drugs - Rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) suspension

Experimental: Rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) tablet, OD, Age: 12 - &lt;18 - Subjects aged from 12 - &lt;18 years were administered with age and body weight-adjusted oral dose of rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) IR (immediate-release) tablet once daily (OD) under fed conditions for 30 days. Subjects with a body weight of 14 to less than 50 kilogram (kg) received a dose (equivalent to 20 milligram [mg] in adults) ranging from 5 to 15 mg, and subjects with a body weight (comparable to adults) of greater than or equal to 50 kg received a dose of 20 mg.

Active Comparator: Comparator, Age: 12 - &lt;18 years - Subjects aged from 12 - &lt;18 years received comparator as per standard of care. The dosage given was to be adjusted based on the individual body weight (low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux) or international normalized ratio (INR) adjusted (vitamin K antagonist).

Experimental: Rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) tablet, OD, Age: 6 - &lt;12 years - Subjects aged from 6 - &lt;12 years were administered with age- and body weight-adjusted oral dose of rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) IR tablet once daily under fed conditions for 30 days. Subjects with a body weight of 14 to less than 50 kg received a dose (equivalent to 20 mg in adults) ranging from 5 to 15 mg, and subjects with a body weight (comparable to adults) of greater than or equal to 50 kg received a dose of 20 mg.

Experimental: Rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) suspension, BID, Age: 6 - &lt;12 years - Subjects aged from 6 - &lt;12 years were administered with age- and body weight-adjusted oral dose of rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) suspension under fed conditions twice daily (BID). Subjects with a body weight of 9 to less than 50 kg received a total daily dose (equivalent to 20 mg in adults) ranging from 6.4 to 15 mg and subjects with a body weight of greater than or equal to 50 kg received a total daily dose of 20 mg.

Active Comparator: Comparator, Age: 6 - &lt;12 years - Subjects aged from 6 - &lt;12 years received comparator as per standard of care. The dosage given was to be adjusted based on the individual body weight (low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux) or INR-adjusted (vitamin K antagonist).


Treatment: drugs: Rivaroxaban (Xarelto, BAY59-7939)
Subjects were administered with age- and body weight-adjusted oral dose of rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) IR tablet once daily under fed conditions for 30 days.

Treatment: drugs: Active comparator
Subjects received comparator as per standard of care. The dosage given was to be adjusted based on the individual body weight (low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux) or international normalized ratio (INR) adjusted (vitamin K antagonist).

Treatment: drugs: Rivaroxaban (BAY59-7939) suspension

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Major and Clinically Relevant Non-Major Bleeding Events - Central independent adjudication committee (CIAC) classified bleeding as follows: Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding and:
associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 gram/decilitre (g/dL) or more, or
leading to a transfusion of the equivalent of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood in adults, or
occurring in a critical site, e.g. intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal, or
contributing to death.
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding, but associated with:
medical intervention, or
unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or
cessation (temporary) of study treatment, or
discomfort for the child such as pain or
impairment of activities of daily life (such as loss of school days or hospitalization).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of study drug administration until end of the 30-day treatment period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Symptomatic Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism - The occurrence of recurrent venous thromboembolism was summarized by age group. Symptomatic recurrence of venous thrombosis was documented by the appropriate imaging test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of study drug administration until end of the 30-day treatment period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Asymptomatic Deterioration in Thrombotic Burden - The occurrence of asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden was summarized by age group. Asymptomatic deterioration in thrombotic burden was documented by the appropriate imaging test and the results were classified as normalized, improved, no relevant change, deteriorated, not evaluable or not available.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Repeat imaging at the end of the 30 day treatment period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
