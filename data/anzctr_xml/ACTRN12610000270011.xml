  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized phase III trial of irinotecan in combination with capecitabine or 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin and bevacizumab: (xeliri-bevacizumab vs folfiri-bevacizumab) as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary objective of this study is to test the antineoplastic activity, expressed as progression-free survival, of XELIRI regimen vs FOLFIRI, in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer not previously treated for advanced disease. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the convenience and safety of the two regimens as well as to evaluate the response rate and the overall survival.</summary>
