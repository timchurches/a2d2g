    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Double-blinded. We will blind the participants to their intervention. We will also blind the investigators and data collectors (who will see participants at regular follow-up) to whether the participant they are seeing is in the treatment or placebo group. Finally, we will also blind the investigators conducting or reporting on investigations such as CTCA or endothelial dysfunction (FMD or EndoPAT) to whether the participants undergoing the investigations are in the placebo or treatment group. This blinding process will remain intact over the entire course of the study (from allocation to final follow-up after one year post treatment commencement). The method of allocation concealment will be central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. We will recruit approximately 320 to 360 patients in a 1:1 ratio of treatment to placebo. These numbers are based on a sample size calculation assuming power of 80-90% and using the outcomes generated by the LoDoCo trial of low-dose colchicine in patients with stable coronary artery disease over 3 years. These numbers are also higher than other studies which used serial CTCA to assess plaque progression and changes in plaque characteristics after a specific intervention. For example, in 2013, Zeb at al. enrolled 100 patients who underwent serial CTCA to assess coronary plaque progression in patients who received statin therapy compared to those who did not. Similarly, in 2010, Inoue et al. enrolled 32 patients who also underwent serial CTCA to assess changes in plaque morphology in 24 patients who received statins compared to 8 who did not. Finally, in 2015, Auscher et al. enrolled 140 patients with a myocardial infarction of whom 96 underwent serial CTCA to assess the effect of early aggressive statin therapy versus standard statin therapy on plaque volume and composition.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inflammation plays a pivotal role in atherosclerosis, offering new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease.

Colchicine is a commonly used anti-inflammatory medication approved for the treatment of gout, Familial Mediterranean Fever, and acute/recurrent pericarditis. There is an increasing body of evidence in the medical literature supporting a beneficial role of long term colchicine therapy in prevention of cardiovascular disease, via modulation of inflammatory cytokine production and tubulin-mediated mitosis inhibition. This includes both primary prevention in patients treated with colchicine for gout or Familial Mediterranean Fever, and secondary prevention in patients with stable coronary artery disease who are also being treated with statins and anti-platelet agents.

Low-dose colchicine use has also been proven to be safe, well tolerated, and is inexpensive and readily available.

In this randomised clinical trial, we will aim to primarily document changes in coronary plaque volume and stability objectively by computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) at baseline and one-year follow-up, in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with low-dose (0.5 mg/day) colchicine compared to placebo for a year. We will also use non-invasive methods of assessing endothelial dysfunction such as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) using ultrasound, and endothelium-mediated changes in digital pulse waveform signal and pulse amplitude tonometry (EndoPAT) after reactive hyperaemia, using a pair of modified plethysmographic finger probes. These will also be assessed at baseline and at one-year follow-up, to support our findings. Secondary outcomes will assess major adverse clinical events (MACE) such as acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke during the one year follow-up period.</summary>
