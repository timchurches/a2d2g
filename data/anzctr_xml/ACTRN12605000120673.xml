  <interventions>
    <interventions>All subjects will be asked to complete screening questionnaires (the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, The Berlin Questionnaire, the Multivariate Apnea Index and a comfort and ease of use questionnaire) and these will take 3 minutes to complete. Anthropometric and demographic data will also be collected. Participants will be assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 will have their nasal flow measured with a nasal flow pressure transducer and their oxygen concentration measured with an oximeter for one night in parallel with in-laboratory full polysomnography (PSG) which involves monitoring sleep, ventilation and muscle activity. Group 2 subjects will have within an 8 week period (according to the patient circumstances and laboratory availability) one night of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) and 2 consecutive sets of three nights each at home using oximetry alone and nasal flow monitoring alone in random order without a resting period between each set. They will also be asked to complete the Karolinska Sleep diary for each night at home while using each device. This will take 2 minutes to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>For Group 1 In-laboratory full
polysomnography will be compared to single channel nasal flow and oximetry and for group 2 in-laboratory full PSG will be compared to 2 sets of
three nights each at home on oximetry alone and nasal flow alone in
random order. Subjects will also complete the Karolinska Sleep diary for
each night at home while using each device.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common disorder. It is linked to heart disease, stroke high blood pressure and poor cognition as well as motor vehicle and work accidents. However till now the diagnostic gold standard is in hospital overnight sleep study. This is expensive time consuming and has limited availability. Studies investigating the use of simple single channel monitors for OSA detection at home have predominantly involved device that measure oxygen in the blood (oximeters) with limited data available for devices that measure breathing (nasal flow). Our aim was to assess and compare the validity of nasal flow and oximetry recordings using separate single channel monitors in the laboratory on the same night as the sleep study and at home for a single and three nights each with respect to the laboratory sleep study.</summary>
