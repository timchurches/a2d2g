  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a factorial trial which means we are testing two types of intervention in the same patients starting at the same time. This means that all patients will be in both the Drug trial and the Lifestyle trial at the same time until the final 3 months of the trial when they will only be on the diet. This is also a parallel study design which means once a patient has been randomly allocated to their intervention groups they will not crossover to the other intervention program. At baseline patients will see an exercise physiologist and dietitian for approximately 1.5 hours in an individual consultation. They will then participate in individual sessions conducted by the exercise physiologist/dietitian running for 1.5-2 hours at 2 weeks, 1 month and 4.5 month timepoints. Patients will also recieve a phonecall from exercise physiologist/dietitian at 1.5 months to review their progress. Further approx 1 hour individual consultations at 6, 9 and 12 months to review their progress with the dietitian and exercise physiologist. The Drug Trial is a Superiority Trial (i.e. is the drug better than the placebo?): 3x50mg tablets (ie 150mg) of Armodafinil or placebo once in the morning for 9 months. The Lifestyle Trial is an Equivalence Trial (i.e. are these two diets similarly effective interventions?): Participants will also be randomly allocated for 12 months to either a low GI/high protein diet or a standard low calorie diet as a part of an individualized lifestyle modification program also providing exercise and lifestyle recommendations.</interventions>
    <comparator>Diet: low GI/high protein diet compared with standard low calorie diet. The program will be individualized.
Drug: Control group placebo- 3 x 50mg (ie 150mg) sugar pill tablets in the morning for 9 months will be the control for 3 x 50mg (ie 150mg) Armodafinil.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Only eligible adults providing written informed consent, according to the protocol approved by the local ethics committee, will be enrolled into the trial. OSA patients will be enrolled sequentially according to two pre-allocated randomisation lists stratified at the cut-line between Class 1 and 2 obesity (Class 1 30-35 BMI; Class 2 35-40 BMI) and randomised to a 2 x 2 factorial design in either: 1. Armodafinil (3x50mg tablets (ie 150mg): morning) OR an identical placebo for 9 months. 2. Standard low calorie diet, lifestyle and exercise program OR a low GI and High protein diet, lifestyle and exercise program. Allocation concealment in the drug trial will be achieved by numbered containers of the drug that have been prepared according to entry numbers into the trial. This list has been generated by an independent statistician and investigators in the trial will not have access to this list until the end of the trial. Allocation concealment in the diet trial will be achieved via sealed opaque envelopes prepared by the trial epidemiologist who will play no role in the recruitment of patients.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical trial for patients with sleep apnea who cannot use the standard treatments: continuous positive airway pressure machines or mandibular advancement splints. In this study we are testing two types of treatments at the same time, one a drug-based treatment and one a diet and exercise treatment, in combination we hope these will reduce sleep apnea and control its daytime symptoms. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two types of diet for 12 months, a standard low calorie diet versus a diet which is high in protein and low in glycemic index (Low GI). Both of these groups will participate in the same lifestyle program promoting activity, exercise and healthier choices.
The drug based treatment is testing a drug called Armodafinil for 9 months. Armodafinil is a drug that promotes wakefulness but does not improve your sleep apnea directly. So we think that it may improve other secondary outcomes including ability to concentrate, particularly whilst driving. We will be comparing Armodafinil to an inert placebo which does not have any active ingredient.</summary>
