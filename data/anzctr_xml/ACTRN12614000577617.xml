  <interventions>
    <interventions>Merino Encircle Compression Stocking(s) will be provided for 42 days. These stockings are made of Merino and are below knee. They are avaliable in 3 different compression classes (A1-A3), providing up to 40mmHg compression. Classes will be matched to those provided by participant's previous stockings. They will be asked to don stockings in place of their usual stocking regimen.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate patient satisfaction following the use of Merino Encircle Compression Stocking(s) and to compare them to the stocking(s) they usually use. The study is funded by the Encircle Medical Devices, who manufacture them. The study is run by the Orthotic Centre Wellington and the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. At least twenty patients will be asked to take part in this study. We are inviting patients currently using below knee compression stockings to take part. Participants will be provided with Merino stockings to wear for six weeks instead of their usual stockings. The study will involve three visits to the Orthotic Centre Wellington. At the first visit we ask general questions about health and provide a questionnaire about symptoms. We will measure leg circumference and fit the Merino Encircle Compression Stocking(s). At visit 2 (within two weeks) we will provide another questionnaire and measure leg circumference. At visit 3 (6 weeks) we provide a questionnaire and measure leg circumference</summary>
