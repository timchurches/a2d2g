  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Colorectal anastomosis /joins in the colon following surgery leak around 2%. From previous studies we are aware that the most important reason being decreased blood supply. To this date there are lots of studies looking at how to detect anastomotic leaks, But very few studies in predicting anastomotic leak. We believe a prospective study which involves measuring blood flow with the help of rectal laser doppler probe used preoperatively and then post operatively will help us	in predicting which anastomosis are more prone to leak. The proposed study is a non-randomised study.All participants who are considered for bowel anastomosis at the participating hospital will comprise the study sample. After obtaining an informed consent from the participants the study will be conducted. The laser doppler flowmetry is a well established method for providing non-invasive real time measurements of blood flow within local tissue</summary>
