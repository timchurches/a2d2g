  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have previously been shown to
complain of poor sleep, daytime fatigue and sleepiness. This has been seen in large studies
based on questionnaires, however a US study of over 2,000 participants with mild COPD found
little sleep disturbance. This study will measure sleep quality and symptoms of sleep
disturbance in a group of participants with moderate to severe COPD and correlate perceived
with actual sleep disturbance.
Thirty participants with moderate to severe COPD (defined as at least 1 standard deviation
below the lower limit of their predicted function) will complete questionnaires measuring quality
of life, symptoms of respiratory and sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness. They will be
required to have a stable regimen of treatment for their lung disease and no significant medical
or psychological conditions which could prevent them completing the study. Standard clinical
spirometry will be performed and an in-laboratory sleep study carried out. This sleep study will
monitor sleep, airflow, oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during the night, as
accumulation of CO2 during the night in these patients may contribute to sleep disruption and
fragmentation. Participants will be asked to describe the quality of their sleep and this will be
compared to the measured sleep, as sleep perception is thought to be poor in these patients.
The outcomes of the study will be a description of sleep architecture, including the number of
changes in sleep stage. It is thought that sleep stage transitions are important for daytime
sleepiness. The degree of sleep fragmentation will be correlated with the sleep questionnaire
outcomes and also with the severity and other measures of the respiratory function.</summary>
