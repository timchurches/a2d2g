  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thus study aims to investigate new methods of treating a specific cause of hip pain, where the top of the thigh bone hits against the pelvic bone. Existing keyhole surgery techniques will be combined with a new computer-assisted method to determine if the surgery can be improved. Patients will be assessed before and after their operation to measure activity, pain and quality of life.</summary>
