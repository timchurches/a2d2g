    <studytitle>The aDOPT Trial (Dose Optimisation Prior to Transplant):
In kidney transplantation, can pre-transplant blood levels of mycophenolic acid (MPA) help to optimise individual patient's post-transplant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dose to improve outcomes?	
</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In adults and children undergoing renal transplantation, does dose individualisation of Mycophenolate Mofetil based on a pre-transplant pharmacokinetic assessment improve post-transplant drug exposure, compared to post transplant exposure on standard fixed doses  -  as assessed by an increased proportion of patients within therapeutic range from early (day 3-5) post transplant in the dose individualised group.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial involves administering a drug (MMF) at an unapproved time, for the purposes of pharmacokinetic analysis. We plan to compare pre-renal transplant pharmacokinetics with post-renal transplant pharmacokinetics, on the same dose. 
This drug is standard care post-renal transplant. Post-transplant intervention is purely the pharmacokinetic assessment.
We aim to test proof-of-concept that a pre-transplant MPA concentration assessment (TDM) improves early post-transplant MPA exposure, in a prospective pharmacokinetic trial. All patients will have standard dose MMF pre- and post-renal transplant.  We will model a virtual data set of the exposure to MPA which would have occurred if we had adjusted the dose based on the pre-transplant PK assessment.

We will additionally model peri-transplant change in MPA pharmacokinetics. 

Oral mycophenolate mofetil will be administered for 4 days, at a within 1 month prior to planned living donor renal transplant, with pharmacokinetic assessment on day 4. For planned cadaveric donor renal transplant, there is no restriction on dosing and PK assessment timing (and transplant date is unknown).

Following renal transplantation, mycophenolate mofetil will be administered as part of standard care, and we will perform repeat pharmacokinetic assessment on around day 4 and day 8.

The pre-transplant dose will be whatever the treating clinician plans to administer post-transplant (there is some practice variation between centres and depending on individual patient risk).
For adults this will be either MMF 1g oral twice daily or 1.5g oral twice daily.
For children this will be between 300mg/m2/dose oral twice daily to 600mg/m2/dose oral twice daily.

Adherence will be monitored by medication return, and patients will fill out a dosing sheet to document time of each administration. The day 4 MMF dose will be observed.</interventions>
    <comparator>MMF is already standard care post-transplant.
All patients will have standard dose MMF pre- and post-renal transplant.  
For adults this will be either MMF 1g oral twice daily or 1.5g oral twice daily. For children this will be between 300mg/m2/dose oral twice daily to 600mg/m2/dose oral twice daily.

We will model a virtual data set of the exposure to MPA which would have occurred if we had adjusted the dose based on the pre-transplant PK assessment (a virtual intervention group).

The outcomes are post-transplant exposure to MPA.
The control arm will be the measured MPA exposure on standard dosing.
The intervention arm will be a virtual pharmacokinetically modelled arm of MPA exposure from individualised doses.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients in the TDM-controlled dose arm within therapeutic range in the early post-transplant period.
This will be based on the MPA exposure - the MPA AUC over 12 hours (MPA AUC12). Serum assays of MPA concentration from a dosing interval will be used to estimate the MPA AUC over 12 hours, using the log-linear trapezoidal rule.

A two-group chi-square test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a (standard dose) group proportion, p1, of 0.54 and a (individualized dose) group proportion, p2, of 0.790 when the sample size in each group is 55.</outcome>

Population analysis will be performed based on all MPA concentration assays collected throughout the trial. The analysis will be performed using NONMEM.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MPA concentration-time profiles will be collected prior to renal transplantation, and at 2 post-transplant dosing intervals. The first will be between day 3-5 post-transplant, the second between days 7-10 post transplant.

The population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed once all data is collected (at end of 2 year trial period).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The largest analysis of effective TDM-controlled dosing of MMF in the early post transplant period showed 54% of patients within therapeutic range versus 79%, in fixed versus TDM-controlled dosing respectively. 

A two-group chi-square test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a (standard dose) group proportion, p1, of 0.54 and a (individualized dose) group proportion, p2, of 0.790 when the sample size in each group is 55. Because each patient provides the data for their (measured) standard dose exposure and (modelled) individualised dose exposure, a total of 55 patients are required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Each individual differs in how his/her body handles a medication, meaning that even when every patient is given the exact same dose, each person can end up with a very different concentration of the drug in the blood. It is the drug concentration in the body, not the dose given, which determines a drugs effects  both its benefits and unwanted side effects. This drug concentration is critical for many anti-rejection drugs used in kidney transplantation, because of the delicate balance between giving enough to prevent rejection and loss of the transplant kidney, whilst minimising adverse effects of the medication.  

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is one of the most important anti-rejection drugs that have improved kidney transplant outcomes. We are testing whether giving patients MMF before their kidney transplant, and testing the concentrations in their blood, allow us to optimally dose each individual's MMF dose from the time of transplant. This potentially means that a patient can be on the best, personalised dose from the start. 
This has the potential to reduce transplant rejection rates and improve outcomes, whilst also reducing harmful effects of MMF, with an overall improvement in quality of life.</summary>
