  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Final Overall Survival (OS) - Primary Analysis in the ITT (Intent To Treat) Population - Overall survival determined as the time (days) from the date of randomization at start of study to the date of death, due to any cause. Outcome measure was assessed regularly, i.e. every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks during treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter and approximately every 3 months during post-treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of randomization of the first subject (1Dec2003) until the data cut-off (8Sep2006) for the final OS analysis, approximately 33 months later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Final Overall Survival - Secondary Analysis (Placebo Data Censored at 30June2005) in the ITT Population - Overall survival determined as the time (days) from the date of randomization at start of study to the date of death, due to any cause. Outcome measure was assessed regularly, i.e. every 3 weeks for the first 24 weeks during treatment and every 4 weeks thereafter and approximately every 3 months during post-treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of randomization of the first subject (1Dec2003) until the data cut-off (8Sep2006) for the final OS analysis, approximately 33 months later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Final Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - Independent Radiological Review - PFS determined as the time (days) from the date of randomization at start of study to the actual date of disease progression (PD) (radiological or clinical) or death due to any cause, if death occurred before PD. Outcome measure was assessed approximately every 8 weeks using RECIST v1.0 criteria by independent radiologic review. Radiological PD defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter (LD) of measured lesions taking as reference smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started or appearance of new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of randomization of the first subject (1Dec2003) until the data cut-off (28Jan2005), approximately 14 months later, tumors assessed every 8 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Overall Response - Independent Radiological Review - Best overall response was determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0 by independent radiologic review. Categories: complete response (CR, tumor disappears), partial response (PR, sum of lesion sizes decreased), stable disease (SD, steady state of disease), progressive disease (PD, sum of lesion sizes increased) and not evaluated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of randomization of the first subject (1Dec2003) until the data cut-off (28Jan2005), approximately 14 months later, tumors assessed every 8 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) by FKSI-10 (Functional Assessment of General Therapy Kidney Symptom Index 10) Assessment - Primary Analysis for FKSI-10 patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure defined as longitudinal analysis of mean score over the first 5 treatment cycles. FKSI-10 patient responses for each question range from "0=not at all" to "4=very much" and after reverse coding the range of values for FKSI-10 total score is from 0 to 40; higher score represents better HRQOL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of randomization of the first subject (1Dec2003) until the data cut-off (31May2005), approximately 18 months later, PRO data collected at Day 1 of each cycle and end of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) by Physical Well-Being (PWB) Score of the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Version) Assessment - Primary Analysis for FACT-G (using PWB score) patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure defined as longitudinal analysis of mean score over the first 5 treatment cycles. FACT-G (PWB score) patient responses for each question range from "0=not at all" to "4=very much" and after reverse coding the total FACT-G (PWB score) range of values is from 0 to 28; higher score represents better HRQOL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From start of randomization of the first subject (1Dec2003) until the data cut-off (31May2005), approximately 18 months later, PRO data collected at Day 1 of each cycle and end of treatment.</timepoint>
