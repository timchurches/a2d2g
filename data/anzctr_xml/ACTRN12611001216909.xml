  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is one of the most pressing health issues in Fiji today. It is estimated that 40% of Fijis population suffer from type 2 diabetes. Several public health strategies have been used to address this issue but there has not been a significant change in the figures. Therefore, pharmacological intervention may be of value in curbing the problem. Medical literature suggests that early therapy with insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents are of benefit in delaying complications of diabetes in newly diagnosed patients. On this note, this proposed study will focus on the effectiveness of insulin therapy and insulin/metformin combination therapy in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glucose.

The study is based on the fact that impaired glucose tolerance to frank type2 diabetes is the progressive loss of insulin secretary capacity (functioning pancreatic beta cells). It is therefore, hypothesized that administration of insulin in patients at risk of developing diabetes will give time to the pancreatic beta cells to rest and regenerate. Animal studies have shown that high rate of glucose metabolism triggers beta cells to regenerate.

The proposed study will be based in Suva and include 45 subjects having an impaired glucose tolerance or an impaired fasting glucose. 15 patients will be given a dose of long-acting insulin, 15 patients will be given a combination dose of long-acting insulin/metformin, while the other 15 will be the control group. Serum insulin, HbA1c, BMI and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance results will be recorded at regular intervals. The study will proceed for 3 months. The study also involves the checking of the results after 1 year since the beginning of the trial.</summary>
