Experimental: Cohort 1 - Subjects in this cohort will receive dose 1 every four weeks (Q4W) subcutaneously (sc) during the 48-week open-label Treatment Period. There will be an option to increase the dose to dose 2 Q4W at the discretion of the Investigator if the subject's Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) response is &gt;=50% to &lt;75% reduction from the Baseline of PS0016 at Week 12 or later. If the subject's disease is adequately controlled on dose 2 Q4W, they may return to dose 1 Q4W at the discretion of the Investigator.


Treatment: drugs: Bimekizumab
Bimekizumab will be administered subcutaneously in 2 different doses.

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects previously participating in this study

          -  Subject has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could jeopardize or would compromise the subject's ability to
             participate in this study. Note: For any subject with an ongoing serious adverse event
             (SAE), or a history of serious infections (including herpes zoster or
             hospitalizations) in PS0016, the Medical Monitor must be consulted prior to the
             subject's entry into PS0018

          -  Subject has any current sign or symptom that may indicate a medically significant
             infection

          -  Subject has current clinically active infection with Histoplasma, Coccidiodes,
             Paracoccidioides, Pneumocystis, tuberculosis (TB), nontuberculous mycobacteria
             (NTMB),Blastomyces, Aspergillus, or Candidiasis (systemic). Any subject diagnosed with
             Histoplasmosis, Coccidiodes, Paracoccidiodes, Pneumocystis, TB, NTMB, Blastomyces,
             Aspergillus, or Candidiasis (systemic) during PS0016 is excluded from PS0018 even if
             treatment has been completed.

          -  Any subject who meets any withdrawal criteria in the feeder study (PS0016) is excluded
             from participating in the open-label extension study (PS0018)</exclusivecriteria>
