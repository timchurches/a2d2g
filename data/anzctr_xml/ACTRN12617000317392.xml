  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive GLITtER, integrated into the routine Spinal Assessment Clinic (SAC) consultation at the Royal Adelaide Hospital.
What is GLITtER (Green Light Imaging Interpretation to Enhance Recovery)?
* GLITtER is a brief intervention that will be integrated into current practice in the SAC.  It will be conducted face-to-face by clinicians with more than 5 years of experience working in this setting.
* It will extend the clinic consultation time by a maximum of 10 minutes
* GLITtER offers the treating clinicians a framework for interpreting imaging findings.  Key components (to be verbally delivered while reviewing the patient's own imaging results) are:
1.	Reframing of normal imaging findings.  E.g. We now understand that many scan findings like degeneration and disc bulges are actually completely normal  you can think of them a bit like wrinkly skin or grey hair: as physical changes that just happen over time.
2.	Most/many of the findings on your scan are also found on scans of people who have never had back pain.  They would have been present well BEFORE your back pain started and they will still be there once your back pain has settled.
3.	There is often very little link between scan findings and a persons activity levels.
4.	Summary: Scans (on their own) actually dont explain much about	
a. Your current pain  especially why you have good days and bad
b. The activity you are capable of 
c. Or how likely you are to recover: because the changes on your scans will still be there when your pain goes away.

* On the basis of the above information patients will be given (verbally) a metaphorical green light.  The clinician will explain to the patient that after reviewing their imaging and assessing them in the clinic they consider that movement and activity is safe: the patient is given the green light to increase their activity level (and it is important for their recovery).  This green light message is re-iterated on the first page of the take-home information.
* GLITtER offers a simple strategy for promotion of activity.  Patients will be introduced to the activity TICK list  an acronym for: make a Time, its Important, be Consistent, Know your back is up to it.  This TICK list is included on each page of the 4-week take-home information.
* GLITtER offers take home information: designed as a 4-week series of key messages displayed in poster style.  Participants will be instructed to display Week 1 when they arrive home, and change the poster weekly.  The main themes of this information are as follows:
1.	Scan findings should not cause worry; it is safe to be active.  Many abnormal findings on scans are actually completely normal (like wrinkles on the inside) and are not associated with pain or likely recovery.  The spine is a strong and stable structure and needs to move. 
2.	Pain is complex and lots of things contribute to the experience of pain.  Chronic pain often has little to do with damage  it is produced by a nervous system that is over-protective.
3.	Activity and exercise are important for recovery and have many benefits.  These include benefits to physical health and well-being, psychological benefits and restoration of the over-protective system.
* Involves SMS follow ups (X4) with links to online education resources.  Brief SMS messages will be sent on Mondays for the subsequent 4 weeks (following the consultation).  The SMS message will prompt the participant to display/turn over/read the information sheet they were provided at their consultation, and to plan some activity/exercise for the week ahead.  
* Includes brief written communication with the patients General Practitioner.  This information will inform the GP that their patient was part of a pilot study assessing an educational intervention designed to reassure patients and promote activity.  It will outline the main messages provided to the patient: 
1.	Surgical intervention is not indicated and further scans are not required
2.	Scan findings should not cause worry; it is safe to be active 
3.	Pain is complex (chronic pain often has little to do with damage) 
4.	Activity and exercise are important for recovery and have many benefits
Contact details for the principal researcher will also be provided.

Adherence to reading of the poster information will be assessed at one-month follow-up.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will receive standard care in the SAC. This involves routine assessment, interpretation of imaging findings and advice regarding conservative management.  Standard care will be delivered by clinicians who are naive to the content of GLITtER and operate according to what is considered to be best-practice SAC care.  The components of GLITtER that are underlined above will be unique to the intervention group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is to determine feasibility of the GLITtER intervention for LBP patients attending the Spinal Assessment Clinic (SAC).  This is a composite outcome that will include meeting of the following specific feasibility criteria:
1.	One subject per clinician per week can be recruited (4 Clinicians at each weekly clinic).
2.	At least 70% of all eligible patients can be recruited.
3.	Complete follow-up data are obtained in at least 95% of all recruited subjects.
4.	GLITtER consultations do not extend clinic appointments by longer than 10 minutes (on average). 
5.	Acceptability of the GLITtER intervention for LBP patients attending the Spinal Assessment Clinic (SAC) is indicated by:  &gt;80% of responses to questions 1-7 of the Participant Experience Questionnaire are rated as agree or strongly agree.
6.	SAC Clinicians delivering GLITtER report that they are confident or very confident when asked:  How confident are you that you could integrate GLITtER into standard practice on an ongoing basis?, and How confident are you that integrating GLITtER would enhance SAC care? (4 point scale).

    <sequence>Group allocation is determined by clinic scheduling and clinician availability. 
I.e.  4 clinicians routinely provided consultations in the spinal assessment clinic.  Patients are booked into one of four time-slots spread throughout the morning clinic.  The 'next available' clinician calls the 'next patient' (ie. the patient with the earliest scheduled appointment time who has been waiting the longest) into their consulting room.  Two of the treating clinicians will deliver the GLITtER intervention to patients who fulfil all eligibility criteria (the intervention group). The other 2 clinicians will identify patients who meet all eligibility criteria and will deliver a routine consultation  (the control group).  All patients will provide informed consent prior to attending their consultation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current practice guidelines universally recommend reassurance as an important component of low back pain (LBP) management.  However, despite the recognition that clinicians are able to effectively reassure LBP patients (and with lasting effect), how best to reassure  and its impact on pragmatic outcomes  is poorly understood.

Approximately 2000 adults with spinal pain are referred by medical practitioners (annually) for surgical opinion in the spinal outpatient clinics at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH).  Surgery, however, is likely to benefit less than 10% of these patients.  It has been suggested that the communication of imaging reports may increase fear of re-injury and reduce the likelihood of a good outcome.  Indeed, the highly prevalent abnormalities detailed in radiology reports are rarely reassuring.  Recent evidence suggests that many degenerative changes found on spinal imaging are not abnormal and highly likely to be found in asymptomatic individuals.  It is also understood that spinal imaging findings are not well associated with pain or prognosis.  Our intervention involves a new and standardised method of communicating radiological findings in a manner designed to reassure patients, and promote engagement in an active recovery. 

This study is a feasibility trial which will be conducted in the spinal outpatient setting at the RAH.  It is the crucial first step towards definitive testing of GLITtER (Green Light Imaging Intervention to Enhance Recovery).  

Aim
The aim of this study is to inform feasibility of definitive testing of the GLITtER intervention in a quasi-randomised controlled trial.  This trial would ultimately address the question of whether the proposed intervention  integrated into routine practice in a spinal outpatient clinic setting - is a cost-effective strategy for reducing chronic LBP and disability.
