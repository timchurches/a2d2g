    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RO6870810
Other interventions - daratumumab

Experimental: RO6870810 - Participants will be administered RO6870810 monotherapy at ascending-dose levels during the dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase during which RO6870810 will be administered as monotherapy at the recommended dose. Participants will continue to receive study drug as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, as determined by the Investigator after an integrated assessment of IMWG response criteria, biopsies/aspirate (if applicable), and clinical status, or withdrawal of consent.

Experimental: RO6870810 + Daratumumab - Participants will be administered RO6870810 at ascending-dose levels in combination with daratumumab at the recommended dose during the dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase during which both RO6870810 and daratumumab will be administered each at their recommended dose. Participants will continue to receive the study drugs as long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression, as determined by the Investigator after an integrated assessment of IMWG response criteria, biopsies/aspirate (if applicable), and clinical status, or withdrawal of consent.


Treatment: drugs: RO6870810
RO6870810 will be administered subcutaneously (SC) at ascending-dose levels (from 0.30 milligrams/kilogram [mg/kg] to 0.65 mg/kg). In Cycle 1, RO6870810 will be given on Day 1 (omitted on Day 2) and then every day from Day 3 through to Day 15. Starting at Cycle 2, it will be given every day from Day 1 to Day 14 of each 21-day cycle. In the first combination therapy cohort RO6870810 will be administered at one dose-level below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

Other interventions: daratumumab
Daratumumab will be administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 16 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight weekly for the first 8 weeks, every two weeks for the following 16 weeks, and every four weeks thereafter, until disease progression.

DLTs are defined at specific severity levels for each term and include, but are not limited to the following Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) terms: neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and injection site reaction.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response is either complete response (CR, including stringent complete response [sCR]) or partial response (PR, including very good partial response [VGPR]), assessed with use of the IMWG criteria. CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and &lt;5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates. sCR: CR plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. PR: &gt;/=50% reduction of serum M-protein plus reduction in 24h urinary M-protein by &gt;/=90% or to &lt;200 mg/24h.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as the time from first study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression (per IMWG criteria) or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression is defined as an increase of &gt;/= 25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following: serum M-component, urine M-component, in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels (the absolute increase must be &gt;10 mg/dL), bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute level &gt;/= 10%), definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL or 2.65 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events - An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter, global study designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of RO6870810 as monotherapy and in combination with daratumumab in participants
      with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Each treatment cycle will be 21 days in length.
      There are two parts to this study. A dose-escalation phase (Part I) will be used to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability and dose limiting toxicities, and to establish the maximum
      tolerated dose/optimum biological dose of RO6870810 when given as monotherapy or in
      combination with daratumumab. A dose-expansion phase (Part II) will further characterize the
      safety, tolerability and activity of RO6870810 as monotherapy or in combination with
      daratumumab at the defined expansion dose-levels.</summary>
