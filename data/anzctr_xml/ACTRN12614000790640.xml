    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All adult patients scheduled to undergoing a major surgical procedure and require mechanical ventilation in the operating  suite of the Austin Hospital will be screened for eligibility. Once informed consent has been obtained, randomisation will be by means of sealed opaque envelopes with permuted blocks of variable size. Each envelope will contain a study arm allocation with the tidal volume target as well as a copy of a simplified study protocol.</concealment>
    <sequence>Permuted block randomisation will be used using computer generated software.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>There are two study groups associated with this trial:
1. Volume control ventilation with a tidal volume 6ml/kg of Ideal Body Weight and PEEP of 5cm H2O.
2. Volume control ventilation with tidal volume 10ml/kg of Ideal Body Weight and PEEP of 5cm H2O.

Calculation of tidal volume &amp; use of PEEP.
Tidal volume for each participant will be calculated base on a) the patients gender and b) the patients ideal body weight (IBW). IBW will be calculated by the treating anaesthetist using the following standard formula.
For males: 50 + 0.91 (centimetres in height  152.4)
For females 45.5 + 0.91 (centimetres in height  152.4) 

Immediately after randomisation, the tidal volume will be set on the ventilator for either a target of 6ml/kg or 10 ml/kg based on ideal body weight and gender. This allocated tidal volume target will be maintained for the duration of the surgical procedure. At the end of the surgical procedure the patient will have their anaesthesia reversed and will be woken and weaned from mechanical ventilation according to standard hospital protocol. There is no change to the type of anaesthesia provide or any oxygenation or ventilation management of enrolled patients during the surgical procedures.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a prospective randomised trial comparing two tidal volume targets in patients undergoing major surgery. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Comparisons will be made using t-test and ANOVA for repeated-measures or Wilcoxon rank-signed test and Kruskall-Wallis according to the underlying distribution for continuous data and Chi-square for categorical data. A Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test will be performed to further compare in-hospital mortality and rate of discharge home where appropriate. Logistic regression analysis will also be performed to adjust for baseline imbalances.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is no good evidence to guide the choice of breath size (tidal volume) delivered by the breathing machine during anaesthesia. In a recent multi-centre study, we found that anaesthetists deliver a variable tidal volumes with some patients receiving low-tidal volumes (6-7 ml/kg) and others receiving high-tidal volumes (9-10 ml/Kg) according to clinician preference. We also found that they typically positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) (pressure to keep lung when breathing out has been completed) at an average modest value of 5.0 cmH2O. Thus, in Victoria and the Austin hospital in patients under general anaesthesia administered tidal volume can be variably high or low and PEEP is often applied at modest levels. Because of such variability and the possibility that one approach or another may be better at avoiding lung complications after anaesthesia, we wish to perform prospective randomised trial to evaluate the impact and outcome of two different tidal volume strategies during anaesthesia.

Specifically, we wish to conduct a pilot single-centre prospective randomised trial comparing a low tidal volume (6 ml/kg) to a higher tidal volume (10 ml/kg) tidal volume strategy in combination with PEEP at 5 cm H2O for patients undergoing major surgery. The anticipated sample size is 900 participants over a 18 month period. Patients will be randomly allocated to either low or control tidal volume ventilation for the period of their surgical procedure to test the hypothesis that one of these two approaches in superior at decreasing post-surgical lung complications.</summary>
