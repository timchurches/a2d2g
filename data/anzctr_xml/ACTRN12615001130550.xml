  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two interventions (CPAP and upper airway surgery). 
CPAP: Brand of ResMed-- S8 autoset Spirit in automatic positive airway pressure model. The participants put on the facial mask when sleeping, turn on the machine and the machine will start to work and automatically give the positive pressure. Diary will be used to moniter adherence of the CPAP. The dose setting of the CPAP: 10 cm H2O. Duration: 4 to 8 hours a day for 3 months
Surgery: Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with or without tongue base reduction, occur once. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty means to remove and/or remodel of tissues in the throat to reduce airway obstruction. Sleep surgeon perform the surgery. The operating surgeon will decide whether the patient receives a tongue base reduction or not based on size of tongue. Approximate duration of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: 1 hour
All participants undergo only one intervention. Either CPAP or surgery treatment will be chosen by each participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>It is a pre-post comparison study. CPAP is considered to be the comparator group.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Sample size calculation: 
      Lin et al. reported that the leptin levels before and after successful surgical treatment in OSAS patients were 24.2 +/- 6.1 ng/ml and 15.9 +/- 6.0 ng/ml. Based on the mean values and standard deviation of the previous study, P value 0.05 and power 0.8 were set, the sample size was estimated as 18 using two sample comparison means. According to the results of sample size calculation and accounting for dropout rates 10%, we plan to recruit 20 participants in this study.
2. Described statistical analysis, T-test, image data analysis (SPM), regression model </statisticalmethods>
