  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a placebo-controlled trial using BLIS K12, a commercially available oral probiotic. It contains a strain of S. salivarius at a concentration of at least 1x10^8 cf. per lozenge. Participants will be treated with 10 days of oral amoxycillin and then take one lozenge per day for 3 months or until their surgery. Adherence will be monitored by a patient diary and a return lozenge count at 1 months and 3 months of treatment. At each clinical assessment a throat swab will be taken and tested for the presence of BLIS K12 strain of S salivarius. </interventions>
    <comparator>This is a double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The placebo will be an identical product without the probiotic bacteria included. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recurrence of tonsillitis. If a child has an episode of tonsillitis while on the trial they will be assessed by one of the ENT doctors ( Registrar or Consultant) for confirmation. We will use internationally determined diagnostic criteria as outlined in the protocol to determine the presence of absence of tonsillitis. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>In a small study in children with recurrent tonsillitis 24 children with recurrent tonsillitis received a daily dose of BLIS K12 or placebo (Hale, Burton, Chilcott et al 2014). The rate of sore throats in the treatment group was 0.10 per month while in the placebo group it was 0.19 per month. 
An Italian study demonstrated a 97% reduction in the incidence of pharyngitis caused by S. pyogenes in a group of children treated with BLIS K12 for 90 days when compared to historical rates of disaese in the group (Di Pierro, Colombo, Zanvit, Risso, &amp; Rottoli, 2014). 
A sample size of 35 per group will provide 90% power at an alpha of 0.05 to detect a 50% reduction in the number of episodes or tonsillitis if the background rate is 6 episodes per year and the children are followed for 3 months. 
We will allow for a 12.5% drop out rate and plan to recruit 40 patients per group. The children are likely to be followed for a period longer than 3 months given the current waiting lists. This will increase the power of the study and provide a margin of error for any possible reduced effect size.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recurrent tonsillitis is one of the major indication for tonsillectomy in children. Each year the Department of Otolaryngology at CDHB see in excess of 90 children who require tonsillectomy because of recurrent tonsillitis. The current waiting list for tonsillectomy is 18 weeks. This is well above the recommended waiting times and reflects increasing pressure on the surgical waiting lists for children needing tonsillectomy.

The primary objective of this research is to establish if the use of probiotics can reduce the burden of disease, and as a consequence the need for surgical intervention, in children with recurrent tonsillitis.

We will run a randomized double-blinded controlled trial to address the following hypothesis:
1)	BLIS K12 probiotics taken orally reduce the incidence of recurrence of tonsillitis in children who have recurrent tonsillitis

The BLIS Tonsillitis trial will recruit patients from June 2016 until January 2017 with final follow up of patients through until April 2017. It will require approximately 40 patients per group for each study with 5 months of follow up per patient. Children will be recruited from two sites  the CDHB and CCDHB.
