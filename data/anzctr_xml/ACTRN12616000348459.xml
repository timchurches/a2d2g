    <interventions>5mg TDS Treatment Period
Treatment A: Donepezil TDS Formulation 1: 1 x 60 cm2 patch (contains 115.2 mg/patch donepezil HCl) will be applied and worn for seven days. An overlay will be applied to the patch.
Treatment B: Donepezil TDS Formulation 2: 1 x 60 cm2 patch (contains 150 mg/patch donepezil HCl) will be applied and worn for seven days. An overlay will be applied to the patch.
Treatment C: Donepezil TDS Formulation 3: 1 x 60 cm2 patch (contains 126 mg/patch donepezil HCl) will be applied and worn for seven days. An overlay will be applied to the patch.

All formulations contain a rate controlling membrane made of microporous polypropylene, but the treatments differ in the composition of the drug-in adhesive layer:
Treatment A: contains acrylic adhesive, crospovidone, sodium bicarbonate, glycerine, and two or three additional vehicles selected from triethyl citrate, sorbitan monolaurate, and lauryl lactate as inactive ingredients, with donepezil hydrochloride as the active ingredient.
Treatment B: contains acrylic adhesive , colloidal silicon dioxide and/or Crospovidone, Eudragit EPO, glycerine and additional 2 or 3 vehicles or enhancers selected from triethyl citrate, , and lauryl lactate as inactive ingredients, with donepezil hydrochloride as the active ingredient.
Treatment C: contains acrylic adhesive , colloidal silicon dioxide, Eudragit EPO, glycerine and additional 2 or 3 vehicles or enhancers selected from triacetin, sorbitan monolaurate, and lauryl lactate as inactive ingredients, with donepezil hydrochloride as the active ingredient.

All formulations will be applied as one patch worn continuously for 7 days, applied to the lower back (preferred location is vertically along the spine) by a trained member of site staff.
Participants will remain in the study facility for the duration of patch application and will constantly monitored to ensure compliance.

10mg TDS Treatment Period
The treatment determined (by interim PK and safety analysis) to be the lead formulation will be selected and applied as 2 x 60cm2, 5mg/ day target dose (comprising of two individual patches, with total target dose 10mg/ day) worn continuously for seven days. 
Patches will be applied to the lower back (preferred location is vertically along the spine) by a trained member of site staff.
Participants will remain in the study facility for the duration of patch application and will constantly monitored to ensure compliance.
</interventions>

      <timepoint>For the TDS Treatment Periods:
Baseline; 2, 6, (+/- 5 minutes), 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 148, 152 and 168 hours (+/- 1 hour) following TDS application; at 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, and at 168 (if the washout period is 7 days) or at 192, 240 and 288 (if the washout period is longer) hours (+/-1 hour) after TDS removal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability (including local skin tolerability) of seven day applications of each Donepezil TDS (60 cm2 patch size) treatment, as well as to data obtained from the oral arms of this study. 
Local tolerability evaluation will be performed by trained site staff using an eight-point Dermal Response Score scale: 0 = no evidence of irritation; 1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible; 2 = definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response; 3 = erythema and papules; 4 = definite edema; 5 = erythema, edema and papules; 6 = vesicular eruption; 7 = strong reaction spreading beyond application site. Other effects will also be rated: 0 = no other effects; 1 = slight glazing; 2 = marked glazing; 3 = glazing with peeling and cracking; 4 = glazing with fissures; 5 = film of dried serous exudate covering all or part of the patch site; 6 = small petechial erosions and/or scabs. Not applicable for oral treatment periods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Local tolerability evaluation will be studied and assessed at the application sites at Baseline, then 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours following removal of the patch.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the PK of donepezil and metabolite 6-O-desmethyl donepezil between formulations of Donepezil TDS (60 cm2 patch size) and the oral arms of this study. This will be assessed with plasma samples. </outcome>

For the oral treatment periods:
Relative to the first dose on Day 1: Baseline; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (+/-5 minutes), 12, 24 (+/- 1 hour) hours post-dose. Relative to the last dose on Day 7: pre-dose; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (+/- 5 minutes), 12, 24, 48, 96, 144, and at 168 (if the washout period is 7 days) or at 192 (if the washout period is longer) hours (+/- 1 hour) post-dose. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>For the TDS Treatment Periods:
Baseline; 2, 6, (+/- 5 minutes), 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 148, 152 and 168 hours (+/- 1 hour) following TDS application. 

For the oral treatment periods: 
Relative to the first dose on Day 1: baseline; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (+/- 5 minutes), 12, 24 (+/- 1 hour) hours post-dose. Relative to the last dose on Day 7: pre-dose; 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (+/- 5 minutes), 12, 24 (+/- 1 hour) hours post-dose. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess TDS adhesion.
Trained site staff will score adhesion at the specified timepoints using the folling scale:
0 = greater than or equal to 90% adhered (essentially no lift off of the skin)
1 = greater than or equal 75% to &lt;90% adhered (some edges only lifting off the skin)
2 = greater than or equal 50% to &lt; 75% adhered (less than half of the system lifting off the skin)
3 = &lt; 50% adhered but not detached (more than half the system lifting off of the
skin without falling off)
4 = 0% adhered - patch detached (patch completely off the skin.

Photographs are to be taken of the TDS patches: after application (but prior to overlay), post application of the overlay, at each scheduled adhesion assessment time point, prior to additional tape (if needed) and after taping.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adhesion will be assessed every 12 hours +/- 1 hour from the time the TDS is applied until it is removed (i.e. 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96,108, 120, 132, 144, 156 and 168 hours after the TDS is applied).</timepoint>
