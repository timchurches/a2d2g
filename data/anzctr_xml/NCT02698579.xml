  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, long-term safety and efficacy follow-up study for subjects with
      cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) who have received Lenti-D Drug Product in Study ALD-102.

      After completing Study ALD-102 (approximately 2 years), eligible subjects will be followed
      for an additional 13 years for a total of 15 years post-drug product infusion. No
      investigational drug product will be administered in this study.</summary>
