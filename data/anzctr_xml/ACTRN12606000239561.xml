    <interventions>Arm A - Intervention: Parenting program (one 15-minute session at the routine individual Maternal and Child Health (MCH) 8-month visit, and two 2-hour group sessions when the children are ages 12 and 15 months) that discuss normal toddler behaviour development, ways to encourage desirable behaviour, and ways to manage misbehaviour. Strategies were derived from systematic reviews of parenting programs for treating established child externalising behaviour problems. Programs delivered by Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Nurses and co-facilitated by parenting experts.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm B - Control: Standard care provided by MCH Nurses at well child visits (active control) Families can attend free well child visits at 8, 12, 18 and 36 months of age where advice about development and management of established behaviour problems may be offered. There is no routine advice about prevention of behaviour problems.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to prevent the development of child externalizing behaviour problems (eg aggression, oppositional defiance) by offering parents anticipatory guidance on how to effectively manage toddler behaviour. Up to 20% of Australian children aged 4 to 16 years experience significant behaviour problems and only ¼ of these receive professional help. Treating established problems is time and cost intensive and so a prevention approach is required. This community-based study will assess the effectiveness of a parenting program designed to promote warm and appropriate parenting, and to offer alternatives to harsh, punitive parenting (known to contribute to externalising problems). MCH nurses deliver the program. It is the first study of its kind in the world to offer a universal, primary health care preventive program for externalising behaviour problems.</summary>
