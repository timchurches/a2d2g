  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study group 1: Traditional acupuncture with primary acupuncture points Kidney 3, Stomach 36, Spleen 6, Conception Vessel 6. Colon 4. These points have been used in previous research suggesting a therapeutic effect on fatigue in general. In addition secondary points will be administered based on a diagnosis used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This design is similar to for example a psychiatrist who may diagnose a patient with the same condition yet use a different intervention due to varying clinical features. Treatment will be administered twice weekly over the first three weeks and then weekly for the final three weeks. Duration of each treatment 45 minutes. Acupuncture needles will be inserted to tissue level and stimulated manually. The needles will be stimulated once more during this treatment session. Single-use disposable stainless steel needles (0.25 x 40mm for body acupuncture) will be used.  All points will be located according to the World Health Organisation International Standard Acupuncture Point Locations that was agreed on at Tsukuba, Japan, November, 2006.  The intervention commences four weeks post cancer treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Study group 2: The placebo group will use the Park Sham device which has a guide tube making it impossible for the subject to see whether the needle has penetrated the skin or not. The sham needle its self is able to slide into the handle, which increases the appearance that the skin has been penetrated. Needle penetration does not occur. The sham needle will be placed away from acupuncture points.  The sham acupuncture device is an effective masking device for blinding in randomised controlled trials of acupuncture. Treatment will be administered twice weekly over the first  three weeks and then weekly for the final three weeks, with each intervention lasting 45 minutes.  The intervention commences four weeks post cancer treatment. 

Study Group 3: Wait list control. Women randomised to this group will not receive any acupuncture during the six week trial. The research assistant will make contact with subjects at the assessment time. Women will be given the opportunity to receive acupuncture with the chief investigator following completion of the study.</comparator>

The fatigue has to be associated with cancer treatment (experienced only since receiving treatment for breast cancer) and not general fatigue.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Screening for eligibility will be undertaken over the phone by the trial co-ordinator:
Women will need to be in the age range  &gt;18 years and &lt;70 years with a history of a diagnosis of breast cancer.  If women are eligible and interested in joining the study, an appointment will be made. Women will be randomly allocated to a study group by taking the next sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelope.  Randomisation will be into three study groups, acupuncture, sham acupuncture and no acupuncture/wait list control.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be prepared by a researcher not directly involved with the trial. The randomisation sequence will be computer generated. The sequence will be concealed and held in a locked filing cabinet at the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study looks at the effectiveness of acupuncture to reduce fatigue in women after treatment for breast cancer. You can join this study if you have recently been treated for breast cancer with chemotherapy, and you are suffering from fatigue associated with this treatment. Participants will be divided into three groups: an acupuncture treatment group, a placebo acupuncture group and a wait-list control group. Both the acupuncture and the placebo acupuncture groups will receive a type of acupuncture twice weekly over the first three weeks and then weekly for the final three weeks, with each treatment lasting 45 minutes. The placebo group will use a device which has a guide tube making it impossible for the subject to see whether the needle has penetrated the skin or not. Needle penetration does not occur. The sham needle will be placed away from acupuncture points. The wait list control group will receive no treatment for 6 weeks but will answer questionnaires during this time and be offered acupuncture treatment at the end of the 6 week study period.  From 25% to 99% of people receiving cancer treatment suffer from fatigue. Preliminary reports suggest that acupuncture may help improve quality of life. The results of this study will be used in the design of a larger trial on the use of acupuncture to support cancer care.</summary>
