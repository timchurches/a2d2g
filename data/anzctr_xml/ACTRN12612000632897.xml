    <studytitle>The Influence of Anaesthetic Depth on Patient Outcome after Major Surgery</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A prospective, randomised, double-blind, active control, parallel assessment, intention to treat, safety and efficacy study comparing "light" and "deep" general anesthesia monitored with Bispectral Index (BIS) to investigate whether depth of anesthesia alters peri-operative outcomes in patients having major surgery</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>General anaesthesia monitored with Bispectral Index (BIS). BIS targets will be either 50 or 35. We expect 90% of anaesthesia time to be within 5 units of the target range and no deviations for &gt;5 minutes. Anaesthesia standard care using standard anaesthetic hypnotics, volatiles, opioids and relaxants, intravenous or inhalational gas induction, volatile maintenance, continuous BIS monitoring, computerised data logging of BIS, blood pressure and volatile anaesthetic concentration. An individualised blood pressure target range appropriate for the patient being studied will be set by the anaesthetist before BIS target randomization</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One-year mortality. One year mortality will be compared between randomised groups using a Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test, stratified on study centre. 
A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.049 will be taken to indicate statistical significance. 
One year mortality is expected to be approximately 10% based on the findings of Leslie's study and Australasian studies.  The reduction in mortality in the light anaesthesia group is expected to be 20%. 
A power analysis using p1=0.10 and p2=0.08 indicates that N=3250 patients are required in each group, Beta=0.8,alpha=0.049. The alpha level is reduced to allow for the single interim analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year after randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morbidity review for the presence of myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke, sepsis, surgical site infection, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, hospital stay, awareness, WHODAS disability score, disability free survival, persistent postoperative pain and cancer recurrence will be compared between randomized groups using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test depending on the expected cell frequencies. Additionally a composite score including the presence of any of MI, cardiac arrest, stroke, PE, sepsis and surgical site infection, will be compared between randomised groups also using a chi-square test. Additional analyses will also explore the role of MI, cardiac arrest, stroke, PE,  sepsis and surgical site infection on one year mortality using Cox's proportional hazards regression to develop a model of independent predictors of one year mortality. The randomized group will be added to this model to assist explanation of any observed differences in outcome between the randomized groups. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 450,000 people undergo surgery for various reasons in New Zealand. Most of these people are given general anaesthesia for their procedure. We use a range of monitoring to assess vital signs and other safety factors. One of the monitoring systems we use is the Bi-spectral Index (BIS), which uses electroencephalogram (EEG) waves to determine the depth (how deeply anaesthetised) patients are during their procedure. These monitoring systems are widely available nationally and internationally, however, the optimal depth at which anaesthetics should be given is unknown. Recent observational studies have shown a 20% increase in mortality in patients undergoing major surgery who receive relatively deep anaesthesia. We plan to perform a large scale randomized trial investigating the difference between two clinically standard depth ranges, which are commonly referred to light and deep anaesthesia, to definitively answer the question of whether anaesthetic depth alters surgical outcome. In particular we will look at death rate at one year and also whether there are differences in other complications of surgery and anaesthesia, including wound infection, cardiovascular and neurological complications, pain and awareness</summary>
