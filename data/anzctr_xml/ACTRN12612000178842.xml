  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be required to attend three testing sessions over 4 days with at least 24 hours (1 day) of recovery day between Session 2 and 3. In Session 1 (day 1), subjects will undergo a glucose tolerance test (GTT). Based on the GTT results subjects then will be categorized into normal, impaired, or high glucose levels. In Session 2 (day 2), subjects will be required to perform maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test to determine the exercise load that will be used in Session 3. In Session 3 (day 4), subjects will perform a single bout of moderate intensity exercise on the bike for 30 min. All variables will be measured at pre and post acute exercise. During exercise subjects will be supervised and their heart rate will be monitored every 2 min by the tester/researcher.</interventions>

    <sequence>Following a glucose tolerance test, subjects will be categorized into normal, impaired, or high glucose level group. Thus, the categorization is based on the level of subject's glucose.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight and obesity can result in impaired or high glucose levels and aberrant vascular function, which leads to metabolic syndrome (MetS), pre-diabetic (PD), or type 2 diabetes. Early detection of impaired glucose levels in overweight/obese individuals is desirable to prevent the likelihood of disease progression. Thus, the purpose of this study, is firstly to identify early markers, such as impaired/high glucose level and aberrant vascular function in overweight/obese individuals, and secondly, to examine the acute effect of aerobic exercise on those early markers. It is expected that acute exercise will normalize vascular function aberration in MetS and PD individuals.</summary>
