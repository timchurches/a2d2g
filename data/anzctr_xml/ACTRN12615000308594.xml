Key Active Ingredients:
Arginine - 4.2g
Omega-3 Fatty Acids
 - ALA 1.1g
 - EPA 672mg
 - DHA 432mg
Nucleotides - 430mg

Energy and Protein:
Energy - 200 calories
Protein - 18g

All patients will fill out a compliance record form, which is a tick sheet outlining whether or not they have consumed each supplement. If they have not consumed a supplement they will be asked to explain why. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will consume 3 nutrition supplements each day for five days. Together, they will be approximately equivalent in protein and energy as the immunonutrition supplements. They will drink 3 Resource Protein (200mL each) each day and repeat this for five days. Please see attachment for active ingredients, dose and protein and energy content (viewed on the ANZCTR registry only).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if immunonutrition prior to pelvic exenteration surgery for people with cancer decreases complications, length of hospital stay and immune markers after their surgery. 

Who is it for? 

You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and are scheduled to undergo pelvic exenteration surgery for cancer. 

Study details -

Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will consume 3 immunonutrition supplements (known as Impact Advanced Recovery) each day for 5 days prior to their surgery. Participants in the other group will instead consume 3 nutrition supplements with equivalent protein and energy as the immunonutrition supplements (3 x Resource Protein) each day for 5 days prior to their operation. 

All participants will be monitored for up to 3 months post hospital discharge for any post-operative complications, such as infectious or non-infectious complications and immune markers. </summary>
