    <designfeatures>Each participating subject is their own control, i.e. each subject has teledermoscopy first then a face-to-face consultation. Patient management is determined by the latter assessment. The study is evaluating the concordance in diagnosis (and separately in management) between teledermoscopy and face-to-face consultation to assess the potential for use of teledermoscopy as a triage tool to reduce the necessity for face-to-face consultation.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>New Zealand has the highest rate of skin cancers in the world, which leads to a large number of referrals to skin specialists in hospitals. In this study, we want to see whether taking photos of suspicious moles or spots in the skin with a sophisticated camera and sending these by computer to skin specialists for a diagnosis is as accurate as being seen by skin specialists for a face to face diagnosis. This teledermatology approach may be able to reduce the number of patients who need to be seen in hospital outpatient clinics. This phase II study will test the accuracy of teledermatology and assess whether it can be used in a larger study to prove the benefits of this technology. The aim is to improve healthcare delivery and costs, overcome geographical barriers and improve care for the most vulnerable groups affected by skin cancer  the young and elderly.</summary>
