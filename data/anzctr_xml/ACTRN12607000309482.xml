Anaesthetists within the Department of Anaesthesia at Frankston Hospital without prior experience of optical stylet intubation will be randomly allocated to one of 2 groups:  to learn intubation with the Bonfils (Group B) or to learn with the Levitan (Group L). Anesthetists will perform 20 intubations with their assigned device on succesive consented patients over a period of not more than 2 months. After 20 intubations with one device, the next 7 patients will be intubated via the alternative device.  Washout period will be less than 14 days.</interventions>

      <outcome>Intubation success rate. Following induction of anaesthesia up to 3 attempts at intubation will be permitted per patient. Oxygenation by bag and mask will be done between attempts.

    <concealment>Patients will be enrolled &amp; consented by treating anaesthetist.  Anaesthetist will have been allocated to group B or group L based on table of random numbers. Concealment will be via opaque envelopes. On opening envelope, anaesthetist will know if he/she will learn with the Bonfils (Group B) or Levitan (Group L) and therefore no longer be blinded. All anaesthetists will then undergo a standardized 1 hr training session for their device and practice on airway manikins. Patients will not be truly randomized in that if they fall in a particular anaesthetists operating list, they will be intubated according to that anaesthetists allocation (provided they are eligible to participate and agree).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intubation is the insertion of an endotracheal tube into the trachea of an anaesthetized patient for airway management during surgery. Intubation is traditionally achieved by inserting a laryngoscope into the anaesthetized patients mouth, moving the tongue out of the way and inserting the endotracheal tube through the vocal cords if they can be seen.  In the last decade there has been growing interest in a new type of intubating device called optical stylet.  Optical stylets incorporate fiberoptic imaging elements in an intubation stylet design. Their appearance is of a thin semi-rigid telescope which an endotracheal tube is threaded over. While any patient may be intubated using a stylet, they have been particularly reccomended for difficult intubations, which occur with an incidence of between 1:300 and 1:3000 (rising with conditions such as obesity and sleep apnoea).  The proposed study compares the ease of use and intubation success of the 2 optical stylets, the Bonfils (Storz, Germany) and the Levitan (Clarus, USA) (pictures) amongst specialist anaesthetists whose only experience with them was basic training with the device on airway mannikins. Both devices will be used according to their approved application for device entry at the Therapeutic Goods Administration.</summary>
