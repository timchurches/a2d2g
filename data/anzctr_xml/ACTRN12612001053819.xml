  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating whether a diagnostic technique, known as PET scanning, can provide a non invasive means of evaluating the presence of acute graft vs host disease of the gastrointestinal tract following bone marrow transplantation. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged above 18 years and have suspected acute graft vs host disease of the gastrointestinal tract following bone marrow transplantation. 

Trial details
All participants in this trial will undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) scan at the time acute graft vs host disease of the gastrointestinal tract is suspected. A PET scan involves injection of a small amount of radioactive tracer into the bloodstream followed by scanning of the whole body in a machine that looks similar to a CT scan machine for approximately 30 minutes.

In addition, participants will undergo standard care, which involves a gastroscopy and colonoscopy where biopsies of the gastrointestinal tract are obtained to assess whether graft vs host disease is present or not.

This study will help us to determine whether PET scanning can accurately assess non invasively the presence of acute graft vs host disease of the gastrointestinal tract following bone marrow transplantation.</summary>
