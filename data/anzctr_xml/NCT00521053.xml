  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of intralesional (IL)
      PV-10 for locoregional treatment of metastatic melanoma. This study will also include
      assessment of response in untreated bystander lesions following intralesional injection of
      PV-10 into targeted lesions. Additional objectives are to determine the safety profile of
      PV-10 following intralesional injection, and assess the pharmacokinetic profile of PV-10 in
      the bloodstream following intralesional injection.</summary>
