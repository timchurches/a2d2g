  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two possible interventions:
1.	100% humidified air delivered by the rNHF device, via nasal cannuale at 35L/min at 41°C for two hours on Day 1, administered under the supervision of investigators at the clinic, and then at home for up to 5 days depending on resolution of symptoms. The participant will be encouraged to use the rNHF device as a single administration for 2 hours in total per day at home during this period. If the participant is unable to use the rNHF device for 2 hours in one session, then it can be used in a second session to achieve the 2 hour period for each day. Participants may reduce the flow to a minimum of 30L/min at home according to comfort.
Adherence to the rNHF device treatments will be assessed by investigator review of the device data, downloaded directly from the device on Day 5. Adherence will be defined as a minimum of 90 minutes use per day, delivered in no more than 2 sessions per day.</interventions>
    <comparator>Oral Vitamin C 100mg tablet (Healtheries Vit C containing 100mg vitamin C) once per day for 5 consecutive days (Day 1 to Day 5 inclusive) will be used as the control treatment.  

Adherence to Vitamin C tablets will be assessed by study investigators after return of the packaging and any remaining tablets by the participant on Day 5. Adherence will be defined as a minimum of four vitamin C tablets consumed between Day 1 and Day 5, and will be assessed by participant diary information and by tablet count</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate if patients suffering from the common cold will have improved outcomes using rhinothermy via Nasal High Flow (rNHF) therapy compared to a control treatment. 

This is a randomised, open-label, parallel groups trial of five days of treatment with either rNHF therapy up to 2 hours daily or vitamin C (100mg) daily in the treatment of symptoms of the common cold.

170 participants will be recruited within 48 hours of the onset of specific symptoms of the common cold. They will be randomised into 1 of 2 arms and receive the intervention for up to 5 days, depending on symptom resolution. There will be 2 visits to the MRINZ clinic. Questionnaire data will be collected both in person and remotely via smartphones.

The trial is for a duration of 14 days, with visits on Day 1 and Day 5.

The treatment period has a duration of 5 days, Day 1 through to Day 5 inclusive.
