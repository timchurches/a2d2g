  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will have previously received a 6 week health-service based exercise program, one hour (1-2 sessions per week.) They will be taken to the gym based  centre 1-2 weeks after completing the health service based exercise program. 
The intervention group will involve a 12 month individualized gym-based exercise program supervised by an exercise physiologist from the health service
Intervention group participants will be advised that the health professional leading their community service-based exercise program will be attending 2 hours a day Monday till Friday during the 12 month intervention to consult with them. During these 2 hour supervision times, the exercise physiologist will be supervising other clients so it is not one on one supervision. They are encouraged to attend during these supervised times. However, the client is able to attend independently during off peak times at the gym (Monday til Friday 8am - 4 pm) These participants would have had a home exercise program prescribed prior to discharge from the health service-based exercise program.
These exercise intervention sessions will be of 1 hour duration (approximately 15 min aerobic training,  40 min resistance training and 5 min flexibility and/or balance exercises) and will be held within the community based fitness centre. The exercise program will be closely supervised, multimodal,  individually prescribed, based on the goals and limitations of each participant, and will be regularly progressed and adapted as necessary. In addition to resistance, aerobic and flexibility exercises, if indicated the program may also include exercises for static and dynamic balance, core stability and posture.
Participants who choose to attend this specific gym based fitness centre will be required to pay the standard casual entry fee for that centre each visit.  While attending the community-based fitness centre, the execise physiologist  will monitor participants progress and physical capacity and suggest modifications to participants exercise prescription.  The exercise physiologist will also use motivational interviewing techniques aimed at motivating the participant to engage fully with their exercise program (both at the centre and at home) and adhere to this.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will have previously received a 6 week health-service based exercise program, one hour per week once per week.

Comparator:  Telephone-based follow-up / usual care.
This follow-up approach will entail participants being provided with a home exercise program at the conclusion of the health-service based exercise program to be completed independently by the client for a 12 month period.  There will be no exercise physiologist attending the clients home  and the supervision will be provided by the telephone follow up as stated below  (5 follow-up telephone calls over the first 10 week commencing when the client receives the home exercise program)

This home exercise program intervention will be of 1 hour duration (approximately 15 min aerobic training,  40 min resistance training and 5 min flexibility and/or balance exercises) and will be completed at the clients home.  The exercise program will be closely supervised, multimodal,  individually prescribed, based on the goals and limitations of each participant, and will be regularly progressed and adapted as necessary. In addition to resistance, aerobic and flexibility exercises, if indicated the program may also include exercises for static and dynamic balance, core stability and posture. The frequency of the sessions will be range from (1 -4 sessions per week) depending on the clients goals as determined by the treating Exercise Physiologist.


The intervention will be 5 follow-up telephone calls over the first 10 week commencing when the client receives the home exercise program. The health professionals providing the follow-up telephone calls will use the same Health Coaching Australia model to enhance participant adherence to their program as used in the health service staff in community-based fitness centre intervention approach.  Modifications to the home exercise program will also be made in response to participant feedback.
The initial telephone call will be 20-25 minutes in duration, subsequent telephone calls will be 10 minutes.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Prior to the commencement of the patients’ discharge plan from the health service-based group exercise program, they will be informed about the project and provided with an information sheet and written consent form.  A verbal explanation will also be provided by one of the investigators who will be able to answer patient’s questions. Patients who consent to participate will have the baseline assessment undertaken by one of these investigators at their discharge assessment from the health service-based group exercise program.  The measures being applied for the baseline assessment overlap with those routinely administered at the discharge assessment for this program so there will be little additional burden on participants to this point.
Once baseline assessments are completed and a home exercise program prescribed, the investigator will then open a sealed, opaque envelope containing the random allocation sequence.  Participants will then be provided with information relating to the intervention that they have been allocated to.  The intervention will be provided as described above.</concealment>
    <sequence>This random allocation sequence will have been developed by a different investigator than those recruiting, who has no knowledge of the patients’ baseline results or their recruitment order.  This sequence will be set out in permuted blocks, and will be stratified by client main chronic disease diagnosis type (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, diabetes, other). A computer-generated random number sequence will be used.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to compare the effect of home-based exercise plans and telephone follow-up to a 12 month gym program with health professionals. 114 participants will be recruited from Southern Healths community-based health programs in Melbournes south east, following their participation in health service based exercise program. Participants will have at least one risk factor for readmission that include: multiple co-morbidities, impaired functionality, aged 65 and over, recent hospital emergency department admissions, poor social support, and history of depression. Base-line data will be collected upon participant recruitment that include: demographics, health and medical history (obtained from the clients health record), endurance and strength will be assessed. Outcome measures include: health-related quality of life, depression scale, social isolation, health and labour questionaire, health care utilisation, endurance and strength tests. Participants will then be randomly allocated to either a control group or intervention group. The control group will receive the usual care, a 12 month home exercise program with telephone follow-up. The intervention group will involve a 12 month individualized gym-based exercise program supervised by an exercise physiologist from the health service. At 3 months post-discharge, participants will be re-assessed over the telephone (survey instruments only). At 6 months post-discharge, the participants will be re-assessed on both survey instruments and physical capacity tests for endurance and strength, health related quality of life, depression, social isolation, At 9 months post-discharge, participants will be re-assessed over the telephone (survey instruments only). 
At 12 months post-discharge, the participants will be re-assessed on both survey instruments and physical capacity tests for endurance and strength, health related quality of life, depression, social isolation.</summary>
