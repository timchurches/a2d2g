Other: Early Goal Directed Sedation - Early Goal Directed Sedation process of care involves:
Early delivery of proposed intervention, shortly after initiating mechanical ventilation;
Effective analgesia provided simultaneously and early (analgesia first).
Regular and frequent assessment of patient wakefulness/sedative state;
Avoidance of benzodiazepines and minimisation of use of propofol;
Reduced overall sedation depth with targeted light sedation; Patients randomised to the EGDS arm will receive a sedative infusion of Dexmedetomidine withor without minimal propofol in order to maintain a RASS of -2 to +1.
Dexmedetomidine infusion will be continued until sedation is no longer clinically indicated up to a maximum of 28 days after enrolment.

Active Comparator: Standard care Sedation Arm - Patients randomised to the standard care sedation arm will receive process of care sedation directed by the treating clinician. Based on the information from our observational study and the EGDS Pilot trial, most patients in this group are likely to receive midazolam and /or propofol. These agents will be infused to achieve the default target of Light sedation (RASS -2 to +1) whenever clinically appropriate and as specified by the treating clinician. The use remifentanil or dexmedetomidine for initial and maintenance sedation will be precluded.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Use of sedative drugs in intensive care is widespread. A cohort study conducted in
      Australia and New Zealand in 2010 revealed a high prevalence of deep sedation within the
      first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation which was independently linked to prolonged
      ventilation, hospital and 180 days mortality. Clinical practice is moving towards the use of
      lighter levels of sedation. Recent RCTs in Europe (JAMA 2012) and previous RCTs (JAMA 2009)
      supports growing evidence that dexmedetomidine facilitates rousable sedation, shortens
      ventilation time and attenuates delirium when compared to midazolam and propofol.

      The investigators confirmed in a pilot study the feasibility, efficacy and safety of a
      process of care known as Early Goal Directed Sedation (EGDS) that delivers:

        1. Early randomization after intubation or arrival in the ICU (intubated).

        2. Early Adequate analgesia after randomization.

        3. Goal directed sedation titrated to achieve light sedation.

        4. Dexmedetomidine based algorithm as the primary sedative agent with avoidance of
           benzodiazepines.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Early Goal Directed Sedation when
      compared to standard care sedation in critically ill patients.

      The study hypothesis is that Early Goal-Directed Sedation (EGDS), compared to standard care
      sedation, reduces 90-day all-cause mortality in critically ill patients who require
      mechanical ventilation.</summary>
