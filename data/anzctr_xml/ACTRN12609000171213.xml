  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intubation with a McGrath videolaryngoscope.  Intubation involves passing an endotracheal tube into the trachea to enable ventilation during surgery.  Evidence suggests that the McGrath videolaryngoscope provides an improved view of the larynx to enable safe passage of the tracheal tube.  Duration of laryngoscope will be approximately 30-60 secs.  Intubation will take place after induction of anaesthesia.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh laryngoscope.  A Macintosh laryngoscope is a metal instrument with a light which enables retraction of the soft tissues of the oropharynx in order to expose the larynx as described above.  Duration of the procedure will be 30-60 secs and the procedure will take place after induction of anaesthesia.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Speed of intubation.  This will be measured using a stop-watch (seconds) by one of the study investigators who is also an anaesthetist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of intubation, immediately after induction of anaesthesia.  Intubation is predicted to take 30-60 seconds.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of difficult tracheal intubation.  This will be assessed by the anaesthetist performing the intubation.  Difficulty of intubation will be assessed via the intubation difficulty score (IDS) which is a validated measure of the difficulty of intubation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of intubation, immediately after induction of anaesthesia.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Laryngoscopic view will be assessed by the established Cormack/Lehane grading system.  This grading system applies grades to the view depending on how much of the larynx is seen.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of intubation, immediately after induction of anaesthesia.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of complications will be assessed when one of the study investigators reviews the patient in recovery ie. after they have woken up from surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Success rate of intubation will be calculated by dividing attempts at intubation by successful intubation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to determine if the McGrath laryngoscope makes insertion of a breathing tube easier and safer compared to the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope.  This procedure is done after the anaesthetic has started (you will be asleep when the breathing tube is put in).  It is important to investigate better laryngoscopes for insertion of the breathing tube because sometimes this procedure can be more challenging than usual, especially if the patient has a neck injury and their neck must be held still during the procedure.  In this setting, certain laryngoscopes may make the procedure easier by providing a better view of the larynx.  There is evidence to suggest that the McGrath laryngoscope can make breathing tube insertion easier than when the conventional Macintosh laryngoscope is used.</summary>
