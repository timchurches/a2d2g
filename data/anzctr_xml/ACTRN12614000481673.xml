    <interventions>A new modification of pancreaticogastrostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy: anastomosis of the pancreatic duct to the gastric mucosa with invaginatation of the pancreatic remnant end into the posterior gastric wall. 
Operative technique: Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in a classical technique using (linear cutter TRT75  , green,  Ethicon (Registered Trademark)) to cut at the neck of the pancreas. Very few cases required further hemostasis as using the linear cutter was very effective to control bleeding from the pancreatic edge. The pancreatic remnant was mobilized 2 to 3 cm from the splenic vein and the surrounding tissues. After removal of one or two staples and identification of the pancreatic duct, a 10 or 12 Fr. polyethylene catheter passed into the main pancreatic duct to ensure its patency. The catheter was cut 1 cm. from the pancreatic edge. Then a stab 5mm. transverse full thickness incision was made on the posterior wall of the stomach opposite to the pancreatic duct end . A purse string suture was made in the posterior gastric wall around the opening in the posterior gastric wall using 2-0 polypropylene  sutures, with a distance between the purse suture and the opening 1.5 times the distance between the pancreatic duct and the upper edge of the pancreas. The purse string suture was left loose. Next, anastomosis between the pancreatic duct and the gastric mucosa was done using four 4-0 polypropylene  sutures at the four  quarters. The polyethylene catheter passes into the stomach through the pancreaticogastrostomy and left to be dropped spontaneously. Four 3-0 polyglactin sutures were secured between the capsule of the pancreas (1 cm. from the edge) and the seromascular layer of the posterior wall of the stomach. In cases of soft pancreas, the pancreatic sutures were taken a little bit deeper. Care must be taken that the posterior suture must be done and kept loose before the anastomosis between the pancreatic duct and the gastric mucosa as the field will be blocked by the anastomosis and will make taking this suture very difficult and hazardous. Then, the posterior wall of the stomach is wrapped around the pancreatic remnant while the purse string is tightened to ensure invagination of the pancreatic remnant. This maneuver should be performed very gently to ensure tight wrapping of the posterior gastric wall around the pancreatic remnant and to avoid any tension over the anastomosis between the pancreatic duct and the gastric mucosa. Further reconstruction of digestive continuity was obtained by end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy, and side-to-side stapled gastrojejonostomy. All patients had two closed suction drains placed at the time of operation, one in close proximity to the pancreatic anastomosis and the other in the pelvis. duration of the procedure is from 3 - 6 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Data collected from the literature as regards Standard technique by anastomosing the pancreatic duct to gastric mucosa using 4 polypropelene 4-0 sutures in the four quadrants. Duration of the procedure is from 3 - 6 hours.

    <statisticalmethods>The statistical analysis of data done by using excel program for figures and SPSS (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL) program statistical package for social science version 17. The description of data done in form of mean (+/-) SD for quantitative data and frequency &amp; proportion for Qualitative data. Chi square test and more accurate Fisher Exact test was selected  for qualitative data and odds ratio for risk assessment. P is significant if equals 0.05 at confidence interval 95%.
Sample size  calculation was based on a error of 0.05, power of 0.80  using G power program version 3.1.3 2007 
as the wide range of incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (0 - 17%), calculation revealed that any sample size will give valid results.</statisticalmethods>
