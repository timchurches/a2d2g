  <interventions>
    <interventions>Myopics younger than 40 years old with more than 12 dioptres of myopia or who were not fit for  Lassie assisted in situ keratomieusis (LASIK) were included . Group A was the Clear lens extraction with foldable intraocular lens implantation this is a one off intervention lasting approximately one half hour, and Group B was the Visian intra ocular contact lens (ICL) implantation this is a one off intervention lasting approximately one half hour  . Patients were evaluated for visual and anatomic outcome, and complications</interventions>
    <comparator>The 2 groups were compared to each other</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: surgery</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients subjective and objective refraction measured in diopters using the retinoscope and autorefractor. and verified by visual acuity testing using the snellens chart</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks post surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>saftey of the procedure regarding retinal problems or intra ocular infections in group1
in group 2 complications as cataract ,glaucoma
these outcome are detected and measured by clinical examination by the slit lamp and ophthalmoscope</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year post surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
