  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Visceral obesity is strongly associated with dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia, low
      HDL-cholesterol and mildly elevated LDL-cholesterol) and insulin resistance, key
      characteristics of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Recent evidence has clearly established that
      the risk of CVD is increased in subjects with the MetS. The precise reason for this remains
      unclear, but appears to be closely related with dyslipidaemia. Effective management of
      dyslipidaemia is important to reduce the risk of CVD in these subjects.

      Hypothesis: Inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis by statins and triglyceride synthesis
      by fish oils improve lipoprotein metabolism in visceral obese men.</summary>
