  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Response at Week 12 - Clinical response, defined as decrease in Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score, from Baseline value of &gt;=100 points. Baseline defined as Week 0. CDAI is scoring system measuring disease severity with scores of &gt;=220 to &lt;=450 describing moderately-to-severely active population(higher score indicated severe disease). Contains 8 questions related to disease symptoms; soft tools in 7 days (weightage (Wt)as 2; abdominal pain over 7 days Wt= 5; general well being Wt= 7;Crohn's disease symptoms Wt=20; antidiarrhoeal medication used Wt=30; abdominal mass Wt=10; Anemia Wt=10; standard weight with Wt=1.Total CDAI score algorithmically derived from participants-reported above Crohn's disease symptoms and investigator recorded assessments, calculated by Interactive Voice Response System. Missing efficacy data, imputed using "no effect" imputation where missing was no response or no change in response (were non-responders). If baseline CDAI, &lt; 100,participant was considered non-responder.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Remission at Week 8, Week 12 and at Both Week 8 and Week 12 - Clinical remission is defined as a CDAI score of &lt;150 points. CDAI is scoring system measuring disease severity with scores of &gt;=220 to &lt;=450 describing moderately-to-severely active population(higher score indicated severe disease). Contains 8 questions related to disease symptoms; soft tools in 7 days (weightage (Wt)as 2; abdominal pain over 7 days Wt= 5; general well being Wt= 7;Crohn's disease symptoms Wt=20; antidiarrhoeal medication used Wt=30; abdominal mass Wt=10; Anemia Wt=10; standard weight with Wt=1.Total CDAI score algorithmically derived from participants-reported above Crohn's disease symptoms and investigator recorded assessments, calculated by Interactive Voice Response System. Missing efficacy data, imputed using "no effect" imputation where missing was no response or no change in response (were non-responders).

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response at Week 8 and at Both Week 8 and Week 12 - Clinical response, defined as decrease in Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) score, from Baseline value of &gt;=100 points.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in C-reactive Protein Concentration at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 - Blood samples were planned to be collected for the measurement of C-reactive protein at Baseline (Screening) and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Baseline is defined as the measurement at Screening (Day -21 to Day -1). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at the post-Baseline time points (Week 4, week 8 and week 12) minus the value at Baseline respectively. The study was terminated prematurely due to absence of favorable benefit-to-risk profile of GSK1605786A, and thus data for this outcome measure was not collected.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Faecal Calprotectin at Week 12 - Stool samples were planned to be collected for the measurement faecal calprotectin level at Baseline (Screening) and Week 12. Baseline is defined as the measurement at Screening (Day -21 to Day -1). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at the post-Baseline time point minus the value at Baseline. The study was terminated prematurely due to absence of favorable benefit-to-risk profile of GSK1605786A, and thus data for this outcome measure was not collected.</outcome>

      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK1605786A - The PK analyses was planned to perform to characterize the PK of the study drug GSK1605786A, in the participant population. PK is defined as the concentration of drug in a participant's blood at certain time points after the drug was taken by mouth. PK sampling was to be conducted at week 2, 4, 6 ,8, 10 and week 12 (pre-dose, post-dose 0.5 hour (hr) to 2 hr, 3 to 6 hr, and 6 to 28 hr post-dose. The study was terminated prematurely due to absence of favorable benefit-to-risk profile of GSK1605786A, and thus the data for this outcome measure was not collected.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacogenetic Analyses - Sample for the pharmacogenetic analyses was collected during any one of the Treatment Phase visit (Week 2, 4, 6, or 8 ). The pharmacogenetic analyses was planned to perform to investigate the relationship between the genetic markers with the safety and efficacy response to GSK1605786A. These pharmacogenetic analyses was not conducted following the early termination of the study. The study was terminated prematurely due to absence of favorable benefit-to-risk profile of GSK1605786A, and thus data was not collected for this outcome measure.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, active treatment, parallel group induction
      study in subjects with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease. Subjects will receive
      one of two doses (500 milligrams once daily, 500 milligrams twice daily) of GSK1605786A for
      12 weeks. The primary objective of the study is to induce clinical response (Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index [CDAI] decrease from baseline of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI
      score less than 150) with GSK1605786A at Week 12 in subjects with active Crohn's disease to
      qualify subjects for enrolment into a 52 week maintenance study (CCX114157). Secondary
      objectives will include assessment of the safety and evaluation of the efficacy in induction
      of clinical response or remission. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events and
      assessment of changes in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs and electrocardiogram.
      Population pharmacokinetics will evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes
      assessments will include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, SF-36, EQ-5D,
      and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Crohn's Disease.</summary>
