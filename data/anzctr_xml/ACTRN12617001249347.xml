  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will attend on three separate occasions (after fasting from solids for 14 h and liquids for 12 h) at least five days apart. 

Subjects will receive an ID (intraduodenal) infusion of each of the following on the three study days:
(1) 25 %w/v glucose at a rate of 3 kcal/min, 
(2) 4 mM sucralose in 0.9 %w/v saline, or 
(3) 0.9 %w/v saline 
All in a volume of 300 mL over 60 minutes (i.e. 5mL/min from t = 0  60 min). Saline (0.9%w/v) will be infused at a rate of 5mL/min for a further 60min (i.e. t = 60  120min).

On each study day, subjects will undergo measurements of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR)  and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow by Doppler ultrasonography, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), blood glucose, serum insulin, plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and catecholamines under randomised, double-blind conditions. Each study will be separated by at least 5 days.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to evaluate the effects of the artificial sweetener, sucralose, compared to glucose and saline (control), on blood pressure, heart rate and superior mesenteric artery flow following intraduodenal infusion, in healthy older subjects. 

On three separate days, separated by at least 5 days, subjects will receive an ID infusion of either (1) 25 %w/v glucose at a rate of 3 kcal/min, (2) 4 mM sucralose in 0.9 %w/v saline, or (3) 0.9 %w/v saline all in a volume of 300 mL over 60 minutes (i.e. 5mL/min from t = 0  60 min). Saline (0.9%w/v) will be infused at a rate of 5mL/min for a further 60min (i.e. t = 60  120min). Measurements of blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow by Doppler ultrasonography, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), blood glucose, serum insulin, plasma glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and catecholamines under randomised, double-blind conditions.

The primary hypotheses underlying the current study are that (i) compared to saline, intraduodenal infusions of glucose and sucralose will induce a larger reduction in blood pressure and increases in both heart rate and superior mesenteric artery flow and (ii) ID glucose will have a greater hypotensive response than sucralose. </summary>
