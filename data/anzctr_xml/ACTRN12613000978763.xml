  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study we sought to compare the independent effects of two programs to improve social cognition in schizophrenia: SoCog Mental-State Reasoning Training (MSRT) and SoCog Emotion Recognition Training (ERT). Both SoCog programs consist of 12 one-hour sessions over 6 weeks . Training is run by two facilitators in small groups of 3-6 participants using a manual-driven suite of activities including games developed by us [e.g., Social Trivia (MSRT) and Face Detective (ERT)] and Tropfest Videos (http://tropfest.com/au/). The training approach of SoCog provides repeated exposure and practice of the skills that underlie complex mental-state reasoning abilities or emotion recognition abilities.

A weekly points system with prizes is used to provide extrinsic motivation. So, when a participant wins a game or they contribute a valid hypothesis or observation they can be awarded points at the discretion of the facilitator. Points are tallied and a prize (e.g., small toiletries and stationery items) is awarded to the participant with the most points at the end of each week. Likewise, intrinsic motivation plays an important role in overcoming the core motivational impairments in schizophrenia. With the latter in mind, we structured SoCog sessions to give a sense of control over training and to enhance engagement with the treatment; thus, facilitators set the activity for the first 20 minutes of a session and then participants chose an activity for the second 20 minutes with a 10-minute break between the first and second activity.

The specific training approach of SoCog-MSRT is that participants receive repeated exposure and practice of the skills that underlie complex mental-state reasoning abilities (e.g., interpreting and predicting other peoples actions/behaviours in terms of causal mental states; e.g., Fred will do x since he wants y and believes z about the situation). Thus, activities centre on vignettes of social situations with a focus on making inferences and predictions about characters thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Similar vignettes are repeated across different activities with frequent repetition of training materials and concepts and a focus on making inferences and predictions about characters thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. The facilitators roles are to guide discussion, and to explore a range of possible hypotheses for beliefs, perceptions, or behaviors that will involve the group in developing a reasonable explanation for a particular situation. This further allows for different possible interpretations and inferences from all group members, which presents an invaluable learning experience about the often ambiguous social interaction in the real world.

In contrast, SoCog-ERT is focussed on drawing attention to salient facial features that are important for accurate recognition of others emotions`. As with SoCog-MSRT  this program relies on a suite of manualised games and activities developed specifically to direct attention to relevant facial features of commonly confused emotional expressions (e.g. using the eyebrows to distinguish fear from surprise).

Adherence to treatment was monitered via sign-off sheets which each participant was expected to sign before starting each group session. To encourage attendance 100% attendance certificates were awarded at a graduation ceromony at the completion of treatment. Completion certificates were also awarded.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual with no social cognitive intervention. Treatment as usual is defined as the treatment the participant is receiving from their current treatment team (inpatients and outpatients) and includes medication and any other rehabilitation programs (e.g., vocational) or day programs for inpatients. Our treatment groups also continued to receive treatment as usual with the addition of either ERT or MSRT.</comparator>

Because referrals were slow we could only partially randomise the first four cohorts of the study into either treatment (11) or a control group (10) to produce workable group sizes. These were drawn using an opaque envelope.

    <statisticalmethods>Initial power analyses were calculated based on similar  studies: one of which produced a large effect size (d = 1.24); and the other of which reported moderate effect sizes (eta squared = .37 to .44). To obtain a moderate effect size for 3 treatment groups such as in our study with an alpha level of .05 requires n = 52/group (total = 156), or, for a large effect, n = 21/group (total = 63). Based on these calculations,w e planned to recruit 40 into each treatment group and 48 into the TAU group (total = 128) which will allow us to detect significant differences with an alpha level of .05 and a power estimate of .80 if effect sizes are medium to large.

Planned mixed-between GLM analyses were performed initially but significant interactions between treatment groups (SoCog-ERT, SoCog-MSRT, and controls) and time were not found. This was likely due to the small sample sizes resulting in insufficient power. Observed power estimates for the interactions ranged from 6.6% - 37.2%.
Inspection of the data showed a general pattern of participants in the training groups have better scores than controls on several measures. As such, post-hoc repeated measures analyses were performed separately for each group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Poor functioning in social activities, one of the most debilitating aspects of schizophrenia, is a core feature of this illness. Poor social functioning reinforces social isolation due to difficulties with communicating and understanding other peoples perspectives, as well as ones own.  It may also increase the risk of disease and death. Ninety percent of people with schizophrenia show poor social functioning even while in remission from their illness
Improving social disability in schizophrenia is a high research priority world-wide, driven by consumers reports that it is one of their greatest unmet needs.

Research suggests that impaired social cognition underlies poor social functioning. Social cognition is the mental operation that allows humans to think about and form impressions about other people in social interactions.  Put simply it is people being able to think about other people. 


The aim of study was to determine the most effective way to treat poor social cognition in schizophrenia in order to improve real-world social functioning.  We will do this by comparing the independent effects of two innovative social-cognitive remediation programs developed by us at the Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science (MACCS): one targets poor emotion recognition (emotion recognition training; ERT) and the other targets poor mental-state reasoning (i.e., reasoning about other people in terms of the others thoughts). We refer to the second program as mental-state reasoning training (without ERT: MSRT). We expected to see improvements in participants' social thinking and functioning in every day life.
