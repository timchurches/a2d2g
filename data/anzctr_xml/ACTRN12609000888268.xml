  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomized to recieve 6g per day psyllium or 6g/d potato starch placebo for 6 weeks on each intervention. Psyllium and placebo will be given as 6g/day as 12 x 500mg capsules, with participants instructed to consume these at once or in divided doses with a large glass of water. After 6 weeks participants will washout for 2 weeks before starting 6 weeks on the opposite intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>While on placebo or psyllium, both groups with be able to eat a normal diet.A diet recall questionaire will be given to both groups after randomization, to ensure that the groups are similar in terms of calorie intake, and the percent energy derived from fat, carbohydrate, protein, and that they have a similar background fibre intake The intervention is supplemented fibre or placebo as described above</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin sensitivity. This will meaured through the matsuda method which is the best model to the gold standard euglycaemic clamp. This involved overnight fasting, with a oral glucose tolerance test, with measurements at 0min, 30 min, 60, 90 and 120 of serum insulin and glucose. That matsuda index calculation gives an insulin sensitivity score.
  Equipment will be IV cannulation, and syringes to draw the venous samples at the time points as described above. The Liggins Institute has an in house assay for insulin levels.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to formally assess the impact of fibre alone on insulin sensitivity, and if this is achieved independently of weight loss. Fibre will be givenas a supplement, without altering other aspects of the diet. The hypothesis is that the properties of fibre can benefit insulin senstivity independently of weight loss, clarifying its role in dietary interventions for overweight, and normal weight insulin resistant people. We expect the effect to be greatest in the obese population.</summary>
