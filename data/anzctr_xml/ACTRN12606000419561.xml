    <interventions>Acupressure Bracelet(s)
Study intervention: Two proprietary elastic bracelets containing plastic studs (Sea Bands). Device applied such that stud applies pressure over p6 (Neugian) Acupressure point ) situated 3 fingers breadth proximal to the wrist crease between the flexor tendons flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus.

A third group will not be fitted with any device. 
The device will be worn for  90 minutes during the data collection phase. After this period patients continued use of the device will be at the discretion of the treating doctor and the patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Intervention: Identical device  applied such that stud applies pressure over a point three fingers breadth proximal to the flexor crease of the wrist but lateral to the flexor tendons of the forearm.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nausea and vomiting are symptoms frequently reported by patients attending Emergency Departments (EDs).We aim to determine if Acupressure is useful for reducing nausea and vomiting experienced by patients presenting to the Emergency Department. Acupressure is a non-invasive variation of the traditional Chinese Medicine Modality of Acupuncture. To date no studies have been performed in an Emergency Department. Conclusions from previous studies of acupressure in other settings have had mixed results. These studies all suggest that acupressure wristbands are safe and easy to apply. 
Our hypothesis is that the use of Acupressure bracelets will lead to a clinically significant reduction in nausea experienced by Emergency Department patients. Our secondary hypothesis is that Sham acupressure (placebo) may provide a similar clinically significant benefit.</summary>
