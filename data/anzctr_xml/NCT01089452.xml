  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking to evaluate which drug combination, olmesartan/amlodipine or
      perindopril/amlodipine, is better at lowering blood pressure in people with mild to moderate
      hypertension. The investigators will be enrolling people who are either currently taking
      medication to lower their blood pressure or who have been recently diagnosed with high blood
      pressure and are not yet on medication.

      Patients on medication for their blood pressure will be asked to stop taking this medication
      for 2 to 4 weeks. If their blood pressure is suitable (not too high or low) they will be
      randomised to one of their treatment arm:

      Group 1 will receive Perindopril on its own (5mg for 4 weeks followed by 10mg for 8 weeks).
      There will be 80 patients in this group.

      Group 2 will receive Perindopril and Amlodipine together (5mg/5mg for 4 weeks, 10mg/5mg for a
      further 4 weeks then 10mg/10mg for the final 4 weeks). There will be 80 patient in this
      group.

      Group 3 will receive Olmesartan and Amlodipine together (20mg/5mg for 4 weeks, 40mg/5mg for a
      further 4 weeks then 40mg/10mg for the final 4 weeks). There will be 120 patients in this
      group.

      During the study we will measure the patients blood pressure and heart rate, weight and
      perform routine blood tests. They will also have ECGs (3 occasions) and 24 hour blood
      pressure monitor (4 occasions).

      At the end of the study patients pre-study medication will be restarted or they will be put
      on to a suitable alternative.</summary>
