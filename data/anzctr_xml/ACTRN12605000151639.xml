    <exclusivecriteria> Subjects will be excluded from the study if: shoulder symptoms are exacerbated during active cervical movements with and/or without overpressure and/or during cervical or thoracic region palpation; they are complaining of parathesia in the affected upper limb; passive shoulder joint mobilisation is contra-indicated; shoulder forward flexion and/or abduction is less than 75% active range of movement; shoulder pain is due to an inflammatory or neoplastic disorder; they have had surgery or trauma to the shoulder in the previous 4 weeks; or they are experiencing a feeling of shoulder instability.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Forty subjects presenting with pain during  shoulder movements will be recruited for this study. Subjects will be randomly allocated into either a control or experimental group. Both groups will receive advice and shoulder exercises. The experimental group will additionally receive passive shoulder joint mobilisation. Outcome measurements of pain intensity, functional impairment, self assessment of improvement and active range of movement will be re-assessed by a blinded researcher at 1, 3 and 6 months following recruitment.</summary>
