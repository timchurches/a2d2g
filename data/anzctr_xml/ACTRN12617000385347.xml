  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive contoured shoe inserts (foot orthoses) from a commercially available range (Vasyli International, Labrador, Australia). The inserts are manufactured from ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) of high, medium and low density, and have an inbuilt arch support and 6 varus wedging. A variety of lengths and shapes are available to fit the shape of different footwear. Study practitioners (Podiatrists, Physiotherapists) will fit contoured inserts to the participants shoes, following a prescription algorithm that emphasises comfort. Comfort can be enhanced through the addition of wedges to the forefoot, rearfoot or heel, or by gentle heat moulding. Where possible, the inserts will be able to be transferred across their usual footwear. Participants will be given written instructions for using and adapting to the inserts, and will be advised to wear the inserts as much as possible for the duration of the study (12 months).

To reflect current clinical practice, and to provide sufficient opportunity to ensure adequate comfort and prescribe additional inserts, participants will attend up to 6 appointments (each approx. 20-30 mins duration) with the study practitioner in their private clinic, in the initial phases of the study. Participants will be provided with up to 4 pairs of contoured inserts, fitted to multiple pairs of commonly worn shoes, in order to maximise wear time.

Participants with a high BMI (30 kg/m2) will attend a follow-up appointment 6 months after randomisation to receive new inserts. This will not be necessary for those with a BMI &lt;30 kg/m2, as the pressure-redistributing properties of the contoured inserts are maintained after 12 months. 

To maximise outcomes of wearing a comfortable, contoured device, participants will receive one pair of sandals from the Vionics range (Vionics International, San Francisco, USA). Participants will be encouraged to wear these during times that they do not normally wear enclosed footwear (e.g. at home). </interventions>
    <comparator>Flat inserts will be used as the comparator intervention. This is because the contour and wedging of the contoured inserts are proposed to exert mechanical effects on the foot and lower limb, which is thought to be the basis for symptom improvement. The flat insert should have no mechanical effect, but has potential to provide enhanced sensory feedback and shock attenuation. The flat insert will have identical covering fabric to the contoured inserts. To control for gradual contouring that occurs with repeated wear of low-density inserts (a limitation of previous studies), the flat inserts will be made of high-density EVA. Standardised guidelines for fitting and follow-up of the flat inserts will be followed by study practitioners to ensure comfort.

To provide sufficient opportunity to ensure adequate comfort and prescribe additional inserts, and ensure consistent practitioner contact time for both insert conditions, participants will attend up to 6 appointments (each approx. 20-30 mins duration) with the study practitioner in their private clinic, in the initial phases of the study. Participants will be provided with up to 4 pairs of contoured inserts, fitted to multiple pairs of commonly worn shoes, in order to maximise wear time. At 6-months post-randomisation, a follow-up appointment will be made and all inserts replaced.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Worst knee pain severity during a self-nominated aggravating activity in the previous week. Participants will nominate one of three everyday activities that they experience the greatest pain severity (rising from sitting, squatting, stair ambulation). Pain severity will be measured on a 100mm VAS (terminal descriptors 0=no pain, 100=worst pain possible).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants will complete a series of pain visual analogue scales, rating the severity of their knee pain on a 100mm scale (terminal descriptors 0=no pain, 100=worst pain possible).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PF OA) is a leading cause of pain, disability and health expenditure in Australia, has no cure, and there is little evidence for effective treatments. Pilot data shows that simple contoured shoe inserts (foot orthoses) worn in everyday footwear can reduce pain in older adults with PF OA immediately and after 2 months of wear. This clinical trial will investigate whether contoured shoe inserts are an efficacious longer-term intervention for PF OA. The primary aim is to compare the 3-month efficacy of prefabricated, contoured shoe inserts to flat shoe inserts for reducing the severity of knee pain in people with PF OA. The FOOTPATH trial is a multicentre, randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups and 12-month follow-up. 160 participants aged 50 years and older will be randomly allocated to receive either contoured shoe inserts or flat shoe inserts. Outcomes will be evaluated at 3 and 12 months. Secondary aims will compare the 3- and 12-month effects of contoured inserts and flat inserts on pain, global improvement, function, quality of life, self-efficacy, kinesiophobia, adverse events and use of co-interventions, while cost-effectiveness will be evaluated at 12 months. </summary>
