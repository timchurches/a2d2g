  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 1 Treatment: Mometasone Furoate Cream (0.1%) 20mg/application site (5mg/cm2), single dose topical

All participants will receive the above treatment applied to a total of 16 sites (2x2cm2) on the inner aspect of their forearms (8 per arm). Four additional sites will be marked but will remain untreated to act as non-dosed control sites. 

Mometasone furoate cream will be applied to test sites at staggered timepoints followed by synchronized removal from all test sites to achieve treatment durations of 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240 &amp; 360 minutes. 

Part 2 Treatments:
Reference Treatment: Mometasone Furoate Cream (0.1%), 20mg per application site (5mg/cm2), single dose topical
Test Treatment: MK-0887G 20mg/application site (5mg/cm2), single dose, topical

All subjects will receive the same treatments which includes both the reference and test treatments as well as untreated control sites across a total of 20 sites (2cm x 2cm) marked on the volar aspect of the forearms (10 sites per arm). 

The reference and test treatments will be applied to test sites at staggered time points followed by synchronized removal from all test sites to achieve treatment durations (3 different durations for mometasone furoate and a single duration for MK0887G). The durations for the treatments have not yet been identified but will be deduced from the results of part 1 of the study.

The position of reference and test treatment sites will be determined by the randomization code.

MK0887G (fixed dose cream) is being developed for the treatment of infected dermatoses. However, this study is in healthy volunteers only.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 1

Objective: To evaluate the dose-duration response relationship for single doses of mometasone furoate cream and estimate its ED50 (duration at which chromameter readings are half maximal)

Measured by: quantification of skin blanching via chromameter readings</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: predose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 22, 24 &amp; 30hrs post dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2
Objective: To assess the relative vasoconstrictive potency of MK-0887G in comparison to the marketed Mometasone Furoate Cream.

Measured by: quantification of skin blanching via chromameter readings</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points: predose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 22, 24 &amp; 30hrs post dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2:
Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of MK-0887G

Measured by: Laboratory safety tests (haematology, chemistry), urinalysis, physical examination, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oral/tympanic temperature) and assessment of adverse events</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time points (laboratory safety tests, urinalysis, physical examination, ECG, vital signs): pre-dose &amp; Day 2

Time points (Adverse events):  pre-dose, Day 1, Day 2 and Day 15 (recorded in an ongoing fashion but at minimum elucidated at these timepoints)</timepoint>
