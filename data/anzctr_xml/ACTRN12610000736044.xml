  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transfusion of freshest available red blood cells. The freshest red blood cell is defined by the shortest number of days between the collection of the blood and its delivery. 
The freshest available red blood cells will be take in the back of the fridge of the blood bank 
The patients receiving the freshest red blood cells will be allocated in this group after randomisation
This allocation remains throughout the stay in intensive care or for the study period (6weeks)
The methods used in transfusion, the amoount of blood transfused depend on the needs of the patients and on the doctor's prescription. These characteristics are not defined by the protocole.</interventions>
    <comparator>standard care - blood of standard age
The standard care is the transfusion of the oldest available red blood cell, which has the highest number of days between the collection and the delivery (maximum 42 days).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the primary aim of this study is to determine feasibility of allocating the freshest available red blood cells in critically ill patients.
We will calculate the percentage of patients randomized among the eligible patients. The good communication between the intensive care unit-team and the blood bank team. and we will calculate the percentage of red blood cell packs younger than 7 days in each study group.</outcome>
