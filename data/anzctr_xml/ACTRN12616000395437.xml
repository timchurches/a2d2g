  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants are selected from patients already undergoing colonoscopy for various indications (Ie; family history of colorectal cancer, signs or symptoms concerning for bowel disease). The only intervention study participants are exposed to is a colonoscopy that they would undergo regardless of their involvement in the study.

Patients undergo colonoscopy and are randomised prior to the procedure to either narrow band imaging or standard white light on Olympus 190 series colonoscopes.  These are illumination settings on the colonoscope and can be used by a simple push of a button. Narrow band imaging uses filters to illuminate tissue at a selected wavelengths (415 and 540nm)- giving a high definition and excellent visual determination of polyp/adenoma histology. The proceduralist will be told prior to the procedure which modality they will be required to use and then they will complete the withdrawal of the colonoscope (when polyp detection is predominantly done) in this modality.

The procedure will be performed by consultant gastroenterologists or advanced trainees under the direct supervision of consultants. Each procedure usually takes about 15 minutes and they will all be required to have a withdrawal time of at least 7 minutes (which is associated with a higher polyp and adenoma pick up rate). </interventions>
    <comparator>Both groups undergo colonoscopy.
Trial group undergoes colonoscopy with withdrawal in narrow band imaging mode of illumination.
Control group undergoes colonoscopy with withdrawal in standard white light mode of illumination.

Standard white light is the default illumination setting of the colonoscope and uses no filters to limit the light's wavelength. Patient's randomised to have their colonoscopy in standard white light will have a standard colonoscopy with a withdrawal time of at least 7 minutes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of the Olympus 190 series colonoscope narrow band imaging (NBI) technology for the detection of polyps and adenomas, in comparison to the current standard white light technology used during colonoscopies. Research to date has found no difference between the two technologies of illumination, but with improved technology we believe that NBI may now improve our detection rate of polyps and adenomas- thereby decreasing the overall cancer risk per patient.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over, and have been scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy for diagnostic/investigational purposes.

Study details
All participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the NBI or standard white light colonoscopy. All other aspects of the procedure, other than the type of light used during the colonoscope withdrawal will remain the same between each group, as per standard care. NBI is simply a type of light available by pushing a button on the colonoscope, which uses filters to illuminate tissue at a selected wavelength. This may be beneficial for the detection of polyps and adenomas, despite providing less illumination overall than the standard white light.

Researchers will then review the colonoscopy procedure and histological notes to assess the detection rates for polyps and adenomas between each type of light. Subsequently, statistical analysis will determine which technology is better for polyp and adenoma detection.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on which type of light may be the most effective for the detection of polyps and adenomas in patients undergoing colonoscopy.
