A block randomisation for 3 arms (Pilates + exercises; yoga + exercises and Exercises only) generated in advance of recruitment for the target sample size, using the website http://www.randomization.org, and held by an investigator not involved in the recruitment process.

Correlational analysis of potentially explanatory variables and primary and secondary outcomes

Calculation of effect size using G*Power 3 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang &amp; Buchner, 2007) has taken into account a comparison of changes from before to after the intervention using dependent differences tests as well as differences between independent groups. Three previous studies reviewed (Rydeard et al, 2007; Cramer et al, 2013; Ezar et al, 2012) do not show clear differences in effect sizes noted for pain in change from baseline following yoga and Pilates interventions (ES range from 2.8  3.6 reductions in pain) compared to differences in changes in pain noted between treatment and exercise control groups (ES range from 1.0  2.5 more reduction in intervention compared to control groups). When comparing changes in a treatment versus control group, a sample size of 17 in each group would be required to detect a difference in change between groups of ES = 1 (the smallest effect reported in the above studies), assuming a level of significance of 0.05, and statistical power of 80%. To allow for withdrawal from the study and non-compliance, an initial sample size of 20 per group is sought. A sample of 19 in each intervention group would also provide sufficient power to detect changes from pre- to post-intervention of ES = 0.7 using the above assumptions, much smaller than those effects reported in the above studies.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the degree to which equipment Pilates and/or yoga are efficacious for treating chronic non-specific neck pain, when applied as an additional intervention to therapeutic exercises.

Our hypothesis is that the holistic approach of these therapies will alleviate pain and disability and improve quality of life for people with chronic neck pain when applied with the type of exercises usually prescribed by manual therapists, compared to prescription of these exercises alone.</summary>
