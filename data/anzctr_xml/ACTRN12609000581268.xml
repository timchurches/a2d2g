  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cannabis is often a difficult drug to stop, and its regular use often causes dependence and withdrawal symptoms when attempting to stop.  In Australia, the major treatment available for cannabis dependence is counselling, but many individuals find that counselling for cannabis use is not effective, particularly because of the withdrawal symptoms that occur.  
This project will assess a new treatment for cannabis dependence in patients who are seeking treatment to stop their cannabis use, and uses a combination of medications that aim to block the effects of cannabis withdrawal in the brain, and so reduce the severity of cannabis withdrawal symptoms. The three medications used in combination are tiagabine, acamprosate and mirtazapine.
Participants will be allocated to one of two treatment groups. One treatment group will receive a combination of the three active medications, tiagabine, acamprosate and mirtazapine for a period of 12 weeks. The second treatment group will receive placebo (dummy) medications for 12 weeks.  Allocation to either group will be by a randomisation process  like flipping a coin.
All patients in the trial will also receive a program of weekly counselling and support. Patients will participate in the trial for a period of six months.</summary>
