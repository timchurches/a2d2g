    <interventions>Screening intervention
Consented students will be screened for head lice infestation (case definitions = at least 1 live louse or &gt; 12 live lice = hyperinfested) 

Parent education intervention (includes a paper based screening tool and head lice comb)
Parents will be provided with an education package designed to provide them with the knowledge and skills to effectively screen their child/ren for head lice. Knowledge acquisition will be assessed pre and post education package using a short quiz. Head lice screening skills will be assessed by comparing the effectiveness of head lice detection by parents compared to trained screeners. Effectiveness is measured by detecting/not detecting head lice and by identifying/not identifying hyperinfestation with head lice.  

Treatment intervention
Treatment is oral ivermectin treatment - i.e. Stromectol tablets 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight up to 18 mgs two doses 7 days apart.  
Phase 1
In the first 2 schools students found to be infested/hyperinfested with head lice and their infested/hyperinfested household members will be offered ivermectin tablets free of charge. 
Phase 2 
In the next 2 schools students found to be infested/hyperinfested with head lice and their infested/hyperinfested household members will be offered a prescription for oral ivermectin and compliance with redeeming the prescription will be monitored using pharmacy records.
Phase 3
In the next 2 schools only hyperinfested students and their infested/hyperinfested household members will be offered oral ivermectin free of charge.
Phase 4
In the final 2 schools students found to be hyperinfested with head lice and their infested/hyperinfested household members will be offered a prescription for oral ivermectin and compliance with redeeming the prescription will be monitored using pharmacy records.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The prevalence of head lice infestation in primary schools students infested/hyperinfested with head lice and their infested/hyperinfested household members are treated with oral ivermectin. Outcome is measured by clinical assessment of all consented primary school students by trained head lice screeners in schools where ivermectin treatment has been offered 3 months after treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability of oral ivermectin treatment to primary school students, their parents and other household members. Outcome is assessed by administration of questionnaires containing Yes/No and categorical questions - one questionnaire for households where ivermectin was offered free of charge and one questionnaire for households where ivermectin script was offered and households paid for their treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days and 3 months after treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness of parental screening for head lice compared to effectiveness of trained head lice screeners.  Effectiveness is measured by detecting/not detecting head lice and by identifying/not identifying hyperinfestation with head lice. 
Screening procedure: Parental and trained screeners will use one fine-tooth comb per child. The comb method has been found to be superior to direct visual examination for the detection of head lice with one study finding the average time to first louse detection was 57 seconds with the comb compared to 116 seconds by direct visual examination. This method is not as invasive as combing after applying hair conditioner. All head hair will be combed at least twice, taking approximately 5 minutes per child for short hair and 15 minutes for long hair.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following parent education and student screening by parents and/or student screening by trained screeners prior to treatment and again 3 months after treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The prevalence of head lice infestation in primary schools when only hyperinfested students (&gt; 12 head lice) and their infested household members (at least 1 live louse) are treated with oral ivermectin compared to when all head lice infested students and their infested household members (at least 1 live louse detected) are treated with oral ivermectin. Outcome is assessed by whole of school screening by trained screeners using the combing protocol previously described.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The principal aim of this study is to obtain information that will enable the development of an effective sustainable head lice education, screening and treatment program suitable for implementation in all primary schools. The proposed study builds on the results of a pilot study we conducted in 2008 where we tested the feasibility and acceptability of whole-school head lice screening and the use of oral ivermectin as a treatment for head lice among those found to be infested. As screening hundreds of students is time consuming and therefore expensive and the provision of oral ivermectin free of charge to the consumer is also expensive the proposed study is designed to identify a more efficient approach.

The specific objectives of the proposed study are to determine if (1) parents/guardians (hereafter parent(s)) are as efficient at identifying head lice as trained screeners, (2) if oral ivermectin is an acceptable treatment for head lice in primary school children and their household members and (3) the most acceptable way to provide oral ivermectin treatment for head lice. An instrument to enable parents to screen their children for head lice has been developed and will be tested and validated; the acceptability of oral ivermectin, provided in three ways (free of charge to all infested students and their infested household members, through user pays prescription to all infested students and their infested household members and free of charge only to hyper-infested students and their infested household members (infested with more than 12 lice), will be ascertained using questionnaires, uptake of ivermectin and telephone contact (acceptability) and rescreening of infested and treated students (effectiveness)</summary>
