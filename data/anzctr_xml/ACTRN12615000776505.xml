  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will employ a double-blind placebo controlled within-subjects design. Each participant will complete two treatment conditions, separated by a minimum of one week. The treatment conditions will involve a single dose of either placebo or oxytocin (24 IU of Syntocinon spray), delivered by intranasal spray. Participants will receive each treatment in the laboratory, supervised by an experimenter.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control condition will consist of an intranasal placebo spray. The placebo spray consists of 5 ml Sorbitol, Glycerin and preserved water containing parabens.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body perception will be examined via the experience of a multi-sensory perceptual illusion, as assessed by self-report ratings, proprioceptive estimates, and kinematic measures. Self-report ratings are assessed on a 20 cm visual analogue scale. Proprioceptive estimates are assessed by recording the felt position of the arm in the horizontal/lateral plane directly before and after the experience of the illusion. Specifically, participants indicate the felt position of their arm with the use of a marker that can be slide across a bar positioned above a box in which their arm is hidden; the marker position is recorded to the nearest mm with a ruler. Kinematic measures relate to a grasping movement recorded with an electromagnetic tracker, and include integrated jerk and modelled sub-movement parameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The study will consist of two testing sessions  oxytocin and placebo  separated by a minimum of one week. Experience of the illusion will be assessed 45 minutes after each intervention is delivered, and compared between the two sessions. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Autism spectrum traits in the sample of healthy volunteers will be assessed using the Autism Spectrum Quotient. The effect of oxytocin on the experience of the illusion will be assessed in relation to these traits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Autism spectrum traits will be assessed only once, directly before delivery of the first intervention (whether placebo or oxytocin).</timepoint>

    <concealment>This study involves a single sample of healthy volunteers. A repeated measures design will be used to compare the effects of oxytocin to placebo. Hence, all participants will complete both the treatment (oxytocin) and control (placebo) conditions. The order that participants complete these conditions will be counterbalanced, and the treatment received in each session will be double-blinded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test whether a single dose of oxytocin influences body perception. Body perception will be examined using a multi-sensory illusion, in which individuals experience a sense of ownership for a prosthetic limb, involving integration of visual, tactile and proprioceptive sensory information. Perceptual and kinematic effects of this illusion will be assessed. Oxytocin will be delivered via nasal spray, and compared to a placebo spray in a repeated measures design. Participants will be healthy adult males. The effects of oxytocin on body perception will be examined with respect to autism spectrum traits (in the sample of healthy volunteers). It is hypothesised that oxytocin will facilitate the effects of the illusion.</summary>
