  <interventions>
    <interventions>The active intervention ("myCompass") is a fully-automated, self-help, public health intervention, that is tailored to the user and has no therapist input. Real-time self-monitoring of symptoms (e.g., problem moods, thoughts and behaviours) via mobile phone and/or computer/tablet is a key therapeutic feature.  Users can self-monitor three symptoms of their choice at any one time, selected from a list of 20, or three that are recommended to them by the program (e.g., confidence, worry, irritability, motivation, diet, and medication use).  Each symptom is rated on a 10-point scale (e.g., how confident do you feel right now, how worried do you feel right now, how satisfied are you that you have taken your prescribed medication today).  At the time of rating, users also provide contextual information about where they are, what they are doing and who they are with, using a series of drop-down menus.  To improve adherence to the intervention users can schedule short message service (SMS) or email reminders to facilitate self-monitoring (frequency of reminders determined by the user); receive and print graphical feedback about their monitoring, including contextual information, on their phone or computer (to monitor change and assist identification of triggers); and elect to receive helpful facts, mental health-care tips or motivational statements by SMS or email.  
The myCompass program offers evidence-based and interactive psychological modules that users can complete via the internet on their computers. The program contains 12 skill-building modules derived from CBT, Interpersonal Psychotherapy, Problem-solving Therapy and Positive Psychology that cover topics such as Managing Fear and Anxiety, Tackling Unhelpful Thinking, Managing Loss and Major Life Change, and Solving Problems.  Each module comprises three 10-minute sessions and includes activities for users to complete on the computer. There are home practice tasks recommended for participants to complete between the weekly online sessions (i.e. completion of one full module per week), which are intended to promote skill generalisation.  Users can, however, complete the modules of their choice and at their own pace, and/or those recommended to them by the myCompass program. As part of the myCompass registration process, program users  complete a profile questionnaire, responses to which are used to tailor the self-monitoring and module recommendations.   Specifically, this questionnaire asks users to rate the extent to which they experience a range of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (e.g., worry, irritability, difficulties with motivation and concentration).  Targeting the three highest rated symptoms, in-built algorithms generate personalised feedback to the user about the self-monitoring dimensions and psychological modules that may be of greatest benefit (i.e., each dimension and module is weighted according to its clinical relevance for each symptom, and those with the highest weightings are recommended). Participants will have 8 weeks to undertake the myCompass program, with a 4 week tailing off period. During this 4 week tailing off period, myCompass users will only have access to the real-time self-monitoring of symptoms (e.g., problem moods, thoughts and behaviours), but will not have access to any Module content and activities. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo control intervention ("Healthy Lifestyles") is an online and interactive health information program which provides information about a range of health topics including environmental and community health, stress and wellbeing, sustainable living, healthy skin and eye health, safe road usage, and travelling. The program has no therapeutic content, and has been successfully used as a placebo in previous studies by members of the research team.  Participants in the placebo control group will similarly have access to the intervention for 8 weeks with a tailing off of 4 weeks.

    <concealment>Participants will be invited to enrol in the study via a generic letter prepared by the researchers but mailed from their doctor, or from the general community. Interested participants will visit the study website to enrol and complete screening measures. 
Participants who pass the eligibility criteria (automated) will then be randomised using computerised random numbers procedure. Members of the research team will not be involved in the randomisation process, and only the trial manager and an off-site research assistant will know the group to which a participant has been allocated.  This is necessary so that appropriate technical support can be provided to participants, if necessary. The allocation will remain concealed to the research team coordinating the trial. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation to either myCompass or the placebo control  intervention will be carried out after baseline measurement, according to a sequence generated by a computerized random-number generator using permutated blocks. The randomisation process will be facilitated by a the research platform, which will occur without researcher input. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS and STATA.  Characteristics of the two groups at baseline will be compared using chi-square tests for categorical data and t-tests for continuous data.  Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated by intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses using a technique recommended for analysing incomplete datasets, namely, mixed models repeated measures (MMRM).  Supplementary analyses will use data for completers and will also investigate whether there are any differences by recruitment source, duration of diabetes and presence of comorbid conditions.  Adjustments will be made for multiple statistical testing, as appropriate.  

The primary study outcome is a significant improvement in work and social functioning, measured by the Work and Social Adjustment Scale, for myCompass users at 3 months.  In a previously approved study (UNSW Australia HREC10019), A/Professor Proudfoot's research team obtained an average between-group effect size (based on estimated marginal means) of d = .3 for work and social functioning.  We calculated the sample size for a series of t-tests (cross-sectional comparison of arms) with alpha = 0.05 and desired power = 80%.  The sample size required was N=350 (175 per arm).    We cross-checked the sample size calculation using a reduction of 5 points on our secondary outcome, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, 29), and got a similar outcome.  A 5-point reduction on the PHQ-9 is considered an adequate treatment response.  
Previous studies indicate attrition rates of approximately 40% in eHealth studies.  As such, we will recruit 300 in each arm of the study for sufficient statistical power for completer analyses (600 in total).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will test the hypothesis that functioning and mental wellbeing will be improved in people with type 2 diabetes and comorbid depression following the use of a fully-automated mobile phone and web-based mental health intervention (myCompass) for 12 weeks, compared with those who receive a placebo intervention.
