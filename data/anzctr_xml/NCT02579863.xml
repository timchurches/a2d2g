    <inclusivecriteria>-  Confirmed diagnosis of active multiple myeloma and measurable disease.

          -  Ineligible to receive treatment with auto-SCT due to age (=65 years old) or any
             significant coexisting medical condition (cardiac, renal, pulmonary or hepatic

             tests (with a sensitivity of at least 25 Milli-international units/Milliliter) within

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide and low dose
      dexamethasone with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) to that of lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone
      without pembrolizumab in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with newly
      diagnosed and treatment-na√Øve multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell
      transplant (Auto-SCT).</summary>
