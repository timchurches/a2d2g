Experimental: Intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) - Patients will receive intravenous tenecteplase (0.25mg/kg, maximum 25mg, administered as a bolus over ~10 seconds).

Active Comparator: Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) - Patients will receive intravenous t-PA at the standard licensed dose of 0.9 mg/kg up to a maximum of 90mg, 10% as bolus and the remainder over 1 hour.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients presenting to the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke, who are are
      eligible for standard intravenous tPA therapy within 4.5 hours of stroke onset will be
      assessed for major vessel occlusion to determine their eligibility for randomization into the
      trial. If the patient gives informed consent they will be randomised 50:50 using central
      computerised allocation to intravenous alteplase or tenecteplase before all participants
      undergo intra-arterial clot retrieval. The trial is prospective, randomised, open-label,
      blinded endpoint (PROBE) design.</summary>
