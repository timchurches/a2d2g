    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The trial will be advertised and respondents will have the trial explained to them. If they are interested will be asked to sign a consent form and under go screening. Participants will be randomised to a predetermined sequences of drug administration over the study period of the active trial with a 3-day period of normal smoking between the administrations of each individual drug in the sequence. 
A randomisation code will be affixed to the plastic bag containing each product. Four different products will be packaged together into a single box (study product pack), which will be assigned a pack number. On the first study day a study product pack will be given to participants, sequentially, on arrival. The pack number will be recorded next to the participant number and also on the study product supply form which will tell the researcher which individual product to give on each study day. This sheet will only list the randomisation code, not the product name.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation codes will be prepared by computer in advance, four for each participant. On arrival to each study session study staff will retrieve the product corresponding to the relevant randomisation code.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study tests the hypothesis that a more rapid nicotine delivery from nicotine replacement therapy results in a superior withdrawal relief, and improved product satisfaction. 
It compares the Ruyan e-cigarette inhaled nicotine delivery device to existing nicotine therapy and placebo, in conferring withdrawal relief in 48 people. Time to peak serum nicotine levels will be compared between the products in 12 of the 48 people. Time to peak concentration will be correlated with reported withdrawal symptoms.</summary>
