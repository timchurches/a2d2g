    <interventions>Randomised allocation of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT). EGDT involves treatment with intravenous fluids, and medications to support the blood pressure and heart following a protocol. A special catheter is inserted to monitor central blood oxygen levels and the standard treatments are given according to the blood oxygen level reading. EGDT is given for 6 hours, then the patient receives standard care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Randomised allocation of standard care at the clinician's discretion in accordance with current best practice. Standard treatment may involve treatment with intravenous fluids, and medications to support the blood pressure and heart.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study is to determine whether providing EGDT, compared to standard care, reduces 90-day mortality in patients presenting to the ED of hospitals in Australasia with severe sepsis.

Each patient meeting all of the exclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomised in the ED to receive either EGDT for a total of 6 hours post-randomisation, or standard care.

Patients assigned to receive EGDT will be cared for by the dedicated ARISE study team. The patient will receive treatment as per the study protocol for 6 hours with central blood oxygen levels as the target end-point, then receive standard care.

Patients assigned to receive standard care will continue to be cared for by the hospital team in accordance with current best practice.

Patients in both groups will also receive any additional treatment needed, such as antibiotics or surgery.

The study will be conducted in 32 hospitals in Australasia with 1600 patients enrolled in the study over a 2.5 year period.</summary>
