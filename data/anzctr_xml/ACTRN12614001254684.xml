  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ying Hui Medical's oesophageal and gastric balloon catheter with multipair silver electrodes;The paediatric version of the catheter will consist of a polyurethane tube with 10 x 5 mm length silver plated copper coils which have a 1 mm gap between adjacent recording electrodes. The catheter would have the same diameter as a 7- French gauge nasogastric feeding tube (2.3 mm diameter). There will be two latex balloons (oesophageal and gastric balloons) mounted on the same polyurethane catheter which are both 2.5 cm in length to measure oesophageal and gastric pressure.
	The adult version of the catheter (which will be used in children &gt; 12 y.o) will be the same as the catheter used in previous published research. The catheter will consist of a polyurethane tube with 10 x 10 mm length silver plated copper coils which are 1 mm apart. The diameter of the catheter will be 2.8 mm ( similar to an 8 French gauge nasogastric feeding tube). There will be two latex balloons ( oesophageal and gastric balloons) mounted on the same polyurethane catheter which are 7 cm in length. 

The catheter will be inserted by trial physician, with the assistance of a play therapist, an experienced paediatric nurse at the sleep lab. Routinely the sleep study commence between 1800-2100 (depending on the sleep time of the child), and ends between 0500-0600. The catheter will be removed at the end of the sleep study, similar to all the other routine sleep study set up.


Each child will have the catheter in situ overnight for the entire duration of the sleep studies for one night only at SCH sleep laboratory (or until the catheter is removed for any reason). As per routine sleep study set up, the child will be observed by a sleep technician or sleep lab nurse during the entire duration of the sleep study via a camera installed in the sleep study room. Whilst the catheter is in situ, the data collected on diaphragmatic EMG, oesophageal and gastric pressure, will be recorded and visualised in real time. Minor adjustment to the catheter may be made to ensure the catheter is at the optimal position.

For the outcome of safety, the data collected will be the same for participants across different age groups, including vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation level), hoarse voice or cry,  cough, sore throat (if able to express in words), nose bleed or vomit from the insertion process, pain (described by child or perceived by carer), persistent bradycardia due to presence of the catheter, complications associated with the catheter itself including rupture of the balloon whilst in-situ.  
The occurrence of any adverse outcome will be documented by sleep technician / sleep nurse at the time it arise or during routine observation time throughout the sleep study.

    <concealment>All children who are referred for sleep study at the Sleep Lab at SCH are given written information on the study by their sleep physician on the day of sleep clinic review. Interested families are then approached in person by the research team on the same day. A tour of the sleep lab with all the routine sleep study set up placed in a tray (including the oesophageal catheter) will be shown to the child and the parent. The child is encouraged to touch and handle the electrodes, wires, sensors, and oesophageal catheters. 
On the day of the planned sleep study, written consent will be obtained from the parents / carers by the principal researcher who will insert the catheter.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overnight polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for diagnosing sleeprelated
breathing disorders such as
obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The monitoring of work of breathing during sleep is paramount to help differentiate
between different types of sleep disordered breathing, which direct the cause and hence management for sleep
disordered breathing in children. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Australasian Sleep Association
deems the definitive measure of work of breathing as changes in oesophageal pressure (Poes) during sleep, which
is measured using a catheter (thin flexible tube) inserted into the oesophagus. Measuring the diaphragm muscle
(our main breathing muscle)'s electrical activity (EMGdi) is another way of accurately assessing work of breathing
during sleep. Simultaneous recording of Poes and EMGdi offers different and complementary information about the
function of our diaphragm. Currently TGA approved devices in Australia can only measure Poes or EMGdi using two
separate oesophageal catheters. More recently, an oesophageal ballon multipair electrode catheter designed by
Yinghui Medical has been used overseas in infants and adults to measure Poes and EMGdi simultaneously using
one catheter.It has been used during normal breathing awake, during sleep, and during exercise. Its size is similar
to a feeding tube used in children. It is well tolerated without any significant adverse events reported. It has not being
custom made for use in children previously. Our pilot study's aim is to investigate the tolerability, safety, and
feasibilty of using this oesophageal balloon catheter with multipair electrodes designed by Yinghui Medical in
infants and children to assess their work of breathing during sleep. All children (&lt;18 y.o) referred by their sleep
physician to Sydney Children's Hospital's Sleep Lab is eligible for this study, unless they already have nasogastric
or nasojejunal tube insitu
for feeding. The catheter will be inserted by the research doctor with the help of an
experienced nurse and play therapist, as part of routine sleep study set up. Any adverse events associated with the
catheter (safety), how many children and the number of hours the children were able to tolerate having the catheter
in situ (tolerability), and whether meaningful Poes and EMGdi were able to be recorded (feasibility) will be
assessed.</summary>
