    <interventions>After consenting, participants will log into the Rekindle web intervention. Participants will be asked a series of questions that will determine their unmet needs and inform what of the available content is appropriate to each participant (the assessment battery). At this stage, participants will also be randomly assigned to one of the three study conditions: Rekindle, Rekindle Plus, and Attention Control. Patients and their partners may elect to complete Rekindle together or separately.

The content covered by the intervention includes psycho-education about sex, sexuality, cancer and side effects of cancer, principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, communication skills training, medical and non-medical treatments for diminished sexual function, mindfulness, sensate focus, and strategies for maintenance of skills. 

Participants in the Rekindle and Rekindle Plus conditions will then complete the exercises determined as most appropriate by their responses to the Assessment Battery. 
These exercises are completed sequentially at whatever pace and intervals that best suit individual participants. The intervention is estimated to take 10 weeks, although this will vary depending on each participant's identified needs. The exercises may include reading written text, watching videos and animations, and completing quizzes. Participants will be able to indicate whether or not they want to have more information at the end of each topic.

Participants will repeat the Assessment Battery at 10 weeks and six months after they commenced the intervention.  Participants in the Rekindle Plus condition will receive three phone calls across the intervention to encourage their ongoing participation with the aim of heightening engagement with Rekindle by providing added support. The calls will be made by trained Cancer Council supportive care staff within one week of joining the study, mid-way through each participants program, and at the end of each participants program.

The content of the intervention will be available to the participants in the Rekindle and Rekindle Plus conditions indefinitely after their completion of their program. 
Adherence to the program will be tracked by the back-end of the study website.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the Attention Control condition will receive usual care. In the context of this study, usual care is a collection of existing information and links available online.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine which modality of Rekindle (self-led Rekindle
or self-led plus telephone support  Rekindle Plus) is most feasible and encourages greater completion of the prescribed intervention. This will be assessed by examining data collected via the study site back-end.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In exploratory analyses, determine which subgroups are more likely to complete their prescribed intervention. This will be assessed by examining and comparing demographic data and completion rates collected via the study site back-end.</outcome>
      <timepoint>10 weeks and 6 months after commencing participation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Provide preliminary estimates of the effect size needed to demonstrate the efficacy of Rekindle to improve sexual satisfaction, to inform power calculations in a future Phase III trial. The assessment tools found in the batteries vary across user profiles. 

The tools used are: a background demographic and medical questionnaire, the unmet needs survey (USeNS), the PROMIS satisfaction with sexual life survey (GSSS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Female Sexual Function Inventory (FSFI), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Sexual Self Disclosure Questionnaire (SSDQ), the Sexual Self Efficacy for Females (SSE_F), the Sexual Self Efficacy for Males (SSE_M), a System Usability Scale (SUS) and a 0-100 rating of confidence in being able to create a fulfilling sex life. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of an online resource to promote sexual well-being for both cancer patients and their partners. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and either you or your partner has had a cancer diagnosis. You will also need to be at least 6 months past your primary treatment. Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of three groups. Participants in the Rekindle and Rekindle Plus groups will use the online resource. This involves first completing some screening questions, and then working through some self-led exercises tailored to participant needs and sexual concerns. Participants in the Rekindle Plus group will also receive three telephone support calls delivered by a qualified, trained provider to encourage their ongoing participation and engagement with the intervention. The duration of the intervention period is approximately 10 weeks. Participants in the third group will receive a program which is designed to replicate usual care, within the design and formatting of the Rekindle website. We will monitor completion of the prescribed intervention in order to determine which mode of Rekindle is the most feasible.</summary>
