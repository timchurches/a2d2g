    <summary>The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the GTU
      artificial urinary sphincter device in restoring continence in males who have confirmed
      urinary stress incontinence for a minimum of 12 months with primary etiology being radical
      prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).</summary>
