  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 1: Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response Rate (ORR) According to the International Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), Cheson 1999. - Response was defined as participants with a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu) or partial response (PR), based on IWG 1999 Response Criteria for NHL as evaluated by the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC).
Complete Response (CR) is a complete disappearance of all disease with the exception of nodes. No new lesions. Previously enlarged organs must have regressed and not be palpable. Bone marrow(BM) must be negative if positive at baseline. Normalization of markers.
CR Unconfirmed (CRU) does not qualify for CR above, due to a residual nodal mass or an indeterminate BM.
Partial Response (PR) is a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of diameters (SPD) for up to 6 identified dominant lesions, including spleenic and hepatic nodules from baseline. No new lesions and no increase in the size of liver, spleen or other nodes</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Sept 2010 to the data cut-off of 4 July 2013; when all participants had reached the scheduled 16-week assessment or had progressed/died before the scheduled 16-week assessment). Median follow-up time was 6.7 and 4.7 months in each arm respectively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 2: Progression-free Survival for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Participants - Number of participants who survive without progressing based on the International Working Group Response Criteria [IWG].</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 2: Complete Response Rate for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Participants - Complete Response Rate (CR + CRu rate) was to be calculated as the proportion of participants achieving a CR or CRu using 1999 IWG Response Criteria, (Cheson, 1999).
CR: Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease, disappearance of any disease-related symptoms, and normalization of biochemical abnormalities.
Cru: Criteria for CR above but with 1 or more of the following:
A residual lymph node mass &gt; 1.5 cm in greatest transverse diameter that has regressed by more than 75% in the sum of the products of diameters (SPD) Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number or size of aggregates without cytologic or architectural atypia).</outcome>

      <outcome>Stage 2: Duration of Overall Response for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Participants - Length of time of overall response (Complete Response + Complete Response unconfirmed + Partial Response) was to be calculated for responders as the time from documented initial response (either CR, CRu, or PR) until documented disease progression determined by CT or MRI scan, or death, whichever occurs earlier.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 3.5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
