      <outcome>Percent of Participants With Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) at 6 Months Follow-Up - Cytogenetic response (CyR) was based on the number of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) metaphases among cells in metaphase on a Bone Marrow (BM) sample.

      <outcome>Number of Participants With MCyR Whose Disease Progressed by 24 Months - Progression in a participant=participant achieved a CHR and no longer met the criteria consistently over consecutive 2-weeks after starting their maximum dose; had no CHR after receiving their maximum dose and had an increase in white blood count (WBC) defined as a doubling of the count from the lowest value to &gt;20,000/mm^3 or an increase by &gt; 50,000/mm^3 on two assessments performed at least 2 weeks apart; participant met criteria of accelerated or blast phase CML at any time; had a MCyR and subsequently no longer met the criteria for MCyR after starting their maximum dose; had a = 30% absolute increase in the number of Ph+ metaphases.

After the 2-year analysis and Protocol Amendment 02, those on a BID dosing schedule were allowed to switch to a QD dosing schedule. Due to the large number of participants switching from BID dosing to QD dosing, the abbreviated dosing data collection method incorporated in Amendment 03, the overall safety data are presented for the 100 mg QD group and combined for the other treatment groups.</outcome>
