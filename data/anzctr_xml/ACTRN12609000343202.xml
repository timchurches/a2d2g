  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten sessions of specific physiotherapy management over 10 weeks, involving 30 minute sessions. Frequency of sessions will be individually tailored based on the individual's progress. Generally, participants will initially attend two sessions per week for the first fortnight and then will attend the final 6 sessions spread out over the final eight weeks. Management will include specific lumbar spine directional preference exercises, taping of the lumbar spine, a gradually progressed core stability exercise program and condition specific advice and education.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two sessions of physiotherapy advice over a 10 week period (involving one 30 minute session directly following randomisation and another 30 minute session 5 weeks following randomisation). The sessions will involve condition specific advice regarding the prognosis and self-management of the condition.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers who respond to advertising or who are referred by a medical practitioner or health care professional will undergo a phone screening and baseline physical assessment to determine eligibility. Eligible volunteers who consent to participate will complete baseline outcome measures prior to being randomised to one of the treatment groups. This will be done by the assessor contacting an off-site trial administrator who will hold the randomisation schedule, and will not be involved in assessing, enrolling or treating participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomisation schedule will be generated prior to the commencement of the trial by a researcher at La Trobe University who will have no contact with participants. Permuted block randomisation with random block sizes will be undertaken using a web-based randomisation program. Randomisation will be stratified by developing a separate schedule for each of the 14 physiotherapy treatment clinics.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this trial is to compare the outcomes and adverse events of two different physiotherapy treatment approaches for people with reducible discogenic low back pain (with or without associated leg symptoms).
A secondary aim is to determine the perspectives of participants on the specific physiotherapy treatment and advice utilised in the trial.</summary>
