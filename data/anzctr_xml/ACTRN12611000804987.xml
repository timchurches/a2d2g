  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to receive 12 weeks of individual therapy;either Metacognitive therapy(MCT) or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). Most participants will receive 12 sessions in 12 weeks with 6 sessions in the first 4 weeks however the range permissible is 8 to 15 sessions over the 12 weeks.  Therapy sessions last up to 1 hr. Clinical psychologists deliver both therapies and follow the work of AT Beck and J Beck for CBT(1,2) and of Adrian Wells and Costas Papageorgiou for MCT (3,4).

    <concealment>Allocation is concealed. The holder of the therapy allocation is outside the research team and holds the allocation in numbered sealed opaque envelopes, only releasing the envelope once the baseline assessments have been completed. Thus therapists recruiting  and assessing participants are not given therapy allocation until the baseline assessment are complete, immediately prior to commencing therapy. The study co-ordinator will remain blind to therapy allocation throughout the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a common, often recurrent or chronic, serious health problem causing significant burden to individuals, their families and to society. The most evaluated psychotherapy, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is effective for around 50% of depressed individuals but relapse is common. Despite advances in knowledge about brain dysfunction and changes with recovery from depression, until recently there has been little integration of those findings with developments in the psychotherapy literature. Metacognitive Therapy (MCT) is a brief, innovative, targeted psychotherapy partly based on evidence of dysfunction in cognitive and emotional processing. We propose to treat 140 outpatients with depression in a randomised controlled trial of MCT vs. CBT. We hypothesise that MCT will act more rapidly and effectively in improving depression, with changes detectable on fMRI in a subset of participants. Being better able to understand how psychotherapies work in relation to brain function will contribute to development of better treatments.</summary>
