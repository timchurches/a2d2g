  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised insertion of All-polyethylene tibial implant or metal-backed implant. The control (metal-backed implant) would involve a metal tibial implant which would require an all-polyethylene insert. The all-polyethylene implant incorporates the usual polyethylene insert to the tibial implant, becoming an 'all-poly' tibial implant. The procedure (total knee joint replacement) takes approximately 90 minutes, regardless of the implant used. Total knee joint replacements can last up to and beyond 10 years, or until any component fails.</interventions>
    <comparator>Metal-backed implant group. The metal-backed implant is a colbalt-chromium tibial implant that requires a polyethylene insert to fit on top, for contact with the femoral component. The procedure (total knee joint replacement) takes approximately 90 minutes, regardless of the implant used. Total knee joint replacements can last up to and beyond 10 years, or until any component fails.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects are enrolled from outpatient clinics when they are offered total knee joint replacement surgery. The surgeon will have decided which brand of implant to use, but not whether it will be an all-polyethylene or a metal-backed tibial implant. Randomisation will occur in theatre, using calculator-generated random numbers. Neither the surgeons nor the patients can be blinded. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>A calculator generating random numbers will be used. The first number of the sequence will determine whether the implant to be used is an all polyethylene or a metal-backed. Even numbers shall represent all polyethylene and odd numbers, metal backed.</sequence>
