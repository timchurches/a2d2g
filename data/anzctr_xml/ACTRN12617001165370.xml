    <interventions>Brief name (Arm 1): Six individual sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety + four individual sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia over ten weeks.
Brief name (Arm 2): Four individual sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia + six individual sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety over ten weeks.
There was no washout period between the two treatments. 

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy method for social anxiety and sleep problems respectively. The emphasis is on problems "here and now" rather than problems in the past. CBT includes a combination of cognitive techniques and behavioural techniques. The cognitive techniques strive to, in short, an increased awerness of negative thoughts and beliefs related to a specific disorder and to consciously strive to question or alter them. The aim is to learn to interpret situations in a more realistic manner. Behavioural techniques means trying new behaviors and approaches, as mental disorders often are maintained by dysfunctional behaviours such as avoiding any situation that might provoke anxiety. The treatment manuals used in this study have been scientifically tested.

CBT for insomnia included the following techniques: psychoeducation about sleep, stimulus control, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, and constructive worry. 
CBT for social anxiety includes the following techniques: psychoeducation about social anxiety, cognitive restructuring, exposure, and behavioural experiments. 

Two master students in clinical psychology will conduct the therapies. The students have previous experience in clinical manual-based therapies. The sessions will be about one hour long each and be delivered face to face at Ã–rebro University (Sweden). The therapists will receive supervision from two clinical psychologists (one expert on insomnia and one expert on social anxiety) with licenses to practice. The treatments will be manual-based and as such not personalised. Treatment fidelity will be assessed through the use of therapist check lists, to be completed by the therapists after every session.

    <comparator>In single case experimental designs, each participant acts as their own control. The baseline values from a pre-intervention period is compared to daily measures over the treatment period. The participants data from two weeks of baseline will be compared to data from seven weeks of treatment. In th current study, participants will be randomized to one of two sequences of CBT. Either first CBT for anxiety followed by CBT for insomnia, or first CBT for insomnia followed by CBT for social anxiety. </comparator>

    <designfeatures>When designing the study, care was taken to closely follow general quality criteria of single case experimental designs (SCED), meaning for example (but not limited to) sufficiently defined outcome criteria, long enough baseline period, randomisation of treatment start times, a minimum of five observations in each study phase for main outcome variables (baseline, treatment, and follow-up), and intersubject replication (multiple participants). Due to assumed irreversible effects of the therapy, intrasubject replication (varying baseline with treatment phases several times) was not conducted.  </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In SCED, conclusions are strengthened by the replication of findings over several participants. Guidelines sometimes mention at least three or five participants. Ten participants would allow for some potential attrition, thus this number was chosen.
The most established way of reporting results from single case studies is through graphs (so-called visual inspection). The basic idea is that if any significant change has occurred, it will be visible. The result of daily sleep measurements will therefore primarily be reported visually, and in accordance with established recommendations for how single case graphs should be presented to present results in a clear and correct manner. However, one should decide on what kind of visual differences that are meaningful for the current research question. Therefore, in the case of daily measurements of sleep, it is relevant to mark the number of nights where involuntarily time awake before falling asleep or in the middle of the night exceeds 30 minutes (frequently used research and diagnostic criteria at insomnia). If the occurrence of these nights decreases after treatment, then a clinically meaningful change has occurred. As statistical calculations are becoming increasingly common in SCED  and required by newer guidelines, we plan to follow the methodological development and complement graphs report with appropriate statistical calculations. We refrain from deciding on a specific statistical method at this point, as we are currently investigating which would be the most appropriate method, but it is likely that the choice falls on a version of "time-series analysis" or "percentage of non-overlapping data" which can handle the specific mathematical circumstances that apply to SCED data, such as autocorrelation and variability within one phase. Results from questionnaires will be presented in tables. In cases where clinically significant differences have occurred, this will be highlighted.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal is to investigate the effects from cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and social anxiety respectively on participants with comorbid insomnia and social anxiety. Comorbidity between anxiety and insomnia is common, and research suggests a bidirectional relationship. However, few studies have examined the relationship between social anxiety disorder and insomnia, as well as how treatments for this comorbidity should be conducted. Participants will be randomised to receive one of two sequences: either CBT for anxiety + CBT for insomnia or CBT for insomnia + CBT for anxiety. </summary>
