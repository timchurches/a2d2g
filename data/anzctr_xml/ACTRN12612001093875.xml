    <concealment>Qualified subjects will be enrolled and allocated to treatment according to a sequential randomization held by the unblinded dose preparer and kept in a secure place, unavailable to staff involved in subject treatment and assessment. Active and placebo treatments appear identical.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be prepared by an unblinded study statistician using a permuted block randomization. Active or placebo treatment will be assigned to a subject randomization number. These numbers will be assigned sequentially to subjects as they qualify for inclusion in the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RT001 compared to placebo in subjects with allergic rhinitis who test positive to rye grass. Previously reported studies conducted with a similar compound have shown reduction of the typical symptoms of seasonal allergy.</summary>
