  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated into one of three intervention groups: (1) curcumin capsules containing 250mg of a proprietary blend of curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark'); (2) curcumin capsules containing 250mg of a proprietary blend of curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark') plus 15mg of saffron; or (3) curcumin capsules containing 500mg of a proprietary blend of curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark'). These capsules will be consumed twice daily for 12 weeks by adults diagnosed with depression. Adherence to capsule intake will occur through records in a study diary and return of capsules.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will respond to advertisements and/or respond to flyers displayed in health clinics. Participants will then be briefly interviewed to assess eligibility and if meeting eligibility criteria a formal mental health assessment will be conducted (MINI International Neuropsychiatric interview). If the participant meet all eligibility criteria, he/she will be randomly allocated into a placebo, curcumin or curcumin/saffron treatment group. Group allocation will be conducted in a double-blind, randomised fashion. Allocation concealment will occur through the use of numbered containers where both the participant, and primary researcher responsible for conducting the study, will be unaware of its contents.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated into placebo and treatment groups. These groups are named group 1, group 2, group 3 and group 4. The primary investigator and participants will be unaware of which treatment these groups represent. Each participant will be allocated a participant number (1 to 120) based on order of inclusion in the study. A computer-generated software will randomly assign the numbers 1 to 160 into either group 1, 2, 3 or 4.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In a previous study completed by our research team, positive effects from curcumin were found when using a sample size of 60 adults. In previous trials on saffron, statistically significant effects were identified using samples of 40-60. Based on the the moderate effect sizes found in these studies and assuming a power of 80% and a type one error rate (alpha) of 5%, the number of participants per group to find a statistical effect is approximately 30. In the current study we will be using 40 participants per group</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study assessing the antidepressant effects of curcumin or curcumin/saffron in 160 adults suffering from depression (mild to moderate severity). Participants will be randomly allocated into one of four groups (1) curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark' - 250mg twice daily); (2) curcumin/ saffron (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark' - 250mg + 15mg saffron twice daily); (3) curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark' - 500mg twice daily); (4) placebo. Changes in depression and anxiety will be measured over a 12-week period. The aim of this study is also to investigate potential mechanisms of action of curcumin so urine and blood samples will be collected at the beginning and completion of the study. Levels of markers associated with inflammation and oxidative stress will be assessed over time.
