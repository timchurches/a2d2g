  <interventions>
    <interventions>ForSight Ocular System (drug/device combination product) will be placed in eye. Product contains prostaglandin which elutes with varying dose over six month period. Dose is higher at beginning of use of product and gradually declines as drug elutes from product, as is typical for drug-eluting products. Maximum daily dose will not exceed levels tested in prior clinical studies. Dose will start under 100 mcg/day (maximum amount tested in prior clinical use) and will decline toward 0 mcg/day by end of study period. 

The design for this study (Protocol 502) may possibly be influenced by the progress of our organisations corresponding, ongoing, Australian study (Protocol 501) which began in 2011 (see: http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12612000362897.aspx).</interventions>
