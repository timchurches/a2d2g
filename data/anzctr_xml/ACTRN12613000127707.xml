  <interventions>
    <interventions>Salt loading (Slow Sodium, NaCl at a dose of 100mmol/24h in 3 divided doses) or placebo to be taken daily for 3 weeks each. Slow release salt capsules manufactured by Thompsons compounding pharmacy. 
As this is a cross over study, there will be a three week washout period between both treatment arms. </interventions>
    <comparator>Identical placebo tablets will be manufactured by Thompsons Compounding Pharmacy in Bulleen, Victoria. These will be identical in appearance, taste and size but will not contain any salt (NaCl). </comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Other</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients with Type 2 diabetes (Cases) with habitual salt intake in the lowest tertile (&lt;150mmol/24h), have increased baseline Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) activity and increased endothelial dysfunction compared to Controls. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During baseline visit,  week three and week nine of the trial, the SNS will be measured by muscle sympathetic Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity  (MSNA) and by Pulse Amplitude Tonometry (EndoPAT).  For endothelial dysfunction, this will be measured at baseline and the start of week three, week six and week nine. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Salt loading (100mmol/24h over 3 weeks) will reduce SNS activity and improve endothelial function in Cases, not Controls.  
a.Reduction in SNS activity will be measured by Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity  (MSNA).
b.Improved endothelial function will be measured by Pulse Amplitude Tonometry (EndoPAT).
c.Improved endothelial function will be measured by endothelial microparticles (EMP).

    <concealment>This is a randomised double blind, controlled, cross-over study with the intervention being salt loading (100mmol/24h) versus placebo in patients with T2DM and controls (normotensive but age, sex and BMI matched). The pharmacy department will be responsible for allocating tablets which will be in a non-identified envelope to patient or pharmacy department. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The statistical power for this study will be based on measurements of endothelial function and SNS. As participants will be their own controls, a sample size of 29 will ensure a power of 90% and a type 1 error to detect an effect on RHI of at least 22% (difference 0.4404) with a standard deviation of 0.5753. Thirty five participants will be recruited to allow for drop outs. A sample size of 21 subjects per treatment arm will have an 80% power to demonstrate a difference in MSNA of 20% or greater (a = 0.05).  Hence, allowing for possible procedural failure and participant withdrawal from the study 35 subjects will be recruited.  Moreover, treatment effects on MSNA, EndoPAT, EMPs will be analysed using a 2-way ANOVA, one between-group factor being cases versus controls and one within-subject factor being salt supplement versus placebo. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A high salt diet is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. By contrast, in patients with type 2 diabetes, a low salt diet is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular and total mortality. As a low salt intake may increase sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, we aim to determine baseline SNS activity and endothelial function in patients with diabetes consuming a habitual low salt diet and determine whether salt loading reduces SNS activity and enhances endothelial function. </summary>
