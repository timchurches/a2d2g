Experimental: Catheter Over Needle - The femoral nerve catheter used will be the "E-Catheter" (Pajunk) device which is a novel catheter over needle system.

Active Comparator: Catheter through needle - The femoral nerve catheter used will be the "Sonolong" catheter (Pajunk) which is a traditional catheter through needle system.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Catheter leakage - Any leakage around the catheter insertion site as assessed by visual inspection.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 days post insertion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall rate of secondary failure as assessed by the acute pain service on days 1 and 2 post op. - Secondary failure is when a nerve catheter that was previously working has ceased to provide analgesia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease of insertion assessed by the inserting anaesthetist on a 5 point Likert scale. - Assess the anaesthetist's opinion on the ease of insertion of the different catheters</outcome>
      <timepoint>intraoperative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Needle visibility assessed by the inserting anaesthetist on a 5 point Likert scale. - Assessing the needle visibility in the two different catheter systems.</outcome>
