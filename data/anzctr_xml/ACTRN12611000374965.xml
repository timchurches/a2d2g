  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. High force mobilisation will consist of a single application of 3 sets of 30 seconds of oscillating pressures manually applied by thhe physiotherapist' thumbs with a mean peak force of 90N to the symptomatic spinal level. 2. Low force mobilisation will consist of a single application of 3 sets of 30 seconds of oscillating pressures manually applied by thhe physiotherapist' thumbs with a mean peak force of 30N to the symptomatic spinal level. 3. Laser will consist of a single application of 3 sets of 30 seconds application applied using the Echolac with probe to skin contact over the symptomatic level. Laser was detuned (i.e., not active) and represented the placebo group, or an inactive treatment control.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be measured with the J-tech algometer (Tracker Freedom Algometry, J-tech Medical (http://jtechmedical.net/products/pain_eval/freedom/freedom_algometry.cfm) over the following landmarks in randomised order: (1) Adjacent to the spinous process at the treated spinal level (right side) (2) Right upper trapezius muscle (3) Right median nerve trunk at the elbow. Measurements will be taken in triplicate and averaged for each landmark.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately before treatment application, immediately after treatment application and one follow-up 3-5 days later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cervical range of motion will be measured with a Cervical Range of Motion instrument (CROM, Performance Attainment Associates, Minnesota, USA, http://www.spineproducts.com/) in the following ranges: (1)Total sagittal plane ROM, (2) Total horizontal plane ROM and (3) Position (degrees) at first onset or increase in pain with movement towards the most painful movement direction. Measurements will be taken in triplicate and averaged.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately before treatment application, immediately after treatment application and one follow-up 3-5 days later</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cervical spine stiffness will be measured with a customised device that applied 5 standardised oscillating pressures to the spinous process using a probe while recording the resistance to movement and the distance the probe travels. The relationship between resistance and displacement (distance) represents the spinal stiffness (N/mm). The symptomatic spinal level as well as C7 (for normalisation)will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately before treatment application, immediately after treatment application and one follow-up 3-5 days later</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient reported pain (visual analogue scale)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Around 30-50% of adults will experience neck pain over a 12 month period, and many are treated with manual therapy. Although evidence supports manual therapy treatment when combined with exercise, the dose is not defined. Up until now, there were few methods for objectively quantifying a manual technique to establish its optimal dose. This pilot randomised controlled trial will investigate two specific doses of posterior-to-anterior (PA) mobilisation, the most common manual technique therapists use when treating the cervical spine. Sixty patients will be randomised to receive either a high force or low force PA mobilisation, or sham treatment, with patients pressure pain threshold, resting pain, cervical range and stiffness measured before, immediately after and 3-5 days post-treatment. We will utilise innovative equipment we developed to standardise the manually applied forces, conducting the trial using demonstrable methods from our previous research. Determining dose-response relationships for manual therapy is essential for establishing optimal treatment strategies for patients with neck pain. The cost of neck pain is increasing, and many patients do not achieve symptom resolution. Therefore there is an urgent need for physiotherapists to provide effective treatment dosages with demonstrated patient outcomes, impacting spinal pain and advancing physiotherapy as the preferred treatment choice.</summary>
