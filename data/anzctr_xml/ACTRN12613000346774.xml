  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) involves giving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the infant in the intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode that have advocated as a means to wean infants from mechanical ventilation(by nasal root).We have found NIPPV more effective than  nasal continuous positive airway pressure(NCPAP) in weaning infants with RDS from mechanical ventilation and have recommended that NIPPV be used as the modality of choice for extubation.because mechanical ventilation (by endoteracheal ventilation) is associated with high morbidity,today an effort to decrease ventilator induced lung injury,alternative techniques of ventilation have been employed.we administered NIPPV when the patient have CPAP failure and it will continue till wean from NIPPV(with frequent arterial blood gass(ABG).We will also assess the incidence of complications such as pneumothorax, intra ventricular hemorrhage(IVH), broncho pulmonary dysplasia(BPD), necrotizing enterocolitis(NEC) and patient dactus arteriosus(PDA) in our trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional mechanical ventilation (CV) is a modality that paitients with respiratory failure and CPAP failure intubated and then connected to to ventilator with IMV mode.It will continue untill with frequent ABG,we could wean pateint  from ventilator.</comparator>

Categorical data will be analysed with Chi2 test or Fishers Exact Test as appropriate. All analysis will be intention-to-treat.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RDS and its sequelae BPD, are both frequent complications of prematurity that may requires respiratory support.because mechanical ventilation (by endoteracheal ventilation) is associated with high morbidity,today an effort to decrease ventilator induced lung injury,alternative techniques of ventilation have been employed.NIPPV is a noninvasive approach for ventilation.The benefits of NIPPV use for infants with NCPAP failure is not studied yet.So our purpose is to compare two modalities;NIPPV and conventional ventilation(CV) for treatment of respiratory failure in preterm neonates.This prospective clinical trial performs on 50 patients with GA&lt;35 weeks and Birth Weight &lt;2500g that have CPAP failure and admitted in NICU of Alzahra and Shahid Beheshti hospitals in Isfahan.The randomization is performed applying minimization technique with respect to baby's gender and Birth weight and the newborns will devided into two groups;NIPPV and CV.We will also assess the incidence of complications such as pneumothorax,IVH,BPD,NEC and PDA in our trial.</summary>
