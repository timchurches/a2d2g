  <interventions>
    <interventions>A nurse-led, face to face , one-on-one  intervention, consisting of  an intervention phase of four weekly sessions  of 1 hour each and a maintenance phase with follow up  sessions of 30 minutes every month  to reinforce behaviour change for 6 months. We focused on patient empowerment, through collaborative goal setting and action planning  to enhance self management skills using techniques of  brief Motivational Interviewing , goal setting, problem solving and action planning.

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A computer generated algorithm was used by a researcher (not directly involved in the project) to randomize the patients with the treatment allocation  of patients. Those allocated to the intervention were given an appointment to be seen by the intervention staff ( medical officer and trained nurses). Those on the control arm continued to attend the regular monthly clinic. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Participants  in the intervention and control were compared on all demographic, biochemical, lifestyle and psychological measures using t-tests or non parametric tests as appropriate. Data missing from complete questionnaires were excluded from analysis and indicated by reduction of sample size. Effectiveness of intervention was analyzed using analysis of covariance .  </statisticalmethods>
