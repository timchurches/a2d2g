  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who agree to participate in the study and fulfil the inclusion criteria will be randomised to one of two treatment groups.
1.Standard therapy group will receive high-carbohydrate low-fat enteral feed (16.7% protein, 30% fat and 53.3% carbohydrates) at a target rate as decided by the treating physician and dietician for a maximum of 5 days following randomisation.
2.Alternative therapy group will receive high-fat low-carbohydrate enteral feed (16.7% protein, 55.2% fat and 28.1% carbohydrates) at a target rate as decided by the treating physician and dietician for a maximum of 5 days following randomisation.
All patients will receive enteral feeding by continuous flow for 24hrs/day. 
The decision to commence or cease enteral feeding will remain with the treating physician. 
The measurement of VO2, VCO2, resting energy expenditure and respiratory quotient will be made on all participants 12 hourly for a maximum of 5 days using the indirect calorimeter. The indirect calorimeter is connected to the expiratory outlet of the ventilator, collecting and analyzing gas that is normally discharged into the atmosphere.</interventions>
