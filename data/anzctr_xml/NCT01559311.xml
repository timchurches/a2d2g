Active Comparator: CRT-P OFF - Patients randomized into the Echo-guided Group were implanted with a CRT-P device (St. Jude Medical), which was programmed to DDDR pacing mode (CRT-P OFF) at implant. For each Echo-guided Group patient, presence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony was assessed within 24-hour of implant using the standardized criteria of Doppler echocardiography. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory (Echo Core Lab) then analyzed each image and the treatment allocation of the Echo-guided Group was done within 72-hour post implant based on the Echo Core Lab outcomes:
 Patients with the absence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony were allocated to the DDDR standard therapy with CRT-P remained OFF

Experimental: CRT-P ON - Patients randomized into the Echo-guided Group were implanted with a CRT-P device (St. Jude Medical), which was programmed to DDDR pacing mode (CRT-P OFF) at implant. For each Echo-guided Group patient, presence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony was assessed within 24-hour of implant using the standardized criteria of Doppler echocardiography. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory (Echo Core Lab) then analyzed each image and the treatment allocation of the Echo-guided Group was done within 72-hour post implant based on the Echo Core Lab outcomes:
 Patients with the presence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony were allocated to the CRT-P standard therapy with CRT-P turned ON

Active Comparator: DDDR - Patients randomized into the Control Group were implanted with a DDDR device (St. Jude Medical) standard therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this clinical project is to evaluate the efficacy of the presence of Right
      Ventricular Apical (RVA) pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony as a guiding parameter for
      bi-ventricular pacing in patients with bradycardia and normal left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF). The results of this project may provide with the evidence based medicine for
      guidelines expansion of using Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with Heart
      Block and normal LVEF (LVEF &gt;45%).</summary>
