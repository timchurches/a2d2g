  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental arm: Ga-68 PSMA-PET/CT imaging in place of standard care conventional imaging scan
Patients randomised to the experimental arm will undergo PET/CT imaging following a single intravenous bolus administration of 150 MBq (+/- 50 MBq) of Ga-68-PSMA-11.
Prior to injection, qualified site personnel will assay the dose in the dose calibrator and
record the assay reading and time. The CT and PET imaging session will begin approximately 45 to 75 minutes after injection. The total time in the scanner is around 20 minutes.
The result of the scan will be provided to the treating physician who may modify patient management based on the result
All patients will cross-over to second-line DI (crossover to other arm) within 14 days from the first line DI unless the disease status for distant metastases was positive (ie. not equivocal or negative) with &gt;2 sites of disease demonstrated. 
Repeat imaging at 6 months will be performed if (1) initial staging was N1 or M1 (ie. positive for disease in pelvic lymph nodes or distant disease) or (2) Biochemical or clinical suspicion of residual / recurrent disease for those initial N0 M0.
After completion of first and second-line imaging, at pre-defined sites, 50 participants will also undergo a whole body MRI . The scan takes around 45 minutes and involves no preparation. In the MRI scanner there is a high magnetic field and all patients need to undergo a thorough safety questionnaire and assessment to ensure that any metallic implants or devices (such as pacemakers, stents, joint replacements or even shrapnel) are compatible and safe within the scanner. The diagnostic accuracy of whole body MRI will be then compared to that of PSMA PET/CT</interventions>
    <comparator>Control arm. Conventional imaging (CT + bone scan)

Each patient randomised to the conventional imaging will undergo a whole body bone scan with SPECT/CT following injection of 99mTc-MDP or 99mTc-HDP, and multi-slice CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis following injection of intravenous contrast.
All patients will cross-over to second-line DI (crossover to other arm) within 14 days from the first line DI unless the disease status for distant metastases was positive (ie. not equivocal or negative) with &gt;2 sites of disease demonstrated.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the diagnostic accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT to that of conventional imaging (CI) for detecting nodal or distant metastatic disease. 
To define accuracy, diagnostic findings will be compared to the ground truth which will be established using all data available to the six-month follow-up time-point (+/-30 days). Cases will be considered positive by ground truth if they satisfy at least 1 hard criterion or at least 3 soft criteria amongst the pre-defined criteria listed in the protocol as evidence for one or more metastases. Where feasible, biopsy confirmation of disease is strongly encouraged. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be assessable 6 months from randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the first-line management impact of PSMA-PET/CT to that of conventional imaging  DI. This outcome is assessed by a prospective questionnaire completed by the clinician before and after first-line imaging. The questionnaire has been designed for this trial and available through the secure electronic data capture system. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess incremental accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT or  conventional imaging  as a second-line imaging modality by their ability to detect additional metastases in subset of patients who cross-over and have both tests. This is defined as the proportion of M0 patients (ie. patients without distant metastatic disease) who were upstaged to M1 by second-line imaging, and the separately, the proportion of N0 patients (ie. patients without pelvic nodal metastases) who were upstaged to N1 by second-line imaging.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will be diagnostic accuracy, assessed by the AUC. For a binary valued diagnostic instrument, the AUC is equal to the mean of the sensitivity and specificity. The power of the trial is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of both diagnostic tools, as well as the ratio of cases (positives as assessed by ground truth, defined in section 8.1) to controls (negatives as assessed by ground truth). A sample size of 180 (90 patients per arm) will achieve a power of 0.8 using the following pragmatic assumptions:
1) Conventional imaging (CI) has a true underlying AUC of 0.65, consisting of a sensitivity of 0.65 and a specificity of 0.65.
2) PSMA-PET/CT has a true underlying AUC of 0.9, consisting of a sensitivity of 0.9 and a
specificity of 0.9.
3) The proportion of cases (as opposed to controls) is 40%.
4) Margin of 10% improvement (absolute) in AUC requirement to declare PSMA superior
5) Two-sided type I error of 10%.
To allow for patient drop out of up to 10%, 200 patients will be accrued to the study</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT scans for determining the stage of prostate cancer and planning treatment.

Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with prostate cancer for which you have not yet received treatment, but it is planned that you will undergo surgery or radiotherapy.

Study details: All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either the conventional scans (CT + bone scan), or the PSMA-PET/CT scan which is being evaluated. All patients will cross-over to second-line DI (crossover to other arm) unless the disease status for distant metastases was positive (ie. not equivocal or negative) with &gt;2 sites of disease demonstrated. The results of the scan will be made available to your doctors to help them to plan the most suitable treatment course.

The accuracy of the scans will be determined by using follow-up information available up to 6 months after entering the study. If the scans showed abnormalities or your doctor has clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, the scans will be repeated at 6 months.

In patients with normal PSMA PET/CT scans, follow-up data may be collected at 18 30, 42 and 54 months (the study will stop 3 years after randomisation of the last patient).</summary>
