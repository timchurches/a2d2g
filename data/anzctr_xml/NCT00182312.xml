  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At least 5 of every 1000 live-born babies are very premature and weigh only 500 to 1250 grams
      at birth. Approximately 30-40% of these high-risk infants either die or survive with lasting
      disabilities. The aim of this research is to reduce this heavy burden of illness. A
      multi-center randomized controlled trial has been designed in which 2000 very low birth
      weight infants will be enrolled. Our goal is to determine whether the avoidance of
      methylxanthine drugs will improve survival without disability to 18 months, corrected for
      prematurity.

      Methylxanthine drugs such as caffeine are used to prevent or treat periodic breathing and
      breath-holding spells in premature infants. However, there is a striking lack of evidence for
      the long-term efficacy and safety of this therapy. Methylxanthines block a naturally
      occurring substance, called adenosine, which protects the brain during episodes of oxygen
      deficiency. Such episodes are common in infants who are treated with methylxanthines. It is
      possible that methylxanthines may worsen the damage caused by lack of oxygen. Therefore, this
      trial will clarify whether methylxanthines cause more good than harm in very low birth weight
      infants.</summary>
