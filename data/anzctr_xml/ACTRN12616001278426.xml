  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate factors associated with healthy eating, physical activity and healthy weight gain during pregnancy, maternal feeding practices post partum and how these may differ according to mothers pre-pregnancy weight and pregnancy weight gain.  What we are interested in are womens knowledge, attitudes and beliefs; factors that help women continue with healthy behaviours once they make changes such as support from family, friends and their health care providers and things that are needed to have a healthy lifestyle such as access to healthy foods, new skills and services.  </summary>
