  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Healthy Toddlers (HT) consists of eight in-home lessons, followed by four weekly reinforcement telephone calls, focusing on increasing toddlers' intake of fruits and vegetables; decreasing the amount of sweetened beverages consumed; and enhancing parental feeding behaviors.

Duration of Lessons: 60 to 90 minutes, administered once a week for 8 weeks targeting low-income mothers with toddlers 1 - 3 years.

Mode of Administration: Lessons are taught by trained paraprofessional nutrition instructors.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control Standard treatment of 8 in-home lessons that  focus on basic nutrition messages, and food budgeting and menu planning, but not on feeding toddlers.

      <outcome>Toddler weight/height-standardized measurements will be done according to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.  A toddler's weight will be attained with a digital scale measuring mass to the nearest ounce; a recumbent length or height will be used (depending on the toddler's age). A z score will be computed for the toddler's weight-for-height (length) plotted over time.  Categories will be created according to CDC/WHO age/sex specific growth charts.  Normal (5th and above and below 84th percentile) versus not normal (either below 5th ~ above 85th) or higher weight-for-height (length).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this project for low-income parents of children ages one to three is to promote healthy eating behaviors in young children.  Critical factors address obesity prevention, specifically food consumption and the mealtime environment.  Our objectives are to : (1) promote the development of healthy eating behaviors in young children while dietary habits are forming; (2) demonstrate that nutrition education provided through a multi-state intervention is effective in promoting healthy eating behaviors in young children; and (3) demonstrate that 'Healthy Toddlers' is a sustainable intervention with existing programs.  Delivered by Extension paraprofessionals, eight in-home lessons (plus four telephone follow-up reinforcement contacts) are based on the social cognitive theory which addresses the influence of social, psychological and cognitive factors on health behaviors.  A randomized experimental, short-term longitudinal design is proposed with intervention and control groups (300 participants per group), with three assessment periods: baseline, post assessment, and delayed post [six months after post]. Toddler eating skills and diet, and maternal toddler-feeding style, are assessed through parent self-report and in-home mealtime observations.  Child and maternal BMI will be directly measured.  Subjects in the intervention group are expected to demonstrate more positive dietary and eating skills and feeding interactions than the controls.  The project's long-term goal is to improve the nation's nutrition and health by addressing childhood obesity through an effective intervention promoting the development of healthy eating habits at an early age.</summary>
