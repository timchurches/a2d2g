  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Success - Subject must show 15 point improvement in the Neck Disability Index from baseline to 24 months post operative as well as have no device related SAE, Secondary Surgical Interventions at the index level or any new permanent neurological deterioration.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neck Pain VAS Scores - Change From Baseline - Change from baseline of the Neck Pain VAS Scores. VAS is a 100-mm visual analog scale used to assess pain. It asks the subject to place a vertical mark on a 100-mm horizontal line, with 'No pain' listed on the left (at 0 mm) and 'Very severe pain' labeled on the right (at 100 mm). The subject is instructed to indicate the amount of pain they feel in their neck.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum Arm Pain VAS - Change From Baseline - Change from baseline in maximum value of the left and right arm VAS scores. VAS is a 100-mm visual analog scale used to assess pain. It asks the subject to place a vertical mark on a 100-mm horizontal line, with 'No pain' listed on the left (at 0 mm) and 'Very severe pain' labeled on the right (at 100 mm). The subject is instructed to indicate the amount of pain they feel in their arm.</outcome>

Responses from the questionnaire were scored as "always" 4, "sometimes" 2, or "never" 0, and summed to provide a total score (range 0-100). Higher DDI scores suggest greater subjective signs of dysphagia.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is intended to treat patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease at one
      level of the cervical spine. The patients will be randomized to the DISCOVER Artificial
      Cervical Disc (total disc replacement) or SLIM-LOC (cervical fusion) to determine the safety
      and efficacy at 2 years post operative. Follow-up on patients treated with total disc
      replacement will be continued to 5 years post operative.</summary>
