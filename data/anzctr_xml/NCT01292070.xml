Other interventions: Intradermal Human Fc?1-Fel d1 fusion protein

Part B: 5 sequential 10-fold dose increments from 0.1 BAU/mL to 1,000 BAU/mL; An 6th dose of 10,000 BAU/mL might be given only if the 10 BAU/mL of CAT is the dose that elicits a bump or hive of &gt;= to 10mm.

Other interventions: Positive Control - standardized cat hair allergenic extract (CAT)
4 sequential 10-fold injections starting from 0.01 BAU/mL to 10 BAU/mL

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to show that Intradermal Human Fc?1-Fel d1 fusion protein (GFD)
      is able to block the skin reaction to cat allergen in cat allergic subjects compared to the
      skin reaction to cat allergen alone. This research project is also testing the safety and
      tolerability of this new, experimental treatment, compared to the current treatment of cat
      allergen alone.</summary>
