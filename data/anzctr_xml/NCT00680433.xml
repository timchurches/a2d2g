  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research into the mechanisms underlying memory impairment in ECT suggests that its
      development may be prevented by the administration of certain medications at the time of ECT
      treatment. For example there are reasons to believe that ketamine, also used as an
      anaesthetic agent, may have such protective properties.

      In this clinical study patients undergoing a course of ECT will be offered the opportunity to
      receive a small dose of ketamine (or a placebo) as part of their anaesthetic at the time of
      ECT treatment. Mood changes and any memory changes will be evaluated to see if the subjects
      who received ketamine had less memory side effects than those who did not, while still
      improving their depression.</summary>
