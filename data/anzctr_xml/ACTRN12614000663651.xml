Heparin ceased 8 hours pre-operatively. Heparin ceased one week post-operatively, once patient warfarinised.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This was a prospective study of 369 consecutive patients referred to a single surgeon for treatment of pelvic and acetabular fractures over a 20 year period. All patients were treated with chemoprophylaxis using unfractionated heparin, according to a sliding scale, at an antithrombotic dose. Treatment was withheld for 48 hours post-injury and 48 hours post-operatively, due to the risk of bleeding. Patients were fully anticoagulated with warfarin 7 days post-operatively when the risk of secondary bleeding was over.  Patients with clinical evidence of pulmonary embolus (PE) were investigated with ventilation-perfusion lung scans early in the study and CT angiography or MRI angiography when those investigations became available.
Seven patients developed PE (1.9%).  There was 1 fatal PE (0.3%)
CONCLUSION: Variable dose unfractionated heparin followed by warfarin offers excellent protection against PE compared to published results of fixed dose regimens using fractionated heparin or unfractionated heparin in patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures.

    <publicnotes>This was an observational study commenced in 1987 at onset of my treatment of patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures. Data was collected propectively as standard of care. When clinical observation suggested an inordinately low rate of pulmonary embolus, ethics committee approval was sought for a study and data was reviewed retrospectively and data collection continued prospectively.</publicnotes>
