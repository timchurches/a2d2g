  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in CFQ-R Respiratory Symptoms Scale (RSS) Score - The CFQ-R was administered at baseline and every visit thereafter. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms from baseline, assessed with the CFQ-R respiratory symptoms scale (RSS; range of scores: 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in CFQ-R RSS Score - The CFQ-R was administered at baseline and every visit thereafter. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms from baseline, assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (range of scores: 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 14</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in CFQ-R RSS Score - The CFQ-R was administered at baseline and every visit thereafter. The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms from baseline, assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (range of scores: 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 42</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change in FEV1 (L) - Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines at each visit. The percent change from baseline in forced expiratory volume (liters) in one second (FEV1) was determined at Day 28.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) Log10 Colony Forming Units (CFU) Per Gram of Sputum - Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype). Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Receiving Intravenous (IV) or Inhaled Antipseudomonal Antibiotics Other Than Trial Drug - Use of IV and inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics was compiled from data recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 to Day 42</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Hospitalized at Least Once Between Day 0 and Day 42 - Details of all hospitalizations, including the dates of admission and discharge, were recorded on the SAE eCRF.</outcome>
