    <interventions>For this study, participants will complete just 1 survey. Following the collection of participant demographic and health behaviour information, sports club members will be read the following statement during a telephone interview:

"I would like you to imagine that your sporting team has just 
played and won a competition game. After the game you and other  club members decide to celebrate at a local licensed venue. The venue has live music, and a sells meals but is not within walking distance from where you live.

A fellow member of the club agrees to be designated driver and 
drive you home after the celebrations."</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial aims to assess if designated driver programs may increase alcohol consumption intentions of community football club members. Participants will be randomised to receive a hypothetical scenario describing a post match celabration, or an identical scenario which also indicates that participants would have access to a designated driver to transport the participant home following the celebration. Participants will then be asked to indicate the quantity of alcohol they would intend to consume given this scenario.</summary>
