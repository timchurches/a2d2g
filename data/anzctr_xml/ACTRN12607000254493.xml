  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study was to assess whether a programme designed to prevent the development of anxiety and depressive disorders in children with symptoms of anxiety could be effective when run by teachers within the school system. We predicted that children who completed the intervention would be less likely to develop anxiety or depressive disorders in their adolescence than similarly "at-risk" children who did not receive the intervention.</summary>
