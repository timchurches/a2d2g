  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessment will be with a combination of neurobehavioural assessment, amplitude integated electroencephalography (aEEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Neurobehavioural assessment will be conducted by the Bayley III at 1 year and 2 years corrected gestational age. This assessment takes approximately two hours. MRI will be acquired at two time points- pre-operatively and post-operatively. Participants will have aEEG placed in the post-operative period. The type of surgery that the participants in this study will undergo are congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair, oesophageal atresia repair or anterior abdominal wall defect repair.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Abnormalities of cerebral development associated with preterm birth will be identified by comparison of MRI and aEEG data from healthy, late-born infants, as well as comparison with a cohort of late preterm infants with gestational ages 32-36 weeks who are being studied elsewhere. Specifically these 'healthy' late preterm infants are currently being recruited into a study of cerebral development using MRI being performed at the Royal Women's Hospital by a co-investigator Dr Jeanie Cheong. This study commenced in 2010.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is the examine the cerebral injury and changes in cerebral structure in late preterm and term infants undergoing surgery using neurobehvavioural, electrophysiology and MR imaging.  
Our study hypothesis is that childhood survivors of infants undergoing surgery in the newborn period for conditions including oesophageal atresia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and gastroschisis will have impaired neurodevelopment.</summary>
