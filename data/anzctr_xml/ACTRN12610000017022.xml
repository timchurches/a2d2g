  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 4 arms to this trial.  Arm 1: Imaginal Exposure only. Arm 2: In Vivo Exposure only. Arm 3: Imaginal Exposure and In Vivo Exposure combined. Arm 4: Imaginal Expsoure, In Vivo Exposure and Cognitive Restructuring combined.  Therapy is administered in once-weekly 90-minute sessions of one-on-one therapy with a clinical psychologist over 8 weeks. Imaginal exposure includes imaginal reliving of trauma memories.  In vivo exposure includes gradual exposure to feared situations.  Cognitive restructuring includes training reappraisal of the trauma experience. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Imaginal Exposure condition involves 8 once-weekly 90-minute sessions of individual therapy over 8 weeks. The therapy includes imaginal reliving of trauma memories.   The In Vivo Exposure condition involves 8 once-weekly 90-minute sessions of individual therapy over 8 weeks. The therapy includes gradual exposure to feared situations.   The Imaginal Exposure/In Vivo Exposure Condition involves 8 once-weekly 90-minute sessions of individual therapy over 8 weeks. The therapy includes imaginal reliving of trauma memories and gradual exposure to feared situations.  The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 8 months.</comparator>
