      <conditioncode1>Other</conditioncode1>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Graduated Extinction (gradually extending the time between the infants' cry and the parents' response to the infant: response time night 1, 2-6min; night 2, 3-7min; night 3, 5-15min; night 4, 10-20 min; night 5, 15-25 min; night 6, 20-30min; night 7, 25-35min [duration of treatment =1 week]) vs. Bedtime Fading (bedtime restriction therapy: gradually reducing infants' time in bed to more closely match their total sleep time, 15-min changes to bedtime made once per night until desired bedtime is reached [duration of treatment=1 week]). Parents supported with 24/7 mobile phone support during treatment, when needed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sleep Education (educating parents about infants' average nocturnal sleep time, individual difference in sleep obtained, sleep architecture (eg, sleep stages) and napping). Administered in a single 50-minute session on an individual basis.</comparator>

    <interventioncode>Behaviour</interventioncode>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep (including sleep onset latency and wake after sleep onset, both in minutes; and the number of nocturnal awakenings). Outcome assessed with parent-completed 7-day sleep diaries of their infant's sleep, as well as a activity monitor worn on the infant's ankle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-treatment, 1 week after beginning treatment, 1 month after, 3 months after and 12 months after.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infant stress (salivary cortisol).</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-treatment, 1 week-, 1 month-, 3 months- and 12 months after treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental (self-reported) stress, as measured by the Stress subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Short Form).</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-treatment, 1 week-, 1 month-, 3 months- and 12 months after treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
