  <interventions>
    <interventions>A system for screening for cancer pain and feeding back results to the medical team to inform treatment + strategies to implement evidence-based guidelines for screening, assessment and management of cancer pain as follows:

1.	An audit tool will be administered twice over a 3 month period to enable centres to monitor how well they are implementing core standards of cancer pain assessment and management. 
2.	A toolkit for identifying barriers and facilitators to practice change and implementing strategies to overcome these;
3.	QStream online health professional education to test and consolidate knowledge of cancer pain assessment and management as recommended in the 'Cancer pain management in adults' guidelines available from the Cancer Council Australia Cancer Guideline Wiki;
4.	Patient-held resources to ensure management remains centred on individual patient needs, support patient-health professional communication and coordination and help patients advocate for evidence-based, person-centred care. Patients and caregivers will be offered brief training in how to use the resources by a staff member at the centre.

Centres will be asked to implement the above strategies for a 4 month period and will be at liberty to continue them for as long as they wish afterwards.</interventions>
    <comparator>A system for screening for cancer pain and feeding back results to the medical team to inform care for cancer pain according to local practice. The system will allow patients to report their pain and quality of life via touchscreen computer at each visit to the service whilst waiting to see their medical team. Results will be fed back to the medical team via print-out and/or email prior to the consultation. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate strategies to implement evidence-based guidelines for screening, assessment and management of cancer pain in adult outpatients presenting at oncology and palliative care services.

Who is it for?

You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with any cancer and are attending a participating cancer centre as an outpatient. 

Study details

All centres will start in the control arm and transition to intervention arm, but the order in which they transition will be allocated randomly (i.e. by chance). The control arm will receive screening for cancer pain with feedback to medical team to inform treatment and care according to local practice. The intervention includes the addition of strategies to implement evidence-based guidelines for screening, assessment and management of cancer pain. Strategies will include: An audit tool to enable centres to monitor how well they are implementing core standards of cancer pain assessment and management; a toolkit for identifying barriers and facilitators to practice change and implementing strategies to overcome these; QStream online health professional education to test and consolidate knowledge of cancer pain assessment and management; patient-held resources to ensure management remains centred on individual patient needs, support patient-health professional communication and coordination and help patients advocate for evidence-based, person-centred care.

The study will compare a time before the strategies are introduced with the time when they are being used to see if there is a difference in the probability of a clinically important reduction in pain for patients with moderate-severe pain. It will also test the effects of the strategies on patient quality of life and empowerment, carer experience, and cost-effectiveness of care.</summary>
