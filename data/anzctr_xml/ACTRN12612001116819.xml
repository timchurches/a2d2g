  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Healthy, non-smoking, males and females aged 18-40 
2. Are comfortable with computers, EEG (not photosensitive or sensitive to flashing lights) and fMRI and willing and able to participate in all scheduled visits, treatment plan, tests and other trial procedures according to the protocol. 
3. Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent indicating that the participant has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial.
4. Must be right-handed</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. History of anxiety, depression, psychiatric disorders.
2. Currently suffering from/ or have history of heart disease or high blood pressure or diabetes
3. Taking any medication, herbal extracts, vitamin supplements or illicit drugs for 4 weeks prior to (and duration of) study
4. Taking any form of medication within 5 days of admission (except for prophylactic antibiotics, or other routine medications to treat benign conditions, such as antibiotics to treat acne) and agree not to take any medication throughout the study
5. Health conditions that would affect food metabolism including the following: food allergies, kidney disease, liver disease and/or gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. Irritable bowel syndrome, coeliac disease, peptic ulcers)
6. Epilepsy/Photosensitive or unable to look at flashing lights
7. Left handed participants. This is for ease of analysis looking at the fMRI. There are hemispheric differences in terms of structure between right and left handed individuals that prove to be problematic when analysing the output. Given that this investigation will employ a method where participants need to press buttons as a response (in turn involving the motor cortex), it is wise to use an all right handed population.
8. Renal function problems, Hypercalcaemia; Hypermagnesemia, Severe hypercalciuria, phenylketonuria (autosomal metabolic disorder),  
9. Currently pregnant or lactating
10. People with metal implants (for MRI component)</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A unique screening number will identify all subjects screened for study participation. Screening numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order as each subject signs their consent form. Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised according to the randomisation schedule. A disinterested third party will generate the randomisation sequence using a computerised sequence generator. Randomisation numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order according to appearance at the study site on the day subjects are randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization of participants to a treatment sequence will be determined by a latin square. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The randomisation order that has been placed next to the participantâ€™s number will be the allocated treatment for that individual. Participants will be randomly allocated to the fMRI assessment (5 participants) or the CDB/SST assessment (15 participants)</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will follow a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross over design. 20 participants will complete the study, of which 15 will take part in the SST/CDB part and 5 participants will take part in the fMRI component with the RVIP and inspection time tasks. For the 15 participant group, they will attend 3 testing days and will first do baseline testing of the CDB, followed by treatment administration and post dose testing of all tasks at 30min post dose (post dose testing will consist of CDB and SST. For the fMRI group, participants will consume their allocated treatment and undergo the cognitive tasks in the fMRI scanner 30mins post dose.</summary>
