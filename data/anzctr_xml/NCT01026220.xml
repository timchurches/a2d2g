  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - bleomycin sulfate
Treatment: drugs - doxorubicin hydrochloride
Treatment: drugs - liposomal vincristine sulfate
Treatment: drugs - vinorelbine tartrate
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - etoposide phosphate
Treatment: drugs - prednisone
Other interventions - filgrastim
Treatment: drugs - ifosfamide

Experimental: Regimen I (consolidation therapy) - Patients receive 2 more courses of ABVE-PC comprising doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-120 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 2; bleomycin sulfate IV over at least 10 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) and vincristine sulfate IV on days 1 and 8; etoposide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3; oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-7; and filgrastim SC or IV daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Experimental: Regimen II (consolidation therapy) - Patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously on days 1-4, vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 5, and filgrastim SC or IV beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients then receive 2 more courses of ABVE-PC in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

Experimental: Induction: all patient - All patients receive ABVE-PC induction therapy then they are assigned to Group 2 (RER), Group 3 (SER) or taken off study if they develop progressive disease.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together with
      radiation therapy works in treating young patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy
      x-rays to kill cancer cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy
      may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
