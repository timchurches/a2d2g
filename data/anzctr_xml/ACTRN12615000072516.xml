  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention involves participation in the myMoves course - a course consisting of 6 Lessons delivered over an 8 week period. Lessons are delivered via the internet with support via telephone. The myMoves course aims to build the knowledge and skills required to self-manage physical activity levels over the long term. Lesson 1 consists of introductory material regarding ABI and physical activity. The Active Lifestyle Model is introduced - consisting of four elements - Managing Activity, Managing Barriers, Managing Expectations and Managing Habits. These four elements are the framework for the content of Lessons 2-5. Each element makes up the content of a Lesson. Lesson 6 is a summary of the course and provides information regarding relapse prevention. Each Lesson is accompanied by one Chapter of The Stories and a Worksheet. The Stories consist of the stories of 6 individuals which follow the participants through the course. The Worksheets are designed to help participants build the skills covered in each Lesson, such as problem-solving and challenging unrealistic expectations. Participants are supported via a telephone at least once per week. This will allow researchers to monitor adherence to the program, support participants in understanding content and building skills, and gain feedback on course materials and content. It is anticipated that participants will spend 2-4 hours per week on the course, including reading of materials, completing worksheets, discussion with myMoves team via telephone and email, and general consideration and application of course content and skills to their week. This time can be spread over the week as is convenient to the participant.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data to be analysed for all time-points (pre, post and 3 months post intervention). Descriptive statistics used to describe sample demographics and characteristics. Repeated measures ANOVAs will be used to assess for differences in continuous data within the group over time (p-value &lt;.05 for significance). Should differences be found, paired t-tests with Bonferroni corrections will be applied to evaluate changes within the group over each time period. If data is non-parametric then Wilcoxin sign-rank test will be applied instead. Categorical data will be assessed using McNemar's chi-square test. Correlational data to compare physical activity and sedentary behaviour measures using ActivPal and Actigraph GT3XE with actiity recall measure (MARCA) will be conducted using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. All data analysis will be conducted using IBM SPSS.</statisticalmethods>
