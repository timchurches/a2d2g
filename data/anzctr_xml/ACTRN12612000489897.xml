  <interventions>
    <interventions>An additional 5ml of blood will be drawn with the initial blood taken for standard clinical managment during patients presentation to ED for syncope. If blood is not being taken for clinical care, patient will be asked if they wish to take part in the study and provide a blood sample. The blood will be tested for Brain-Natriuretic peptide levels using the Alere Triage machine. There will be no storage of blood, other than temporarily if the testing needs to be done at a later date.

Data will be collected using a standardised data collection form. Patients will be managed and discharged as determined by their treating clinician as per their clinical judgement - the trial blood sample will not be available to clinicians. 

Patients will be recruited for 12 months with the aim for at least 450 patients.

Patients will be telephoned by research nurses at approximately 30 days post ED discharge and asked a series of standard questions regarding their health and investigations since ED discharge. Hospital summaries and results of investigations will be obtained by research staff.

The San Franciso Rule will be applied to the patient data retrospectively, there will be no change to patient care. The San Francisco Rule considers patients with an abnormal ECG, a complaint of shortness of breath, haematocrit less than 30%, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or a history of congestive heart failure is at risk of an adverse outcome and should be admitted for futher investigation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serious adverse outcome. Serious adverse outcome is defined as any of: Death, AMI, arrhythmia, pulmonary embolism, stroke, subarachnoid haemorhage, significant haemorrhage or any condition causing or likely to cause a return ED visit and hospitalisation for a related event. 

Death will be determined from hospital records or the hospital morbidity system which is reguarly updated from the WA Births and Deaths Registry.

Myocardial Infarction: The definition will be any elevation of troponin or ECG change with an accompanying diagnosis and confirmed by the treating consultant.

Pulmonary Embolism: Determined by ventilation perfusion scanning, computed tomography (CT) of the chest or angiography or confirmed on autopsy.

Stroke: Determined by discharge diagnosis asssigned by treating consultant.

Subarachnoid haemorhage: Determined by discharge diagnosis asssigned by the treating consultant.

Significant Haemorrhage: Source of bleeding that required transfusion or other therapeutic intervention eg. iron infusion. 

Arrhythmia:To be captured on monitoring and thought to have had a temporal relationship to the syncopal or near syncopal event. The treating consultant will determine whether there was a temporal relationship to the syncope event.

Representation to the ED resulting in  hospital admission, with a condition that can be related back to the original syncopal event. This will be determined by the PI's.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients that present to Emergency Departments with syncope are some of the most difficult to diagnose. Syncope (fainting, collapse) is a temporary loss of consciousness with a spontaneous return to normal function. There are many causes of syncope, some serious and some trivial. There are a number of ways to determine whether a patient has a serious cause (and should be admitted to hospital and undergo further testing and observation) or a trivial cause and can be discharged home. One way is the San Francisco Rule, which looks at five factors. These factors are: using the acronym CHESS, C-history of congestive cardiac failure, H-haematocrit &lt;30%, E-abnormal ECG, S- shortness of breath, S- systolic blood pressure &lt;90. However, the accuracy of this rule is variable. There have been suggestions that looking at an additional factor, like a specific blood test for heart failure, may improve the accuracy of this rule.

The aim of this project is to determine whether the use of the San Francisco Syncope Rule (SFR) with the addition of a Brain-Naturetic Peptide (BNP) blood test can result in an improvement in the outcomes of patients who present to Emergency Departments (ED) with syncope.</summary>
