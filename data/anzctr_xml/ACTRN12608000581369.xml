  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Everolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System (PROMUS Element) is a metal tube coated with the drug Everolimus. A single stent will be permanently implanted in the patient via use of a catheter inserted into the vasculature. The drug dosage depends on the size of the stent and varies from 57 micrograms (2.25x12mm stent) to 242 micrograms (4.0x38mm stent) and this drug is gradually eluted into the blood stream following implantation of the stent. Stent size is selected by the investigator based on vessel diameter and length.  Typically stent diameter is selected to be slightly larger than the vessel diameter (ie a 3.0mm stent would be used to treat a 2.8mm vessel).  Typically stent length is selected so that the stent is 2-4mm longer than the lesion length (ie a 28mm stent would be used to treat a 22mm lesion)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac events at 30 days post index procedure: Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac Death Rate, Target Lesion Failure (TLF)Rate, Target Lesion Revascularisation (TLR) rate &amp; Stent Thrombosis (ST) rate</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cardiac events will be assessed during hospitalization and at the 30 day follow up.  Any adverse event experienced prior to the 30 day follow up must be reported within 24 hours. Source data regarding the event will be collected and sent to the Clinical Events Commottee (CEC) for adjudication.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Target vessel failure (TVF) is any ischemia-driven revascularization of the target vessel, Myocardial Infarction (MI) (Q-wave and non Q-wave) related to the target vessel or death related to the target vessel. If it cannot be determined with certainty whether the MI or death was related to the target vessel, it will be considered a TVF.   Any of the component events (TVR, MI or death) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours.  Source data regarding the event will be collected and sent to the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) for adjudication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 9 months &amp; 12 months post index procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Target vessel revascularization (TVR) is defined as a Target Lesion Revascularisation (TLR) or a TVR remote.  Target lesion revascularization is any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to improve blood flow, of the successfully treated target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel with a graft distally to the successfully treated target lesion. A TLR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the target lesion diameter stenosis is 50% by QCA and there is presence of clinical or functional ischemia which cannot be explained by other coronary or graft lesions. Clinical or functional ischemia is any of the following:
* The patient has a positive functional study corresponding to the area served by the target lesion 
* The patient has ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes at rest in a distribution consistent with the target vessel
* The patient has ischemic symptoms referable to the target lesion
A TLR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the lesion diameter stenosis is 70% by QCA even in the absence of clinical or functional ischemia
Target vessel revascularization remote is any ischemia-driven repeat percutaneous intervention, to improve blood flow, or bypass surgery of not previously existing lesions diameter stenosis 50% by QCA in the target vessel, excluding the target lesion. A TVR will be considered ischemia-driven if the target vessel diameter stenosis is 50% by QCA and any of the following are present:  

* The patient has a positive functional study corresponding to the area served by the target lesion

* The patient has ischemic ECG changes at rest in a distribution consistent with the target vessel
* The patient has ischemic symptoms referable to the target lesion
A TVR will be considered as ischemia-driven if the lesion diameter stenosis is 70% by QCA even in the absence of clinical or functional ischemia.  

Any events must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours.  Source data regarding the event will be collected and sent to the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) for adjudication.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PLATINUM QCA is a prospective, multicenter trial to assess PROMUS Element for the treatment of patients with a maximum of 1 de novo atherosclerotic coronary artery lesion of up to 34 mm in total length (by visual estimate) in native coronary arteries =2.25 mm to =4.25 mm in diameter (by visual estimate). Approximately 100 non-randomized patients at up to 20 sites are proposed to obtain clinical outcomes data for the PROMUS Element stent system.  Follow up occurs at 30 days, 9 months and 12 months with both QCA and IVUS assessments at 9 months.  The Primary Endpoint is Cardiac events at 30 days post-index procedure (Myocardial infarction (MI, Q-wave and non-Q wave) rate; Cardiac death rate; Target lesion failure (TLF) rate; Target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate; Stent thrombosis (ST) rate (definite or probable by Academic Research Consortium [ARC] definitions) with an efficacy endpoint of 9 month in-stent late loss and post-procedure incomplete apposition.</summary>
