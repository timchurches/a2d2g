      <outcome>Progression-free Survival in BRAF V600E Mutation-positive Participants Without a History of Brain Metastases as Assessed by the Investigator and Independent Review - Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented occurrence of disease progression or death. PFS for investigator-assessed and blinded, independent, central review committee (BRIC)-assessed responses was summarized per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1, which is a set of published rules defining when cancer patients improve (respond), stay the same (stabilize), or worsen (progress) during treatment. Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions with an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm) or the appearance of at least 1 new lesion, or the worsening of non-target lesions significant enough to require study treatment discontinuation.</outcome>

    <summary>This is a two-arm, open-label, randomized Phase III study comparing single agent GSK1120212
      to chemotherapy (either dacarbazine or paclitaxel) in subjects with Stage IIIc or Stage IV
      malignant cutaneous melanoma. All subjects must have a BRAF mutation-positive tumour sample.
      Subjects who have received up to one prior regimen of chemotherapy in the advanced or
      metastatic melanoma setting will be enrolled into the study. Subjects with any prior BRAF or
      MEK inhibitor use will be excluded. Approximately 297 subjects will be enrolled with 2:1
      randomization (198 subjects into the GSK1120212 arm and 99 subjects into the chemotherapy
      arm). The primary endpoint for the statistical analysis will be a comparison of progression
      free survival for subjects receiving GSK1120212 compared to chemotherapy. Subjects who have
      progression on chemotherapy will be offered the option to receive GSK1120212.</summary>
