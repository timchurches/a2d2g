    <statisticalmethods>To compare the risk of postoperative cardiovascular events between the group of patients withholding AAB agents at least twenty-fours prior to noncardiac surgery and the ones continuing these agents, a Chi-square test or Fishers exact test (when appropriate) will be performed. 

The association between treatment group and perioperative mortality, myocardial events, postoperative acute kidney injury, postoperative stroke and clinically significant haemodynamic instability will be investigated using Chi-square test or Fishers exact test (when appropriate) for categorical outcomes and t-test or Mann-Whitney test (when appropriate) for continuous outcomes.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research study will investigate the effect a common blood pressure tablet has on patients undergoing elective surgery. Participants will be randomly assigned to continue or cease their angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers at least one day before their operation. Researchers will collate and analyze routinely collected patient information to detect if continuation or cessation results in better outcomes for the participants. </summary>
