  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dietary nitrate supplementation in the form of beetroot juice, equivalent to 15mmol/L nitrate daily for 8 weeks. Overall intake will be approx. 250ml daily. Juice composition will be 72% beetroot and 28% apple juice.

Subjects otherwise will maintain their normal diet and exercise regimens.

The trial will be conducted at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, SA, Australia by the principal investigators: 
1. Dr Aaron Sverdlov - Senior Consultant Cardiologist
2. Dr Doan Ngo - Senior Research Fellow, Senior Lecturer, University of Adelaide; Pharmacist
3. Prof John Horowitz - Professor of Cardiology

Obese individuals (BMI greater or equal to 30kg/m2), aged ranging 20-60 years with no history of heart disease, or diabetes who are not on a regular exercise regime will be randomized into 2 groups: beetroot juice supplementation (Group A, 25 participants) vs. identical nitrate-depleted placebo (Group B, 25 participants) daily for 8 weeks. Subjects in both groups will be matched for age, gender and BMI. 

The active juice and the placebo will be provided by the investigators.

Adherence will be monitored using food diary, provided to the participants.

    <comparator>Placebo juice will consist of an apple juice concentrate base matched to the beetroot juice for sweetness and colour. Randomization to placebo will be on 1:1 basis</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary and secondary end points between the nitrite (beetroot) and placebo treated groups will be compared using unpaired t test for normally distributed data or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-parametric data. Correlations between exercise duration and plasma nitrate/nitrite, HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, weight loss, and endothelial function measurements will be performed using linear regression analyses. A value of P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

(v)	Power calculations: As recently shown, beetroot juice supplementation significantly improved exercise duration in heart failure patients with a mean difference 0.8 +/- 1.3 minutes in exercise duration; P=0.02, n=17 patients (Zamani P, Rawat D, Shiva-Kumar P, et al. Circulation 2015;131:371-80). Therefore, a sample size of 24 patients in each group: beetroot juice vs placebo, unpaired t-test will give us 80% power with a=0.05 to detect 1.25SD difference in exercise duration.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity prevalence is rising at an alarming rate, affecting more than 60% of the Australian population, with no trend of slowing down. Obesity is associated with increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and coronary heart disease, all of which lead to increased hospitalization, morbidity and mortality. The obesity epidemic is driven largely by our worsenning dietary habits (with diets high in fats and sugar) and sedentary lifestyles. Strategies to promote physical activity will not only promote weight loss in the obese, but will lead to significant benefits for the cardiovascular health. 

Beetroot juice is a nitrate source which represents an easy and effective way to increase nitric oxide generation and improve vascular health. Data are emerging suggesting that beetroot juice is not only a beneficial way to lower blood pressure and improve glucose metabolism; it has been shown to improve oxygen consumption during exercise, thereby increasing exercise tolerance and durability. This project aims to determine whether: 1) beetroot juice supplementation for 8 weeks in obese patients will improve exercise capacity, and 2) the mechanism(s) associated with this outcome. The results of this study will be the first to ascertain evidence of whether beetroot juice is an effective and cheap dietary supplementation to improve physical activity in obese patients. Such outcomes will be pivotal for the management of obesity and associated cardiovascular complications.
