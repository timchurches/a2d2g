  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study we are looking at using a rapid ultrasound procedure to the eye to look at the optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter. The ultrasound scan involves gentle placement of an ultrasound probe on the closed eyelid of an unconscious, sedated patientThe ONS diameter will be compared with intracerebral pressure monitors and radiologist interpretation of CT scans to establish whether or not a detectable correlation exists.
Duration 18 months</interventions>
    <comparator>Ultrasound procedure to the eye to look at the optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter.
Group 1
Group name for participants in this group:Ventilated patients with traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid haemorrhage
Expected number of participants in this group: 50. Age range:&gt;18 years
Group 2
Group name for participants in this group: Nonventilated
volunteers.Expected number of participants in this group: 30
Age range: &gt;18 
Other relevant characteristics of this participant group:
None
Why are these characteristics relevant to the aims of the project?
The optic nerve sheath measurements will be examined to find a normal diameter for the optic nerve sheath. We
can compare the brain injured patients to these numbers to see if there is a difference.  By screening volunteers the study is looking to ensure that our readings are consistent with data published by other groups, and that we have a control group.</comparator>

      <outcome>Possible Outcomes
We aim to see whether, using ultrasound, a relationship exists between optic nerve diameter and brain injury in a cohort of ICU patients. In the future we would envision a role for this procedure in routine examination of injured patients, in particular in rural Australia where rapid access to expensive and bulky scanners is not always possible.

Paired t-test for comparison of brain injury group versus non-brain injured group. This will be attended a tht end of study</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patient selection
There will be 2 groups of patients who present acutely with either:
1.	Traumatic brain injury
2.	Subarachnoid haemorrhage (Grade 3-5)
All patients will be subject to entry into the study as long as:
&gt;18 years, no upper age exclusion
Acute presentation to Hospital
Suffering from either traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid haemmorhage that is so severe they require intubation and ventilation in Intensive Care.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis
Optic nerve sheath (ONS) diameter increases with raised intracerebral pressure in patients with traumatic brain injury (1) and subarachnoid haemmorhage (2) and this is detectable in intensive care patients by a rapid ultrasound examination of the eye.</summary>
