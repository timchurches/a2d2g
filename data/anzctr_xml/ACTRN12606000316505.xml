  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, Phase III study designed to compare the efficacy of sorafenib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with NSCLC Stage IV or Stage IIIB with pleural or pericardial effusion.  
The study population will include chemonaive patients with unresectable Stage IIIB (with pleural or pericardial effusion) or Stage IV NSCLC for whom treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin is considered medically acceptable.  
Patients will be randomized in a double-blind fashion using a 1:1 allocation of patients to sorafenib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (sorafenib group) or placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (placebo group).  
Patients will receive up to 6 cycles (21 day cycles) of paclitaxel (200 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, based on body weight) and carboplatin (AUC 6 IV on Day 1, based on body weight)  in combination with either sorafenib (800 mg orally twice daily) or placebo.</interventions>

      <outcome>The primary efficacy objective is to compare overall survival (OS) in patients treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and sorafenib to OS in patients treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to compare the efficacy of sorafenib in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients with NSCLC Stage IV or Stage IIIB with pleural or pericardial effusion. Treatments will be blinded to both the investigator and the patient. Double-blinding will be assured by having identical packaging of the sorafenib treatment and the placebo. An interactive voice response system will be used to accomplish allocation of treatment group.</summary>
