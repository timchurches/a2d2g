  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of KB002.  The first 6 patients will be assigned to Dose Level 1 (0.2 mg/kg).  If there are no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 7 days after their infusion, the next 6 patients will be assigned to Dose level 2 (1.0 mg/kg).  If there are no DLTs during the first 7 days after their infusion, the next 6 patients will be assigned to the final Dose Level 3 (5.0 mg/kg).  If a DLT occurs in any dose level then an additional 3 patients will be assigned to that dose level.  Dose escalation can only occur if there are no further DLTs in the additional 3 patients.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the safety and tolerability profile of KB002 in patients with chronic ITP.   Safety assessments include: physical examination, vital signs, (Electrocardiograph) ECG, pulmonary function tests, haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, laboratory tests and recording of adverse events.   Follow up assessments include pulmonary function tests and laboratory tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety assessments will be performed at Days 1, 8, 15 and 29.  Follow up assessments will be performed at Days 60, 90 and 120.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of KB002. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At Days 1, 3, 8, 15 and 29.  This will be measured by evaluating platelet count results at these timepoints.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To investigate the preliminary pharmacokinetics of KB002. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At Days 1, 3, 8, 15, 29 and 60.  These will be measured by blood tests to evaluate blood serum levels of KB002 at these time points.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3.To investigate the potential immunogenicity of KB002 </outcome>
      <timepoint>At Days 29, 60, 90 and 120.  This will be measured by performing blood test to measure blood plasma levels of Human Anti Chimeric Antibody (HACA).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
