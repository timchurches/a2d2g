  <interventions>
    <interventions>A school- community-linked program was designed, implemented and evaluated in a cluster-randomised-controlled trial. The intervention program included a school and community component, which were underpinned with student-centered teaching and coaching approaches and behavioral skill-development theory.

The school component involved two six-session units  sport unit (football or tennis) and recreational unit (YMCA)  which were incorporated into the physical education curriculum for Year 7 - 9 girls. The classes were delivered in a collaborative manner by PE teachers, community fitness instructors and sports coaches. The school component was conceptually and practically linked to PA opportunities for continued participation outside school in sports clubs and recreation facilities via  a subsequent 8-week program that was promoted during the school component.

The theoretical framework for the intervention was the socioecological model that was underpinned by both individual-level (social cognitive theory) and organizational-level (building organizational/community capacity) strategies. 
Capacity-building strategies were applied to create supportive school and
community environments that facilitate the engagement of girls in physical activities (i.e., the organizations and communities). PE teachers, coaches and instructors were provided with professional development opportunities and program resources (e.g. lesson plans).  

This was a real-world intervention and the frequency and duration varied slightly between settings; particularly as all schools organise PE timetabling differently. The program was designed on the basis that the school program equated to approx. 1 x 100min session per week for 6 weeks per unit, however sometimes this was delivered as 2 x 50min sessions per week for 6 weeks per unit.
Each student received two units during the 2011 school year and the school program was followed by a subsequent 8-week community program which was generally 45  60 minutes once a week for 8 weeks per unit.

Strategies to monitor adherence relied on the teachers and coaches keeping attendance logs.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control arm involved schools going about their usual curricular and co-curricular programming and did not include any engagement strategy beyond those currently employed on a routine basis by the intervention program partners: Tennis Victoria, Football Federation Victoria and YMCA Victoria.  </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Year 7 - 9 female students attending schools in low-SES non-metropolitan communities in the Australian state of Victoria with the requisite combination of sports clubs and leisure centres for potential delivery of the intervention. 

School communities were classified as low-income based on being classified as disadvantaged by the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage.

    <concealment>Low-SES non-metropolitan communities in the Australian state of Victoria  that had the requisite combination of sports clubs and leisure centres for delivery of the community component of the intervention were identified.  The communities were matched in pairs on population size with one randomly selected community receiving the intervention, and the other acting as a control. Government and Catholic schools within these matched communities were then eligible for inclusion. A random number function in Microsoft Excel was used to determine the order in which eligible secondary schools were approached to participate in the study.

A letter inviting schools to be involved in the project and detailing all levels of involvement by all parties was sent to schools. School Principals were then contacted by phone by a member of the research team and invited to participate in the study. A face-to-face meeting was requested with both the Principal and the Head PE teacher to outline the requirements of the study and gain consent. Parents, students and PE staff were then provided with information and consent letters.

Schools were assigned to control or intervention and all female students within the school were eligible.  Concealment was not required.
