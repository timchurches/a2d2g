  <interventions>
    <interventions>The following intervention elements will carried out at intervals throughout the study period of two years. 


MindWise stalls at pre-existing Victoria University campus events (such as Orientation Week, Safety Week and Wellness Day). Each event will last for between one and five days and there will be several such events throughout the study period.

MindWise website/Facebook page will be available throughout the study period for participants to access when they wish.

Mailout of Taking Care of Yourself and Your Family to staff members. Mailout 12-hour Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course via e-learning CD to interested parties. These will be done twice during the study period.

Links to MindWise student factsheets on student electronic learning portal (always available).

Monthly emails to staff containing MindWise factsheets.


The following resources or information will be provided. Participants can access these at their own pace: mental health factsheets from beyondblue, Reachout and MindWise, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) alcohol guidelines, MindWise coffee mugs with mental health message and MindWise showbags containing beyondblue materials and Victoria University services for students and staff, check your drinking quiz, pour a standard drink activity and self-care ideas activity.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A cluster randomized controlled design will be used, with campuses constituting the clusters. Reply paid registration forms were given out by researchers to students and staff at 9 Victoria University campuses. Potential participants across all campuses were given a standardized introduction to the project and encouraged to register for the trial on the spot, without knowing whether their campus was intervention or control. Allocation was not concealed from the researchers.</concealment>
    <sequence>Nine of Victoria Universityâ€™s campuses have been paired (some pairs contain a cluster of several campuses) on the basis of similar size and course type. One of the researchers used Random.org to assign random numbers for each campus cluster. These random numbers (without campus codes) were given to a second researcher, who used a coin flipper option from Random.org and ascertained that 'heads' determined that the first campus of a pair was randomly assigned to the intervention group, while the second campus of the pair was randomized the control group. A 'tail' determined that the second member of the pair was randomized to the intervention group (and the first member of the pair was randomized to the control group). Both researchers emailed their information to a third researcher, who was also given the campus codes from the first researcher. The third researcher matched the codes to the randomization sequence. The study will follow the requirements of the CONSORT statement for cluster randomized trials (Campbell, Elbourne et al. 2004).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aims of the project are to design, implement and evaluate an educational campaign, known as MindWise to help raise mental health literacy in higher education students and staff. Data will be collected on mental health problems (anxiety, depression and alcohol misuse), knowledge of and beliefs about mental health problems, stigmatizing attitudes, self-help and help-seeking behaviours at baseline, at the end of the 2010 academic year and the end of the 2011 academic year. Data will be collected via telephone interviews carried out by the Social Research Centre.</summary>
