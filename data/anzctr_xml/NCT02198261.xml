  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Topical minoxidil is the most common drug used for the treatment of AGA in men. While topical
      minoxidil exhibits a good safety profile, the efficacy in the overall population remains
      relatively low i.e., 30-40% re-grow hair. To observe significant improvement in hair growth,
      minoxidil is typically used twice daily for a period of at least 16 weeks. Due to the
      significant time commitment and low response rate, a diagnostic test to identify
      non-responders prior to initiating therapy would be advantageous.

      Minoxidil is converted in the scalp to its active form, minoxidil sulfate, by the
      sulfotransferase enzyme SULT1A1. The enzyme expression is variable among individuals. We have
      demonstrated in two prior feasibility studies that the SULT1A1 enzyme activity in plucked
      hair follicles correlates with minoxidil response in the treatment of AGA and thus can server
      as a predictive biomarker.

      Consequently, we developed a minoxidil response in-vitro diagnostic kit intended to identify
      non-responders prior to initiating therapy with 5% topical minoxidil foam.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical validity of the minoxidil
      response in-vitro diagnostic kit.</summary>
