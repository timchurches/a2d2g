  <interventions>
    <interventions>This 2 year project will introduce screening and brief interventions for high risk drinkers admitted to hospital with facial trauma. This study plans to test the effectiveness of a brief culturally adapted intervention in improving outcomes for at-risk drinkers using a randomised controlled design.
a)Motivational Care Planning involves key principles of a number of brief therapies: motivational interviewing, goal setting and problem solving. 
The brief intervention is facilated by Indigenous mental health researchers who are trained by Psychiatrist.

b)The duration of treatment is 10 minutes and the frequency is three times in 18 months period
c) Talking Treatment involves one on one therapy showing our pictorial sheets explaining our STAY STRONG PLAN that briefly explains the impotance of family of the participants, their strength and worries and goals for change and early warning signs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU)

The allocation will be concealed until baseline assessment is completed and will then be revealed by consultation with the Menzies-based researcher allocated to this task.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This 2 year project will introduce screening and brief interventions for high risk drinkers admitted to hospital with facial trauma. The project will be conducted by the Menzies School of Health Research in partnership with the NT Department of Health and Families. It will build on the relationships and knowledge learned from the Australian Integrated Mental Health Initiative in the Northern Territory (AIMhi NT). This project will allow direct transfer of those findings to clinical practice. This study plans to test the effectiveness of a brief culturally adapted intervention in improving outcomes for at-risk drinkers using a randomised controlled design.</summary>
