  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To evaluate the effect of tactile and kinesthetic stimulation on behavioral and clinical development in preterm neonates while still in hospital. Methods: Thirty-two clinically stable preterm infants weighing &lt; 2500 grams, with no significant perinatal asphyxia, were allocated to two groups: a control group (CG) in which no intervention was made (n=16) and a study group (SG) in which the newborn infants received tactile and kinesthetic stimulation (n=16). Data on the infants clinical progress were collected from medical charts and behavioral evaluations were carried out using a series of weekly, 8-minute films recorded from study admission until hospital discharge.  Results: There was a trend towards a shorter duration of hospital stay, increased daily weight gain and a predominance of self-regulated behavior (regular breathing, state of alert, balanced tonus, a range of postures, coordinated movements, hand-to-face movement control, suction, grasp, support) in infants in the SG. With respect to motor control, comparative analysis of postconceptional ages according to age-bracket (I  31-33 weeks 6/7; II  34-36 weeks 6/7; and III  37-39 weeks 6/7) revealed balanced tonus and coordinate voluntary movements in all three periods, a longer time spent in a range of postures (age bracket I) or in flexion (age bracket II) and more regular breathing in age bracket I in the SG. Conclusion: In hospital tactile and kinesthetic stimulation was shown to have a positive effect, contributing towards adjustment and self-regulation of behavior in the preterm newborn infant.</summary>
