    <interventions>One-session cognitive intervention

One-session cognitive intervention for spider phobia is a brief intervention, delivered in a single session and taking between 30-45-mins. It begins with a description of the cognitive model. The relationship between thinking and feeling is demonstrated using an example of a women hearing a loud noise in the night. Participants are provided with a thought monitoring form that consists of three columns: situation (A); belief (B) and consequence (C). With the clinicians assistance participants complete the form demonstrating that emotional and behavioural consequences (column C) are dependent on beliefs (column B) in any given situation. Participants that demonstrate a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between thinking and feeling are provided with another example. Using the same form catastrophic beliefs regarding spiders are then identified (e.g., what goes through your head when you see a live spider? How do you feel and what do you do?) and challenged using cognitive challenging techniques. To assist in challenging beliefs participants are given a Spider Fact Sheet, which contains factual information about spiders, their behaviour and the level of threat they pose to humans.

A clinical psychologist with 8 years experience in providing cognitive-behavioural therapy to people with anxiety disorders will deliver the intervention face to face to each participant individually. Participants will receive the intervention at the UNSW Psychology Clinic.

A clinical psychologist that is blind to the participants group and independent from the study will assess intervention adherence via video recordings of the sessions. Feedback regarding good adherence or failure to adhere to the intervention protocol will be provided to maintain or improve fidelity.

    <comparator>The low estradiol group will act as the comparator group. Specifically, the results on the outcome measures will be compared between women with low estradiol levels and women with high estradiol levels, based on a serum assay. The groups will be determined based on a median split of serum levels of estradiol..</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Women are allocated into high or low estradiol groups based on their estradiol levels from a serum sample given on the day the intervention is administered. Group allocation is determined using the median split method. All participants receive the same one-session cognitive treatment for spider phobia.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations (GPower) indicate that a sample size of n= 30 participants per group provides adequate power (beta = .8) to detect a medium-large between groups effect size (f = .3) at an alpha level of .05. 

2-sample t-tests will compare the change scores (from pre- to post-treatment) for the primary and secondary outcome measures between the high and low estradiol groups. A 2-sample t-test will also compare the percentage of participants no-longer meeting diagnostic criteria between the high and low estradiol groups. Maintenance of treatment gains will be assessed by a repeated measure ANOVA of 1-week and 13-week post-treatment scores for all outcome measures.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women are 2-3 times more likely to have an anxiety disorders compared to men. One proposed biological reason for this difference is that changes in sex hormones, particularly, estrogen impact treatment efficacy.  The aim of this study is to assess whether sex hormones, particularly estrogen, impact a single-session cognitive intervention for women with spider phobia. Naturally cycling women with spider phobia will receive a one-session cognitive intervention for spider phobia. Outcome measures (scores on the BAT and SPQ, conviction ratings and diagnostic criteria) will be compared for women with high estradiol levels (the main estrogen derivative) versus low estradiol levels as determined by blood serum levels. It is hypothesised that women with high estradaiol levels will have better treatment outcomes compared to women with low estradiol levels.</summary>
