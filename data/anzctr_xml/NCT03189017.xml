    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ICP-022
Treatment: drugs - Placebos

Experimental: ICP-022 - There are 5 cohorts in the Part 1 phase of the trial. Three quarters of subjects will be randomized to receive ICP-022 in a double-blind fashion. Five dose levels will be evaluated; dose escalation steps may be modified based on the safety from the previous dose. Cohort 4 will return on Day 8 and receive a single dose of ICP-022 under fed conditions.
In Part 2 phase of the trial,three quarters of subjects will be randomized to receive the ICP-022 in a double-blind fashion in 3 cohorts. ICP-022 will be administered once a day for 14 consecutive days.

Placebo Comparator: Placebos - In part 1 phase of the trial, one quarter of subjects will be randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion. Cohort 4 will return on Day 8 and receive a single dose of placebo under fed conditions.
In Part 2 phase of the trial,one quarter of subjects will be randomized to receive placebo in a double-blind fashion. Placebo will be administered once a day for 14 consecutive days.


Treatment: drugs: ICP-022
The drug product is a white, round, uncoated tablet.
