  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lipovaxin-MM 1mL, 3mL and 10mL doses, four administrations by slow intravenous injection at intervals of 1 week.  Study is of sequential dose escalation.  Total on study time is 84 days.  All patients receive the same treatment; there is no comparator/control group.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety. Assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and results of vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms and traces, physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests, including urinalysis, biochemistry and haematology. This is a first in human study so the adverse event profile is unknown.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments performed routinely throughout the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immunogenicity. Humoral immune responses will be measured in serum using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cellular immune responses will be measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells using intracellular cytokine staining, cytometric bead array assay and flow cytometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>assessed at days 0, 21 and 42 of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumour response. Determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments made every 6 weeks for 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
