  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of clopidogrel 75mg once daily
      (od) plus aspirin 100mg daily (recommended dose) is better than aspirin alone (100mg daily
      recommended dose) for preventing vascular events such as stroke and heart attack during
      approximately three years of follow-up in patients with atrial fibrillation associated with
      at least one major risk factor of vascular event such as elderly, blood pressure increase,
      history of stroke or transient ischemic attack or left ventricular dysfunction etc. The study
      will also accept patients with atrial fibrillation and unwilling to take oral anticoagulant
      therapy.</summary>
