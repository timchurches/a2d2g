    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants were drawn from the general public through media advertisements and promotions, emails and through flyers. Volunteers of the study underwent a screening interview and eligible participants attended an initial assessment at the University of Wollongong. Randomisation was performed centrally, off-site and and the holder of the allocation schedule provided the codes to a single researcher who was independent to the subject interface. The placebo and active ingredient capsules were coded off-site . The codes were kept from the researchers collecting dietary data and delivering treatment. Allocation concealment was maintained as the persons responsible for screening eligible participants for inclusion in the trial was unaware to which supplement group the subject would be allocated. Different dietitians collected the dietary data and provided dietary advice. Since dietary advice was given in terms of food groups, it was not possible to blind the dietitians but the subjects were not  informed as to their diet group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher independent of the subject interface undertook the randomisation of subjects into diet groups (stratified by sex and block randomised (nQuerry Advisor V 7.0 Statistical Solutions Cork, Ireland).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to demonstrate that, in the long term, a hypocaloric diet supplemented with long chain polyunsaturated fat (LC PUFA) will be more beneficial for weight loss than a control hypocaloric diet for overweight individuals. Outcomes will be compared in those receiving general hypocaloric  dietary advice with those receiving the same advice but inclusive of 180g fish/week and LC PUFA (fish oil) supplements. We hypothesise that the intervention will produce positive outcomes for cardiovascular disease risk factors Potential mechanisms for the effect of the diet will be investigated</summary>
