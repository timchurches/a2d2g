  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ambulatory surgery is performed as an outpatient day-only procedure, and is considered minor surgery. Anaesthesia for this type of surgery can be with general anaesthesia (GA) only, or GA in combination with regional anaesthesia (RA). 
  However, while it is assumed that outpatient surgery constitutes minor surgical stress, there are sufficient case series observing severe cognitive dysfunction and poorer than expected functional recovery even after brief surgery. Anaesthetists have used RA techniques on the assumption that an effective nerve block allows a reduction in GA doses, better and prolonged analgesia, and a positive influence on post-operative recovery. This study will help anaesthetists determine if anaesthetic choices will lead to better outcomes for their patients undergoing minor ambulatory surgery.
    The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of cognitive recovery at day 3 between groups. Secondary endpoints will be recovery in other domains, over time.</summary>
