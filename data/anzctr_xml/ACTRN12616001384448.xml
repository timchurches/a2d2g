  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention, HeadGear, is a smartphone application-based intervention centred on behavioural activation and mindfulness therapy. The main therapeutic component of the HeadGear app takes the form of a 30-day challenge in which users complete one mission daily (approximately 10 minutes). These missions include psychoeducational videos on coping skills/resiliency, mindfulness, and behavioural activation; mindfulness exercises; value-driven activity planning, goal-setting, and review; and coping skill development (problem solving, sleep, grounding, alcohol use, assertiveness, and training in adaptive forms of coping). The first daily challenge will involve the completion of a risk calculator, which will assess and provide participants with personalised feedback regarding their risk for future mental health issues. The risk calculator consists of 20 items developed from the HILDA derived risk algorithm. The risk factor items are based on participant self-report. The HILDA risk items include: age, gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, active carer, freedom to decide work, satisfaction with hours worked, satisfaction with employment opportunities, three or more times physical activity, alcohol use, episodes of distress in the previous two years, satisfaction with health, satisfaction with the neighbourhood, satisfaction with partner, satisfaction with the way tasks are divided with partner, have someone to confide in, feeling being pushed around, and English as a second language. The HILDA questions and response items were replicated from the original items included in the HILDA survey, apart from age, which is measured here as a continuous measure. Users will receive personalised risk feedback immediately after completing the risk calculator. The personalised risk feedback involves an interactive icon array which displays the calculated numerical risk estimate of developing anxiety and depression within the next year, along with a text description. 
Other components of the app include a mood monitoring widget, a toolbox of skills (which is built from the challenge as it is completed), and support service helplines. users will have access to the application indefinitely. The application monitors use time and frequency, and mission completion rates</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed via descriptive statistics derived from participants smartphone use data to characterise feasibility and acceptability in the pilot study. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to examine the association between baseline continuous variables (e.g. K6) and application use (ie, days used, number of times used per day). Spearmans rank correlation coefficients were used to examine the association categorical variables (e.g. gender) and application use. Paired samples t tests were used to test for differences between pretrial and post-trial clinical outcomes (K6).

Pilot studies tend to be underpowered in order to determine proof of concept. In order to ensure adequate development time and resources for developing the web-based program in the current study, the recruitment time window and sample size is purposefully limited. To adjust for these factors, and given the goals for examining initial feasibility of the program, significance was determined at a value of p = .05. This provided adequate power of .80 to detect a medium effect size of Cohens d = .60 with a sample size of 40 participants per group using a two tailed test and alpha of p = .05 (Levin, 2014).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our research team has recently been awarded an Australian Mental Health Award by Beyondblue and the Movember Foundation that will fund a program of research aimed at developing and evaluating a range of new e-health interventions for male dominated industries. Necessary preliminary steps include the pilot-testing of these interventions to ensure the programs are acceptable and feasible. This application is intended to cover the conducting of a pilot testing of the interventions. The working title for this new smartphone application is Headgear. 
This project aims to develop an App which will enable workers in male-dominated industries to identify and problem solve aspects of mental health, triggers and lifestyle related factors, and develop personalised goals and strategies. Objectives include:
(1) Developing and testing a high quality wellbeing phone App for working men and women; and
(2) Conducting a mixed-methods study of the acceptability of the App.
With the pilot testing and feedback, we aim to design and prototype an app that is engaging for workers in the target industries. It is hoped that by engaging users throughout the development process, we will be able to produce a range of e-health products that these individuals will be able to engage with.
Data Collection:
Eligible participants will be directed to the programs website in order to provide consent via the online participant information statement. From here they will complete a battery of assessment measures including:
1. Demographic information (age, gender, education, occupational status, and industry group; email, phone number)
2. Mood and anxiety symptoms (K6 questionnaire)
2. Wellbeing (WHO 5 Well-being Index)
3. Psychological strength and resilience (Connors-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10))
4. Stress (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10))
Participants will then be invited to download the app via the Testflight application and are encouraged to use the app for 30 days. At which point participants will be contacted via phone and email by research assistants to complete the follow-up survey comprised of the same measures in the initial battery with the addition of the acceptability/usability questionnaire (comprised of adapted items from the System Usability Scale, Post Study System Usability Questionnaire, Technology Assessment Model Measurement Scales, and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease questionnaire. Usage data will be automatically collected by the app including time spent in app, number of logins, and specific responses to exercises. This data will be used to examine program engagement and usage.</summary>
