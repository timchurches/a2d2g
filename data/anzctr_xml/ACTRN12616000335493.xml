Cohort B: 20 mg ISIS 696844 or placebo
- Subjects will receive 2 subcutaneous doses of Study Drug per week during the first 2 weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, 12) and then one (1) subcutaneous dose of Study Drug per week for the next 4 weeks (Days 15, 22, 29, 36) for a total of 8 doses.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of ISIS 696844 administered subcutaneously. 
- The safety and tolerability of ISIS 696844 will be assessed by determining the incidence, severity and dose-response relationship of adverse events (AEs) and changes in the laboratory parameters (summaries of changes and counts of shifts from Baseline) by dose. Vital signs and body weight will be monitored throughout the study, and electrocardiograms (ECG) and physical examinations will be conducted periodically to monitor for adverse effects. Safety results in subjects dosed with ISIS 696844 will be compared with those in subjects dosed with placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Screening, Day -1, Day 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 15, 22, 29, 36, 37, 43, 57, 71, 85, 106 and 127</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of ISIS 696844 administered subcutaneously.
- The plasma pharmacokinetics of ISIS 696844 (conjugated and/or unconjugated equivalent) Cmax, Tmax plasma t1/2 and AUCinfinity will be assessed following multiple-dose subcutaneous administration. In addition, the amount of ISIS 696844 and/or associated metabolites excreted in urine over selected 24-hr intervals (Days 1-2 and 36-37) will be determined, and metabolite identification and profiling may be determined in select samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 15, 22, 29, 36, 37, 43, 57, 71, 85, 106 and 127</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the plasma pharmacodynamics of ISIS 696844 administered subcutaneously. 
- Plasma complement factor B (FB) level will be assessed following multiple-dose subcutaneous administration of Study Drug (ISIS 696844 or placebo). </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ISIS 696844 is being developed as a treatment for an eye disease called age-related
macular degeneration (AMD). This study assesses multiple doses of ISIS 696844 in healthy men and women, to learn about: Levels of drug in the blood over time;Safety and side effects of the drug; Effects of the drug on specific cells and proteins in the body, which will give researchers an idea of how well the drug might work; Which dose levels of the drug may be best to use in future clinical trials.

30 healthy men and women will be divided into 2 equal dose groups, and will each receive a total of 8 doses of study drug (or matching placebo) over a 6 week period. The dose levels planned for the study are:
Cohort A: 10 mg study drug or matching placebo;
Cohort B: 20 mg study drug or matching placebo;
Blood tests to measure drug levels and effects on specific proteins will be taken at certain times during the dosing period, and any changes in health will be recorded. Extra participants may be added to a dose level, or additional dose levels may be studied, depending on ongoing results.</summary>
