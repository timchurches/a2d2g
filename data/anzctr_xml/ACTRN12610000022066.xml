    <interventions>Spinal Cord Stimulation System Components.	
The spinal cord stimulation system and related components to be used in this 2 year registry (this registry is the means in which data will be collected for this observational study and analysis) are currently available and FDA approved for use for spinal cord stimulation i.e. The devices are currently cleared for market and distribution in the United States for chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs.
The registry is a database on patient outcomes as a result of SCS interventions and devices</interventions>

    <summary>To obtain real-world clinical outcomes of neuromodulation in patients with St. Jude Medical Neuromodulation Division devices.
An observational registry is defined as non-interventional research that involves the collection of scientifically valuable information for the purpose of answering important research questions. The term 'non-interventional' means that the healthcare provider's decisions regarding the proper treatment and care of the patient are made in the course of normal clinical practice.</summary>
