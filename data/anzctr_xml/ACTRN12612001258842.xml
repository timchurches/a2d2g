  <interventions>
    <interventions>Six online modules to be completed over six weeks. Each module takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and involves participants engaging with an interactive computer program to apply the target skills to their own examples of target problems. Module 1: label reading skills
Module 2: problem solving skills
Module 3: communication skills
Module 4: cognitive challenging skills
Module 5: goal setting skills
Module 6: summary module
AT the end of each module participants are required to set specific plans for how they will practice the skills prior to completion of the next module. Plans are reviewed at the beginning of each subsequent module and participants asked to identify the factors which either facilitated their performance or acted as barriers to carrying out their plans.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gluten free diet adherence: measured using the Coeliac Dietary Adherence Test (Leffler et al., 2009). The CDAT is a seven item questionnaire assessing gluten free diet adherence via questions about gluten avoidance habits, coeliac disease related symptoms and self-efficacy. The CDAT has been validated against more objective measures of adherence including the gold standard dietitian rated assessment of adherence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, three-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological symptoms: to be assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995) - a 21 item self-report questionnaire assessing the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The Eating Disorders Inventory-3 Eating Disorder Risk Scale (Garner, 2004) - a 25 item questionnaire assessing the risk of an individual developing an eating disorder via questions related to body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and bulimic behaviours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, three-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gluten free diet knowledge: to be assessed using 14 ingredient lists adapted from educational materials used by the coeliac society of NSW. Requires participants to state whether each product is gluten free or not based on their knowledge of safe and gluten-containing ingredients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, three-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Theory of planned behaviour variables: Intention, Attitude, Subjective Norm and Perceived Behavioural Control. Assessed using the 17 item Coeliac Disease Theory of Planned Behaviour questionnaire (Sainsbury &amp; Mullan, 2011).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, immediate post-intervention, three-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Three separate sets of randomised numbers (1 = waitlist, 2 = intervention) were generated using an online random number generator. Following completion of the baseline measures participant's adherence category was determined (excellent, moderate, poor). The main researcher (Kirby Sainsbury) then allocated the participant to the intervention or waitlist group by using the next number within the respective adherence category. After each enrolment in the trial the allocation was crossed off the list.</concealment>
    <sequence>An online random number generator (http://www.random.org) was used to generate 3 sets of 80 integers between one and two. The 3 sets were labeled as "excellent", "moderate," and "poor."</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An online intervention to improve gluten free diet adherence, coping, psychological symptoms and quality of life in adults with coeliac disease. The intervention modules are based on the theory of planned behaviour and cognitive behaviour therapy. It was hypothesised that relative to the waitlist control group the intervention group would evidence greater improvements in gluten free diet adherence, psychological symptoms, and quality of life from baseline to immediate post-intervention.</summary>
