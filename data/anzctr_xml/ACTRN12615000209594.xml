  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transvaginal sonographic screening to measure cervical length was done.Cases with sonographically detected short cervix during mid-trimester of pregnancy were given vaginal progesterone 200 mg/day and followed up weekly for cervical length for 4 weeks. Adherence to treatment is confirmed only by patients' verbal confirmation.  If progressive shortening was detected; Mcdonald cervical cerclage suture was placed. The procedure is a 10 minutes procedure done under general anaesthesia in which a synthetic band is inserted and tied around the cervix as high as possible to close internal cervical os.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>subjects were recruited as a single group that underwent screening for cervical length. at this step subjects either had normal cervix and those were followed up without treatment, or had short cervix and those had vaginal progesterone therapy to prevent further shortening. On follow up those with short cervix initially either had stable cervical length on follow up or progressive shortening of the cervix and those only were offered cerclage. </designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>pregnant women were screened by trans- vaginal sonography for cervical length. Women with short cervix received vaginal progesterone 200 mg for prevention of pre-term labor. women with progressive shortening despite of progesterone had cervical cerclage done. All screened women were followed till the end of pregnancy and gestational age at delivery recorded.</summary>
