  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study was to determine the effect of physiotherapy on impairments and
      health-related quality of life in people with a painful osteoporotic spinal fracture. It is
      hypothesised that physiotherapy will reduce impairments and improve quality of life in this
      patient group.</summary>
