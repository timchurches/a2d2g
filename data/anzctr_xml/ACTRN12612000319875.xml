    <interventions>This is sub-study of another trial that is nearing completion. This trial has been registered on the ANZCTR: ACTRN12611001228976, Title: Impact of an Integrated Point of Care Testing service for patients presenting to the Emergency Department on time to disposition decision: a randomised trial. In this trial appropriate patients presenting to the emergency department were randomised to have blood tests performed either by point of care or by the central laboratory. There were two main groups that were enrolled: patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, and a general group of patients who only needed blood tests from the limited selection available by point of care. Randomisation was stratified according to these two groups. The primary outcome of this trial was time to admission/discharge decision. 
This sub-study involves only those patients suspected of an acute coronary syndrome, and following them up at 3 months for clinical outcomes. 
Patients suspected of an acute coronary who were randomised to the point of care arm of the study had their first troponin test performed by a point of care device (Radiometer AQT-90). This device takes 12 minutes to process the sample. This test was performed only once.</interventions>
    <comparator>When patients suspected of an acute coronary are enrolled their first troponin test will be performed by the laboratory based device (5th Generation Roche troponin T assay). This test is performed only once.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be a composite of AMI, revascularisation, cardiac arrest and death at 3 months. This will be assessed by medical record review, obtaining death data from the national death registry, phone call to participants at 3 months, and for patients who were not able to be contacted we will utilise the CHeReL service which provide linkage of data from all NSW hospitals which will allow us to identify any admissions to other hospitals.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months from the time of admission to the Emergency Department</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes will be each of readmission for chest pain/SOB, further angina, AMI, need for revascularisation, cardiac arrest, or death at 3 months. This will be assessed by medical record review, obtaining death data from the national death registry, phone call to participants at 3 months, and for patients who were not able to be contacted we will utilise the CHeReL service which provide linkage of data from all NSW hospitals which will allow us to identify any admissions to other hospitals.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Study allocation will be recorded on a sheet of paper, each sheet sealed inside opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. These will be stored with the emergency department team co-ordinator (nurse in charge).  When a patient meets inclusion criteria, the traeting doctor will ask the team co-ordinator to provide a randomisation envelope. The team co-ordinator will take the next envelope in the sequence and give this to the treating doctor to open.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence was generated using a computerised random number generator. A block randomisation method was used to ensure balanced numbers of participants in each arm of the study. Given that this study is unblinded, block sizes will be mixed to prevent the possibility of predicting the allocation sequence.</sequence>

    <summary>This is sub-study of another trial that is nearing completion. This trial has been registered on the ANZCTR: ACTRN12611001228976, Title: Impact of an Integrated Point of Care Testing service for patients presenting to the Emergency Department on time to disposition decision: a randomised trial. In this trial appropriate patients presenting to the emergency department were randomised to have blood tests performed either by a point of care device or by the central laboratory. There were two main groups that were enrolled: patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, and a general group of patients who only needed blood tests from the limited selection available by point of care. Randomisation was stratified according to these two groups. The primary outcome of this trial was time to admission/discharge decision.
This sub-study involves only those patients suspected of an acute coronary syndrome, and following them up at 3 months for clinical outcomes. 
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that performing troponin testing using a point of care device in the emergency department and operated by emergency staff will produce the same clinical outcomes at 3 months amongst patients suspected of having an acute coronary syndrome.</summary>

    <publicnotes>The date that the first patient was enrolled predates the date of ethics approval. This is because this study is following up patient who were enrolled in a separate study (ACTRN12611001228976). Enrolment in the prior study began before this study had been approved. Enrolment of the first patient therefore refer to the date the first patient was enrolled into the prior study.</publicnotes>
