  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - O6-benzylguanine
Treatment: drugs - carmustine

Experimental: Arm I - Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, then, 1 hour later, carmustine IV is administered over 1 hour. Treatment is repeated every 6 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of carmustine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose level at which fewer than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). If myelosuppression is the DLT, stratum 1 is closed and patients are accrued to stratum 2. If neutropenia is the DLT in stratum 2, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover.

    <summary>Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of O6-benzylguanine and carmustine in treating
      children who have refractory CNS tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells.</summary>
