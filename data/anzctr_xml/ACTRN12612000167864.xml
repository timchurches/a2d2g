  <interventions>
    <interventions>An existing skills-training Couple Relationship Education program, Couple CARE, will be tailored to address the needs of military couples.  

This intervention is designed to prevent couples from experiencing relationship distress; military couples are likely at higher risk of distress than civilian couples, due to the unique demands placed on their relationship such as postings, separations and deployments.

The program will consist of 6-7 units, each addressing a different aspect of couple relationships (e.g. communication, conflict management), aimed at teaching couples the skills required to maintain a mutually-satisfying relationship.  The program will take approximately 7 weeks in total to complete.

Couples will complete the intervention in flexible delivery format.  Couples are sent materials and instructed to complete each unit at home in their own time.  For each unit, couples watch a short vignette on a DVD and complete exercises in a guidebook; some activities are completed individually, and some as a couple.  Each unit takes approximately 50 minutes to complete.  Couples then have a 50 minute telephone or Skype session with their educator, who revises the content and helps the couple apply the ideas to their own relationship.  While the program is designed to fit around the busy military lifestyle, ideally couples will complete one unit (total 100 minutes) per week for 6-7 weeks (program yet to be finalised).</interventions>
    <comparator>As this study is a randomised controlled trial, half of the participants will be assigned to a control group.  The control group will receive a standard relationship enhancement intervention in the form of a book.  This control allows couples the chance to benefit from their participation, but lacks the skills-training component that is key in Couple Relationship Education.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Couple Relationship Education (CRE) is a preventative intervention for couples in intimate relationships, aiming to teach couples the skills required to maintain a mutually satisfying relationship before small issues become larger problems causing conflict and distress.  Although CRE programs have been shown to be effective with civilian couples, few studies have looked at the effectiveness of CRE programs with military personnel and their spouses.  The current study will tailor an existing CRE program for civilian couples, Couple CARE, to address the relationship challenges that may arise as a result of the unique military lifestyle; namely, postings, routine separations and deployments.  Couples will complete measures of relationship satisfaction, stability, communication and individual adjustment, both before and after participation in the program, and again at a six month follow-up.  Their scores on these outcomes will be compared to those of a control group, to assess whether CRE has a positive impact on relationship outcomes for military couples.</summary>
