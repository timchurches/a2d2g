  <interventions>
    <interventions>BADI (Brief adjustment disorder intervention) is an internet-based modular self-help intervention for adjustment difficulties.  BADI is designed as a self-help intervention delivered entirely via internet with no therapist support. It is based on the principles of CBT and mindfulness and consists of 4 modules: Relaxation exercises (Body module), Time management exercises (Time module), Mindfulness based exercises (Space module) and Exercises for strengthening relationships (Relationships module).  Each module consists of 3 exercises which participants of the program are instructed to use based on their preference and as frequently as they feel the need.  Exercises take from 3 to 7 minutes to complete. The participant may complete as many or as few modules as they choose. This enables a participant to personalize the intervention to his needs. The participants are instructed that they will have access to BADI for one month. Adherence will be measured by logging the completed exercises.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>To achieve an improvement of 10 in mean scores of WHO-5 Well-being index we calculated about 73 participants per study arm to achieve 80% power at a=.05. Factoring in the 30% attrition rate, we seek to randomize a total of 190 participants. Cohens' d will be used to measure effect sizes. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to determine statistically significant differences within and between groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The efficacy of internet-based interventions for various mental health problems has already been demonstrated. Many of these interventions still use a lot of human resources for delivery and assessment. Vilnius University Trauma research group has created an internet-based modular self-help intervention based on the principles of CBT and mindfulness for people with adjustment difficulties. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate BADI efficacy on adjustment disorder symptoms and psychological well-being compared to a waiting-list control group.</summary>
