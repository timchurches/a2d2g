  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Endometrial Hyperplasia at Month 12: Main Study - Endometrial hyperplasia was assessed by endometrial biopsies. All endometrial biopsies were read centrally by 2 primary pathologists. If both the pathologists disagreed on the presence of hyperplasia, a third pathologist was consulted. Results were summarized for two definitions of hyperplasia (simple hyperplasia with or without atypia or complex hyperplasia with or without atypia); definition 1: participants were considered to have a diagnosis of hyperplasia when the 3 pathologists disagreed but at least 1 pathologist determined hyperplasia; definition 2: participants were considered to have a diagnosis of hyperplasia if at least 2 of the 3 pathologists agreed on the diagnosis.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of Lumbar Spine at Month 12: Osteoporosis Sub-Study - BMD measurements of the anteroposterior lumbar spine were acquired by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, twice at Month 12 for a subset of participants who entered the osteoporosis substudy. The second scan was to be performed on the same day as the first; however, the participant was to be removed completely from the table after the first scan and repositioned for the second scan. Mean percentage change from baseline of the 2 readings were reported.</outcome>

The second scan was to be performed on the same day as the first; however, the participant was to be removed completely from the table after the first scan and repositioned for the second scan.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Amenorrhea: Main Study - Cumulative amenorrhea was defined as the absence of any bleeding or spotting for cumulative 4-week periods throughout 1-year study.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Breast Density at Month 12: Breast Density Sub-Study - Breast density was assessed by digitalized mammograms which were centrally read by a single radiologist using specifically-developed software. Breast density was assessed for subset of participants who entered the breast density sub-study</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Turnover Markers (BTMs) at Month 6 and Month 12: Osteoporosis Sub-Study - Bone turnover is the removal of old bone from the body and its replacement by new bone. Bone turnover markers included serum osteocalcin, C-telopeptide, and procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), were measured at Month 6 and Month 12 for a subset of participants who entered the osteoporosis substudy. Blood samples were collected to evaluate bone turnover markers levels.</outcome>

      <outcome>Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale at Baseline: Sleep Sub-Study - Participant-rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Consists of 12-item questionnaires answered on a range of 1 to 6 for questions (Q) 3 to 12, 1 to 5 for Q1 (some questions are reversed so that a high score reflects more of the attributes); and Q2 answered on 0 to 24. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range* 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute. The items contribute to each scale and are averaged to create the 7 scale scores and a sleep quantity scale. Scales with at least one item answered was used to generate a scale score. Scales include; sleep disturbance (SD), snoring, awaken short of breath (ASoB) or with a headache (H), somnolence, sleep adequacy (SA), sleep problem index (SPI) I and II (range: 0-100) and sleep quantity (SQ [range 0 to 24]). Except for sleep quantity, higher scores=greater impairment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale at Month 3: Sleep Sub-Study - Participant-rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity.

      <outcome>Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) Score at Baseline: Sleep Sub-Study - MENQOL questionnaire assessed how bothered participants were due to menopause. It consists of 29 items divided into 4 domains: vasomotor function (3 items), psychosocial function (7 items), physical function (16 items), and sexual function (3 items). Each item scores a range from 1 to 8, with 1 indicating that the participant did not experience the symptom or problem, 8 indicating that the participant was extremely bothered by the symptom or problem. The total score for each domain is the average of item scores and ranged from 1 to 8 with higher score indicating worsening of symptoms. The MENQOL total score is the mean of these 4 domain scores and ranged from 1 to 8 with higher score indicating worsening of symptoms.</outcome>
