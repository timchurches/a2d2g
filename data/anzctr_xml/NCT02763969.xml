    <summary>The purpose of this study is to establish if BMS-986202 is safe and effective at treating
      autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis. BMS-986202 which has shown some promise in preclinical
      studies for inhibiting autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis. This study will be the first
      time this drug is given to humans.</summary>
