  <interventions>
    <interventions>IAll patients eliglble for the study will have a painbuster rectus sheath infusion catheter inserted by the surgeon at the end of surgery. This will be initially bolused with 30ml of 0.2% ropivacaine in all patients.  Patients will then be randomized to have the painbuster elastometric pump either filled with normal saline, 0.2% ropivacaine, or 0.5% ropivacaine, and pain scores, opioid consumption, length of hospital stay, time to first eating and mobilisation and presence of side effects will be recorded. The elastometric pump will contain 400ml of fluid (either normal saline or ropivacaine) and this is infused at 4ml an hour for 100 hours following surgery. There are 2 rectus sheath catheters inserted by the surgeon and each catheter runs at a non-titrable rate of 2ml/hr via the elastometric pump. Compliance to use of the painbuster pump and time at discontinuation will be monitored by the pain team who will be responsible for follow up and data collection for the study patients.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group - Placebo (normal saline)
The elastometric pump provides a non-titrable rate of 2ml/hr down each of the 2 rectus sheath catheters.  The pump is left in situ until it is empty (it is filled with 400ml of fluid so this takes 100 hours).</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be approached by research staff pre-operatively and the trial explained and written consent sort. The surgical team and the people doing the follow up (done by the pain service) will be blinded to the group allocation. There will be 3 separate data collection forms, entitled study group one, study group two or study group three, 40 of each of these will be placed into 120 envelopes and when a patient consents to the study, an envelope will be randomly drawn from a box. The anaesthetic technicians are currently responsible for setting up the painbuster pumps by filling them with ropivacaine, they will be only people aware of the group allocation, and fill the pumps accordingly.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation of an envelope which will contain the group allocation. Group allocation will be placed in the envelope (control, 0.2% ropivacaine, or 0.5% ropivacaine ), the envelopes will then be thoroughly shuffled and divided into 3 and placed in the recovery rooms of both levels of our theatre block.</sequence>

The target is for 40 patients to be recruited in each group. Continuous data will be compared with a two-tailed students T test, and categorical data will be compared with chi-squared test.  Any differences between the 3 groups will be analysed by a 3 way ANOVA test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in opioid consumption or pain scores following major abdominal surgery with the use of the painbuster rectus sheath infusion device. To do this, we will compare 3 groups, receiving either normal saline, 0.2% ropivacaine, or 0.5% ropivacaine through the painbuster device. Pain scores and opioid consumption will be recorded for the duration the painbuster infusion (100 hours). The outcome of the study will have important implications for use of these devices in our insitution. If they prove to be beneficial, then the patient experience will be improved. If there is no benefit to them, then the hospital will save money by not purchasing these devices.</summary>
