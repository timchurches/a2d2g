  <interventions>
    <interventions>Free primary health care access at Dunedin's free clinic (Servants Health Centre).  The free clinic opened in January 2010, so the intervention period is January 2010 to December 2012.  This "after" phase will be compared with the "before" phase, in which patients were receiving primary health care at other clinics from January 2007 to December 2012.</interventions>
    <comparator>Access to fee-for-service primary health care at other Dunedin clinics serving low income neighbourhoods ("treatment as usual").  The total study period is January 2007 to December 2012.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary care utilisation rates.  Data on emergency department presentations and hospital admissions will be obtained from the National Non-Admitted Patient Collection and the National Minimum Dataset respectively.  Primary care consultation data will be joined by record linkage (using a one-off key-coded identifier in lieu of the encrypted National Health Index) by the New Zealand Health Information Service to these secondary care datasets.  The prevalence of "unfilled prescriptions" will be used a proxy for the extent of unmet health need, and will be inferred from the gap between prescriptions generated at the free clinic, as determined from the primary care consultation data above, and prescription items subsequently dispensed, as determined from the Pharmaceutical Collection.</outcome>
      <timepoint>January 2007 to December 2012.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health care expenditure.  Basic costing methods will be used given the constraints of the proposed project (to be achieved within the timeframe of PhD study).  Expenditure will be estimated using  Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) codes added by the Ministry of Health to the datasets mentioned above.</outcome>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Enrolment at Dunedin's free clinic.  A gatekeeping role is performed by the practice manager: criteria for enrolment include possession of a current Community Services Card (CSC, which is means-tested), and a variety of social vulnerability characteristics such as having a mental illness, substance abuse, an imprisonment record, prior child abuse.  There is a degree of discretion with regards to the latter.  Therefore, enrolment at the free clinic is implicitly associated with both socioeconomic deprivation and social vulnerability.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Not being resident in Dunedin prior to enrolment at the free clinic.  Since there is almost certainly no fully appropriate comparator group, even among patients at Dunedin clinics serving low income catchment neighbourhoods, the primary outcome (secondary care usage) is being compared for free clinic patients pre- and post-enrolment (constituting in essence a before-and-after study).  For this reason, study participants need to be resident in Dunedin during the pre-enrolment phase of the study period. </exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess whether access to free primary health care reduces secondary care use in vulnerable patient groups.  Primary care and secondary care datasets will be joined using record linkage.  Secondary care use for patients at Dunedin's free clinic will be compared before and after enrolment at the clinic.  Secondary care use by patients at local clinics serving low income areas will also be studied to take into account the effect of temporal trends and external factors such as changes in hospital policy.  A mixed methods study is being proposed, in which patient interviews in a qualitative phase are used to explain and interpret findings from the earlier quantitative phase.  Factors associated with high usage of secondary care, other than the cost barrier to primary care, will be explored during these interviews.</summary>

    <publicnotes>The study uses routinely collected data during the first (quantitative) phase, so no participants are actually physically recruited, and the inclusion of participants' health data into the study appears to commence before ethics approval is obtained.  Only in the second, qualitative phase is recruitment carried out, when 15-20 free clinic patients are selected for interviews on the basis of their health services usage patterns, in order to elucidate the reasons explaining these patterns.</publicnotes>
