    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Daratumumab SC

No Intervention: Arm A: Active Monitoring - Participants randomized to active monitoring will receive no study medication, but will undergo the same disease evaluations at the same frequency as participants randomized to daratumumab.

Experimental: Arm B: Daratumumab SC - Participants will receive 1800 milligram (mg) of daratumumab co-formulated with rHuPH20 by subcutaneous (SC) injection up to 36 months or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study treatment, study or study completion.


Treatment: drugs: Daratumumab SC
Participants will receive daratumumab 1800 mg by SC injection once weekly for Cycles 1 and 2 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each week), every 2 weeks for Cycle 3 to Cycle 6 (Days 1 and 15), and thereafter every 4 weeks (Day 1) up to 36 months or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study treatment, study or study completion. Each cycle is 28 days in duration.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Score - EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer participants. It is composed of 30 items, multiitem measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4 point scale is used and the score for each item range from "1 = not at all" to "4 = very much". Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which will be rated on a 7 point scale ranging from "1 = very poor" to "7 = excellent". Lower scores indicate worsening. Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of physical functioning</outcome>
