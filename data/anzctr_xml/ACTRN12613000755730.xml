  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of AMD,
detected on non-mydriatic 45 degree colour digital retinal images centered on fovea.

The Beckman categories of AMD development will be used: 
1. No apparent ageing change: no drusen and no AMD pigmentation abnormalities,
2. Normal ageing changes: only small drusen (&lt;63 microns) and no AMD pigmentation abnormalities,
3. Early AMD: Medium drusen (from 63 to 124 microns) with no AMD pigmentation abnormalities,
4. Intermediate AMD: Medium drusen (from 63 to 124 microns) with AMD pigmentation abnormalities Or Large drusen (equal or greater than 125 microns),
5. Advanced AMD : Neovascular AMD or any geographic atrophy.

Note:  Increase of the Beckman AMD Classification Category in at least one eye from Categories 1 or 2 to any higher category (3, 4 or 5) would be considered as AMD incidence. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3-year follow up and 5-year follow up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression in severity of non advanced AMD, 
detected on non-mydriatic 45 degree colour digital retinal images centered on fovea.

Increase of the Beckman AMD Classification Category in at least one eye from Categories 3 or 4 by at least one level would be considered as AMD progression.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>3-year follow up and 5-year follow up</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression of advanced AMD:

Development of fresh retinal haemorrhage in eyes with choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) or geographic atrophy (GA), either detected on colour retinal images (confirmed by the participant's ophthalmologist when necessary) or reported by the participant/medical practitioner if the event occured and was detected/treated earlier during the follow up period.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Treatment allocation and concealment procedures are conducted at the parent ASPREE study.  Here is the extract from the ASPREE study Protocol:  

The computer-generated randomization list is prepared by an independent statistician. This arrangement ensures that the randomization code remains inaccessible to all study staff and senior investigators. Following the completion of the randomization process by the research assistant/nurse, a study medication number is provided. All staff, participants  and general practitioners  remain blinded to treatment allocation through the randomization procedure.

Participants in the study are allocated to one of two treatments: a) Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg: enteric-coated un-scored white tablet or b) placebo: enteric-coated un-scored white tablet with identical appearance. Study medications are provided by Bayer Schering Pharma (Germany). A 100mg dosage was selected as this is the common international dose. The enteric coating  ensures that both active and placebo medication have an identical taste.

</concealment>
    <sequence> The randomization list is generated using the STATA “ralloc” procedure. Randomization is stratified for age ('less than 80 yrs' and  'greater or equal to 80 yrs'). </sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Of the participants being enrolled into the ASPREE study in Australia, approximately 50% are aged 70-74, 30% are 75-79 and 20% are 80 years of age and over. We have estimated the prevalence of non-advanced and advanced AMD from data provided in a 2011 report by Deloitte Access Economics for the Macular Degeneration Foundation, entitled Eyes on the Future, which was based on the Blue Mountains Eye Study data (similar to data from other international studies) stratified by age. For the purposes of sample size calculation, we have assumed a prevalence of early AMD (correspondent to Intermediate AMD definition in the new classification adopted for this study) at entry to the study as 22% (averaged amongst males and females). The corresponding figure for neovascular AMD is 3%, and geographic atrophy 1.5% (total for advanced AMD is 4.5%). 

During the period of follow-up, some ASPREE participants will develop new AMD, and some will progress in AMD severity.  
To estimate likely progression rates in the ASPREE population, we have taken 50% of the 10-year rates of individuals aged 70-79 (noting that after 5 years, 50% will be aged 75-80, and 50% over 80). On this basis, we estimate after 5 years of follow up, 18% of ASPREE participants will develop intermediate AMD, 4% will develop advanced AMD and 8% will progress from intermediate to advanced AMD. Corresponding estimates for 3-year follow up are 11%, 2.4% and 4.8%. 
 Using these data, the 5-year follow-up of 6000 individuals with 1:1 allocation of active treatment and placebo has 80% power or greater, with alpha of 0.05, to detect a 15% reduction in incidence of early AMD incidence and 25% change in risk of progression from early AMD to advanced AMD. With this sample-size we could detect a 50% increase or decrease in the risk of development of advanced AMD. 
 

*In addition, we will account for the progression rates from early to intermediate AMD, obtained from Ferris et al (Ferris et al. Clinical classification of age-related macular degeneration. Ophthalmology. 2013)  those with early AMD (medium sized drusen from 63 to124 microns) would progress to large drusen equal to or larger than 125 microns (the main component of Intermediate AMD) at the 3-year rate from 10% (for drusen in one eye only) to 40% (for drusen in both eyes). This additional component will further substantially increase the study power and allow to reduce the requirements for sample size. *

**The number of participants required to enter ASPREE-AMD study needs to account for cross-over treatment of 5% per annum and 1.5% annual attrition due to deaths, therefore it needs to be about 20% to 25% greater at baseline than the sample size required at the end of the study. **

Group descriptive statistics will be used to define the baseline characteristics of participants randomised to aspirin and placebo groups. Continuous variable changes will be normalised prior to analysis. Non-parametric methods will be used where required. Chi-square and logistic regression analysis will be used to assess changes in categorical variables over the study period. Logistic regression analysis, separately for each binary outcome, will be used to determine the association between aspirin treatment and 1) AMD incidence, 2) advanced AMD incidence (for the total advanced AMD, and also separately for GA and CNV), and 3) progression of AMD towards advanced AMD, over the study period. 

The main analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. To ensure the robustness of the study results, we will also analyse the effect of intervention on a sample of on protocol only participants and we will also perform a cross-over analysis, accounting for those who crossed over to the other treatment arm during the study. 

Note: * and **  these two considerations mutually compensate the effect of each other. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment in advanced countries, responsible for nearly half of all legal blindness in Australia.  Due to increased life expectancy, the number of people with this progressive late onset disease will double by 2025. Aspirin could prevent or delay the onset of AMD in older persons but its bleeding risk also needs to be considered. This ASPREE-AMD project will determine whether treatment with low dose aspirin reduces incidence or progression of AMD. 

ASPREE-AMD study is a sub-study of the large-scale randomised controlled trial  ASPREE, which is registered with the International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trials Register. Title:  Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE). Number: ISRCTN83772183.
