        The inclusion criteria (Obese participants) of body weight less than ~100 kg is implemented
        as the PET-CT scanner to be utilised (protocol described subsequently) has a limited
        patient volume. Therefore to fit within the criteria of BMI &gt; 30, only patients of height
        ~183 cm or less can be recruited, and inclusion of borderline participants will be
        discussed with co-investigators from the Alfred Hospital Nuclear Medicine Department.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study the investigators aim to quantitate the extent of cervical and upper thoracic
      brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation in lean and obese humans via positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) in response to the non-specific beta adrenergic
      receptor (AR) agonist ephedrine. The investigators hypothesise that this pharmacological
      adrenergic stimulus will result in activation of BAT in these participants, and that this
      activation will be reduced in obese patients. This study will provide important preliminary
      information with respect to allowing the investigators to progress with longer trials with
      specific beta 3 AR agonists.</summary>
