    <studytitle>Open-label study to assess how the pharmacokinetics (i.e. the way the body absorbs, distributes and gets rid of a drug), safety, and tolerability of the drug siponimod are influenced by the presence of specific genetic characteristics (namely CYP2C9 genotypes).

    <scientifictitle>Open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of siponimod in healthy subjects with CYP2C9 extensive (EM) and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype.

  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>The medical condition pursued for siponimod is Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS). This study aims to characterize the PK profile of siponimod in healthy subjects with the CYP2C9 extensive and poor metabolizer phenotype.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is divided in two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. All subjects will complete Part 1 and will be single dosed with Siponimod (BAF312) administered as a 0.25mg oral tablet. After a wash-out period of approximately 6 weeks, only subjects belonging to the poor metabolizer phenotype will roll over to Part 2 when subjects will be dosed in 3 separate consecutive days with Siponimod (BAF312) administered as an oral tablet (Day 1: 0.25 mg; Day 2: 0.25 mg; Day 3: 0.5 mg). Subjects presenting the CYP2C9 *1/*1 genotype are not eligible for Part 2. The genotype group is assessed through a CLIA-validated blood assay in Part 1 of the study, or Part 2 for replacement subjects. To monitor adherence, subjects will be confined to the study site for 3 days during Part 1, and for 5 days during Part 2. </interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>1) Subjects with CYP2C9 *1/*2, *2/*2, and *1/*3 genotypes according to screening results.
2) Clinically significant disease of any major system organ class including (but not limited to) cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, neurological or psychiatric diseases which has not resolved within two weeks prior to initial dosing.
3) History or presence (=screening or first baseline) of any clinically significant ECG abnormalities. 
4) Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at screening that may jeopardize the subjects' safety throughout the study (as judged by the investigator).
5) Smokers as defined by reported tobacco use or urine cotinine concentrations greater than or equal to 500 ng/mL at screening or baseline visit.
6) Use of any prescription drug, herbal drug or over-the-counter medication from four weeks prior to initial dosing.
7) Pregnant or nursing (lactating) females.
8) Any surgical or medical condition which, as judged by the investigator, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject in case of participation in the study.

    <statisticalmethods>Log-transformed PK parameters for siponimod, will be analyzed by a fixed effects model.
