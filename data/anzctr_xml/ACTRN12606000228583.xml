  <interventions>
    <interventions>The design is a cross-sectional study of cancer patients attending the Peter Mac Moorabbin Campus to test construct validity, acceptability and test-retest reliability.  
For the test-re-test reliability, participants will complete the Peter Mac Supportive Needs Screening Tool twice 72 hours apart.  This tool takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.   To evaluate construct validity patients will complete the three screening tools, the Peter Mac SNST, the SCNS and the BSI-18 presented in a random order. The completion time for the BSI 18 is 10 minutes and for the Supportive Care Needs Survey is 15 minutes. Following completion of the three tools preference questions regarding the tools will be asked.  
Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups, group one participants will receive the Peter Mac SNST alone first and then the three tools 72 hours later and </interventions>
    <comparator>Group two will receive the same tools, but will complete the three tools together first and then the Peter Mac Supportive Needs Screening tool 72 hours later.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is an attempt to measure the reliability and validity of the Peter Mac Supportive Needs Screening Tool (SNST).  The Peter Mac SNST was developed for use in clinical practice to facilitate a system to identify need early and a process for planning of appropriate intervention.  Specifically the study aims to assess:  1) the content validity (the extent to which the tool includes the relevant domains of cancer patients supportive care needs); 2) the construct validity (the extent to which the tool accurately identifies supportive care needs); and 3) assess the reliability of the tool, the extent to which the tool is a consistent measure of supportive care needs.  This project will look at the correlation of the answers of the anxiety and depression domain from the Peter Mac SNST with the Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18), two tools previously validated in the cancer population, to identify the construct validity in this domain.  The construct validity of three other domains will be evaluated by comparing the matching domains of Peter Mac SNST with the SCNS.  Testing the reliability of the tool within a short time frame will also be undertaken.  There was no blinding as participants were aware that they were either filling in three forms whilst waiting for their appointment or were completing only one.</summary>
