  <interventions>
    <interventions>Open-label placebo administration (1 placebo pill per day, with either standard RCT placebo information versus enhanced open-label placebo information) for 5 days compared to a no treatment control condition. Adherence will be assessed via self-report at follow-up after completion of the course of placebo pills (day 6).

Enhanced information will follow the talking points outlined by Kaptchuk and colleagues (2010) - namely that placebos are powerful, can produce an automatic healing response, that positive expectations are not necessary but keeping an open mind is important, and that taking pills faithfully (i.e. adherence) is critical. 

Standard RCT information is similar to that typically provided in RCT studies involving a placebo control condition. Namely, placebos will be described as typically being used as a control treatment, with the capsules containing inert ingredients that have no active physiological effect. 

Information will be provided verbally to both groups during an initial half hour face-to-face research session. Information provision will take 5 to 10 minutes. At the end of this session, participants will be given lactose-filled vegetarian gelatin placebo capsules to take for the next 5 days. </interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep quality (ISI, Morin, Belleville, Belanger, &amp; Ivers, 2011)</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 days post-randomisation (at completion of the 5-day course of placebo pills)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to placebo treatment - assessed using brief self-report measures (number of pills missed, visual analog scale). On the VAS scale, participants will be asked to indicate how well they have adhered to the instructions to take one placebo pill per day, with response recorded on a VAS from 0 (not at all) to 10 (perfect adherence). </outcome>

      <outcome>Positive mental wellbeing (WEMWBS; Tennant et al., 2007) - this is a fourth primary outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the role of information provision in open-label placebo administration. Recent studies have found that open-label placebo treatments are effective in improving symptoms of IBS, depression, ADHD, and low-back and migraine pain. These findings suggest the possibility of generating a placebo effect without deception. Participants will be recruited to take part in a study investigating the effect of open-label placebo administration on wellbeing and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no-treatment control, standard RCT placebo information, or enhanced open-label placebo information.</summary>
