  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention being evaluated is a targeted and individually specific exercise physiologist-led intervention that includes one-to-one exercise prescription and group opportunities for exercise for residents in an aged care facility. Residents are free to engage in either or both opportunities. The intervention involves a 12-week control period, where normal activity occurs, then the 12-week intervention period, when the exercise program is implemented. 

The one-to-one sessions were usually completed within the unit, or for some who are more able-bodied, in the gym. These sessions allowed tailoring of the exercises to appropriately challenge and specifically meet the needs of the individual, depending on their physical and cognitive abilities. This may have been asking residents to stand on one leg to challenge their balance in a controlled environment, or taking them through passive range of motion. There were attempts to incorporate some cardio-respiratory fitness using bike pedals, arm ergo or walking, resistance training using weights and therabands, balance training, coordination and cognition. Sessions occurred once a week, and lasted between 30 and 45 minutes, depending on the capacity of the individual.
 
The group sessions were generally completed in the lounge room or dining room of the unit. These sessions comprised of mostly seated exercises that were quite basic and suitable for majority of the participants. Residents followed along with an Exercise Physiologist (EP), or EP student, who demonstrated the exercises in front of the group,  and encouraged the residents . Equipment such as dumbbells, wrist weights, ankle weights, therabands, and different sized balls were used to challenge the residents. These sessions were intended to be as fun, enjoyable and socially engaging as possible. During the intervention period these sessions ran twice a week for participating residents. Sessions were between 45 and 60 minutes in length, dependent on the circumstances on the day.
 
Where possible, the EPs also tried to challenge the residents cognitively throughout these sessions, whether this be encouraging them to count the repetitions aloud, or asking them to report, while exercising, how many fingers the EPs were holding up. Fidelity was not assessed; however, adherence was registered by the EPs, with a maximum attendance of 12 individual and 24 group sessions.

As evaluators, we are not responsible for the design or delivery of the exercise program. Instead, our evaluation seeks to measure the impact of the intervention on cognitive and functional factors. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For this retrospective cluster randomised design, data was collected from participants from several wings of the aged care facility, in a staggered approach. Data was collected at three timepoints, each 12-weeks apart. Control data was timepoints one and two; intervention data timepoints two and three. Participants will be randomised as either control or intervention at the completion of data collection. This method/approach was adopted to in order to control for an order effect; a 12-week period could be associated with a decline in functional capacity in frail older adults. 
It is important to have a wait-list control as exercise may maintain function/halt the decline in some of our outcome variables (e.g. cognition) rather than lead to positive change. This design will enable us to detect intervention effects and reduce contamination.
Power calculations on the primary outcome (functional performance) allow for 20% attrition. For a large effect, power of .8 and alpha set at P&lt;0.05, 24 participants are required. Allowing for attrition at 20%, we require 27 participants per group (54 in total). 
Data will be analysed using a random effects mixed model.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise Physiology (EP) based physical activity interventions for older adults have been shown to be effective; however, no studies have investigated whether EP in residential aged care facilities leads to maintenance or improvement in physical or cognitive function. The organisation concerned is currently running a funded exercise program with the intention of improving the cognitive and physical functionality of Residents.  Exercise Physiologists (EPs) specialise in clinical exercise interventions for persons at high risk of developing, or with existing, chronic and complex medical conditions and injuries. As a relatively new profession, EPs are developing ways to work effectively with the specific needs of older people, including those living in residential aged care. The organisation has been running an EP-led student clinic for residents in one facility, including delivering services to people with high-level needs in a secure dementia unit. This work has provided initial evidence around the positive impact exercise has on a range of chronic conditions (including dementia). Observed improvements include increased functional capacity and improved cognitive function. The positive impact on residents' wellbeing, as a result of improved function, is perceived to have had a ripple effect on family members: e.g. better quality of life for their loved ones. Staff also responded positively to the changes they saw in residents. This project aims to conduct an evidence-based evaluation of the project 'EP in Aged Care', exploring the effects of exercise primarily for residents with cognitive decline. The evaluation will take a person-centred approach. </summary>
