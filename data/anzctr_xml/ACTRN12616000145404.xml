    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This study is a randomized blinded study; study participants, site staff including principal investigators, monitoring staff and sponsor staff are blinded to treatment allocated. Unblinded personnel will include site pharmacists, unblinded monitor,   1 unblinded sponsor personnel and biostatistician. Subjects will be randomized in a parallel  1:1 ratio to either SYNE008 or Omalizumab</concealment>
    <sequence>Central randomisation will be undertaken, with randomisation numbers assigned sequentially for each participant as they are confirmed eligible for dosing and enrolled in the study.
A total of 80 participants will be randomized in parallel in an overall 1:1 ratio to either SYN008 or omalizumab. As this is a single site study with a homogenous healthy adult population, no stratification will be applied. 
This study includes the first clinical administration of SYN008, therefore no more than 2 of the first 4 subjects to be dosed may receive study drug within the same 24-hour period. In addition, the first 4 participants dosed will be evaluated at their first post-study drug administration follow-up visit (Study Day 3) before any additional participants are dosed. As such, the first 2 participants to be enrolled will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either SYN008 or omalizumab.  Following this the third and fourth subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either SYN008 or omalizumab. If the Principal Investigator determines that there is no reason to pause the study, based on the study pausing rules as outlined in Section 6.1 of the protocol, then the site may proceed to enrol the remainder of the participants. The remainder participants will be enrolled and dosed in sequential cohorts over a total period of approximately 2 months. Each cohort will consist of approximately 20 participants. Blocking will be employed to prevent bias related to any cohort/dosing date effect and to also reduce unbalanced treatment assignment if the study is ceased prematurely. As such there will be 19 blocks of size 4, with participants randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either SYN008 or omalizumab within each block.

    <statisticalmethods>Subject Populations
The safety population will consist of all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug.  
Demographics and Protocol Compliance
Demographic parameters (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group for all subjects in the safety population.
Efficacy Analyses
There will be no efficacy analyses performed in this study. 
Pharmacokinetics, Immunogenicity and Other Immunology Analyses
All immunogenicity analyses will be based on subjects who received one dose of study drug.  Immunogenicity will be summarized for all time points as collected and as available.  No imputation for missing data will be performed.  Data will be transformed as appropriate prior to analysis.  
Free Serum IgE 
Free serum IgE is usually available from a clinical laboratory and is used to determine the initial dose of study drug but since the study drug mediates its effects by binding to free IgE this is also a pharmacodynamic effect of the study drug that might correlate with future efficacy.  
Summaries will include immune response at all available pre- and post-study drug administration immunology time points, and change from pre-study drug administration to post-study drug administration time points.  
Serum SYN008 Concentrations and Pharmacokinetics
SYN008 and omalizumab concentrations will be determined by an ELISA analysis A non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of SYN008 and omalizumab concentrations will be performed.  The availability of SYN008 will be determined by calculating the AUC0-t/mg/kg dose for the one dose group and comparing the associated 95 per cent CI between the SYN008 and omalizumab through the last post-study drug administration time point.  A single dose regimen will be compared to the corresponding regimen with omalizumab.
Serum Omalizumab Concentrations and Pharmacokinetics
The availability of omalizumab will be determined by the AUC0-t/mg/kg dose for the one dose group.
Anti-SYN008 Antibodies 
The population for analysis of anti-SYN008 antibodies will be all subjects who receive a dose of SYN008.  Immunogenicity will be summarized for pre-administration and Day 84. If the Study Day 84 time point is not available, then the time point farthest from SYN008 administration will be evaluated. Data will be transformed as appropriate prior to analysis.   The presence and amount of anti-SYN008 antibodies will be tabulated by group and analyzed to determine if they have any effect on AUCs.
Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population as defined above.  Count (percentage) summaries will be presented by treatment group for all subjects in the safety population.
Adverse Events
The safety profile of the study drugs will be described by treatment group.  The primary variable for evaluation of the safety profile will be the number and percentage of unsolicited and solicited adverse events recorded at all available post-study drug administration time points.  For all presentations of adverse events, additional summaries based on reporting period of adverse events following each study drug administration may also be presented.  
The number (percentage) of subjects with adverse events for each study drug will be summarized by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Additional summaries will present the number (percentage) of subjects with adverse events by severity and by relationship to study drug; each subject will be counted once per preferred term at the greatest severity or most related state recorded for that term.  
Separate summaries of the number (percentage) of subjects with solicited adverse events will also be presented.  Solicited adverse events will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug; each subject will be counted once per preferred term at the greatest severity or most related state recorded for that term.  
Serious adverse events will be recorded through the final study visit for all subjects.  Listings will be provided for subjects with serious adverse events.
Listings will be provided for subjects who have discontinued prematurely due to an adverse event.  
The number (percentage) of subjects with post-study drug administration clinical laboratory values or vital sign values recorded as newly abnormal following study drug administration and meeting toxicity mild criteria (Grade 1) defined in the protocol will be tabulated at each post-study drug administration time point and overall.  Clinical laboratory and vital sign abnormalities will also be reported as adverse events and will be included in the summary of adverse events.
Clinical Laboratory and Vital Sign Parameters
For each clinical laboratory parameter and vital sign parameter pre-specified in the protocol, summary statistics for continuous parameters will be presented by treatment regimen for all pre- and post-study drug administration assessments and for change from pre-vaccination to post-study drug administration assessments.
Sample Size Considerations
The sample size for this Phase I study was selected as adequate for an initial review of the safety profile, rather than for statistical reasons.  If no SAE are observed among 40 subjects receiving active study drug, the exact upper 95 per cent confidence bound on the rate of SAE occurrence would be 8.81 per cent.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a Phase I single site randomized, and double blinded comparison of the safety pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of one dose of SYN008 to one dose of omalizumab (Xolair) control.
The primary objective is to compare the safety of SYN008 to Omalizumab.
Omalizumab is an effective therapy for both moderate to severe asthma as well as chronic idiopathic urticaria.  SYN008 is intended to be a biosimilar agent (generic) to omalizumab.  The availability of a highly similar alternative will help to provide a more robust marketplace and provide this treatment to more patients who might need it.  The current study is performed in normal adults to reduce the background of adverse events.  The dosage (single dose of 150mg) and administration (by injection under the skin) of the study drugs SYN008 and omalizumab are identical providing a comparison of the adverse reactions to the agents.  
The bioavailability and immunogenicity of the study drugs will be evaluated with pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibody determinations.  The effect of SYN008 and omalizumab on free IgE concentrations will be measured as a pharmacodynamic effect. A single dose will be used to reduce any long term adverse effects from the agents and to mimic the way that the antibodies will be used clinically.     
This initial study will enroll healthy volunteers.  This latter selection is made to facilitate the safety evaluation.  This study is a double blinded comparison of SYN008 and omalizumab.  A total of 80 subjects will be randomized in a parallel 1:1 ratio to either SYN008 or omalizumab resulting in 40 subjects in each group.  The study will be conducted at a dedicated Phase I Unit in Melbourne, Australia.   The dose will be 150 mg for both study drugs.  This dose is the minimum dose in the omalizumab product information.
The study duration is 84 days and the screening interval is 14 days for a total duration of 98 days for an individual.  The major outcomes measured in the trial will be solicited adverse events, adverse events and serious adverse events that will be collected according during the trial.  The follow-up for comparison of safety (adverse events) will continue through the day 84 Study Visit.  Standard assessments of serum chemistry including liver function tests, renal function tests, complete blood count, and blood clotting studies, urinalysis findings, vital signs and ECG evaluations will be performed.  Baseline values for pulse oximetry and blood tryptase will be recorded to assist in adverse event evaluation.  The pharmacodynamic parameter being measured is the change in free IgE serum concentrations.  The development of anti-SYN008 antibodies will also be evaluated.  There are 11 scheduled clinical visits after the screening visit(s).
