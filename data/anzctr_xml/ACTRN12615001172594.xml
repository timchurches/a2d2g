  <interventions>
    <interventions> Two 30 minute sessions of occupational therapy per day during acute inpatient admission comprising:
- passive and/or active hand or arm exercises; and/or 
- encouragement of performance of daily living activities involving hand motion (such as feeding, grooming, personal care, playing games) using adapted equipment where required; and/or
- fabrication or modification of custom made upper limb orthoses

Both sessions will be carried out with a Grade 2 occupational therapist during the acute inpatient admission when the patient is moved from intensive care unit to the burns ward.

Number/duration of occupational therapy sessions per day will be recorded via inpatient treatment statistics (occasions of service and time per session)</interventions>
    <comparator>one 30 minute session of occupational therapy per day during acute inpatient admission. This is standard care administered between 01/09/15  31/12/15.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this study is influenced by the number of admissions to the VABS during September 2015 and May 2016. There were 88 patients admitted to VABS between January and June of 2015 with upper limb burns. Thus, it is estimated that once inclusion and exclusion criteria has been applied for each sixteen week period, we may expect approximately 50 participants in each cohort. 

A total of 44 patients (22 per group) is required to have a 90% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5% level, the minimum clinically important difference  (15 points) in the quickDASH between groups.

All outcome data will be tested for normality of distribution. If normally distributed, t-tests will be used to compare group outcomes; if not, data will be log-transformed where possible or non-parametric tests will be used. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is estimated that approximately 80% of major burns involve one or both hands. Occupational therapists have a major role in providing hand and upper limb orthoses and instigating exercise and functional activities when structures are adequately healed. Although there are agreed occupational therapy treatment approaches for patients with upper limb burns, there has been no research into the optimal dose of therapy.  
This project aims to compare two different doses of inpatient occupational therapy for inpatients with upper limb/hand burns in terms of the impact on hand function, self care and length of stay. 
We will do this by creating two separate groups of participants (group allocation is based on admission dates);
1 	 control group (admitted between 1/9/15 and 31/12/15) who have received usual occupational therapy care, which is approximately one x 30 minute session daily. 
2 Intervention group (admitted between 1/2/16 and 31/5/16) will receive usual occupational therapy care, plus an additional 30 minutes of daily therapy. 
Outcomes achieved will then be compared between groups.
