    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous studies at the same hospital, the incidence of pph was approximately 2.5%. About 10000 women give birth at the hospital every year. So the expected number if cases to be diagnosed with pph during the study period will be 300, Sample size calculation was calculated by EPi Info program depending in the type of the study which was clinical trial. Using proportion of expected outcome among treated group and among control group . Level of statistical significance power used at less than . 0.05. Level of attrition should not exceed 10-15%

the same method was used for calculation of sample size only thing that was changed is the hospital flow per year it was increased this year than it was expected to reach 12000 cases per year .

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This cross sectional survey  study will be carried   out in 12 hospitals in Minia governorate  during the period from July 2016 till June 2017 after approval of ethical committee faculty of medicine 
All cases of postpartum hemorrhage will be observed prospectively
Maternal morbidity and mortality  related to postpartum hemorrhage will be recorded in all cases give birth in Minia governorate hospitals main objective of the study to identify factors that associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality in cases that  will develope primary PPH,study hypothesis if we can understand these factors that increase maternal complication we can avoid them for better maternal outcome
