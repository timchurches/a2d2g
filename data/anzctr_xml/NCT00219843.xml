    <summary>The objective of this study is to investigate the safety of intralesional (IL) PV-10 for the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma. This study will also include a preliminary assessment of
      response of treated and untreated lesions by clinical evaluation at follow-up of 12 to 24
      weeks following IL PV-10 treatment.</summary>
