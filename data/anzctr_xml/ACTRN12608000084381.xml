  <interventions>
    <interventions>Detailed observations of person dementia to identify factors which promote well-being and ill-being. Interventions using Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) and Person Centred Care (PCC) models of care.
(1) DCM was conducted for all participating residents in the 5 DCM treatment units by CI A &amp; CI D and two DCM trained staff from each of these 5 units "Mapping" occured continuously in 5 minute observation periods over eight hours during the waking day for three days per resident, in accordance with the specified rules outlined in the 7th edition of the DCM manual. The "mappers" fed back these findings to participating staff within 24 hours, to ensure they consider the identified relationship between care practices, staff-resident interactions and the residents' expressions of well-being and ill-being. Staff were assited by the "mappers" to develop residents' care plans which focus on person-centred care and resident well-being &amp; this was implemented over 3 months.
(2) PCC education and training using Kitwood's PCC principles was provided to all participating staff in th efive PCC care units for six hours over two weeks by two PCC-trained staff from each of teh PCC units, under the supervision of CI E. PCC unit staff were assisted to develop residents' care plans which focus on person centred care and resident well-being by PCC-trained staff &amp; to implement PCC over 3 months</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dementia Care Mapping (DCM) employs detailed observations of persons with dementia to identify factors which promote their well-being and ill-being. This provides the basis for health service delivery which is person-centred and focused on the resident's well-being. Consequently, the persons' behavioural disturbance will reduce.
This is a randominsed control study conducted over 2 years with 360 persons with dementia , with 200 care staff in 15 matched residential dementia care units in a prepost test, followup design.</summary>
