  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number Of Subjects Reporting Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events and Other Indicators Of Reactogenicity After Any Vaccination. - Safety was assessed as the number of subjects who reported solicited local and systemic adverse events and other indicators of reactogenicity following two doses of either mammalian cell culture-derived or egg-derived trivalent influenza vaccination in subjects aged =4 To =17 Years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to Day 7 after any vaccination</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number Of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Adverse Events After Any Vaccination. - Safety was assessed as the number of subjects who reported unsolicited adverse events following vaccination with either mammalian cell culture-derived or egg-derived trivalent influenza vaccination in subjects aged =4 To =17 Years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to Day49 for subjects aged =4 To =8 years not previously vaccinated. Day 1 to Day 38 for subjects aged =4 To =8 years previously vaccinated and all subjects aged =9 To =17 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number Of Subjects Reporting Unsolicited Serious Adverse Events After Any Vaccination. - Safety was assessed as the number of subjects who reported serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs and new onset of chronic diseases (NOCD) in subjects aged =4 To =17 Years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to Day 183 for previously vaccinated subjects and Day 213 for not-previously vaccinated subjects</timepoint>
