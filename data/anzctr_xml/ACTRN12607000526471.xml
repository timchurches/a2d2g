  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the project will be treated in accordance with a standardised protocol (flowchart).  Participants will be asked to complete validated quality of life questionnaires at point of referral, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks, or until such point as the cough has ceased.  Participants will be randomised to active arm (consultation and treatment according to flowchart within 2 weeks of referral) or control arm (consultation and treatment according to flowchart according to usual waiting time of instituition/practitioner, usually 6 weeks).</interventions>

      <outcome>Difference in Quality of Life score (as recorded on validated Parent-proxy cough specific quliaty of life tool (PC-QOL), and commercially available age specific PedsQL tool)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quality of life (PC-QOL and PedsQL) collected from participants at referral, week 6, week 10, week 14, week 26 and week 52, or until the cough has ceased (score of 0 for 3-5 consecutive days on parent completed cough diary).  QOL collected at time of cough ceasing if this is in between set time points.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>% of children where primary diagnosis is achieved will be measured at completion of study period.  Endpoint of study involvement for each participant is when child ceases coughing OR at 12 months from recruitment into study.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a management protocol designed to improve the management of children with chronic cough.  Cough that lasts greater than 4 weeks in children has been shown to cause considerable anxiety to parents and presents a major management problem to the treating doctor.  This study aims to prove the hypothesis that the management of chronic cough in children in accordance with a management protocol is feasible and efficient, and improves clinical outcomes.</summary>
