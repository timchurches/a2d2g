      <timepoint>Approximately 2 months duration (Daily for 4 cycles of treatment; 2 weeks per cycle)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Median time from randomization to date of death caclulated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants were censored on the date of last contact (i.e., the date the participant was last known to be alive) if they were not known to have died.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization to the data cut-off date of 8 June 2012. Median time on study was 11.6 months and the maximum was 27.6 months.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Progression Free Survival - Time from randomization to date of radiological disease progression or death from any cause, whichever event occurs first, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants without either event by the analysis data cutoff date were censored on the date of their last evaluable disease assessment. Disease progression based on the investigator's assessment of radiographic scans using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Clinical progression without radiological assessment was not be considered a disease progression in this analysis. Progression defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study evaluating
      the efficacy of pegfilgrastim to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients
      with newly diagnosed, locally-advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer receiving first-line
      treatment with bevacizumab and either 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, Leucovorin (FOLFOX) or
      5-fluorouracil, Irinotecan, Leucovorin (FOLFIRI).

      This study will also investigate the effect of adding pegfilgrastim to bevacizumab and either
      FOLFOX or FOLFIRI by evaluating overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall
      response rate in each arm at regular intervals over a maximum of 60 months follow-up.</summary>
