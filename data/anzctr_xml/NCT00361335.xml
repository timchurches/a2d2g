  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Golimumab
Treatment: drugs - Methotrexate
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Group I: 2mg/kg Golimumab + MTX - Intravenous (IV) infusions of 2mg/kg golimumab at Week 0 and every 12 weeks thereafter with early escape (an additional 2mg/kg IV infusion of golimumab) and dose regimen adjustment (switch to 4mg/kg IV golimumab), depending on joint assessment results, at Week 16 and 24, respectively. The duration of the combined IV treatment period (initial treatment plus early escape and/or dose regimen adjustment) will be a minimum of 48 weeks. The IV treatment period will be followed by the option of subcutaneous (SC) injections of 50mg golimumab every 4 weeks for a further 24 weeks (Extension Study). In addition, patients will receive methotrexate (MTX) at the same dose as that before study entry

Experimental: Group II: 2mg/kg Golimumab only - IV infusions of 2mg/kg golimumab at Week 0 and every 12 weeks thereafter with early escape (addition of MTX) and dose regimen adjustment (addition of MTX or switch to 4mg/kg IV golimumab), depending on joint assessment results, at Week 16 and 24, respectively. The duration of the combined IV treatment period (initial treatment plus early escape and/or dose regimen adjustment) will be a minimum of 48 weeks. The IV treatment period will be followed by the option of SC injections of 50mg golimumab every 4 weeks for a further 24 weeks (Extension Study). In addition, patients will receive placebo (sham MTX) capsules

Experimental: Group III: 4mg/kg Golimumab + MTX - IV infusions of 4mg/kg golimumab at Week 0 and every 12 weeks thereafter for a minimum of 48 weeks followed by the option of SC injections of 50mg golimumab every 4 weeks for a further 24 weeks (Extension Study). In addition, patients will receive MTX at the same dose as that before study entry.

Experimental: Group IV: 4mg/kg Golimumab only - IV infusions of 4mg/kg golimumab at Week 0 and every 12 weeks thereafter with early escape (addition of MTX) and dose regimen adjustment (addition of MTX), depending on joint assessment results, at Week 16 and 24, respectively. The duration of the combined IV treatment period (initial treatment plus early escape and/or dose regimen adjustment) will be a minimum of 48 weeks. The IV treatment period will be followed by the option of SC injections of 50mg golimumab every 4 weeks for a further 24 weeks (Extension Study). In addition, patients will receive placebo (sham MTX) capsules.

Placebo Comparator: Group V: IV Placebo + MTX - IV infusions of placebo at Week 0 and Week 12 with early escape (switch to 4mg/kg IV golimumab) and dose regimen adjustment (switch to 4mg/kg IV golimumab), depending on joint assessment results, at Week 16 and 24, respectively. The duration of the combined IV treatment period (placebo plus golimumab) will be a minimum of 48 weeks. The IV treatment period will be followed by the option of SC injections of 50mg golimumab every 4 weeks for a further 24 weeks (Extension Study). In addition patients will receive MTX at the same dose as that before study entry. Participants still receiving placebo injections at Week 48 are not eligible to enter the Extension Study.


Treatment: drugs: Golimumab
2mg/kg or 4mg/kg will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes

Treatment: drugs: Methotrexate
Active MTX capsules, filled with microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 102) and a 2.5 mg MTX tablet, will be administered at the same dose as before the study entry.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo solution will be administered through IV infusion in Group V and oral placebo capsules (sham MTX) filled with microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH 102) will be administered in Group II and IV.

      <outcome>Number of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 Response at Week 14 - An ACR 50 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 50 percentage improvement from baseline in: 1. Swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) 2. greater than or equal to 50 percentage improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: a. Patient's assessment of pain (VAS) (0-10 cm) b. Patient's Global Assessment of Disease activity (VAS) (0-10 cm) c. Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) (0-10 cm) d.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of golimumab
      intravenous (IV) infusions every 12 weeks with or without Methotrexate (MTX), compared with
      MTX alone, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite concurrent MTX
      treatment. In addition, the safety of subcutaneous (SC) golimumab injections following
      transition from IV golimumab infusions will also be evaluated.</summary>
