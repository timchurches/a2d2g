  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Sequential therapy comprised esomeprazole 20 mg and amoxicillin 1 g taken twice a day for 5 days followed by esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and tinidazole 500 mg taken twice a day for 5 days. All drugs are oral capsules or tablets.
Arm 2: 10-day standard triple therapy comprised esomeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and amoxicillin 1 g taken twice a day for 10 days. All drugs are oral capsules or tablets.
Patients were asked to return within 1 to 3 days after treatment to assess the compliance with therapy. Compliance, determined by pill counts, was defined as good when more than 90% of the prescribed drugs were taken. Patients who had taken fewer than 80% of the treatment drugs (poor compliance) were excluded from per-protocol analysis.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Eradication rates (%) of Helicobacter pylori infection associated with sequential therapy and 10-d standard triple therapy.
Patients with peptic ulcer and macroscopic gastric mucosal erosions underwent repeat upper endoscopy to determine the outcome of eradication therapy after treatment. Three gastric biopsies were taken at this visit: one from the antrum for rapid urease test and one each from the antrum and corpus for Warthin-Starry staining. Helicobacter pylori infection eradication was defined by the demonstration of a negative rapid urease test and a negative Warthin-Starry stain. 
A urea breath test was used to confirm Helicobacter pylori infection status for patients without evidence of peptic ulcer or macroscopic gastric mucosal erosions after treatment. Helicobacter pylori infection was considered to be eradicated if the urea breath test result was negative.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 8 to 12 weeks after treatment (participants are assessed once only)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and compliance to sequential therapy and 10-d standard triple therapy.
Patients were asked to return within 1 to 3 days after treatment, to determine the incidence of side effects (safety) and to assess the compliance with therapy. Adverse events were evaluated in all patients using open-ended questions, by patient self-reports and from physical examinations. The common known or possible side effects include nausea, epigastric pain, diarrhea, itching, headache, constipation and taste alteration. Compliance, determined by pill counts, was defined as good when more than 90% of the prescribed drugs were taken. Patients who had taken fewer than 80% of the treatment drugs (poor compliance) were excluded from per-protocol analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 to 3 days after treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effects of different patterns of antibiotic resistance on Helicobacter pylori eradication and the factors that influenced eradication efficacy.
Helicobacter pylori strains were isolated from gastric mucosal samples, and in vitro antibiotic resistance to three antibiotics was tested by E-test.
The effects of different patterns of antibiotic resistance on Helicobacter pylori eradication were demonstrated by comparisons of the eradication rates in the subgroups with different resistance patterns. 
Host and bacterial parameters were analyzed using univariate analysis. Variables with a P-value lower than 0.3 were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent factors for eradication outcome.</outcome>

None of the patients had a history of gastrointestinal malignancy, previous gastric or esophageal surgery, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, severe concomitant cardiovascular, respiratory, hematological, renal, hepatic or neurological diseases.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients were enrolled by the medical personnel of the gastrointestinal unit after assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria and provided written informed consent. Patients were interviewed to obtain demographic data and medical history, and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Allocation was concealed with an opaque envelope. The envelope was opened by the investigator when the patient was eligible for the study and had provided written informed consent. The patients were randomly assigned to treatment in a 1:1 ratio within 2 weeks of a positive culture result. Treatment allocation was not blinded.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated randomization chart (SAS version 8.0; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) stratified according to center, was constructed using a block design (block size of four) provided by an independent statistician and was used to determine treatment allocation.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated based on the results from a published pooled-data analysis available at the time when the study was designed. Based on a 93.4% eradication rate for sequential therapy and a 79.6% eradication rate for 10-day standard triple therapy, it was calculated that at least 126 patients per treatment arm would be required to provide 90% power to detect statistically significant difference between treatments at a two-sided probability level of 95%. At least 139 patients were into each group to account for a 10% withdrawal rate.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (version 16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The primary outcome variable was the Helicobacter pylori eradication rate with sequential therapy and 10-d standard triple therapy, evaluated using both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. Secondary outcomes were eradication rates in subgroups of patients with clarithromycin resistance and metronidazole resistance. 
Between group differences were evaluated using Students t test for continuous variables and Pearson Chi-square or Fishers exact test for categorical variables. Host and bacterial parameters were analyzed using univariate analysis. Variables with a P-value lower than 0.3 were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent factors for eradication outcome. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for unsuccessful eradication were calculated in relation to the different variables. The frequency of adverse events and compliance was compared between regimens. Values of P&lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is an important causal factor in a wide range of upper gastrointestinal diseases and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, 10-d standard triple therapy (STT) comprising a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or metronidazole) is the first-line option for empiric H. pylori eradication. However, the effectiveness of STT has declined to unacceptable levels in many regions of the world mainly due to antibiotic resistance. A novel form of sequential therapy (SQT) consisting of 5 days dual therapy (PPI plus amoxicillin) followed by 5 days triple therapy (PPI plus clarithromycin plus tinidazole or metronidazole) has recently been developed. Several systematic reviews have concluded SQT is associated with a good eradication efficacy and safety, and have shown it to be more effective than STT. Based on this evidence, SQT appears to offer an effective therapeutic option to replace STT for first-line treatment of H pylori. However, the majority of evidence supporting the use of SQT comes from Italy indicating that publication bias may compromise the data. At present, STT remains the most widely used treatment approach for H. pylori eradication in China, where there is high prevalence of H. pylori infection and high resistance rates of clarithromycin and metronidazole. It remains unknown whether the SQT regimen is suitable for Chinese patients with H. pylori infection. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the eradication rates of H. pylori infection associated with STT and SQT regimens. We also investigated the effects of different patterns of antibiotic resistance on H. pylori eradication and attempted to determine the factors that influenced eradication efficacy. The safety and compliance to each regimen were also compared.</summary>
