Experimental: Assessing response with MRI + PET. - Pre-operative chemo/RT as per standard treatment. Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) / Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) 45Gray/25 fractions with simultaneous integrated Boost of 50Gray/25 fractions + concurrent capecitabine chemotherapy.
Intervention 1 'Early MRI and PET/CT - 2 weeks after commencing chemo/RT' involves additional Multiparametric MRI + PET/CT 2 weeks into chemo/RT Intervention 2 :\'Late MRI and PET/CT 6 weeks post chemo/RT' involves additional Multiparametric MRI + PET/CT 6 weeks post chemo/RT


Other interventions: Early MRI and PET/CT - 2 weeks after commencing chemo/RT
Patients will have an early MRI and PET/CT - 2 weeks after commencing chemo/RT. A limited range PET/CT will look at parameters: SUVmaxm PERCIST, RECIST 1.1, ?SUV (PET1-2), ?SUV (early -late), Glycolytic tumour volume (GTV). MRI T2 (1-3mm slice as per NS Radiology protocol and ESGAR guideline) will look at parameters: DWI &amp; ADC value (preferably on a single camera with reproducible ADC value), Local Staging, MRF involvement, EMVI, nodal status, MR volumetry, and desmoplastic reaction.

Other interventions: Late MRI and PET/CT 6 weeks post chemo/RT
Patients will have late a MRI and PET/CT 6 weeks post chemo/RT. A whole body PET/CT will look at parameters: SUVmaxm PERCIST, RECIST 1.1, ?SUV (PET1-2), ?SUV (early -late), Glycolytic tumour volume (GTV). MRI T2 (1-3mm slice as per NS Radiology protocol and ESGAR guideline) will look at parameters: DWI &amp; ADC value (preferably on a single camera with reproducible ADC value), Local Staging, MRF involvement, EMVI, nodal status, MR volumetry, and desmoplastic reaction.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Predictive value of PET/CT and MRI 2 weeks into chemo-irradiation for developing a pathologic complete response at surgery. - Predictive value of PET/CT and MRI 2 weeks into chemo-irradiation for developing a pathologic complete response at surgery (Grade 0 - no viable cancer cells seen in the resection specimen).
The standard grading system employed by pathologists at Royal North Shore Hospital will be used to measure tumour regression. This is the system recommended by the RCPA synoptic report for colorectal cancer, based on Ryan R, Gibbons D, Hyland JMP, et al. Pathological response following long-course neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer. Histopathology 2005; 47:141-6.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of conducting additional PET and MRI scans at 6 weeks post-treatment. - This will be assessed in terms of whether PET and MR imaging approximately 6 weeks after chemo-irradiation adds any additional predictive value to imaging performed 2 weeks into treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Utility of adding PET scan to the baseline staging of patients - This will be measured by whether PET 2 weeks into treatment (combined with already utilised MRI) can independently predict the likelihood of a pathological complete response at surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pathologic response according to Tumour Regression Grade (TRG) - A scoring system will be developed based on the degree of response from the PET and MRI scan at 2 weeks incorporating tumour shrinkage (PET and MR), reduction in SUV (PET) and reduction in diffusion (MR) that can best predict the "responders" and "non-responders".</outcome>
      <timepoint>2.5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Impact of pCR rates on long term disease control - Measured in terms of loco-regional or distant recurrence by 3 years.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate if PET/CT and MRI scans performed early in
      treatment and six weeks after treatment can predict the response of rectal cancer following
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This will help doctors to better tailor treatments for rectal
      cancer in the future.</summary>
