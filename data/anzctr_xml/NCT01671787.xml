Experimental: GS-7340 8mg - After Screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive either open-label GS-7340 8, 25, 40, or 120 mg (3 x 40 mg), or open-label TDF 300 mg for 28 days.

Experimental: GS-7340 25mg - After Screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive either open-label GS-7340 8, 25, 40, or 120 mg (3 x 40 mg), or open-label TDF 300 mg for 28 days.

Experimental: GS-7340 40mg - After Screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive either open-label GS-7340 8, 25, 40, or 120 mg (3 x 40 mg), or open-label TDF 300 mg for 28 days.

Experimental: GS-7340 120mg - After Screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive either open-label GS-7340 8, 25, 40, or 120 mg (3 x 40 mg), or open-label TDF 300 mg for 28 days.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA - Time-weighted average change from baseline through Week 4 (DAVG4) in serum HBV DNA (log10 IU/mL) for GS-7340 8-, 25-, 40 and 120-mg.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Week 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in HBV DNA for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) - Comparing the short-term antiviral activity of GS-7340 with TDF 300mg. This is measured by time-weighted average change from baseline through Week 4 (DAVG4) in serum HBV DNA (log10 IU/mL) for TDF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Week 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in HBV DNA of GS-7340 through 28 days of therapy - Time weighted change from baseline to day 29 (DAVG4) in serum HBV DNA (log10 IU/mL)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to week 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-7340 and/or tenofovir (TVF) following single and multiple doses of GS-7340 and TDF - GS-7340 and tenofovir (TFV) PK parameters in plasma will be calculated as applicable: Cmax, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, T1/2, ?z, AUC0-t, AUC0-last, AUC0-8, %AUCexp.
PK samples are collected on:
Baseline/Day 1: 0 (predose), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hours post dose
Additional predose plasma samples will be collected on Days 2, 5, 8, 10, 15, 19, 22, and 29/End of Treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to week 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and Tolerability of Therapy - Safety and tolerability is measured by the incidence of adverse events and graded laboratory abnormalities</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to week 4</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
