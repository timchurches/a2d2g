  <interventions>
    <interventions>Local anesthetic (0.5% Ropivacaine) wound instillation device, Painbuster 4ml/hr, for postoperative 72 hours

Painbuster is an elastometric pump with catheters that have multiorifice holes through which local anesthetics can be delivered at a constant rate 4ml/hr if the catheters are placed at the wound are. 

As for a rescue analgesics, fentanyl intravenous patient controlled analgeisa (IV PCA) was  applied at the end of surgery with a regimen of 1500 ug of fentanyl in normal saline 100 mL (15 ug/mL), programmed for 1ml bolus, 15 minutes lockout time without a basal infusion.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the comparator group, intrathecal morphine 400ug was administered before induction of anesthesia and fentanyl IV PCA was applied at the end of surgery with a regimen of 1500 ug of fentanyl in normal saline 100 mL (15 ug/mL), programmed for 1ml bolus, 15 minutes lockout time, and 1ml/hr basal rate.</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A consumption of IV PCA (fentanyl) and supplementary meperidine

An IV PCA device (AutoMed 3200; Acemedical, Korea) that can manifest infused volumes was used to check the amount of IV PCA fentanyl consumption. 
Supplementary meperidine was given when appropriate by the VAS &gt;5 even if IV PCA was applied more than 3 time (assessed by the clinician at the ward), and the usage was investigated by reviewing the patient chart by the study time interval. An independent investigator  assessed IV PCA fentanyl and meperidine consumption.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Side effects were recorded. 
respiratory rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2), sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pruritus,
wound complications including hematoma, seroma and wound discharge

Side effects were reviewed with the patients chart and patient inquiery at the study check point 

Respiratory rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) were checked with monitoring and recoreded on the patient's chart.  
Sedation was assessed on a 5-point scale (1- completely awake with the eyes open; 2 -drowsy; 3 -dozing, 4- mostly sleeping; and 5- not responding).
Dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and pruritus were assessed by asking the patient on a scale of mild, moderate and severe.
Wound complications including hematoma, seroma and wound discharge were inspected by a surgeon on the postoeprative 3 and were recorded on the chart.</outcome>

      <outcome>Pulmonary function test (Forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1 and Functional vital capacity, FVC)

a portable spirometry (Micro, Micro Medical Limited, Rochester, U.K.) was used for the assessment</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ropivacaine continuous infusion (Painbuster) in liver donors compared to intrathecal morphine (ITM) with intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV PCA). 
Adult donors were randomly allocated into 2 groups: ITM + IV PCA group, Painbuster + rescue IV PCA group. Donors in Painbuster + rescue IV PCA group were placed a catheter in the wound and 0.5% ropivacaine was infused for postoperative 72 hours at a rate of 4ml/hr. Donors in ITM + IV PCA group received morphine sulfate (400ug) and fentanyl IV PCA postoperatively . The visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest and coughing, and IV PCA fentanyl and meperidine consumptions were assessed for 72 hours postoperatively. Side effects including sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pruritis, respiratory depression, wound seroma or hematoma, and bowel recovery time were recorded.</summary>
