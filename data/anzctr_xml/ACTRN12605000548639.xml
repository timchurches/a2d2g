Patches are to be applied to an area of clean hairless skin from 0800 to 2200 daily during the six week trial.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary end point of this study is to see if nitrates in the form of a glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch will improve lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarge prostate). Lower urinary tract symptoms are associated with bladder urine flow obstruction. These symptoms include: slowness to initiate urine flow, poor stream, straining to urinate, dribbling of urine and the feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.</outcome>

      <outcome>To see if there are significant improvements in peak urinary voiding flow rates as measured by uroflowmetry machine.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>You are invited to participate in a study to assess the effectiveness of nitrate patches in decreasing voiding problems and improving urine flow in men who have prostate enlargement. By being involved in this study you will play a very important role in the development of alternative medical treatments for this very common male problem. It will allow better and cheaper ways to relieve the symptoms without the need for surgery. The prostate is a chestnut size gland that lies under the bladder. The tube that urine flows through (the urethra) passes through the prostate. Not uncommonly, the urethra is blocked in older males due to prostate enlargement. This results in troubling voiding symptoms known as lower urinary tract symptoms. These include: - Slowness initiating urine flow. - Poor urine stream. - Straining to urinate. - Dribbling urine especially at the end of voiding. - Feeling the bladder is not completely empty after voiding. - Getting frequent and sudden urges to urinate but only passing small amounts. - Waking up many times at night to pass urine. The enlarged prostate has a muscular component, which contributes to the blockage of urine flow especially when this muscle is tense.</summary>
