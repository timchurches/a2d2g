  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention Arm 1: Du-176b is taken once daily orally - 60mg
Intervention Arm 2: Du-176b is taken once daily orally - 30mg
The overall duration for intervention 1 and 2 is taken once daily orally for approximately 2 years</interventions>
    <comparator>Warfarin - taken orally once daily with dose adjusted to maintain International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 3.0 inclusive. The overall duration the warfarin will be taken is once daily for approximately two years (there are no units of measurement because the number is a ratio)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to compare DU-176b to warfarin with regard to the composite primary endpoint of stroke and Systemic embolic event (SEE).  Each DU-176b regimen will be compared with warfarin for non-inferiority.  Any non-inferior DU-176b regimen will be compared with warfarin for superiority.
Stroke and systemic embolic events will be assessed utilising Hospital and Doctor Records</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years, this is an event driven study so will be assessed every time there is an event utnil the number of required events are collected. This could mean that the study is shorter or longer in duration than 2 years. The number of events needed is 448 events in each of the three study arms.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	To compare DU-176b to warfarin with regard to major bleeding as well as major plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding.
This outcome will be measured as follows:Hospital and or Doctor records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At study end:this is an event driven study so will be assessed every time there is an event utnil the number of required events are collected. This could mean that the study is shorter or longer in duration than 2 years. There will be 448 events collected from each of the three arms of the study</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.	Male or female subjects with age = 21 years;
2.	Able to provide written informed consent;
3.	History of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) documented by a 12-lead electrocardiographic reading and/or continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) (e.g., Holter monitoring) consistent with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) (notation of AF as the abnormal rhythm on the local ECG report with evidence of irregularly irregular rhythm and an absence of P-waves on the ECG for diagnosis of AF) within the prior 12 months and for which anticoagulation therapy is indicated and planned for the duration of the study, including subjects with paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF and subjects with or without previous vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (including warfarin) experience (it is anticipated that approximately 40% of subjects will be VKA-naive);
4.	A moderate to high risk of stroke, as defined by Scoring system Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, previous stroke (CHADS2)  index score of at least 2, is required to be eligible for the study.  The CHADS2 scoring is performed by assigning 1 point each for a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age  75 years, or diabetes mellitus; and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or Trans Ischemic Attack (TIA).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1	Transient AF secondary to other reversible disorders
2	Subjects with moderate or severe mitral stenosis, unresected atrial myxoma, or a mechanical heart valve
3	Subjects with any contraindication for anticoagulant agents;
4	Subjects with conditions associated with high risk of bleeding or  have known or suspected hereditary or acquired bleeding disorders
5	Females of childbearing potential including the following:
    a)Females with a history of 
        tubal-ligation;
     b) Females less than 2 years 
        post-menopausal</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The Investigator will contact the Interactive Voice Randomisation System (IVRS) after assessing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and before the first administration of study drug.  The Investigator should be prepared to provide subject information, including, but not limited to, the following: date of birth, creatinine clearance (CrCL), CHADS2 score, and whether the subject on concomitant verapamil and/or quinidine.  The IVRS will allocate the treatment group assignment for the subject.</concealment>
    <sequence>The specifications for generation of the randomization schedule will be prepared by the study biostatistician and the contract research organization (CRO) in charge of the IVRS.  An independent biostatistician (from the CRO responsible for the IVRS), not otherwise part of the study team, will generate the randomization schedule. This is generated by a computer program</sequence>
