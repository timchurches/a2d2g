  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be a video-based health education package comprised of: 1) health education cartoon: narrative 12 min cartoon video; content: story about a boy who gets infected with Soil-transmitted Helminths (STH) because of unhygienic behaviour. Key messages: a) symptoms of the disease. b) where and how can children get infected. c) how can disease be prevented. 2) A take-home pamphlet with key messages; 3) Classroom discussions; and 4) Drawing and essay competitions for key message reinforcement. 

The cartoon will be shown twice (immediately following each other) in June/July 2016 followed by distribution of the pamphlet and classroom discussions (for 10-15 mins post the viewing by the research team assisted by the child's regular teacher); and then shown twice (immediately following each other) in August/September 2016 followed by classroom discussions (for 10-15 mins post the viewing by the research team assisted by the child's regular teacher) and the drawing and essay competitions. This will take place in the intervention schools.

Albendazole chemotherapy will be administered following the baseline survey in July 2016 in all study schools. Albendazole will also be administered to those found positive at the two follow-up surveys in Feb 2017 and Feb 2018 respectively. The Albendazole regimen will follow standard World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (a single oral dose of 400mg). This will done in concert with the National de-worming program in the Philippines 

Intervetnion and drug delivery will be directly observed and record kept for monitoring purposes

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We estimated a design effect of 1.1 based on our previous study. Sample size calculations were then undertaken for an individually randomized trial and multiplied by the design effect. Assuming an STH incidence of 18% (typical of communities with 50% prevalence) and an intervention efficacy of 33%; the study will have 80% power with a
sample size of 20 intervention clusters (40 in total) and 44 students per cluster at the end of the trial following a predicted annual 10% loss to follow-up (total N = 1760).

Statistical analyses
A hierarchical generalised linear model with school as a random effect will be used for formal analyses of infection and knowledge, and carried out using SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Models will be fitted using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) and a log-binomial distribution used to estimate relative risks and therefore intervention efficacy against infection. Analyses of changes in knowledge and
behaviour scores will use a log-normal distribution, and a timeintervention interaction to estimate differential change over time. Potential confounders such as age and sex will be incorporated. Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to estimate correlations among behaviour, knowledge, and incidence.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our central thesis is that a video-based health educational package, developed by our group, targeting schoolchildren, can influence their behaviour in a way conducive to the prevention of parasitic worm infections, thereby playing a pivotal role in the sustainable control and prevention of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) globally. An extensive
school-based field trial targeting Chinese schoolchildren undertaken by our multidisciplinary team in Hunan province, China established proof of principle that our video-based health educational package widens student knowledge and changes behaviour, resulting in fewer STH infections. To evaluate the potential for up-scaling of our video-based health educational
package as a universal school-focused educational tool forming part of multi-component sustainable integrated NTD control programs, we wish to assess the generalisability of our findings in different countries. This will provide an evidence base for translation of the package into public health policy and practice in the Asian region and beyond.

We will test the hypothesis that: A video-based health educational package (for use in schools) targeting STH increases student knowledge of the worms, their transmission, symptoms, treatment and prevention, and changes hygiene behaviour, thus preventing infections in children in diverse ethnic and endemic settings.

We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aim:
To determine if the video-based health educational package (for use in schools) is effective in preventing STH infection in schoolchildren in Laguna, Philippines.</summary>
