    <statisticalmethods>A total sample size of 1080 participants from 10 hospitals, with on average 27 women recruited per time period in each hospital over 4 study periods of six month (T1-T4), will provide 90% power at 5% level of significance (two-sided) to detect a treatment difference of 6% in the proportion of LGA babies, from 13% using the current target to 7% using the tighter targets, assuming an intra-cluster correlation co-efficient of 0.05.  
Baseline characteristics of all randomised women will be summarized descriptively by the two time periods, control and intervention period, to assess comparability of groups. Data points in the control section wedge - Less Tight Target Period -will be compared with data points in the intervention section -Tighter Target Period - to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. 
Treatment evaluations will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Imputation method will be applied to the primary outcome with any missing data. Statistical tests will be two-sided and maintained at 5% level of significance. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to evaluate the main treatment effect, with a random effect for hospital group and fixed effects for the intervention implementation and the study time period. 
Secondary exploratory analyses will consider baseline covariates that show evidence of imbalance between study groups and are related to the outcome of interest. The risk estimates and 95% CIs will be reported using log binomial regression for binary outcomes. Continuous outcomes will be analysed using linear regression. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a significant health problem affecting one in every 12 pregnant women or over 5,200 women in New Zealand annually. GDM has a major, negative impact on maternal and perinatal health with lifelong consequences. It is unclear what intensity of glycaemic control during GDM treatment is best for mother and infant. 
The TARGET randomised Trial will evaluate the implementation of tighter treatment targets for blood sugar control compared with less stringent targets in women with GDM. We will compare the risk of the infant being born large for gestational age, which is strongly associated with significant early life and later health problems. Other relevant outcomes will be assessed. This trial will allow for the sequential implementation of the new, nationally recommended tighter treatment targets for women with GDM and, establish if there are true benefits, without harm, to tighter treatment targets.
