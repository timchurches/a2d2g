  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and
      genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity
      and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes
      away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead
      in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by
      HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy of GSK Biologicals HPV 16/18 VLP/AS04 vaccine to prevent infection associated
      cervical pre-cancer and vaccine with HPV 16 or 18 and the vaccine safety, over 48 months, in
      young adolescents and women of 15/25 years of age at study start. Approximately 18.000 study
      subjects will either receive the HPV vaccine or a control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine)
      administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.</summary>
