  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention condition takes the form of a smartphone application (app) called Headgear. Headgear is designed for self-directed use by an individual on a smartphone device.  The application features interactive content, delivered on-screen and by audio using text, static and interactive image displays and videos.  The app software is compatible with both Apple and Android operating systems and available for download online via the users respective app store (iTunes or Google Play) or the Trial website.  The application can be accessed by the participant on their smartphone /mobile phone at a time and location of their choosing.  The app monitors usage data including time (amount of time spent in-app) and frequency of use, number of log-ins and 'challenge' completion rates.  This data will be used to examine program engagement.  Participants will have access to the application indefinitely.  The intervention application is designed around a 30-day timeframe. However, the active phase of this trial during which the experimental  condition will be delivered and monitored is 30 days from baseline, with follow-up assessments at 5-weeks post-baseline, 3 months and 12 months.

The intervention, HeadGear, is a smartphone application (app)-based intervention centered on behavioural activation and mindfulness therapy. The main therapeutic component of the HeadGear app takes the form of a 30-day challenge in which users complete one challenge daily (approximately 5-10 minutes per day, for 30 days). These challenges include: psychoeducational videos on coping skills/resiliency, mindfulness, and behavioural activation; mindfulness exercises; value-driven activity planning, goal-setting, and review; and coping skill development (problem solving, sleep, grounding, alcohol use, assertiveness, and training in adaptive forms of coping). 

The first daily challenge will involve the completion of a risk calculator, which will assess and provide participants with personalised feedback regarding their risk for future mental health issues. The risk calculator consists of 20 items developed from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA) derived risk algorithm.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Attention-matched control condition:  
The attention-matched control condition, HeadGear lite, is a simplified version of the same application used in the intervention condition, and is designed to control for time spent interacting with an application.  This lite application features daily mood monitoring for 30 days, instead of the 30-day challenge component, it does also include the risk calculator, which will assess and provide participants with personalised feedback regarding their risk for future mental health issues. The risk calculator consists of 20 items developed from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (HILDA) derived risk algorithm. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome will look for a difference in depression symptomatology (using the PHQ-9 score) between the intervention and control group. Linear mixed models will be employed to analyse the effect of intervention on the PHQ-9 scale, adjusted for potential confounders risk score (high/med/low), baseline score, and allowing a random effect for employer. After review of Headgear pilot data, the effect size was estimated to be 0.35. This effect size was entered into the statistical program R (R Core Team (2013). Power was set at 80% and conservative 2-tailed tests were assumed even though a directional hypothesis is proposed. Based on this testing a sample size of 266 per group was needed (total N = 532). A conservative dropout rate of 40% at follow-up was estimated, which increased the sample required to be 851 participants.
Analysis plan:
Data coding and analysis will be carried out by the authors using available software packages including STATA version 12.0 and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Data on screening, refusals, and dropout are coded and reported as per CONSORT. Primary analyses will be undertaken on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, including data for all participants who were randomised and completed risk assessment, irrespective of their level of adherence to the intervention or whether they withdrew at any point in time. Categorical and continuous measures of outcome will be examined using mixed or marginal longitudinal models (i.e., mixed model repeated measures, generalised estimating equation modelling) as appropriate. A completers analysis on all participants completing at least 75% of the intervention will be undertaken as a secondary analysis. Transformations, including dichotomisation or other categorisation, will be undertaken as necessary to meet distributional assumptions and to accommodate outlying observations. The potential effects of a number of covariates and confounders will be modelled in the major analyses. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our research team has recently been awarded an Australian Mental Health Award by Beyondblue and the Movember Foundation that will fund a program of research aimed at developing and evaluating a range of new e-health interventions for Australian Workers.. This is intended to cover the evaluation via a multisite randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a smartphone intervention aimed at promoting mental health and well-being. Specifically, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone application (app) designed to treat depression in workers, with an intervention condition (HeadGear app) and attention-matched control condition (HeadGear lite app). Specifically, the relative efficacy of the application as a tool for treatment of common mental disorders will be evaluated. 
All employees of several partner organisations will be invited to participate, and directed to their app store via advertisements or via visiting the trial website. Upon downloading the app, participants will undergo initial screening, provide informed consent, and complete baseline assessments of outcomes including: depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (PHQ-2) symptomatology, wellbeing (WHO-5 Well-being Index), Overall health (SF-12), resilience (CD-RISC 10) and work performance (HPQ). Participants scoring below 14 or not meeting diagnostic criteria on the PHQ-9 on the PHQ-9 at baseline will be excluded from this trial. Eligible users will then be randomised to receive either the intervention HeadGear application or the attention-matched control version of the app (users will also be provided with appropriate referral information to health services and crisis lines, and will be encouraged to seek help from their GP).
Participants are encouraged to use the smartphone application for 30 days. Post-intervention assessment will occur at 5 weeks post-baseline, and 3 and 12 months later at follow-up, with measures similar to those assessed at baseline. All assessment (apart from diagnostic interviews) will be completed online. Individuals whose results indicate depressive symptomatology or diagnosis (via PHQ-9); and a random sample of 5% of participants at 3 months, will receive a follow-up diagnostic telephone calls from trial staff. Project researchers will be evaluating the relative impact of the smartphone application intervention on the treatment of common mental disorders, primarily depression, and its effects on health and well-being outcomes, immediately after trial participation, and 3 and 12 months later.</summary>
