  <interventions>
    <interventions>SmartHeart Living Well with Heart Failure service aims to improve the quality of lives of HF patients and reduce hospital admissions by providing patients with community-based clinical support. The service commenced at Curtin University, through its Interprofessional Health and Wellness Clinics, in April 2013. The SmartHeart program is  led by a nurse practitioner who provides monitoring for HF patients through comprehensive patient assessment, regular liaison with General Practitioners, medical specialists or local service providers, coaching in self-management strategies and healthy lifestyle behaviours including individualized educational plan including dietary advice and weight monitoring. Nurses will also assist patients to access community related services including psychological support and exercise programs. Participants consult with nurse practitioner whenever necessary. Participants are required to attend once off meeting with data collector (principal investigator) that will be one-to one and the meeting will be less than 60 minutes. The purpose of the study and the details of the 3 questionnaires (SCHFI, MLWHFQ, SF 36) will to be explain to the participants and the participants are required to answer the 3 questionnaires.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics (percentage, mean, and standard deviation) will be used to portray characteristics of the experimental group (receiving community-based HF management) and control group according to demographic and clinical information. Categorized variables will include ethnicity, education, occupational status, socioeconomic status, social support, HF severity and comorbidities. A comparison of baseline characteristics of participants enrolling in the intervention versus the control group will be undertaken using independent T-tests. 
A mixed model analysis of self-care behaviours at 6-12 months post HF admission is proposed. This will use admitting hospital as a covariate. The treatment effect estimate will be the difference between participants and controls at 6-12 months, adjusting for admitting hospital so any imbalance between groups will be minimized. If there are demographic or clinical factors that are imbalanced between groups and highly associated with outcome, these will also be included in the model.  

Independent sample t-test will be used to test for significant differences in HF self-care behaviors and measures of quality of life between participants in the experimental and control groups. Pearson r correlation coefficient will be used to determine the relationship between the provision or community-based HF management, and other variables, with self-care behaviours and quality of life. 

Sample size calculation:
Based on previous HF study, to detect a 12-point difference in physical function on the Short Form-36 with standard deviation of 20 points, it is estimated a sample size of 59 per group is needed with a 2-sided 5% significance level and 90% power. When taking into account a loss of to follow up of 10%, 130 participants (65 per group) will be required.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart failure is a disorder where right or left ventricular function is affected and the heart fails to pump blood efficiently around the body. The purpose of this study is to identify whether a nurse-led, community based heart failure management service (SmartHeart) improves self-management and quality of life. Participants in the study will be patients with a recent hospital admission due to heart failure as a primary or secondary diagnosis who are less than 85 years of age. The experimental group will compromise patients who are admitted to a tertiary hospital with links to a community-based heart failure management service and subsequently referred to that service. The control group will be comprised of a similar cohort of patients, matched for gender, age and functional class who are admitted to a different tertiary hospital without links to a community-based heart failure management service. The Self-Care Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) will be utilized to measure self-management behaviours and self-efficacy. Quality of life will be determined using the Short Form 36 and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire.  The findings from this study will help guide evidence-based practice for nurse-led management of heart failure in the sub-acute period.
