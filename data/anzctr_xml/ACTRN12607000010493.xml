  <interventions>
    <interventions>All referring health care professionals (GPs and maternal and child health (MCH)nurses) are trained for 6 hours to identify and refer pregnant and recent mothers at risk of partner violence. They are subsequently randomised by cluster (GP clinic or MCH nurse team). 
Women in the intervention arm are offered the weekly visit, outing or phone call support of a mentor mother for up to twelve months. We aim for 1-2 hour contact. 
MOSAIC mentors are community mothers trained initially for five days in domestic violence advocacy, support for depressed mothers, parenting support and other empowerment strategies. This supportive friendship is regularly supervised in groups and individually by MOSAIC coordination staff. Mentors are offered regular upskilling opportunities.                                           Research staff give all referred women a handout which includes family violence services.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>MOSAIC is a community randomised trial which examines whether mentor mothers can reduce partner abuse and depression, and strengthen health, wellbeing and mother-child bonds in women who are pregnant or have children under 5, attending upskilled and supported Maternal and Child Health (MCH) nurses or GPs. Mentor mothers (MMs) are para-professional trusted community women with additional training in domestic violence and parenting skills, who provide home-visiting, empowerment, advocacy and support to women pregnant or with children under 5, identified as abused or symptomatic of abuse by their GP or nurse.
AIMS: The studys primary aims are:
 to reduce partner abuse or depression by 16% among women pregnant or with children under 5 whom GPs or MCH nurses identify as abused or at risk
 Its secondary aims are:
 to strengthen infrastructure support for GP and nurse management of partner abuse, by enhancing effective inter-sectoral collaboration between general practice, MCH nurse teams and community-based family violence networks 
 to enhance health professional case management of family members living with partner abuse</summary>
