  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Nurse coordinated evidence based quarterly follow up of participants in the community, in a shared care relationship between hospital based stroke specialists and community based primary care physicians. Each quarterly intervention includes a pre-visit semi structured telephone interview to assess risk factors and post stroke depression. Based on the pre-visit interview, a report is faxed to the Gp prior to the patient visit. The patient and Gp meet and complete an individualised risk factor worksheet including relevant diagnostic tests. The completed worksheet is returned to the coordinating hospital to facilitate potential shared care. Therefore, coordinated visits to the patients Gp in the first year following the index stroke. 
2. Simultaneously, over the period of 1-year, participants receive risk stratified telemedicine follow-up from the nurse coordinator that includes, education and support. As calculated by a study specific risk calculation algorithm, risk is assigned as high, medium or low. High risk participants are exposed to a greater frequency of telephone follow-up i.e., weekly for 3 months, 3-weekly for 3-months and monthly for 6-months. Low risk participants receive monthly telephone calls. The frequency may be modified according to changes in individual patient needs. Components of telephone calls include a range of established behavioral modification strategies to target health related lifestyle modification, plus health education, carer support, medication compliance and the potential for referral for specialist support.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment or usual care. Participants are discharged to ongoing management by their Gp in the community, without nurse and specialist support as outlined above. Participant outcomes are followed-up at 1-year following the index stroke event.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A significant reduction in the intervention group for the composite endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction and death. Data will be collected at outcome patient interview and through review of health records.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Risk factor management by general practitioners. We will compare the achievement of international recommendations for conventional quantifiable stroke risk factor management in the two groups i.e. hypertension, cholesterol level, diabetic state, atrial fibrillation, degree of anti-coagulation and smoking. Diagnostic results will be collected at 1-year from both control and intervention Gp's records and through outcome participant interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year post index event</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Management of stroke survivors in the community. We will generate the scores from a series of structured assessments on functional status (Modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Social Functioning Examination), cognitive and speech ability (Modified Mini Mental State Examination, Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test), depression (Person Health Questionnaire-9), quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life), as well as consumer and practitioner satisfaction and access to services in the community via study specific data collection tools.</outcome>

    <concealment>Stroke patients admitted to stroke units of metropolitan hospitals will be screened for eligibility, then approached to provide informed consent for a period up to 3-months from the index event. The stroke coordinator will identify the patients General Practitioner (Gp) and assign the Gp a study specific number. This number will be used to randomise the Gp and patient to either intervention or control group using an independent voice randomisation service (IVRS). Only Gp's randomised to the intervention will be contacted by study staff.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be stratified by centre (Gp) using a small block design to avoid unbalancing the sample.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke survivors can be faced with many problems including the physical disability resulting from the stroke, interruption and often cessation of gainful employment, disruption to family life and the onset of post stroke depression. Stroke survivors are also at a much higher risk of experiencing further stroke. Effective management of stroke risk factors including, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, excessive alcohol intake and obesity, can significantly reduce the likelihood of a recurrent stroke. However, there remains a considerable gap between published and evidence-based guidelines for stroke prevention and the reality of care received by stroke survivors.

The Integrated CAre for the RedUction of Secondary Stroke Project (ICARUSS) is an integrated, multi-modal model of care for the management of risk factors in stroke survivors that was developed from a shared care model. Its goal is to reduce mortality and disability by reducing the recurrence of stroke. Initial results of a pilot study suggest that it is practical, feasible and of great importance to stroke survivors, there carers, and the community in general. The model is now being tested on a broader scale throughout Australia.</summary>
