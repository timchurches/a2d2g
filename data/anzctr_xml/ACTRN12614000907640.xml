  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depressive disorders in adolescents are common, disabling and at times life-threatening conditions. Safe and effective biological treatments are few. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive intervention, in which a potent and brief magnetic pulse is generated by an external coil applied to the scalp. rTMS has a remission rate when used in depressed adults of 30% to 40%.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rTMS for use in depressed adults in 2008. 

While rTMS has been shown to be safe and effective in adults, there is very limited information about the safety or efficacy of rTMS in depressed adolescents. 

This is a pilot study to explore the safety and effectiveness in the use of rTMS for adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder.  In the proposed study, we will investigate the relative efficacy of low frequency right-sided rTMS compared with high frequency left-sided rTMS for depressed adolescents. It is hypothesized that left-sided high frequency TMS and right-sided low-frequency TMS will be of similar therapeutic benefit in the treatment of adolescent patients with Major Depressive Disorder.  It is believed that there will be minimal side effects with overall benefits in depressive and anxiety symptoms.

The study will involve 40 adolescent participants with MDD diagnosed by a trained clinician. The 40 participants will be randomly allocated to one of either low frequency right-sided rTMS (20 subjects) or high frequency left-sided rTMS (20 subjects).  Both groups of subjects will receive daily treatment for 5 days per week, over 4 weeks (20 sessions) with the respective treatment. 

Following initial treatment, responders to this will be followed up following treatment and one month after the end of treatment with Children Rating Scale Revised.
