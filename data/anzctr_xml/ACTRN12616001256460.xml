  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive a weekly video email of the treatment program (Dr Stapleton who is a clinical and health psychologist with 22 years experience) which will teach the treatment process (which is the EFT technique) via pre-recorded video for that week (it is self paced for 8 weeks). Weekly handouts and email support from the lead researchers will also be supplied. Therefore the program will be: an online education intervention which is self-guided, but with human-support.  Video software will monitor how often participants watch the videos, and the pace at which they move through the program.  A few brief questions will be asked as multiple choice questions at the end of each video, taken directly from that video, before a person can progress to the next one. This is to ensure skipping ahead cannot occur.

Each person will commit to 1 hour of the video intervention (which is the EFT being demonstrated) per week (to watch it) and a further 20-30 minutes at the beginning, end and followup points to complete the questionnaires.

The topics which will be covered in the 8-weeks include: Psycho-education about the treatment and how it works; The nature of food cravings and how they are cognitively formed; Feelings and Food; Cognitive restructuring; Stress and relaxation training; Goal setting; Good nutrition; and Relapse prevention.

The technique is EFT - or Emotional Freedom Techniques. EFT  is a brief novel intervention combining elements of exposure and cognitive therapy, and somatic stimulation. It is often referred to as psychological acupuncture and uses a two finger tapping process with a cognitive statement.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research combining imaginal exposure and cognitive procedures, with the manual stimulation of acupuncture points  (e.g. Emotional Freedom Techniques [EFT]) for food cravings in overweight/obese adults has revealed significant improvements in weight, Body Mass Index, food cravings, subjective power of food, craving restraint and psychological coping for participants from pre- to 12-months after an 8-week treatment, and . These treatments are typically delivered in person, in a group format, so participants must attend in person. This study will investigate the delivery of the same 8-week treatment program for food cravings in overweight/obese adults, but via online delivery. Participants will receive a weekly video email of the treatment program (Dr Stapleton) which will teach the treatment process via pre-recorded video for that week. Weekly handouts and email support form the lead researchers will also be supplied. Web-based technologies offer enormous potential for increasing members of the publics access to evidence-based health and wellbeing services, as well as offering psychologists increased choice and flexibility in delivering services to populations where previous access has been poor. Therefore the program will be: an email-based education intervention which is self-guided, but with human-support.The broadest and most comprehensive meta-analytic study of the efficacy of internet supported therapeutic interventions has revealed moderate to large effect sizes in targeted cognitions, emotions and/or behaviours (Barak, Hen, Boniel-Nissim, &amp; Shapira, 2008). </summary>
