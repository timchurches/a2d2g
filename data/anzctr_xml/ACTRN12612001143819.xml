  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be switched to citrate-based dialysate (intervention) in a cross-over fashion. The dialysate will be applied six times (thrice weekly for two weeks), patients are exposed to the dialysate for 4 hours each time. Neither base (citrate or acetate) is administered directly to the patient (dialysate is separated from the bloodstream by dialysis membrane), which makes it impossible to define the dose. That's also why it should not be considered drug intervention. Citrate concentration in dialysate is 2.4 mmol/l.</interventions>
    <comparator>Acetate-based dialysate will be used as control treatment. The dialysate will be applied six times (thrice weekly for two weeks), patients are exposed to the dialysate for 4 hours each time. Acetate concentration in dialysate is 3.0 mmol/l.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hemodialyzer biocompatibility in terms of biofilm (secondary membrane) quantity and quality (protein composition) may depend on dialysate formula. Specifically, citrate instead of acetate might reduce the amount of protein adsorbed to dialysis membrane, stable fibrin formation as well as complement binding, and explain higher filter permeability (clearance) previously observed with citrate-based dialysate. Acetic elution of dialyzer will be performed at the end of dialysis session in a cross-over fashion (first with acetate, then with citrate), eluate protein content ascertained and factors of coagulation and complement evaluated</summary>
