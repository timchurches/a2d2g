  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Interventions include two components: 

(1)	Community-based Newcastle disease control programs 
Members of participating communities, selected in consultation with local leaders, will participate in a three-day theoretical and practical training workshop to prepare them to work as community poultry vaccinators. Workshops will be led by government personnel, with tertiary qualifications in animal health and production, and experience in the training program in question and in approaches to adult learning who have participated in initial master trainer workshops led by USyd veterinary personnel. The thermotolerant I-2 Newcastle disease vaccine (produced by Tanzania Vaccine Institute in Tanzania and Central Veterinary Research Institute in Zambia) will be administered to chickens via eyedrop on a fee-for-service basis, during vaccination campaigns conducted every four months. 

(2)	Strategic interventions to improve crop production and reduce crop losses 
Analysis of existing farming systems and participatory discussions with community members will inform a series of crop interventions within each project cluster, according to identified constraints to agricultural production. Interventions such as improved seed varieties and crop diversity, storage methods and cultivation and weeding practices will be demonstrated in centralised farming plots, presented during training workshops and made available to community members.  One two-day training workshops will be held in each project cluster, led by government agricultural officers, with involvement of local agricultural extensionists. 

No intervention will be applied to humans.

Communities will be randomised to receive or not receive village chicken ND vaccination campaigns in the first year and a crop intervention in the second year. For ethical and logistical reasons interventions will be offered to control (delayed intervention) communities after a delay of 12 months. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Delayed intervention. 
There will be a 12 month delay between intervention and delayed intervention clusters.

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Twenty communities (clusters) from Tanzania (12) and Zambia (8) have been identified in collaboration with partner agencies in each country. Enrolment of participants is performed prior to allocation of clusters as immediate or delayed intervention. 

A community-wide census is conducted door-to-door in each cluster to generate lists of children (a) under 12 months of age and (b) 12-24 months of age, from households which meet criteria for inclusion in the study (i.e. from households which currently keep chickens or which have kept chickens in the previous 2 years and intend to keep chickens again in the future, and which intend to reside within the project site for the duration of the study). Random sampling (drawing eligible participant codes “from a hat”) is used to select participants, first drawing from the list of children under 12 months, and then, if numbers are insufficient, from the list of children 12-24 months.

Four communities (clusters) served by the same health facility were recruited and identified as belonging to the same stratum. Within each of these five strata, names of the clusters  are drawn at random, in the presence of local leaders and other representatives, to allocate two communities as immediate intervention and two communities as delayed intervention. </concealment>
    <sequence>The project design involves 20 communities (clusters), stratified in groupings of four communities which are served by the same health facility.  In each group of four, randomisation (drawing cluster codes “from a hat”) will be used to allocate two communities into immediate intervention and two into delayed intervention groups.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Communities will be allocated as immediate intervention or delayed intervention (12 month delay) within the stratifications (groupings of four communities served by a single health centre). The project involves staggered entry of clusters, with all clusters receiving both of the intervention components during the study.

(1)	Community-based Newcastle disease control programs 
Members of participating communities, selected in consultation with local leaders, will participate in a three-day theoretical and practical training workshop to prepare them to work as community poultry vaccinators. The thermotolerant I-2 Newcastle disease vaccine (produced by Tanzania Vaccine Institute in Tanzania and Central Veterinary Research Institute in Zambia) will be administered to chickens via eyedrop on a fee-for-service basis, during vaccination campaigns conducted every four months. 

(2)	Strategic interventions to improve crop production and reduce crop losses 
Analysis of existing farming systems and participatory workshops with community members will inform a series of crop interventions within each project cluster, according to identified constraints to agricultural production. Interventions such as improved seed varieties and crop diversity, storage methods and cultivation and weeding practices will be demonstrated in centralised farming plots and made available to community members.

No intervention will be applied to humans.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In each of the 20 communities, at least 60 children under 2 years of age and their mothers will be enrolled in the first year of implementation. The sample size calculation was based on an estimated baseline stunting rate of 35% with an aim of reducing this to 25% by the end of the project,  i.e. a 10% reduction, giving 80% power to detect this difference as significant at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.014. 
The primary analysis will be a comparison of stunting rates between the 10 communities receiving immediate ND vaccination and the 10 communities receiving the delayed intervention. Stunting is defined as height-for-age more than 2 standard deviations below the WHO child growth standard median. 

Secondary analyses will compare height-for-age and prevalence of stunting between children in households in intervention communities and those in delayed intervention communities, taking into account clustering within communities and adjusting for the following potential confounders using multi-level modelling: birth weight, breastfeeding, diet, infection episodes, household wealth and mothers education level.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite increases in agricultural production over the past two decades, malnutrition rates in children have not diminished significantly in many developing countries. Undernutrition affects health, physical and cognitive development capacity in children as well as productivity in adulthood. Recent reviews indicate that agricultural research interventions have had little impact on childhood nutrition, with poor research project design being a contributing factor to this disappointing outcome. 

Food and nutrition security are particularly crucial in Tanzania and Zambia where the national prevalence of stunting (chronic restriction of growth) in children under five years of age has been estimated to be 42% and 45%, respectively. Sustainably addressing the nutrition component of food security in Tanzania and Zambia is critical and was raised as a priority by senior government personnel in both countries. Also, as research indicates that resources under the control of women are more likely to be used to support the education and nutrition of children, we are testing if improving womens production of family poultry and crops can have a beneficial impact on childrens overall nutritional status and health. 

We aim to enhance traditional village chicken-crop systems as a sustainable solution to the ongoing nutritional challenges in Africa. Rural communities that rely on rain fed crops often go through severe hunger periods just prior to the major harvesting season when their stored grains have been exhausted. These significant peaks and troughs in household food availability are reduced when there is diversity in family farming activities. By improving village poultry health and welfare, families have greater access to poultry meat and eggs which are a source of high quality protein, bioavailable micronutrients and income. Poultry manure can also contribute to increased soil fertility for the production of indigenous vegetables at the household level, further diversifying the range of foods eaten.</summary>
