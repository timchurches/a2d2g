  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group based self management behavioral  lifestyle intervention. A total of four group sessions, 3 consecutive weekly 1 hour group sessions plus a review session at 4 months that focus on goal setting, self monitoring, problem solving skills and action plans. Diet advice included simple evidence based diet messages to reduce energy density. Physical activity advice was simple physical activity messages focusing on walking. Participants were provided with a pedometer and encouraged to walk in groups. On-going support is provided by monthly phone, email or mail contact based on the behavior, physical actvity and diet content of the group sessions over 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single group 40 min education session based on population guidelines. The group was provided with a pedometer but no ideal step count or support.</comparator>

    <concealment>Identify all primary schools within one local government area. Randomise schools to intervention or control using computer generated numbers. Recruited women are allocated to intervention or control as a school cluster to avoid contamination. Research team is aware of allocation as they are implementing intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Schools are paired with a school of similar size based on enrollment numbers. Random numbers were generated in Excell software and listed against the schools. The largest number of each pair allocated to intervention the smaller number to control</sequence>
