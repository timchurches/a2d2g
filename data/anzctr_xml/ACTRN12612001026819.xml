  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will be treated with oral propranolol, 40 mg thrice daily for 28 days. In patients in whom a satisfactory reduction in portal venous hypertension is not achieved at this time point, propranolol will be continued at unchanged dose and oral rifaximin, 550 mg twice daily will be added for 28 days.  Patients in whom propranolol is either contraindicated or not tolerated will be treated with oral rifaximin monotherapy, 550 mg twice daily for 28 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Results in individual patients after intervention with propranolol, propranolol + rifaximin or rifaximin alone (as described above) will be compared to results in individual patients prior to intervention (standard care). Patients thus act as their own control. There is no placebo-treted group in this study.</comparator>

Patients will receive current standard of care, including oral propranolol 40 mg thrice daily. If therapeutic response is suboptimal (as described above), oral rifaximin will be added.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Measurement of the hepatic venous pressure gradient is performed in patients with cirrhosis to assess for portal hypertension and monitor effectiveness of portal venous pressure-lowering therapies. These include treatment with the non-selective beta-blocker, propranolol, while the broad-spectrum antibiotic, rifaximin, has also been shown to be effective.

Whether these treatments to reduce portal venous hypertension in patients with cirrhosis are also associated with reduced bacterial translocation from the intestine and whether reduced bacterial translocation, in turn, results in amelioration of liver dameg are currently unknown.

The aim of this study is to meaure markers of bacterial translocation and liver damage in patients with portal venous hypertension complicating cirrhosis who are undergoing hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement at baseline and after four weeks of propranolol therapy. Should the portal venous pressure not be improved satisfactorily after treatment with propranolol alone, then rifaximin will be added and the portal venous pressure and markers of bacterial translocation and liver damage will be reassessed after a further 28 days. Patients intolerant of or with contraindications to propranolol will be studied at baseline and after 28 days of rifaximin monotherapy.</summary>
