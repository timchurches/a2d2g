  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single case conference of 30-40 minutes between General practitioner, palliative care physician and specialist nurse to develop a care plan for persons with life limiting heart or lung disease. Case conference provides a comprehensive review of the case from a palliative care perspective, including symptom control, psychosocial issues for patient and carer, advance care planning and service delivery, with an emphasis on care coordination between specialist and community based care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Normal care- specialist medical services focusing on maximising function, general practitioner providing day to day care but not in close liaison with specialists, and nurses providing case management at home, and palliative care not involved at all

Control data: Hospital and GP Records search for service utilisation. Time period is up to 12 months prior to the case conference, compared with up to twelve months, or to death, post case conference. Post case conference records searched for evidence of compliance with recommendations from case conference.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With the ageing of the population, the number of people entering the last stages of life will increase rapidly in the coming few years. Most people will die of progressive, non-malignant disease and most will never be reviewed by a specialist palliative care team, in spite of the intensity of many peoples' needs  being equivalent to those dying of cancer. 
This study aims to improve the care of people dying of non-malignant disease, by conducting a case conference between the patient's GP, their specialist heart failure or lung health nurse, and a palliative care specialist. The purpose is to conduct a comprehensive case review, and develop a clear care plan with clear allocation of tasks. We will compare service utilisation after the conference with that of the previous 12 months, patient outcomes, carer outcomes, and a health economic analysis. This project is a pilot and will lead to a formal randomised controlled trial.</summary>
