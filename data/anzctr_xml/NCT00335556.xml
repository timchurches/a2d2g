    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Doxorubicin Hydrochloride
Treatment: drugs - Irinotecan Hydrochloride
Treatment: surgery - Conventional Surgery
Treatment: drugs - Cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - Etoposide
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Other interventions - Dactinomycin
Treatment: drugs - Vincristine Sulfate
Treatment: other - Radiation Therapy
Other interventions - Laboratory Biomarker Analysis

Experimental: Surgery - Patients with completely resectable stage I-IV RCC undergo surgical resection. Patients with incompletely resectable stage III-IV RCC undergo treatment as per physician's choice.

Experimental: Treatment (UH-1) - Patients receive combination chemotherapy comprising vincristine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 4-5Â½ weeks beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy beginning on day 1 in week 13. If the primary tumor was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week 13. Patients with unresectable clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) receive no further study therapy.

Experimental: Treatment (window/UH-1) - Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and 8-12 (course 1). Patients with progressive disease (PD) are treated with regimen UH-1. Patients with stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) receive another course of irinotecan hydrochloride/vincristine window therapy beginning on day 22. After the second course, patients with SD or PD are treated with regimen UH-1 and patients with PR or CR are treated with regimen UH-2.

Experimental: Treatment (UH-2) - Patients receive combination chemotherapy comprising vincristine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carboplatin, and irinotecan hydrochloride. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 7. If the primary tumor was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week 7.

Experimental: Treatment (regimen I) - Patients receive vincristine, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected (except those with stage I CCSK) undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 13. If the primary tumor was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week 13.

Experimental: Treatment (regimen DD-4A) - Patients receive dactinomycin, vincristine, and doxorubicin hydrochloride. Patients whose primary tumors were initially resected undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 1. Patients with delayed primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy as in regimen UH-1 beginning on day 1 in week 13. If the primary tumor was not previously resected, patients undergo resection, if feasible, in week 13.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or
      surgery work in treating patients with high-risk kidney tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving
      combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.</summary>
