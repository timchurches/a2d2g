  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: There is growing interest in the potential role of
anti-inflammatory n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3
PUFAs) in the prevention of allergic disease.
Objective:We sought to determine whether maternal dietary
supplementation with n-3 PUFAs during pregnancy could
modify immune responses in infants.
Methods: In a randomized, controlled trial 98 atopic, pregnant
women received fish oil (3.7 g n-3 PUFAs per day) or placebo
from 20 weeks gestation until delivery. Neonatal PUFA levels
and immunologic response to allergens were measured at birth.
Results: Eighty-three women completed the study. Fish oil
supplementation (n = 40) achieved significantly higher proportions of n-3 PUFAs in neonatal erythrocyte membranes (mean ± SD, 17.75% ± 1.85% as a percentage of total fatty acids) compared with the control group (n = 43, 13.69% ± 1.22%, P &lt; .001). All neonatal cytokine (IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, and IFN-g) responses (to all allergens) tended to be lower in the fish oil group (statistically significant only for IL-10 in response to
cat). Although this study was not designed to examine clinical
effects, we noted that infants in the fish oil group were 3 times
less likely to have a positive skin prick test to egg at 1 year of
age (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 1.02; P
= .055). Although there was no difference in the frequency of
atopic dermatitis at 1 year of age, infants in the fish oil group
also had significantly less severe disease (odds ratio, 0.09; 95%
confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.94; P = .045).
Conclusions: These data suggest a potential reduction in subsequent infant allergy after maternal PUFA supplementation.
More detailed follow-up studies are required in larger cohorts
to establish the robustness of these findings and to ascertain
their significance in relation to longer-term modification of
allergic disease in children.</summary>
