  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the incidence and frequency of adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of ARC-520 - The incidence and frequency of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), related AEs, related SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal, dose modification, or treatment discontinuation will be summarized by dose and treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ARC-520 at different dose concentrations - Plasma concentrations following a single dose of ARC-520 at different dose levels will be used to calculate the following ARC-520 pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24, AUCinf, and t1/2. Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters will include mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation.</outcome>
