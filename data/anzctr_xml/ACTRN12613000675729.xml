  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT): Children and at least one parent will receive 1 x 1hr face-to-face group session per week of CBT for 8 weeks. CBT will include psychoeducation, exposure, cognitive challenging, activity pacing and problem solving. Parents will also be coached in strategies to encourage independence in their children.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator or control treatment is a wait-list with treatment as usual. The children will be ofference the intervention after an equivalent period of time as the intervention (i.e. 8 weeks). 

Treatment as usual is defined as the children are able to seek treatment as usual.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Assessments will be conducted by two researchers (JD and GE). The participant will be given a participant number. A list of participant numbers will be made in advance and linked to a set of random numbers (1= treatment; 2 = wait-list) generated by randomizer.org. The randomization schedule will be held by the chief investigator who will not have had any direct contact with the children. The randomization schedule will remain concealed until allocation. Once the children complete the baseline assessment, the randomization code will be broken for that participant and they will be informed of the group to which they have been allocated. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the relationship between anxiety and asthma. Children and their parents will complete assessments about their illness, anxiety and two experimental tasks as part of an assessment for treatment. Children and their parents will then be randomized to an eight session cognitive behavioural treatment (CBT) targeting anxiety amongst children with asthma and their parents. Following treatment, children will again complete the same assessments as prior to intervention. This project will be the first to evaluate the efficacy of CBT developed specifically for dealing with anxiety in children with asthma. </summary>
