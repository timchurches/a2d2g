  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will compare the short term bioavailability of 3 delivery systems containing omega-3 oils. They are (1) gel capsules versus (2) MicroMAX 1 powder  formulated with milk protein-sugar versus (3) MicroMAX powder - formulated with milk protein-sugar-resistant starch) when combined with a flavoured milk in individuals. Bioavailability will be assessed by measurement of EPA &amp; DHA in blood/plasma.

This is a crossover design study in which all participants will receive the three treatments with a washout period of 6 weeks between each treatment.  

To investigate the bioavailability of a single dose of omega-3 oils delivered via the three above mentioned formats over 48 hrs.  The two different MicroMAX powders  (one formulated with milk protein-sugar and other milk protein-sugar-resistant starch) will each be provided as an 8g serve containing a dose of 500mg/g omega-3 oil.  The gel capsules will be given as a one-off dose of 4 capsules (each capsule will contain 1000mg of omega-3 oil).</interventions>
    <comparator>Being a bioavailabilty study the comparison to commonly available gel capsules will be considered the bench mark or comparator treatment to the 2 microencapsulated products. The subjects for this study have been recruited from existing database of past study volunteers.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma total fatty acids at each appropriate time point.</outcome>
      <timepoint>As a crossover design this study will focus on acute response of ingestion of the 3 test products as measured in plasma free fatty acids.  Baseline measurements will be taken at timepoint 0, then at 2, 4, 6, 24 and 48 hours post ingestion for each treatment.  Each treatment is given on one occasion with 6 weeks between treatments.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute response study: Red blood cell membrane fatty acids at t=0 weeks to monitor accumulation of membrane DHA/EPA over the 3 treatments.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Acute response study: as a crossover design this study will focus on acute response of ingestion of the 3 test products. secondary outcomes listed above.</timepoint>
