  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pulse oximeter is widely used in the NICU as a way of assessing oxygenation in newborn infants. A sensor is attached to upper or lower limbs. The device utilises light in the red and near-infrared spectrum and the absorption of these two light pulses is dependant on the levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the tissue; the device algorithm subsquently converts these into a readout of arterial oxygenation. Pulse oximeter with 2 or 8 seconds averaging time  will be utilised continuous over 1 night when the infant has an overnight oximetry performed.</interventions>
    <comparator>A Masimo pulse oximeter is used for measuring oxygenation non-invasively. Clinical pulse oximeter with 8 seconds averaging time and a will be utilised continuously over 1 night as per standard NICU overnight oximetry protocol.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Premature infants often need to receive additional oxygen treatment. Usually this is because they have a lung condition called chronic lung disease. To ensure that the right amount of oxygen is given to them, we routinely use a sensor (or probe) that tells us the oxygen level in the babys blood. This is the oxygen meter (pulse oximeter); that is a devices that measures the level of oxygen in the body. This sensor does not cause any harm or discomfort to the baby. Our team of doctors and nurses use a test that we call overnight oximetry study or simply  a download. The test involves using the measurements from the oxygen meter to tell them if the baby still needs oxygen treatment. There are some standard settings (in detail, the averaging time of the pulse oximeter) that most hospital put on their oxygen meters. To date, there has been no study to tell us which averaging time is best suited for this purpose. The aim of our study is investigate which averaging time(s) is(/are) most effective for the overnight oximetry study in premature babies when doctors use them to check when the babies are ready to stop oxygen treatment.</summary>
