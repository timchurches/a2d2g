    <summary>1. To determine if BCG immunisation at birth, compared to no BCG immunisation, leads to a
           reduction in measures of allergy and infection in the first 12 months of life.

        2. To evaluate the immunological mechanisms underlying the non-specific effects of BCG by
           comparing markers of immunity between the BCG and non-BCG groups.</summary>
