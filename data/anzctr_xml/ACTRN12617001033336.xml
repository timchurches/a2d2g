  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will be  randomly allocated into one of three groups. They will take 500 mcg of either folic acid, folinic acid or 5-MTHF oral supplements once per day for 4 weeks. A supplement diary will be provided for participants to indicate when they have taken their supplements. Participant are also asked to bring there supplement pots back at the conclusion of the trial so that any remaining supplements can be counted and recorded to assess compliance.

    <comparator>The control group will not take any supplements and will continue to follow there normal diet. A ll participants will be provided with a food diary to record all meals so folate intake from food can be monitored. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose of this Study:
To investigate the safety and efficacy of oral forms of folate supplements in healthy individuals. The aim of this study is to see if there is a difference between the different forms for absorption and utilisation by the body and to see if there is a difference in efficacy between the different forms. This is an important study as it will help clinicians and the general public make informed choices. 

Procedure:
One capsule per day of 500mcg of either L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), folinic acid or folic acid or a control group with no supplementation for four weeks.

Visit 1- Baseline and Beginning of Treatment (Week 1)
Blood pathology tests for MTHFR, serum folate and vitamin B12. A case report and food diary. 


Visit 2 - Mid Treatment (Week 2)
Serum folate blood testing and food diary

End of Treatment  Visit 3 (Week 4)
Serum folate blood testing and food diary

Discomforts and Risks
Folate is generally considered safe and is essentially non-toxic.  More than 15mg can cause abdominal distention, hyperactivity, nausea, sleep disturbances and vivid dreams.  There are some concerns that folate supplements can mask a B12 deficiency so this will be measured at baseline. 

Benefits
The information you provide during the study will help to guide further research which will inform clinicians and the general public about the effectiveness of different oral forms of folate supplements. 

Participant Protection and Voluntary Participation
Participation in the trial is voluntary. Information that is supplied for the study will be maintained in strict confidence and will be de-identified to protect the participants privacy.  You are entitled to withdraw from the study at any time. 

Findings
Findings from the study will be published in the form of reports, journal articles and conferences or local presentations. Published results will not include your name or any information that could identify you.
