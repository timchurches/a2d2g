  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be conducted using a randomised crossover design with four treatments: sucrose, aspartame, Stevia, and Luo Han Guo. The dosage used in the present study is the dose commonly found in commercial products and all the treatments are matched for sweetness, e.g. 1). 65 g sucrose in 500 mL water; 2). 0.44 g aspartame in 500 mL water; 3). 0.33 g Stevia in 500 mL water; 4). 0.63 g Luo Han Guo in in 500 mL water.

All potential participants will be asked to attend a screening session after a 10-hour overnight fast for consenting and screening procedures. Some basic anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, waist and hip circumferences will be taken. Body composition will be measured using Tanita BC-418 machine and BODPOD. Blood pressure will be taken using an automated blood pressure monitor. After the screening visit, participants will be asked to attend four test sessions, with a minimum of five-day washout period between the test sessions. 

During each test day, participants will be asked to consume a pre-package study breakfast in the morning. The study breakfast consists of a packet of Milo, an apple, a packet of biscuit, and a muesli bar. They will be asked to consume a study preload (e.g. sucrose, aspartame, Stevia or Luo Han Guo drink) within fifteen minutes in mid morning and they will be provided with an ad libitum lunch an hour later, where they are allowed to consume as much or as little food as they wish. Fingerprick blood samples will be obtained at baseline (prior to preload consumption), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes after the commencement of preload consumption. Participants will be asked to complete an appetite-rating questionnaire at the same time points. All participants will be asked to complete a physical activity questionnaire and one-day diet record a day before their test day and the actual test day. Participants will also be given the option whether they would like to have their blood glucose to be monitored the day before and after each test session. If they take up this option, Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) insertion will be carried out by a trained researcher the day before each test session and they will return to CNRC on Day 3 for CGMS removal. The sensor will be calibrated using finger prick capillary blood glucose measurements taken at pre-meals (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner) and before sleeping during the intervention period with the OneTouchUltra'Registered Trademark'2 blood glucose meter (LifeScan,Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA). </interventions>
    <comparator>This will be a randomised crossover study where participants will act as their own control. Sucrose will be used as a comparator. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood glucose and insulin concentrations (Composite). Finger prick blood samples will be obtained prospectively for the measurements of blood glucose and insulin. Blood samples will be collected directly into cuvettes for analysing blood glucose concentrations using a Hemocue'Registered Trademark' Glucose 201 Analyser (Helsingborg, Sweden). Blood samples will also be collected into microtubes for the analysis of blood insulin concentrations using Cobas e411 machine. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During each test day, fingerprick blood samples will be collected at baseline (prior to preload consumption), 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes after the commencement of preload consumption.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy compensation, i.e. energy intake during an ad libitum lunch meal. Ad libitum intake of the lunch meal will be measured by weighing the leftovers on the plate. Energy compensation will then be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ad libitum lunch. During each test day, participants will be asked to consume a study preload in mid morning and they will be provided with an ad libitum lunch an hour later, where they are allowed to consume as much or as little food as they wish.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satiety. On the test session days, participants will be asked to record their appetite ratings on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The appetite-rating questionnaire will include questions on hunger, thirst, desire to eat, prospective consumption, and fullness. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to rate their appetite every 15 minutes for the first hour after commencement of preload consumption and every 30 minutes for the subsequent two hours, nine timepoints in total. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Questionnaires on individual characteristics, food choice and preference (Composite) will be used to determine whether the degree of energy compensation could be explained by these variables.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Body Perception Questionnaire, Intuitive Eating Scale, Dietary Practice Questionnaire, Food Choice Questionnaire, Food Preference Questionnaire, and Power of Food Scale during the screening visit.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially globally in the past few decades. Our current obesogenic environment is characterized by the abundance of highly palatable and high energy dense foods, which promotes people to overeat and could lead to positive energy balance over time. The consumption of low energy dense foods such as non-nutritive sweeteners has the potential to reduce total energy intake and aids in body weight management. Two natural non-nutritive sweeteners (i.e. Stevia and Luo Han Guo) have recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. To our knowledge, no studies to date have compared the effects of consuming different types of sweeteners, particularly Luo Han Guo, on postprandial glucose and energy compensation in humans. Therefore the objective of this study is to examine the effects of consuming four different types of sweeteners (sucrose, aspartame, Stevia, and Luo Han Guo) in liquid form on postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations, and dietary compensation among Asians. The proposed study will provide novel insights regarding the glycaemic, insulinaemic, and satiety responses to nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. </summary>
