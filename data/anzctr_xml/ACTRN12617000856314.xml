  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational trial which will examine and compare immune responses to vaccines in infants in three groups classified by exposure to antibiotics.
Group 1 Infant with direct antibiotic exposure within 28 days of birth
Group 2 - Infant born to mother who received  intrapartam maternal antibiotics within 28 days prior to delivery
Group 3  Infant with no direct or maternal antibiotic exposure
Participants will be followed up from birth until 18 months of age.</interventions>
    <comparator>Observational study - immune responses in group 3 (no antibiotic exposure group) will be compared with Group 1  (direct antibiotic exposure) and Group 2 (maternal antibiotic exposure) to assess any effect of antibiotic exposure on infant immune responses to routine vaccines. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We have designed and powered the study to describe the impact of antibiotic exposure on two primary outcomes: PCV13-specific IgG GMC and proportions achieving seroprotective antibody levels at 7 months (following 3 doses of PCV13 vaccination at 2, 4 and 6 months). 
Descriptive statistics including mean (95% CI) GMC (continuous) and proportion seroprotected/seroresponsive (categorical) will be reported by antibiotic exposure group. To assess the relationship between antibiotic exposure and vaccine response, univariate and multivariable linear regression models will be used to compare continuous outcome variables (ie mean GMC between antibiotic exposure groups and control group) whilst adjusting for potential confounders such as maternal age, maternal BMI, gestation age etc. Similarly, logistic regression models will be used to compare categorical outcomes (likelihood of reaching relevant antibiotic thresholds for exposed groups compared to the non-exposed control group) whilst adjusting for relevant confounders.
Based on animal data and published data from a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial of 1,709 PCV13-vaccinated, healthy infants in the US, we conservatively estimated the effect size for our study to be a 25% reduction in mean GMC in the antibiotic exposed groups, with a coefficient of variation of 1.23. Using these parameters, we require 180/group to detect effects at  greater than 85% power (alpha 0.05). For the categorical analysis of differences in proportions achieving PCV13 seroprotective antibody responses (greater than or equal to 0.35 microgram/mL), using a conservative assumption that the proportion would be at least 88% in the control group, we require 140/group to detect a 15% difference (alpha 0.05) with 90% power. 

We have therefore designed the study to enrol 200 infants/group to allow for withdrawals and/or insufficient blood collections for  approximately 10%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A multicentre clinical observational study to determine whether dysbiosis of the neonatal gut microbiome, driven by antibiotic exposure in the perinatal period, leads to impairment of subsequent antigen-specific responses to routine infant immunisations. This study will enrol vaginally born, term infants, with and without perinatal antibiotic exposure (maternal intrapartum antibiotics administered within 28 days of delivery or direct infant antibiotic exposure in the first 28 days of life. Infants will be vaccinated according to the National Immunisation Program and will have stool and blood samples collected to assess gut microbiome, gene expression responses and antigen specific vaccine responses.  Proportions achieving seroprotective antibody titres at approximately 7 months and 18 months of age will be compared between exposed and unexposed groups to assess impact of early antibiotic exposure on subsequent vaccine responses.</summary>
