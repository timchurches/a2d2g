  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post operative delirium is common after hip fracture surgery and is associated with increased
      length of hospital stay, delayed recovery and increased mortality. Postoperative delirium can
      also decrease a patient's quality of life and increase treatment costs. Anesthesia and pain
      relief (analgesia) treatments may also influence the incidence of delirium, but more research
      is needed into which techniques are effective in improving patient outcomes, care and
      decreasing costs. This pilot study compares the addition of regional analgesia as part of
      general anesthesia to determine the incidence of delirium following hip surgery. This is a
      collaborative study involving anesthesia, orthopedic surgery and geriatrics in the
      improvement of patient care.</summary>
