  <interventions>
    <interventions>It was selected 22 subjects with vitiligo. Both are interventions groups. They were divided in 2 groups: A and B. the group A (n=11) was submited by LASER applications and the group B by ultraviolet. the LASER was Heluim Neon (HeNE), density 6j/cm2, pontual tecnique 1 minute and 15 s per point. The total points and session is area dependent. It was about 15 minutes. The LASER was applied transcutaneously and realized 2 sessions per week, totalizing 10 sessions. The patients were reevaluated after 10 sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The ultraviolet was narrow band B therapy. It was applied twice a week, during 5 week, totalizing 10 sessions. The dose of ultraviolet was determined by Saidman test. the duration of session was about 5 minutes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study was evaluated the application of ultraviolet and LASER in patients with vitiligo. It was selected 22 subjects with vitiligo. Both are interventions groups. They were divided in 2 groups: A and B. the group A (n=11) was submitted by LASER applications and the group B by ultraviolet. the LASER was Heluim Neon (HeNE), density 6j/cm2, pontual tecnique 1minutes and 15 s per point. The total points and session is area dependent. It was about 15 minutes. The LASER was applied transcutaneously and realized 2 sessions per week, totalizing 10 sessions. The patients were reevaluated after 10 sessions. The ultraviolet was narrow band B therapy. It was applied twice a week, during 5 week, totalizing 10 sessions. The dose of ultraviolet was determined by Saidman test. The duration of session was about 5 minutes. The area of despigmentation was measure in the corel drawn computer program.</summary>
