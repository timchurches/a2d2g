  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this randomised controlled trial, four memory rehabilitation programmes will be compared namely 1) self-awareness training plus compensatory training, 2) self-awareness training plus remedial training, 3) placebo plus compensatory training, and 4) placebo plus remedial training.  A pretest/post-test/follow-up independent-groups design will be used to compare the relative effectiveness of compensatory versus remedial rehabilitation and self-awareness training. Participants will be randomly assigned to the 4 programmes giving 25 participants in each group. Participants will have a 4-week pre-intervention period, then participate in an individual rehabilitation programme for 8 weeks (2 weeks self-awareness training or placebo plus 6 weeks compensatory or remedial training). This will enable the effects of the two components (i.e. remedial versus compensatory training and self-awareness training versus placebo) to be evaluated separately.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To provide a comprehensive assessment of prospective memory three types of evaluation using a) psychometric testing</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following the 4-week baseline period, participants will be assessed on all measures by a researcher who is blind to group membership. Participants will then commence one of the 8-week standardised individual rehabilitation programmes. All programmes will be administered by the same trained researcher according to standardised, written week-by-week procedures. Post-intervention assessment using all measures will occur at the end of the programme and at a follow-up appointment arranged 6 months later.</timepoint>

      <outcome>To provide a comprehensive assessment of prospective memory three types of evaluation using b) self-report and relative's report of prospective memory function</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following the 4-week baseline period, participants will be assessed on all measures by a researcher who is blind to group membership. Participants will then commence one of the 8-week standardised individual rehabilitation programmes. All programmes will be administered by the same trained researcher according to standardised, written week-by-week procedures. Post-intervention assessment using all measures will occur at the end of the programme and at a follow-up appointment arranged 6 months later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To provide a comprehensive assessment of prospective memory three types of evaluation using c) assessment of diary use (number and quality of diary entries)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following the 4-week baseline period, participants will be assessed on all measures by a researcher who is blind to group membership. Participants will then commence one of the 8-week standardised individual rehabilitation programmes. All programmes will be administered by the same trained researcher according to standardised, written week-by-week procedures. Post-intervention assessment using all measures will occur at the end of the programme and at a follow-up appointment arranged 6 months later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of participation in each of the four prospective memory rehabilitation programmes on community integration will also be assessed using a psychosocial reintegration scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At pre-assessment, post-assessment and 6-month follow-up assessment by a researcher blind to group membership.</timepoint>
