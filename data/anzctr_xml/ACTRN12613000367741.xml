  <interventions>
    <interventions>20 gm curcumin will be taken daily 
Oral curcumin will begin on the morning of day 1 and dosing will occur once daily for seven consecutive days.


Curcumin is granular in consistency and not water soluble. For palatability, participants will be provided with a choice of pudding or shake in which to mix their daily dose of curcumin. One option will be dairy-free for lactose-intolerant individuals. 

Participants will be asked to take an over the counter vitamin E supplement capsules equivalent to 500 IU daily beginning at the baseline visit (1 day prior to commencing curcumin) and continuing through the final day of curcumin dosing.
 
Participants will be asked to maintain a Dosing Diary Card recording the dates and times of dosing with curcumin and Vitamin E capsules, to assess compliance.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate whether a simple eye test could detect Alzheimers disease earlier than current techniques. We have already found some changes to the blood vessels in the retina, at the back of the eye, in Alzheimers disease. This new study will investigate if amyloid plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimers disease in the brain, also occur in the retina. A specialised eye camera will be used to take photographs of the retina. In order to highlight amyloid plaques in these photographs, participants will be asked to take a pudding containing Curcumin once per day for 7 days. Curcumin, the main ingredient of the common food spice turmeric, has been reported to have many beneficial health effects, and is being tested in other trials for possible therapeutic benefit in Alzheimers disease. Curcumin also has molecular and optical properties that may enable us to image amyloid plaques and hence detect Alzheimers disease earlier. It is hoped that this technique could allow us to detect Alzheimers disease before the cognitive signs become apparent, hence participants with normal cognition as well as those with memory problems and diagnosed Alzheimers disease will be recruited for this study.  </summary>
