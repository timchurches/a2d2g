  <interventions>
    <interventions>Data for these analyses were provided by Australian adults (19-85 years) who participated in the 1995 National Nutrition Survey, and adults who participated in the 2011-13 National Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey. The purpose of this study was to examine change in dietary inequalities in intakes of energy, macronutrients, fiber, fruits and vegetables among Australian adults between 1995 and 2011-13.  Variables included:

1)	Dietary intake: In 1995, dietary data were collected via an in-person three-stage multiple pass 24-hour food recall with a trained dietitian and a self-administered, written dietary questionnaire in which they reported the number of daily serves of fruits and vegetables usually consumed in the past 12 months. In 2011-12, dietary data were collected via a computer-assisted in-person five-stage multiple pass 24-hour food recall with trained interviewers from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and reported the number of daily serves of fruits and vegetables they normally consumed to a trained interviewer.
2)	Socioeconomic position: Educational level was categorized as low (less than secondary), medium (secondary/trade/diploma), or high (tertiary). Income was expressed as gross equivalized household income and categorized as low (decile 1-3), medium (decile 4-7), or high (decile 8-10). The Australian Bureau of Statistics Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA) was used to estimate area-level disadvantage in quintiles ordered from most (quintile 1) to least disadvantaged (quintile 5).  
3)	Sociodemographic variables: Age (continuous), smoking status (current, former, never), sex.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>These nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys were conducted using stratified multistage area-based sampling procedures of private dwellings in rural and urban locations in all Australian states and territories.  Australian adults (19-85 years) were eligible if they completed a 24-hour dietary recall (and did not have zero energy intake), answered questions about fruit and vegetable intake, and provided sociodemographic information.  Women were not eligible if they were pregnant or breastfeeding.</inclusivecriteria>
