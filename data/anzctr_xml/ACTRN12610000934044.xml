    <interventions>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique which acquires high resolution images of tissue. It is analogous to ultrasound, but uses reflections of near infrared light waves instead of sound waves. Different tissue types reflect different amounts of light. In this study, we scan ex vivo tissue samples, and compare the OCT images against histology to assess whether cancerous tissue can be distinguished from healthy tissue. Scans are performed on fresh (unfixed) ex vivo human breast tissue samples immediately after excision from the patient. No additional tissue is excised for this study  scans are performed on tissue that is excised as part of normal surgery. Image acquisition takes approximately 2-10 minutes. Tissue then undergoes histological assessment and the results are correlated against the OCT image.</interventions>
    <comparator>After scanning with optical coherence tomography (OCT), the ex vivo tissue samples are fixed, embedded in paraffin, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained histological sections are prepared. Areas of cancerous and healthy tissue in the histological sections are then correlated against the optical coherence tomography images. Both OCT imaging and H&amp;E stained histological analysis are performed on samples after excision from  the patient, and so do not require any additional effort from the patient. Histological analysis is only performed once on each ex vivo sample. Histological processing typically requires 2-4 days.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of cancerous breast tissue. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) image is a three dimension data set. Visualization software is used to extract an oblique plane which closely matches the two dimensional histological section. Different tissue types in the OCT image and histological section are then correlated, and areas of cancerous tissue are identified. The correlation is successful is cancerous tissue identified in the histological section is also identified in the OCT image.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At completion of histological processing and sectioning of tissue.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of cancerous breast tissue. This secondary outcome is assessed in the same manner as for the Primary outcome above. However, the initial assessment of the presence of cancerous tissue in the optical coherence tomography (OCT) image is performed immediately after OCT image acquisition, and prior to completion of histological analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after acquisition of imaging scan with optical coherence tomography.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at whether a new imaging technique, referred to as optical coherence tomography (OCT), is as accurate as histology (examining cells under a microscope) in identifying cancerous tissue in people with breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are a woman or man with breast cancer and are about to undergo surgery. 

Trial details
In this preliminary study, OCT images of tissue samples removed during surgery will be compared to standard histology, to see whether OCT can reliably distinguish cancerous and healthy tissue. 

OCT is an imaging technique which acquires high resolution images of tissue. It is similar to ultrasound, but uses reflections of near infrared light waves instead of sound waves. OCT could potentially be used on tissue before it is cut out of the patient, which would avoid the unnecessary removal of healthy tissue during breast cancer surgery. Results from this trial will form the basis for future trials which will be performed on human tissue prior to removal of the tissue from the patient.</summary>
