  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acupuncture:Using needles Korean brand Dongbang size 0,20 X 30 mm. Needles for single use, discarded in an appropriate container (BD Descartex - Registered Trademark (R)) after use, not being reused.
We used a cube of foam about 2 cm with an adhesive material (double-sided tape) covering one side of the cube, which was placed on the skin over the acupuncture point, making support for the acupuncture needle. The volunteer was not able to see the level of needle entry, because the cube impeded vision. The needle penetrated the skin enough to reach the acupoint and give the effect "DE QI ".
Used acupoints: PC-6, TE-5, LI-4, GB-34, SP-6 and LR-3.
Frequency of twice a week for two menstrual cycles (based on the normal cycle of 28 days), totaling 16 sessions. The duration of each service, with initial treatments, application of needles and the needles stay was around 45 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Acupuncture Sham: Using needles Korean brand Dongbang size 0,20 X 40 mm. Needles for single use, discarded in an appropriate container (BD Descartex - Registered Trademark (R)) after use, not being reused.
In this group, the volunteers received the sham acupuncture into non-acupoints, utilizing location two centimeters to either side of the acupoints used. We used the same technique described in the acupuncture group, but the puncture was performed 02 mm and the needle was withdrawn quickly, not reaching effect "De Qi". Furthermore, the needle was retained in the foam cube, which gave the impression that she remained on the skin. The needle of this group was smaller than the acupuncture group, to ensure that the needle shaft of the two groups stayed the same distance off the cube.
Frequency of twice a week for two menstrual cycles (based on the normal cycle of 28 days), totaling 16 sessions. The duration of each service, with initial treatments, application of needles and the needles stay was around 45 minutes.</comparator>
