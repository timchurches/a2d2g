  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Cervical occlusion

Experimental: Therapeutic Trial - Therapeutic cervical cerclage with or without cervical occlusion in women presenting with short cervix (&lt;25mm)

Experimental: Prophylactic Trial - Prophylactic cervical cerclage with or without cervical occlusion in women with a history of cervical insufficiency


Treatment: surgery: Cervical occlusion
Women were randomized to receive cervical occlusion or no cervical occlusion in addition to a cervical cerclage (McDonald or Shirodkar cerclage). Cervical occlusion was performed with interrupted or continuous sutures, placed approximately 1 cm deep on each lip, and 0.5 cm apart with a nylon 2-0/3-0 suture.
