  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - E2Nomac

Experimental: E2/Nomac - Women with demonstrated HMB at baseline will be assigned to 3 cycles of a E2/Nomac combined pill 1 daily for 24 days followed by 1 placebo pill daily for 4 days per cycle.


Treatment: drugs: E2Nomac
Women will start the first cycle of the COC on the first day of their period in the treatment phase of the study

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women with measured menstrual bleeding &gt;80ml per cycle and no contraindications to combined
      oral contraceptive use will be assigned to an oestradiol/nomegestrol acetate oral
      contraceptive for 3 cycles during which they will collect all menstrual blood and send all
      used sanitary protection to the laboratory at the University of Sydney for estimation of
      blood loss by the alkaline haematin method.

      Hypothesis:

      An estradiol/nomogestrel acetate (E2/NOMAC) combined pill will be effective in controlling
      HMB in the majority of women without structural pelvic pathology.

      Main outcome:

      The primary efficacy end-point will be the proportion of women with a reduction of menstrual
      blood loss = 50% from baseline.</summary>
