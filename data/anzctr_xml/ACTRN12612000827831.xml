    <concealment>Potential participants will be made aware of the study via an advertisement (see attached). This advertisement will be placed, with permission, in doctors surgeries, community centres, newspapers and school newsletters. We will also be looking to contact Victorian schools via the Diocese of that school community and via the principals or board members of those schools and asking permission for publication of the advertising poster in their school newsletters and any other school media.

Potential participants (with their parent/guardian) will contact researchers in response to advertisements in order to request more information and discuss what is involved in the research. At this stage, prospective participants may be mailed or emailed a copy of the PICF. The research assistant will follow-up with prospective participants after they have had time to read all documentation. If they are still interested in taking part in the study, a telephone screen may be conducted in order to determine the eligibility of a person for the study.   

A computerised random number generator will determine whether participants are allocated to treatment group a or b. This will be performed by a disinterested third party.</concealment>
