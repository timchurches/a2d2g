  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Dietary Supplement: Probiotic dietary supplement or Placebo
Dietary Supplement: Probiotic genus &amp; species Strain Active count. Lactobacillus acidophilus (helveticus) 4.35 Billion cfu, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 4.35 Billon cfu, Bifidobacterium longum 4.35 Billion cfu, Saccharomyces boulardii 1.95 Billon cfu, Other Names: -Gastrohealth 4 (Pharmacare Pty Ltd) 


Other Names:
-Gastrohealth 4 (Pharmacare Pty Ltd) 
Study Arm (s) 
- Active Comparator: Probiotic dietary supplement, one capsule once daily until delivery.

The investigators will schedule the women for routine monthly obstetric visits (more often if clinically required) during which time they will also meet with one of the investigators. The investigator at each monthly visit will provide an additional monthly allotment of 30 capsules. The capsule bottle from the previous cycle will be collected and dated if there are capsules remaining in the bottle. Remaining capsules will be counted and refrigerated for future use.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesize that giving oral probiotics to pregnant women during later part of pregnancy (&gt;23weeks) will reduce GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks. This will thereby reduce the need of intrapartum antibiotics for women and infection blood tests for the babies. We also hypothesize that this will have additional beneficial effects on obstetric (GDM, preeclampsia, maternal infections), perinatal (premature rupture of membranes, preterm births) and neonatal outcomes (including reduction in neonatal sepsis).  </summary>
