    <statisticalmethods>Activity, location and people present for each participant will be expressed as a percentage of the total number of observations made. A Pearson productmoment correlation coefficient (r) will be calculated to assess the relationship between activity level and (i) stroke severity (ii) motor function (motor component of NIHSS), (iii) cognitive function (cognitive component of NIHSS), and (iv) mood (HADS). The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Pearsons r will be calculated using Fishers transformation. All analyses will be performed using STATA 13.0. Qualitative data will be analysed using an inductive thematic approach with the use of constant comparison.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute stroke patients spend as little as 13% the day in physical activity (1), but how much of their day is spent participating in cognitive and social activities remains unknown. The proposed observational study seeks to determine the: (i) physical, cognitive and social activity levels of patients very early after stroke, (ii) relationship between stroke severity and activity levels, (iii) proportion of acute stroke patients capable of engaging in greater activity and, (iv) barriers and facilitators to activity in an acute neurology unit. This is important preliminary work required to inform the translation of the use of an enriched environment into the acute setting. </summary>
