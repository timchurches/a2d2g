  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the experimental group will receive usual care (see Usual care) and a 2-week package of exercises and strategies that will provide them with additional opportunities to practice a functional task*. 

This package will include a range of strategies* individualised to the needs of the participant for increasing the amount of practice of a functional task. Participants will be required to perform as many repetitions of this task as they can per day. 

*Details of functional tasks and strategies used to increase repetitive practice have been omitted to minimise contamination between groups.

    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual care (see Usual care), 

Usual care
Usual care for both groups will consist of two one-hour sessions of physiotherapy a day and will include one-to-one or group therapy with a physiotherapist. This therapy will involve strength, endurance, balance and coordination exercises as well as task-specific practice of sitting, sitting-to-standing, standing, and walking. All exercises will be tailored to the needs of each participant.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinicians impression of functional change over two weeks 

A video recording of a participant performing a functional task* will be taken at baseline and again at two weeks. A Global Impression of Change (GIoC) scale will be used to rate the functional change of a participant.  The GIoC scale is a 15-point scale with -7 representing very much worse, 0 representing no difference, and +7 representing very much better. A mean between-group difference of 2/15 points is considered clinically important.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sit-to-Stand (STS) ability 

STS ability will be assessed using the STS item of the Mobility Scale for Acute Stroke Patients (MSAS). This item will be rated on a 6-point scale based on level of assistance required to complete the task of STS with a score of 1 denoting inability to complete the task and a score of 6 denoting completion of the task unassisted and safely. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite strength of the key muscles of the affected lower limb

The strength of the hip extensors, knee extensors, and plantar flexors will be assessed using manual muscle testing. Scores for the three muscle groups will be combined and treated as a composite measure of lower limb extensor strength, with 15 points representing the maximum score. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at 14 days (Two weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gross lower limb extension strength

Gross lower limb extension strength will be measured using an inclinometer on a sliding tilt table. A participant will be transferred to a sliding tilt table and positioned with only their affected lower limb on the foot plate and knee placed in 60deg flexion. The tilt table will be raised and the participant will be instructed to extend their lower limb. The highest degree of incline against which the participant can extend their lower limb will be recorded. 
</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) 

Prior to baseline assessments, participants will identify one personal goal related to a functional task* in conjunction with a physiotherapist. The goal will be set according to the SMART principle, that is, the goal will be specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely.  A blinded assessor will rate attainment of the goal at the 2-week assessment. The goal will be rated on a 5-point scale, where 0 denotes the expected level of achievement; +1 and +2 are respectively a little and a lot better than expected, whilst -1 and -2 are correspondingly a little and a lot less than expected. A higher score will reflect better achievement of goals than a lower score.

      <outcome>Ranking of change in participants' ability to perform a functional task*

A blinded assessor will rank each of the 30 participants in order from most improved to least improved. The assessor will use the videos collected as part of the primary outcome to determine participants ranking.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Following acquired brain injury (ABI) caused by stroke or trauma many people cannot move around independently due to motor impairments such as weakness and poor coordination. These people require intensive repetitive practice to improve their ability to move around. Therefore the aim of this study is to determine if a two-week intensive package of functional training improves functional performance more than usual care in people with ABI admitted to a sub-acute ward for rehabilitation.

Experimental design:
An assessor blinded randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Each participant will be randomly allocated to an experimental or control group using the principles of concealed allocation. Participants allocated to the experimental group will receive usual care and a 2-week package of exercises and strategies that will provide them with additional opportunities to practice a functional task. This package will include a range of strategies individualised to the needs of the participant for increasing the amount of practice of a functional task. Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual care. Usual
care for both groups will consist of two one-hour sessions of physiotherapy a day and will include one-to-one or group therapy with a physiotherapist. This therapy will involve strength, endurance, balance and coordination exercises as well as task-specific practice of sitting, sitting-to-standing, standing, and walking. All exercises will be tailored to the needs of each participant.
Participants:
30 consecutively admitted patients to a sub-acute general adult rehabilitation unit.
