  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim is to explore the potential of selenium incorporated in dairy proteins to improve bowel health and reduce the risk of colon cancer. Participants will  include a special dairy product in their diet in which the dairy proteins have been naturally enriched with selenium. 
High selenium=100 micrograms per day, Placebo =1.5 micrograms selenium per day, in Milk protein concentrate prepared as a powdered food drink. Each intervention is 8 weeks in length with a 2 week wash-out between each phase. Markers of the health value of selenium will then be examined in samples of blood and samples taken from the lining of the bowel wall. The duration of the intervention will be 2 weeks baseline+ 8 weeks for each treatment phase (16wks) and 2 weeks wash out between treatment phases.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation of crossover sequence was assigned by numbered containers. The sequence was not concealed as 1 of 2 different flavoured protein powders (Strawberry or Vanilla) were used for each treatment phase.  The Selenium levels were double blind.</concealment>
    <sequence>Trial coordinators allocated protein powders to volunteers by alternation in relation to their scheduling through the clinical facility, prior to study commencement</sequence>
