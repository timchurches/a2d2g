  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group of outpatient participants with a diagnosis of moderate depression reading a cognitive behaviour therapy based bibliotherapy manual, 'The Good Mood Guide: A Self-Help Manual for Depression,' plus a short weekly telephone contact of approximately five minutes duration with one of the researchers. They will also continue to receive the standard care and treatment at the outpatient department. 

The manual contains eight modules, each module containing reading, writing and activities to be completed over a one-week time-frame. Each module takes approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete. The entire program was designed to be completed in eight weeks. By reading the manual, it is anticipated that participants will have an increase in their resilience. Data will be collected at three timepoints: Baseline (Week 0), end of program (Week 8), and 4 weeks follow-up (Week 12).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group of outpatient participants with a diagnosis of moderate depression will not be given the cognitive behaviour therapy based bibliotherapy manual, but will continue to receive the standard care and treatment at the outpatient department, plus a short weekly telephone contact of approximately five minutes duration from one of the researchers. Standard care and treatment involved attendance at the outpatient department for face-to-face consultations and prescription of antidepressant or a combination of antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication. The duration of control group treatment is eight weeks. Data will be collected at three timepoints: Baseline (Week 0), end of program (Week 8), and 4 weeks follow-up (Week 12).</comparator>

      <outcome>Participants with moderate depression who take part in the cognitive behavioural bibliotherapy self-help intervention program as well as continuing to receive standard care and treatment will have greater resilience than those who receive only standard care and treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to assess if a self-help manual for participants with moderate depression was effective in strengthening their resilience and reducing symptoms of  depression and psychological distress. The study involved two groups: an 'intervention' group who studied the manual, and a 'control' group who did not study the manual.</summary>
