    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: 
The MDASI-BT Symptom Severity and Symptom Interference subscales range from 0 to 10.  

In a study on patients with brain metastases using these subscales, patients with good performance status reported a mean Symptom Severity subscale score of 1.21 (SD=1.11) while patients with a poor performance status reported a mean score of 2.55 (SD=1.62). For the Symptom Interference subscale, patients in the good performance status group had a mean score of 1.76 (SD=2.17) while patients with a poor performance status reported a mean score of 4.27 (SD=2.96)
It is hypothesised that patients in the placebo arm will likely develop symptoms following SRT, causing a decline in their performance status and a deterioration, from baseline, in the mean severity subscale score of 1.6. Similarly, it is expected that there might be a deterioration, from baseline, in the interference subscale score of 2.5. These scores were taken from normative data of a similar patient population. In the dexamethasone arm, and for each subscale, mean scores post completion of SRT are expected to be similar to their respective baseline mean scores.  

With 30 evaluable patients in each arm, the power of the 5% level F-test for the treatment by time interaction is, under a conservative scenario in which more than 98% of the total variation in subscale scores is between assessments within individuals, and when the total standard deviations and conjectured declines are as given above, approximately 80%. 

A total of 64 participants will be randomised to account for potential dropouts.

Analysis:
Intention-to-treat analysis

The analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on a linear mixed model that will be fitted using the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The null hypothesis, that there is no interaction between assessment times and treatment arms (placebo and dexamethasone) will be tested using an F-test conducted at the 5% significance level (a=0.05). The p-value for this test will be reported together with a two-way table of predicted means (time by arm) and their associated 95% confidence intervals. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess if dexamethasone influences the development of symptoms, if any during stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) to brain metastases. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have 1-3 brain metastases with at least one lesion planned for SRT, and not on dexamethasone for at least 7 days prior to SRT. 

Study details:
There are no clear guidelines on who would benefit from prophylactic (ie. as a precaution before any symptoms develop) dexamethasone during SRT to brain metastases. Some clinicians may choose to prescribe prophylactic dexamethasone to prevent or minimize any local swelling during radiotherapy. Others may not, as not all patients will develop symptoms. To evaluate this, we are randomising patients to having 4 mg oral dexamethasone (on days of SRT and 1 day after) or placebo. We are also studying the effect of treatment on patients quality of life. It is hypothesised that patients in the placebo arm may develop symptoms following SRT. The results of the study will guide clinicians whether prophylactic dexamethasone is beneficial in a selected group of patients having stereotactic radiation for brain metastases.
