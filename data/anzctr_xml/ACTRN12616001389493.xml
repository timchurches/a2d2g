  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants attend a sleep laboratory for a single night of assessment, during which polysomnography is carried out involving the attachment of sensors to the head and face to assess sleep parameters. Echocardiography is then performed the following morning, which involves holding a small ultrasound device against the chest</interventions>
    <comparator>This case-control study included 62 patients diagnosed with OSAS, and 22 healthy controls. Polysomnography (Include such paramaters; apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index)  and ecocardiography were performed to all participants (study and control group) to analyze sleep apnea degree and investigation of epicardial fat tickness. Assessment performed only once at enrolment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Epicardial fat thickness, assessed by Standard transthoracic echocardiography. Standard views, including the left lateral decubitus and supine positions were obtained. Epicardial fat was defined as the relatively echo-free space between the outer wall of the myocardium and the visceral layer of the pericardium. EFT was measured in end diastole on the free wall of the right ventricle from the parasternal long- and short-axis views, as previously described. The maximum values at any site were measured, and the average value was calculated. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Single assessment for all paticipants.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oxygen desaturation index was assessed from polysomnographic examination. The oxygen desaturation index is the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood's oxygen level drop by a certain degree from baseline. It is believed that an elevation in ODI may lead to increased oxidative stress in the body that may predispose people to long-term cardiovascular risks, including high blood pressure (hypertension), heart attack, stroke, and memory loss associated with dementia.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Single assessment at baseline.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;5 were regarded as the controls, the ones with an AHI &gt;5 were included in the study group, and two groups were compared for EFT. Also, all participants have one of the sleep disordered breathing symptoms such as snoring, apnea and daytime sleepiness.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thick epicardial fat is a cardiovascular risk factor, and it has been shown to be correlated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), coronary artery disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relation of epicardial fat thickness (EFT) with severity of OSA, clinical and polysomnographic parameters, and to determine independent predictors for EFT. A total of 84 patients with a body mass index &lt;30, and suspected sleep disordered breathing were included in the study. Their EFT were measured using echocardiography. The patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) &lt;5 were regarded as the controls, the ones with an AHI &gt;5 were included in the study group, and two groups were compared for EFT. The correlations of EFT with polysomnographic and clinical data, and severity of OSA were investigated. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors for EFT.  There were 62 and 22 patients in study and control groups, respectively. Mean EFT was 3.75 +/- 1.07 mm in study, and 2.97 +/- 0.62 mm in the control groups (p&lt;0.001). There was a significant positive correlation of EFT with AHI, oxygen desaturation index 3 (ODI3), and the minimum oxygen saturation as well as with age, body mass index, and neck and waist circumferences. Epicardial fat was significantly thicker in severe OSA patients. ODI3 was an independent predictor for EFT. Non-obese OSA patients have thicker epicardial fat when compared to the controls. ODI3 has a strong correlation with EFT, and it is an independent predictor for it.</summary>
