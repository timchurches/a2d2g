  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are reasons to believe that medical grade-honey applied directly to skin may be an effective treatment for nappy rash. In this study parents/guardians of 10 children with nappy rash will apply medical grade honey to the napkin area at each nappy change.

After two weeks the nappy rash will be assessed to look at changes in severity. Participants will also be asked about their experience of using honey.

This trial will provide useful information on the practicalities of topical honey as a treatment for nappy rash. It will also give an initial signal as to whether honey may be effective.</summary>
