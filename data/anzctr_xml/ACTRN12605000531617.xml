  <interventions>
    <interventions>Conducting trials of interventions for people with CRMD across three main streams (contexts): (i) High Support stream focuses on improving outcomes for CRMD patients who need high support interventions. Intervention priorities are (a) collaborative goal setting and homework that maximises ongoing self management of physical and mental health and (b) interventions that can be transported and sustained in multiple ; setting (rehabilitation /community case management). (ii) Rural stream examines interventions to reduce recurrence and to improve physical health behaviours in people with any chronic or recurring mental disorder, with particular emphasis on depression. Brief interventions by general practitioners and mental health staff will be supplemented by a series of correspondence based treatments (eg. for depression and alcohol misuse)  and initiatives of self help organisations, services and local councils. (iii)  The Indigenous stream aims to implement service and setting adapted interventions targeting CRMDs across the mental health spectrum of interventions (patient information systems, best practice specialist and primary care treatment protocols and models of service delivery, mental health outcome measures and community based support activities in order to obtain demonstrable improvements in mental health outcomes in 2 regions of remote northern Australia. Intervention programs will be conducted and evaluated for the duration of the study. Early detection (screening for chronic disease and provision of brief interventions in health issues including smoking exercise, nutrition, alcohol consumption and sexual health), best practice primary prevention and clinical care programs under the Chronic Disease Strategy is being implemented as a vehicle for improving the health status of rural and remote indigenous people.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This overall project aims to apply evidence based health promotion strategies to people with chronic or recurring mental disorders (CRMD) in an attempt to improve mental health outcomes. Conducted across three streams, intervention trials will focus on (i) People in urban areas or regional centres who require high levels of support to improve outcomes for those in need high support; (ii) patients of primary care practitioners and mental health services in rural towns and regional centres. The rural stream aims to detect and prevent relapse in mental disorders; reduce risk of physical disorders associated with smoking, excessive alcohol use, unhealthy diet and low activity levels. (iii) Indigenous consumers of mental health services in remote areas and examines contrasting models of mental health services and related information systems The approach incorporates principles and priorities of the 2nd National Mental Health Plan and attempts to increase the capacity of stakeholders to manage CRMD. It is designed to be sustainable and widely applicable. Overall the study seeks to develop and demonstrate sustainable methods of improving mental health outcomes. Strategic priorities include: enhanced responsiveness of practitioners and service systems to the health risks faced by people with chronic or recurring mental disorders.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The project has the larger long term objective of providing methods that can be sustained and disseminated across Australia. By combining three research streams in very different contexts, the project produces intervention variants that can be applied across Australia. The empowerment and support of practitioners and other service providers is crucial to providing sustainable,  integrated and accessible services. CRMD has a substantial impact on early mortality, morbidity and associated burden and financial cost in Australia, particularly in indigenous populations. Access to best practice in CRMD is variable, with remote areas and indigenous populations being especially disadvantaged. This project addresses these issues through training and support for health care providers and carers. Emphasising service integration, especially between mental health and general practice providers. Involving policy makers and users from its inception and developing increased awareness and capacity in practitioners sustainability will be maximised.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Each stream have specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for recruitment of both patients and professionals (clinician, practitioners and mental health service provider). (i) High Support:  clinician recruitment -a total of 140 clinicians working with people with CRMD will be recruited and randomly allocated to immediate or delayed interventions. Eligibility requires that they are working actively with at least 3 patients who meet patient eligibility; patient recruitment - 840 patients will be randomly allocated from caseload in each condition. Patients are to be: 18 years or over; diagnosis of psychotic disorder or at least 6 months duration.
inclusion of patients with comorbid substance misuse or personality disorders is allowed; "high support needs on the CANSAS scale. (ii) Rural Stream: Participants include 6 groups: (60) GPs in Qld;(approx 70) mental health staff in participating towns (4 pairs of rural centres) to receive immediate or delayed interventions; cross sectional patients (minimum of 10 with CRMD from each GP and a minimum of 20 patients surveyed from each GP (all are sampled from the waiting rooms of all participating GPs); Longitudinal patient sample: 240 patients to be recruited from GP and Mental Health Services. Adults with a history of treatment by antidepressants, mood stabilisers, antipsychotics with an DSM-IV disorder with at least 6 months duration; comorbidity will not result in exclusion.
A community sample will be recruited from each town (50 surveys per town at each assessment) Focus groups: participants will be adults with CRMD and carers; key community representatives, GPs and mental health staff (6-10 in each group, 1 group of each type in each town) . (iii) Indigenous people in remote communities for Far North Queensland (from approx  total population 15000) and Top End of the Northern Territory (from approx total population of 25,000) suffering from chronic and relapsing mental illness and their families. It will utilise existing primary care and specialist mental health consultancy services and build on a set of existing initiatives across two service settings.</inclusivecriteria>
