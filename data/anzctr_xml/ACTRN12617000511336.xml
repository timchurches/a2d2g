    <interventions>Use of a Clear Aligner System to treat orthodontic malocclusion. The clear aligner system is an alternative to braces and allows for better oral hygiene as the aligner can be removed to allow for brushing of teeth and rinsing with mouthwash. After a 3D scan and x-rays of the teeth, a virtual model of the desired treatment outcome is created and a series of aligners is designed to achieve that outcome. Each aligner is reused on a daily basis, being removed for a maximum of 2 hours each day while consuming liquids other than water, while eating and to brush, floss and rinse to maintain good oral hygiene. The aligner is also worn at night. After use, the aligner should be cleaned by rinsing in accordance with the participant instructions for use and care of the aligner.
The participant is instructed by their orthodontist to change aligners every 1-2 weeks at home. These devices are custom-made for each participant and may be used in conjunction with accessories such as buttons and elastics. Modifications to the aligner design and treatment plan can be done as deemed necessary by the treating orthodontist. This information is captured in the CRFs and patient compliance is partly indicated by the reconciliation of the returned, used, aligners.
Treatment is projected to last approximately 12 months. Participants will visit their orthodontist quarterly while on treatment and each visit is expected to be approximately 30-45 mins in duration including 3D scans, and safety reporting. The initial and final treatment visits may take up to 30 minutes longer to accommodate x-rays, extra-oral photographs and questionnaire..</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of effectiveness of the device over a 12-month treatment period, in subjects with the following specific dental malocclusion treatment needs, compared to the initial  treatment plan:

* Intrusion, extrusion
* Rotation
* Expansion
* Posterior space closure (either due to tooth extraction or pre-existing spaces) through Mesial/distal translation
* Tip and torque correction
Effectiveness is assessed by measuring the amount of actual movement in millimetres or degrees, compared to the movement predicted by the treatment plan. X-rays, and intra oral scans will be used to determine tooth movement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>52-aligners (approximately 12 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of the safety of the device through reporting of adverse events and adverse device effects such as allergy to the aligner material, discomfort, and other AEs typically associated with orthodontic treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout treatment duration (approximately 12 months)</timepoint>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 30 subjects is required to complete the trial for a power of 80% to detect a mean percent accuracy of 56% with a standard deviation of 33% (Kravitz et al), a two-sided test, alpha=0.05 for five types of movement with a minimum of five subjects within each type of movement. The anticipated drop-out rate is approximately twenty percent, based on all types of orthodontic treatment.  Hence up to 50 subjects will be recruited and subjects will not be replaced.

The study aims to gather information on safety and effectiveness of the aligner when used to treat malocclusions. Efficacy will be measured by the amount of movement undertaken compared with that predicted.  
Each tooth will be identified by subject, type of tooth (central incisor, lateral incisor, canine, first pre-molar, second pre-molar and first molar) and type of movement required.  Teeth may require more than one type of movement.
The amount of movement predicted for rotation, tip, torque, mesio-distal movement, lingual buccal movement, intrusion and/or extrusion for each tooth that will be treated with the aligner for each subject at baseline and an updated prediction at 6 months. The amount of each type of movement achieved at 6 months will be compared with that predicted at baseline and the amount at 12 months compared with the updated prediction at 6 months using an estimate of accuracy determined as:
Percentage of accuracy = 100% - [(|predicted-achieved|/ |predicted|) x 100%]Percentage of accuracy for each type of movement will be summarized descriptively for each type of tooth and overall at each available time point.  The percentage of accuracy for each type of tooth will also be summarized by each type of movement and overall. Summary statistics will include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. All data will be listed by subject number. All formal data analysis will be undertaken after the 12 month timepoint. No interim analysis is planned.</statisticalmethods>
