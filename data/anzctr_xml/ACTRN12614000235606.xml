    <statisticalmethods>60 Participants will be recruited to the study.  Assuming at most 20% withdrawal/exclusion rates during the study this will ensure complete data on at least 50 participants. An achieved sample size of 50 has reasonable precision for estimates of variance.

Statistical analysis:
The baseline characteristics of the population will be described and the variance and mean values for serum periostin will be calculated for participants who complete the study without developing a severe exacerbation.  Confidence intervals for the variance of periostin will be calculated using a Chi-square statistic.  This analysis may need to be performed on the log transformed scale.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) gene expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states, including asthma. As yet an incomplete picture is currently available on the role and effects of periostin level in the blood, however it has shown promise as a biomarker for asthma severity and a marker of inflammation levels, being easy to measure through a simple blood test. This study of the longitudinal variation of periostin in patients with stable asthma would provide further information on the production of periostin in asthma.  Until now the periostin assay has only been used to determine the relationship of periostin with eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients not responding to inhaled steroid treatment and has not been studied in patients with stable, well controlled asthma.
This study is part of a programme of research being undertaken by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, aimed at furthering knowledge of periostin, in order to discover its clinical usefulness.
