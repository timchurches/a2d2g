  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is designed to be a rigorous intervention trial (randomised controlled trial) and will be conducted at the Army Recruit Training Centre (ARTC). The intervention will be a specific neuromuscular control (NMC) training program that will target neuromuscular efficiency, biomechanical skills and perceptual awareness.
The NMC training program will consist of the following:
Balance training. Conducted for up to five minutes post warmup and prior to every physical training lesson (approximately 46 lessons during recruit training).
Agility training. Conducted three times a week for up to five minutes. Consists of drills in cutting and turning, jumping and landing, and stopping and propping. 

The duration of the trial is from 23 Jan to 10 Aug 07.</interventions>

    <sequence>Recruits are enlisted into the Army in clusters of approximately 50-100 recruits, each week.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim
The aim of this project is to examine the efficacy of a Neuromuscular Control training program for preventing knee and ankle injuries in army recruits undergoing basic training.

Hypothesis 
That integration of a neuromuscular control training program into Army basic training will reduce the incidence of training-related knee and ankle injuries.</summary>
