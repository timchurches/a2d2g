  <interventions>
    <interventions>CBM (OxIGen) Active Version:
Internet-based cognitive bias modification intervention with 7 sessions (1 x 20 minute session/day) of auditory scenarios delivered over 1 week. Each CBM session consists of delivery of 64 initially ambiguous scenarios that terminate with a positive resolution.

+ ThisWayUp Sadness Program: a 6-lesson internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy program for depression. The Sadness Program includes evidence-based content for managing depression and anxiety. Each lesson (approximately 30 minutes) must be completed prior to advancing to the subsequent lesson. Patients are given 8 weeks to complete all 6 lessons. 

Patients first commence the 1 week CBM component followed by the 8 week iCBT component.
</interventions>
    <comparator>CBM (OxIGen) Control Version ( identical to CBM active, but with putative active components removed):
Internet-based cognitive bias modification intervention with 7 sessions (1 x 20 minute session/day) of auditory scenarios delivered over 1 week. Each CBM session consists of delivery of 64 initially ambiguous scenarios that terminate 50% of the time with a positive resolution and 50% of the time with a negative resolution.
