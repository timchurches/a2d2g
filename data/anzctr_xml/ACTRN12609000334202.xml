  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ten 30 minute sessions of physiotherapy over a 10-week period. This will involve a well defined manual therapy program, including mobilisation and or manipulation, and core lumbar stabilising exercises. These involve gentle contractions of the pelvic floor, lower abdomen and deep paraspinal muscles and will be taught in positions of side-lying, 4 point kneeling and standing. Treatment will take place twice weekly to begin with, then move to weekly and finally to fortnightly over the ten week period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two 30 minute sessions of physiotherapy advice over a 10-week period. This will involve condition specific advice regarding the prognosis and self-management of the condition. The first will take place shortly after randomisation and the second 6 weeks after randomisation.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers who respond to advertising, or who are referred by a medical practitioner or health care practitioner will undergo a phone screening and baseline physical assessment to determine eligibility. Eligible volunteers who consent to participate will complete baseline outcome measures prior to being randomised to the manual therapy or advice group. This will be done by the assessor contacting an off-site trial administrator who will hold the randomisation schedule, and will not be involved in assessing, enrolling or treating the participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher at La Trobe University who will have no contact with participants will generate a randomisation schedule prior to trial commencement. Permuted block randomisation with random block sizes will be undertaken using a web-based randomisation program. Randomisation will be stratified by developing a separate schedule for each of the 13 physiotherapy treatment clinics.</sequence>
