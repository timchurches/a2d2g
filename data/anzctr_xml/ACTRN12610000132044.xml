  <interventions>
    <interventions>Project Energize is a school-based nutrition and activity programme which aims to increase childrens activity levels, reduce sedentary time, and optimise nutritional
intake through changes in the school environment and culture. Potential benefits of this include increased ability to participate, improved body composition, improved dental health, and improvements in a range of associated health measures.
In 2004 primary schools (124) in the Waikato district were randomised to an intervention (62) or control (62). Energize staff (Energizers) work with between 6 and 8 schools and each school developed with the Energizer an individualised action plan based on the individual needs of the school. 
Supported by the Energizer within the school, physical activity interventions were aimed at encouraging and aiming for 20 minutes of high intensity physical activity every day; Increasing childrens lunchtime physical activity; Increasing childrens exercise everyday at home; and Increasing childrens incidental activity. The optimisation of children's nutritional intake was by Encouraging the ready provision of water for all children and promoting water intake; Decreasing childrens carbonated beverage intake (at school and at home); Decreasing the availability of energy dense foods at school and home;and Increasing fruit and vegetable intake at school and home.
Examples of facilitation include physical activity sessions modelled with teacher, leadership training for senior students, home school link programmes established, physical education and nutrition curriculum assistance, schools supported to achieve the National Heart Foundation's school food programme, works shops for sportiing disciplines provided.
The control schools were on a wait-list and are now all receiving the intervention as are all primary schools in the Waikato district.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Project Energize is a programme that aims to reduce childhood obesity through a
range of school based interventions. It began in 2004, following a request for
proposals from the Waikato DHB introduced to about one quarter of Waikato children within selected schools and involved interventions to increase physical activity, decrease sedentary time and improve nutrition to ALL children in the school regardless of willingness to participate in the evaluation study.  

The programme was evaluated by inviting children aged 5 and 10 years within the Project Energize schools and within the same number of schools where there was no specific intervention (beyond standard / national initiatives)  to participate in a longitudinal evaluation study.  In 2004 and 2006 children had weight, height, blood pressure, upper arm and abdominal circumference and body fat measured; and the parent / caregiver answered a written questionnaire to determine whether this programme has any positive impact on weight gain, fitness, oral health, asthma, bone fractures and hypertension.
