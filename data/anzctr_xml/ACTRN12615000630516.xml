    <interventions>Community-based care.
Participants allocated to the Intervention group will be followed-up by telephone for two years after discharge.  Community-based healthcare workers will telephone participants each fortnight in the first year and
each month in the second year. They will encourage participants to contact healthcare workers at the first signs of complications or as needed for support.
Each time the healthcare workers speak to a participant, the healthcare worker will screen the participant for complications using purpose-designed interview scripts. Specifically, the healthcare worker will screen for the first indication of a pressure ulcer, urinary tract infection, bowel impaction, bladder infection, depression, autonomic dysreflexia or respiratory complications. At the first indication of any of these complications, the healthcare worker will provide advice to participants and their families about management and then closely monitor the participant over the next few days or weeks until the complication is resolved.
The healthcare workers will also visit participants and their families in their homes. There will be two home visits in the first year and one in the second year. At each home visit, the healthcare worker will assess the participants home situation and provide advice as needed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care.
After discharge from hospital, participants allocated to the Control group will receive the level of care currently provided by the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed. That is, a healthcare worker may telephone Control group participants in the first month after discharge. On this one occasion only, the healthcare worker will provide the same advice to Control group participants as is provided to Intervention group participants on the first telephone contact with participants. Control group participants will not receive routine ongoing support from the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed although they will be free to seek any support they can access.</comparator>

    <concealment>Enrolment: People with recent spinal cord injury will be screened for inclusion by research staff prior to discharge from the Centre for Rehabilitation of the Paralysed in Bangladesh.
Allocation: A secure random allocation sequence will be generated by an independent researcher. Allocation will be stratified by level of injury (paraplegia or tetraplegia). The allocation schedule will be concealed from investigators, potential participants, and clinical and research staff in Bangladesh. A participantâ€™s allocation will only be revealed to the clinical staff administering the intervention. Randomisation will occur at
the time of discharge from hospital and will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is "off-site".</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, with the exception of secondary analyses which will estimate local average treatment effects (complier average causal effects and survivor average causal effects). Separate analyses will be conducted on each outcome. The analysis will follow a detailed statistical plan developed prior to inspection of the data. 
The primary effectiveness analysis will compare the rates of all-cause mortality in the Intervention and Control Groups using the log-rank test (two-tailed alpha = 0.05).
Between-group comparisons of secondary outcomes will be conducted using logistic regression for binary outcomes or linear regression for other outcomes. 
The cost-effectiveness analysis will involve a trial-based economic evaluation based on differences in overall survival and quality-adjusted survival at two years. In addition, a model-based evaluation will be conducted through a state-transition model which extrapolates long term costs and outcomes (survival and quality of life).
A sample size of 410 gives a better than 80% probability of detecting an increase in survival from 83% to 93% at two years with a two-sided log-rank test, uniform follow-up time of two years, loss to follow-up in both groups of 15% at two years, and alpha of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal cord injuries are four times more common in low income countries than in high income countries. In most low income countries, people who sustain a spinal cord injury are discharged home with very little access to support services. They often then develop life-threatening complications, and many die within years of discharge. It is not clear if a low-cost and sustainable community-based model of care for people who have returned home after spinal cord injury can prevent complications following spinal cord injury. 
We will investigate the effectiveness of a sustainable model of care which involves regular monitoring and provision of ongoing education and advice by telephone, together with a limited number of home visits, for patients and their families and carers. The service will be provided in the first 2 years following discharge when patients are most vulnerable to complications.
A pragmatic randomised controlled trial will be undertaken. The primary aim is to determine whether this low-cost community-based model of care reduces all-cause mortality of people with spinal cord injury in Bangladesh. Secondary aims are to determine whether this model of care
- reduces the burden of complications
- reduces the prevalence and severity of pressure ulcers
- reduces depression
- enhances quality of life, independence and participation, and 
- is cost-effective</summary>
