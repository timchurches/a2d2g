  <interventions>
    <interventions>A training session (15 minutes) will be undertaken in the laboratory at Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA). 
Participants will be assigned to one of three groups; forward step training (Arm 1), forward plus lateral step training (Arm 2), or no training group (Arm 3). Participants in the arms 1 and 2 will be asked to undertake step training while standing and taking quick and appropriate steps on the mat. A Step Training System (modified version of "Dance Dance Revolution (DDR)") was used to train stepping performance in forward direction only (Arm 1) or both forward and lateral directions (Arm 2). Individual training sessions will be conducted by a trained researcher who will monitor compliance to the training throughout the 15 minute session.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Two-way repeated measures ANOVA will be applied to examine the  potential interaction of time (pre/post) and group (forward step training/lateral plus forward step training/control) for the primary and secondary outcome measures. Post hoc analysis will be conducted with Bonferroni adjustment.

A total of 42 was estimated as required sample size to detect significant interaction of time and group based on our pilot data (effect size = 0.3, a = 0.0166 (0.05/3), power = 0.8, number of groups = 3, number of measurements = 2, correlation among repeated measures = 0.5, nonsphericity correction = 1). Based on this calculation, we will recruit 45 participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Step training has been recommended as a fall prevention strategy. However, it is possible that the repetitive step training in the forward and lateral direction might have negative effects for stepping ability in the diagonal (untrained) direction. Participants (45 adults 65+ years) will be asked to practice pre-administered exercise for 15 minutes in a single session. Baseline and post-intervention assessments will involve tests of stepping performance. </summary>
