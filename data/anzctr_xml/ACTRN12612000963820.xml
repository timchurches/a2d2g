  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this Study, it is proposed that a delayed treatment randomised controlled trial will review the effectiveness of the internet-based self help program Ontrack GetReal. The trial will involve a wait list (control group) and an intervention group. The wait list will be offered the intervention three months later.

Ontrack GetReal is a free online treatment program for people who are having odd or unusual experiences. The program may also help people in the early stages of psychosis, where they may be hearing voices or feel suspicious of other people. The program uses targeted evidence based therapy techniques that have been shown in research to be helpful with PLEs. 

The overall aims of this study are: 
1. To reduce distress associated with psychotic like experiences (PLEs)
2. To improve help seeking behaviours of young people if distressed 
3. To determine if having e-support/ therapist contact assists in achieving the above outcomes.  

This internet based delayed treatment trial will compare two different Groups.  

Group 1 (control) allocated participants will firstly be placed on a wait list where they will complete the baseline assessments but not be offered access to the GetReal program for 3 months.  They will receive an email each month to inform them that they are still waiting due to high demand and they will shortly be given access. 

Group 2 (intervention) will get full access to the GetReal program as well as access to an e-support/ therapist that will send automated step-care intervention emails based at re-engaging a participant who may log on for transient experience or unusual thought and then not continue to use the program.    This group will receive 4 emails across the 3 month period.  This email will review their use of the program and to prompt them to re-engage with the GetReal program should they require it.  

This study will be in a delayed treatment format to determine if the Getreal program improves the outcomes relating to (i) reducing any distress associated with odd or unusual experiences (ii) and/or increasing early help seeking behaviours compared to participants using a self-help program themselves.  

Participants will be randomly allocated to either the control or intervention group by a predetermined list of allocation. They will then complete all baseline measures and either (a) be placed on a wait list for 3 months or (b) have immediate access to the getreal program.</interventions>

      <outcome>To determine the effectivness of the Ontrack Getreal program for reducing the frequency and PLES in young people and the level of distress associated with them</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures used:
There are pre and post measures already in-built to the GetReal Program that monitor odd or unusual thoughts in young people and associated distress. These are collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. 

(i)	A modified CAPE (positive scale).  The CAPE (positive scale) is a 20 item self-report measures of positive subthreshold PLEs.  It uses a 4-point likert scale to indicate symptom frequency (never, sometimes,often,nearly always). It will be modified to ask,over the past three months, rather than, in your lifetime.  Young people will be asked to rate a 0-100 point visual analogue scale at the end of the CAPE, to indicate their current level of distress related to the positive PLEs. 

(ii)	K10. The K10 (Kessler psychological distress scale) is a 10 item self-report measure of psychological distress related to anxiety and depressive symptoms in the past 4 weeks.  Responses are rated on a 5 point scale (none of the time, a little of the time, Some of the time, Most of the time, All of the time) which is summed to provide a total score. 

A baseline telephone interview using the CIDI will be used to add rigor to the built in assessments.  The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)is a comprehensive, fully-structured interview designed to be used by trained lay interviewers for the assessment of mental disorders according to the definitions and criteria of ICD-10 and DSM-IV. It is intended for use in epidemiological and cross-cultural studies as well as for clinical and research purposes. The diagnostic section of the interview is based on the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO CIDI, 1990). The CIDI allows the investigator to: - Measure the prevalence of mental disorders - Measure the severity of these disorders - Determine the burden of these disorders - Assess service use - Assess the use of medications in treating these disorders - Assess who is treated, who remains untreated, and what are the barriers to treatment. Only the psychosis screen of the CIDI will be used.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Approval to conduct this study will be obtained through Queensland University of Technology (QUT) Ethics committee.  The previously approved study (“A cross sectional survey –No1100000187 ”) will be the source of recruitment, as any participant who completes the survey, meets the criteria for this study and has indicated that they would like to be contacted will be offered the information to be involved in this study. 

1.	Participants will be identified as meeting the required criteria. That Is, they will need to score on the CAPE assessment a score of at least 10 and 17&gt;/ K10.
2.	Participants will be offered the option to join the study via an email.  This email will contain the QUT endorsed recruitment flyer, participant information support and consent form. 
3.	Consent from participants will be obtained at the start of logging into the GetReal program and they cannot participate in this study until consent is acknowledged 
4. A baseline CIDI telephone interview will be completed and the approval for the Getreal program given.
4.	Randomisation to either the control group or the intervention group will be by using a predetermined list generated from a random number table.  Participants who consent and tick they ‘agree’ to participate will be allocated accordingly.
5.	Participants in the control group will then be placed on a waitlist and be sent an email notifying them of this.  They will get an email each month up to 3 months where they will be given access to the GetReal program.  
6.	Participants allocated to the intervention group will direct themselves through the program, but after two weeks will receive the first 'e-therapis/ support' email.  This will support them to continue.
7.	Participation for both groups will be for a period of 3 months.  However, the control group will be involved for 6 months, due to a 3 month ‘lag’ on the wait list. Once in the intervention group, participants will have contact from a e-therapist at week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 12 (completion).</concealment>
    <sequence>A predetermine list will be generated and the prinicnple resreacher is blinded to this process.  Once a person has completed all baseline mesure and approval into eth study has be given, they are allocated to the next predetermined group.</sequence>
