    <interventions>Participantes in Group A attened Tai Chi/Qigong exercise group training classed 3 times a week for 12 weeks followed by 12 week self-led 'at home' training.  Participants in Group B had no intervention during the first 12 weeks (waiting period); this was followed by Tai Chi/Qigong group training classes 3 times a week for the next 6 weeks, followed by self-led 'at home' training during the remaining 6 weeks</interventions>
