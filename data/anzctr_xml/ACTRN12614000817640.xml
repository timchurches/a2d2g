    <interventions>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), including anodal (a-tDCS) and cathodal (c-tDCS), is intervention in the current project.
 Since it is a new technique, the optimal parameters is unclear yet. Based on the literature, the safe current density should be less than 0.054 mV/cm2 and the duration of application should be less than 40 min.
In the current project, healthy participants received intervention with tDCS under each of five different conditions in a random order:  a-tDCS of primary motor cortex , a-tDCS of primary sensory cortex, a-tDCS of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, sham a-tDCS, and  no tDCS. The experimental sessions were separated by at least 72 hours to avoid interference or carry-over effects of tDCS, and completed at the same time of day to avoid diurnal variation. The duration of tDCS application was 20 minutes with amplitude of 0.3 mA and electrode size of 1.5 * 2 cm ( current density of 0.029 mV/cm2) in all experiments.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham transcranial direct current stimulation is the placebo treatment. In Sham transcranial direct current stimulation, the electrodes will be placed on the brain and the device will be turned on just for 30 second. The feeling of participants is completely similar to real (active) transcranial direct current stimulation sessions but in sham condition, there is no treatment effect.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The main outcome measure is the level of brain excitability in primary motor cortex. To measure the level of primary motor cortex excitability, we will use Transcranial magnetic stimulation on the primary motor cortex area and record the EMG activity of First dorsi interossous (FDI) muscle. The peak to peak amplitude of motor evoked potentials recorded from FDI muscle indicates the level of primary motor cortex excitability.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>All evaluations will be performed before (Tpre), immediately after (T0), 30 min (T30) and 60 min (T60) after the intervention. Also, one day after the intervention all evaluations will be repeated (Tday1).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second primary outcome measure is the level of excitability in primary sensory cortex. To measure the level of excitability in the primary sensory cortex sensory evoked potential (SEP) will be measured. and the peak to peak amplitude of N20-P25 responses generated in primary sensory cortex will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All evaluations will be performed before (Tpre), immediately after (T0), 30 min (T30) and 60 min (T60) after the intervention. Also, one day after the intervention all evaluations will be repeated (Tday1).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensory threshold (STh) to electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation will be applied by a pen electrode (model: 2762CC, Chattanooga, USA) to the right median nerve (pulse duration: 200 microsecond) at wrist level. Current supply will start at 0mA and will be increased in steps of 0.1mA until the participant reports sensation and pain. The intensity of current at which perception of the electrical stimulus is first reported will be taken as the STh.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain threshold (PTh) to electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation will be applied by a pen electrode (model: 2762CC, Chattanooga, USA) to the right median nerve (pulse duration: 200 microsecond) at wrist level. Current supply will start at 0mA and will be increased in steps of 0.1mA until the participant reports sensation and pain.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain threshold to the mechanical stimulation (PpTh): Pressure was induced using a pressure algometer (model: FDX 50, Wagner, USA; capacity: 50× 0.05Ibf, accuracy: ±0.3% of full scale) with a flat circular metal probe dressed in a plastic cover. Force was displayed digitally in increments of 0.1N. The algometer was mounted vertically. For each measurement the algometer was calibrated to enable force to be applied at a controlled and steady rate. PpTh was defined as the amount of force required to elicit a sensation of pain distinct from pressure or discomfort. The PpTh measurement point was marked in the middle of the belly of the FDI muscle.

    <concealment>Potential participants contacted the researcher by phone or email. Following this, those who wished to be sent explanatory statements and consent forms volunteer their additional contact details.
Based on the medical history forms answered by the volunteers, individuals who had no neurological or orthopaedics problem  were selected and referred to the physician to be sure that application of tDCS is safe for the volunteers. Then, the second researcher allocated a number for each participants. The order of intervention sessions and the order of measuring of the outcome measures were randomized by sealed opaque envelopes.   </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the effects of two independent variables, site of stimulation (S1, M1, and DLPFC) and time point (Tpre, T0, and T30), on MEPs, SEPs, STh, PTh and PpTh. Mauchlys test was used to assess the validity of the sphericity assumption for repeated measures ANOVA; it requires that the variances for each set of difference scores be equal. Greenhouse-Geisser corrected significance values were used when sphericity was lacking. Additionally, to test whether the baseline value of each stimulation site differed significantly from post-intervention time points (T0, T30), a paired-sample t-test was applied. 
A significance level of P = 0.05 was adopted for all comparisons. A post-hoc test (Bonferroni) was performed where indicated. Means are reported +/- SE. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 22.

Clinically, a minimum of a 20% difference between the level of excitability before and after the intervention  is needed  to be sure that the intervention is effective (the magnitude of the difference between a null hypothesis and a true alternative hypothesis).
As a result, to calculate the sample size, we run a pilot study and measured the level of M1 and S1 excitability. Regarding the Power based sample size formula, the number of participants was calculated. In the current study, the power was 0.9 and Alpha was 0.05. 
Based on the formula, the minimal needed participants was 11 and we recruited 12 healthy individuals.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain is the primary reason for patients to seek medical care. A survey found that 31% of the population in the united state and 19% of adult European population had experienced moderate to severe pain, with serious consequences for their social and working lives. The exorbitant medical treatment costs paid by governments and individuals can be decreased by better therapeutic approaches.
Parallel areas of brain are involved in experience of Pain which make it a  complex issue to manage. Lateral parallel nuclei and somatosensory cortex (S1) are responsible for discrimination of quality, location, and intensity of pain, whereas medical thalamic nuclei, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and limbic system have been proposed to subserve emotional dimensions of pain. Furthermore, it is suggested that neural communications between S1 and primary motor cortex (M1) may leads to motor cortex neuroplastisity  to reduce movement in order to prevent further injuries.
Non-invasive therapeutic approaches, including medication, electrotherapy, and manual therapy, can provide satisfactory pain control in only 20%-30% of cases of pain syndromes. In order to develop a more effective treatment method, it is therefore, needed to test other efficient methods. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), including anodal and cathodal tDCS, is one of the novel painless techniques used by neuroscientists to relieve pain. The optimal parameters, stimulation site and current density, for effective application of tDCS,  have not been studied yet. The findings of current study will be used to optimise the effects of new therapeutic approaches for pain relief.
