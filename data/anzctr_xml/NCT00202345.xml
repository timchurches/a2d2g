  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the complications of late stage kidney disease is the development of a low red blood
      cell count (anaemia/low haemoglobin concentration). The Australian Commonwealth government
      limits funding of medications (called erythropoietic stimulating agents) to those patients
      who have already developed anaemia.

      There is evidence supporting the beneficial effects of maintaining a higher haemoglobin in
      these patients. Higher haemoglobin can delay the onset of dialysis and reduce the development
      of heart enlargement. However, the administration of erythropoietic stimulating agents is not
      without risk, including a high financial burden, worsening of high blood pressure and a rare
      complication called pure red cell aplasia.

      Previous studies have shown that patients with chronic kidney disease require additional iron
      to maintain the production of red blood cells. Thus it would be timely to determine if the
      administration of iron sucrose to these patients can maintain a near normal haemoglobin
      concentration, without the need to start an erythropoietic stimulating agent and possibly
      delaying dialysis.

      Study Hypothesis: That administration of iron sucrose is superior to standard care in the
      prevention of anaemia in patients with stage 3 /4 kidney disease.</summary>
