  <interventions>
    <interventions>The loss of bone and soft tissue, the redistribution of fat and decreased dermal elasticicy and thickness contribute to the formation of wrinkles and folds, all commonly characterise the inevitable ageing process.

A single formalised and reproducible consultation procedure, would empower the patient to make an informed treatment decision individualised to their specific needs.

The primary objective of this study is to prospectively evaluate the utility of a computer generated software program, compared to a standardised patient education intervention over a 9 week period.  Both the education programs are administered at the Screening visit and then again at the week 9 visit, with the control arm being given the opportunity to complete the software at the completion of their W9 visits.   Both education groups are assessed as to the impact of the subjects decision making on medical aesthetic treatments.

The software programme takes approximately 45 minutes for the subject to complete and the control group education intervention is administered in the form of an information sheet and is read by the subect and should take no longer that 20 minutes to read and comprehend.</interventions>
    <comparator>A standard Patient Education Intervention was provided in the form of an infomation sheet with the subject asked to read this  in a quiet room  alone at the study site.  This information sheet consisted of specific information on skin ageing in 7 specific skin areas,:- The forehead, the eye region, the cheek &amp; nose region, the lower face region, the neck region, the chest region &amp; the hands.</comparator>

      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate the utility of the software program compared to information relative to a standard patient education intervention.  

The evaluation is based on a  series of self-administered questionnaires, assessing satisfication with the allocated education intervention.</outcome>
