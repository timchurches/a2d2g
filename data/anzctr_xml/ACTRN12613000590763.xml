  <interventions>
    <interventions>After informed consent is sought and the baseline questionnaire completed, participants will be randomized by computer-generated random number list into the intervention [detailed Skin Self-Examination (SSE) instructions] or control groups (general SSE instructions).   
Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive an information letter detailing an overview of the study, consent form, and reply paid envelope.  Participants will keep the Handyscope dermatoscope for one month, and will be asked to complete one SSE, and then email their selected lesions of most concern to the dermatologist for evaluation.  
Teledermoscopy materials

All participants will receive the following materials:
*	Dermatoscope attachment;
*	Instructions on dermatoscope functionality and how to email lesions for assessment;
*	An information booklet describing how to assess lesions using the Asymmetry and Colour Rule for detecting melanoma to allow selection of concerning lesions for submission to the teledermatologist. 

The detailed print-based instructions on how to conduct a thorough whole body SSE guiding participants towards hard to see areas such as the back or back of the neck and the use of two mirrors or utilising the assistance of a partner to visualise these areas, and are based on our previous studies (1).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Safety and feasibility of mobile teledermoscopy for Queensland residents 50-64 years of age at high risk for melanoma. A follow-up survey after their SSE to assess (1) whether they found any suspicious lesions, (2) comfort level with the procedures, smartphone and dermatoscope, (3) satisfaction with the Asymmetry and Colour (AC) Rule and materials provided, (4) mobile teledermoscopy acceptance, self-efficacy and skin cancer worry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month after all participants have completed their SSE.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the findings within the context of an existing technology acceptance model, and whether the technology acceptance model explains the intentions of people to use teledermoscopy in the future as well as their actual behaviour</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month after all participants have completed their SSE.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria include: Male and female between 50-64 years of age in Queensland.  Previous melanoma or skin cancer diagnosis, fair skin or high number of moles. In addition, stratified sampling will ascertain that 50% of participants will have a history of checking their own skin, whilst the other 50% will have no record of SSE.  All participants must be able to speak English to give informed consent.  Participants must have access to a smartphone.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>QSkin participants have already completed questionnaires assessing the inclusive criteria.  QSkin staff will select potentially eligible QSkin participants located in Brisbane (to allow for attending of clinical following-up skin examination), and at risk to develop skin cancer.  
In addition to QSkin volunteers an announcement via internet and a television news outlet has been made for additional volunteers that fit the eligibility criteria.
Participants will be randomised allocated to two groups.  The intervention group with SSE instructions and Control group with general SSE instructions will be supplied.

Allocation is not concealed.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Each consenting person from QSkin will be identified by their existing QSkin study number.  Subjects will be randomised by computer-generated random number list into the intervention (detailed SSE instructions) or control groups (general SSE instructions).   </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to measure counts and percentages or means and standard deviations as appropriate and will assess internal consistency reliability of the adapted TeledermAM.
Linear regression analyses to assess the relationship between participants characteristics and smartphone factors and technology acceptance overall score and logistic regression models to assess intention to use or not to use teledermoscopy in the future.
Changes in teledermatology acceptance or melanoma worry from baseline to follow-up will be assessed using paired samples t-test. 

The number of skin lesions photographed and submitted by participants who received detailed SSE instructions and those who received general instructions only will be summarised and compared using Chi-Square tests.
 
Unweighted Cohens kappa statistics will be used to measure agreement between teledermoscopy diagnosis and clinical diagnosis of lesions submitted by photographs.

Numbers consistent with usually requirements for a phase 1 safety and feasibility trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This study will test consumer use of mobile teledermoscopy in the home in combination with the Asymmetry and Colour (AC) lesion identification rule, which together may be a powerful tool for melanoma early detection in the future. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 50  64 years, living in Queensland, have had a previous diagnosis of melanoma or skin cancer, and have fair skin or a high number of moles. Trial details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of two groups. Participants in both groups will receive a Handyscope dermatoscope which they will keep for one month, instructions on dermatoscope functionality and how to email lesions for assessment, and an information booklet describing how to assess lesions using the Asymmetry and Colour Rule for detecting melanoma to allow selection of concerning lesions for submission to the teledermatologist. In addition, participants in one group will also receive detailed skin self-examination (SSE) instructions on how to conduct a thorough whole body SSE. The detailed SSE instructions will guide participants towards hard to see areas such as the back or back of the neck, and the use of two mirrors or utilising the assistance of a partner to visualise these areas. Participants in the other group will receive a set of instructions that will ask participants to look for and photograph suspicious skin lesions without specifying body areas to self-examine. Participants in both groups will be expected to complete one SSE during the month they have the Handyscope dermatoscope, and email their selected lesions of most concern to the dermatologist for evaluation.</summary>
