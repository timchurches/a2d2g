    <statisticalmethods>Cigarette craving and smoking satisfaction will be used to predict smoking reduction using multilevel structural equation models, with treatment group included as a variable. Smoking reduction during the pre-quit phase will be used in a logistic regression model to predict 4 week abstinence with treatment group as a covariate. Abstinence analysis will be conducted as intent-to-treat, dropouts will be counted as treatment failures.
The proposed sample size (n=216; 72 participants per group) was determined by the requirements of the primary research questions  detecting reductions in satisfaction (H1) and craving (H2) scores, and smoking rate (H3), between the SP and the two pre-quit treatment groups (PQP and VAR) at the end of the pre-quit treatment period (Visit 3). In a pilot study we observed moderate-to-large effects of pre-quit patch treatment on self-reported satisfaction with smoking, craving, and smoking rate during the pre-quit treatment period. Using these reductions as a proxy for between-group differences (assuming that these measures will not decrease during the pre-quit period for participants in the SP group), a conservative estimate of within-subject correlation of measures (0.5), our proposed sample will afford &gt;90% power to detect a difference in these measures. Our proposed sample size will also afford &gt;80% power to detect an effect of smoking reduction during the pre-quit phase on treatment outcomes.</statisticalmethods>
