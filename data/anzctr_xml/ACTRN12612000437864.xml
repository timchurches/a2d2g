  <interventions>
    <interventions>The active intervention is a web-based self-help program for suicidal thoughts. This program is based on cognitive behaviour therapy and consists of six modules that focus on 1) the repetitive character of suicidal thoughts, 2) regulating intense emotions, 3) identifying automatic thoughts, 4) recognising thinking patterns, 5) thought challenging, and 6) relapse prevention. Participants will be encouraged to complete one module per week, which will take up to a maximum of 15 minutes per day.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is matched for attention by providing a web-based 6-week program that presents lifestyle information on nutrition; physical and artistic activities; education; hobbies; finances; and social and family roles. There is no specific mental health or suicide-related content in this program. The control condition is matched for attention by providing interactive activities of the same duration as the intervention group, i.e. 15 minutes per day.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this pilot is the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial.
This will be assessed by examining the adherence to the program, study dropout rates, and acceptability of the program.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation of primary outcome 1 will take place at the end of the program, i.e. 6 weeks after commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigating all trial mechanisms. 
This will include testing the recruitment method by simple counts of applications through the different methods; testing the screening procedure by examining the number of respondents excluded due to each of the exclusion criteria; and testing the use of self-report questionnaires by analysing trends from pretest to posttest on suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, panic, coping, insomnia, rumination, hopelessness, burdensomeness and belongingness, disability, help-seeking, health care utilisation, and health status.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation of primary outcome 2 will take place at the end of the program, i.e. 6 weeks after commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Testing the web-programs and safety procedures.
The programs will be assessed by looking at usage data, such as number of modules and exercises completed, as well as by analysing feedback from participants about the program. In the case of safety procedures, the proportion of participants referred to crisis services who ultimately utilise these services will be calculated, giving an indication of the applicability and utility of these procedures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation of primary outcome 3 will take place at the end of the program, i.e. 6 weeks after commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>

    <sequence>Once participants have given their consent and have filled in the baseline questionnaire, they are randomised to either the active or the control intervention, using block randomisation, stratified by gender and severity of suicidal thoughts. The latter is defined as a score &gt; 7 on the Suicidal Behaviour Questionnaire-Revised.</sequence>
