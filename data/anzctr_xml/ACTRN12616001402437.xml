    <interventions>This clinical study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a new food supplement called "Amixea" in improving muscle strength and body composition in cancer patients, when compared to placebo.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination:
According to the literature, the expected mean fat free mass (FFM) as measured by DXA in the control group could be 49.06 kg, with a standard deviation of 10.38. Assuming that the minimum difference of interest between the comparison groups is 15%, the study group is expected to obtain a mean FFM of 56.42 kg. Under this hypothesis and considering a common standard deviation (ie. 10.38), 40 subjects per group (80 total subjects) will be required to detect this difference with 80% power, considering an alpha of 0.025 (two-tailed), to account for the two primary endpoints.
The literature review didn't provide data on quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (QVMC) among lung cancer that enabled formal estimation of the sample size. However, with 80 subjects, a difference of 7 kg between the two treatment groups can be assessed with a power higher than 80%, considering an alpha of 0.025 and a common standard deviation of 9 kg.   
Assuming a refusal rate of 20%, an attrition rate of 40% and allowing 15% extra for probable need to apply multivariable modelling techniques to adjust for confounding, we would need to approach 200 patients to enroll at least 160 subjects enabling 80 valid subjects at the end of the study. This sample size would be necessary not to lose the opportunity to detect clinically relevant differences in all primary and secondary outcomes. 

Primary outcomes analysis:
For both continuous primary outcome variables, ANCOVA will be used to evaluate whether outcome means are equal between Amixea and control groups at 10 weeks while controlling for the effects of covariates including baseline values.
The improvement of lean body mass will be assessed by DXA. The improvement of QMVC force will be assessed by dynamometer.

Secondary outcomes analysis:
For all continuous secondary outcome variables, ANCOVA will be used to evaluate whether outcome means are equal between Amixea and control groups at 10 weeks while controlling for the effects of covariates including baseline values.
For categorical secondary outcome variables (i.e., PGSGA ratings), chi squared test will be used to evaluate the sampling distribution between Amixea and control groups at 10 weeks.
Energy-yielding metabolites will be analysed using overnight fasted blood metabolites. 
Nutrition status will be assessed using global PG-SGA rating.
Nutrition risk will be assessed using PG-SGA score. Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be assessed using FAACT. Skeletal muscle mass area from L3 will be assessed in a subsample of patients who have CT scans within the prescribed timeframes. 

Safety oucomes analysis:
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) to give a preferred term (PT) and a system/organ class term (SOC) for each event. The number of patients who experienced at least one AE, trial product-related AE, serious AE, severe AE and the number of patients withdrawn due to AE will be summarized by treatment arm.
Descriptive analysis of vital signs will be performed by treatment group and changes from baseline will be analyzed within each treatment group using paired T-test. Comparisons between treatment groups will be performed using ANOVA.

Exploratory outcomes evaluation:
The adherence to the assigned treatment will be assessed by sachet count at Visits 3 and 4. The percentage of treatment correctly assumed will be estimated and compared by treatment group using Students T-test.
Patient satisfaction will be assessed by a Likert Scale. The patient satisfaction will be compared by treatment group using t-test for normally distributed data or Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data, as appropriate.

Population analysed:
The intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) populations will be analysed under the following conditions:  
-	If less than 20% of the data are missing; both PP and ITT analyses will be conducted.  
-	If more than 20% of the data are missing; only a PP analysis will be conducted.
The ITT population will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in the clinical setting. That is, all randomized patients will be included in the analysis. Any missing data will be coded as missing at random (MAR) or not missing at random (NMAR) and imputed using multiple imputation techniques. 

The PP population will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. That is, all patients who have completed the entire treatment protocol as originally planned and with perfect compliance will be included in the analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this clinical study is to investigate whether a new food supplement called Amixea can prevent or slow the loss of muscle mass and strength in patients with non small cell lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with Stage III or IV unresectable non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for which you are undergoing, or plan to undergo chemotherapy. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take a new food supplement called Amixea 3 times a day for 10 weeks. Amixea is a mixture of amino acids designed to prevent or slow the loss of muscle mass and strength in patients with cancer, particularly in those who show signs of cachexia. Participants in the other group will instead take a placebo (inactive) treatment for 10 weeks. The study will be double blind, which means that neither the patient nor the investigators will know which treatment the patients are receiving until after the study is completed.

All participants will undergo a number of assessments before and after the 10 week treatment period, including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans to evaluate body composition, muscle strength testing of the quadriceps (thigh muscles), and blood tests. They will also be asked to complete a number of questionnaires to evaluate nutritional status, quality of life, satisfaction with treatment, adherence and product tolerability. Results from patients treated with Amixea will be compared to those obtained from patients treated with placebo, in order to investigate the study product effects on cachexia. </summary>
