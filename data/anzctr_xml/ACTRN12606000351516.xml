  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of adding D-Cycloserine to group-based exposure therapy for panic disorder. It is hypothesised that individuals who receive D-Cycloserine and exposure therapy will attain a greater reduction in panic symptoms in comparison to individuals who receive placebo and exposure therapy. Participants from the community who have a primary diagnosis of panic disorder will receive three group based exposure therapy sessions in combination with placebo or D-Cycloserine. Exposure therapy consists of exposure to feared body sensations. Panic symptoms are assess one and three months later. All therapsists, assessors, and individuals entering data are blind to drug condition.</summary>
