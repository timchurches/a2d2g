  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Laparoscopic-Assisted Psoas blockade was conducted after induction of general anesthesia. Under laparoscopic guidance and  after achieving proper exposure of the psoas major muscle, a 5-mm horizontal incision was made in the ventral fascia of the psoas major muscle to provide a proper access for the block catheter. Successful catheter placement was confirmed by expansion of the plane between the psoas muscle and its corresponding fascia with 2 ml normal saline injection. After negative aspiration, twenty milliliters of plain bupivicaine (2.5 mg/ml) were incrementally administered through the catheter.</interventions>
    <comparator>Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block.In Group TAP: Ultrasound guided TAP block was performed under complete aseptic technique after induction of the general anesthesia, using a linear array transducer with adjustment of frequency, depth and gain to spot the best view. The ultrasound (Sonosite Inc., Bothel, Washington, USA) probe was initially placed in a plane transverse to the antero-lateral abdominal wall at a level midway between the lower costal margin and iliac crest. A 20-gauge needle (Stimuplex A, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) was introduced 3 cm medial to the ultrasound probe and advanced in a medial to lateral direction toward the target plane (TAP). Once the needle tip was presumed to be in the correct position (confirmed by expansion of transversus abdominis plane as a dark shadow between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis muscles with 2 ml normal saline injection), twenty milliliters of plain bupivicaine (2.5 mg/ml) was incrementally injected after negative aspiration under real-time imaging.  </comparator>

      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the total morphine requirements in the first 36 hours postoperatively</outcome>
      <timepoint>First 36 postoperative hours </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The time to first request for analgesia is defined as the time from completion of the block injection (taken as time zero minute) to the first postoperative administration of IV morphine. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The dermatomal sensory involvement of both approaches will be estimated bilaterally with pinprick and thermal tests after block performance.  The most proximal and distal levels of sensory involvement will be established if the same dermatome level will be recorded on three consecutive times. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The assessment will be done before induction of the anesthesia and at regular 30-min intervals for 3 hours postoperative. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All patients will be asked to rate their postoperative surgical pain at rest and while coughing by using a numerical rating scale (NRS) (NRS: 0= no pain, 10= worst pain) </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment will be at regular predefined time intervals (6, 12, 24, and 36 hrs) after completion of the block</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aimed to measure the opioid-sparing effect of the laparoscopic- assisted psoas blockade in comparison with the transversus abdominis plane block in patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. We hypothesized that the use of laparoscopic- assisted psoas (LAP) blockade can reduce the postoperative analgesic requirements following inguinal herniorraphy. </summary>
