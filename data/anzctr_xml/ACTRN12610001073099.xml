    <interventions>BN83495 Dosage and Administration
BN83495 (also known as STX64 and 667-coumate) is a first in class inhibitor of steroid sulphatase (STS), currently in clinical development to target steroid dependent cancers. STS converts oestrone sulphate to oestrone, a precursor of oestradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor of adrenal testosterone.
The oral dose of BN83495 is 40 mg daily, fasted (30 minutes before breakfast), given in the morning. BN83495 will be taken for 12 weeks.

BN83495 will be supplied by Ipsen Pty Ltd as tablets packed into conventional blister strips (10 tablets/blister).  

EGFR-TKI Dosage and Administration

The EGFR-TKI used in this study will be either Erlotinib or Gefitinib which will be taken for 12 weeks.

The oral dose of erlotinib is 150 mg daily, taken at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food.

The oral dose of gefitinib is 250mg daily, taken at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food.  

In stratum A, patients with NSCLC requiring treatment with an EGFR-TKI will be pre-treated with BN83495  for 3 days prior to starting the EGFR-TKI. In stratum B, patients already on an EGFR-TKIwill receive BN83495. All patients will continue to receive BN83495 for a period of 12 weeks, and be followed for these 12 weeks to determine the impact of treatment on existing skin condition.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer may receive, or already be receiving treatment with a drug called Erlotinib or Gefitinib. Erlotinib and Gefitinib are similar drugs that belong to a class of drugs that inhibit a specific biological receptor, called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), which is over expressed in a number of different cancers. One of the potential side effects of Erlotinib and Gefitinib is skin rash, which occurs in up to 75% of patients. In this study, we will investigate whether treatment with a new drug, BN83495, can reduce the severity and/or frequency with which this rash occurs.

BN83495 is an experimental drug, which is taken as a tablet, and is being tested as a possible anti-cancer treatment. The drug inhibits steroid production and is being developed by Ipsen Pty Ltd. Excess steroid production in the skin has also been linked to the development of acne and skin rashes. Therefore, it is our hypothesis that BN83495 pre-treatment may complement the use of erlotinib or gefitinib and reduce the severity of rash. This project will be performed at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and will involve approximately 10 to 20 patients. The aim of this project is to measure the frequency and severity of skin rash, and other side-effects, for patients treated with Erlotinib or Gefitinib and BN83495. Changes in the drugs and hormones bllod levels will also be measured. Patients will be assessed at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre weekly for a period of 12 weeks from the first day of treatment with BN83495.</summary>
