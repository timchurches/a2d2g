  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients having bilateral internal thoracic artery harvest for coronary bypass will be randomized to having one side dissected pedicled (artery and veins) or skeletonized (artery only) to determine if a method provides superior flow.

Both arms of the study require diathermy dissection of the mammary artery of the chest wall and clipping of the branches of the artery. The two techniques differ as the pedicled approach involves clipping of the branches of both the mammary  veins and artery and dissecting the mammary artery and veins en bloc from the chet wall while the skeletonized approach involves only clipping and dissection of branches of the mammary artery only and leaving the mammary veins in situ. Both techniques take approximately 30-40 minutes and both techniques are currently in widespread use.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Arterial Flow
The measurment will be conducted by timing how quickly the flow will fill a 50ml sterile pot.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured in theatre during operation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Arterial length
Arterial length will be measured by cutting a a piece of silk sutrure to the same length measuring the artery from the proximal end (marked by the subclavian vein) to its end and then measuring this vicryl with a sterile ruler.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients requiring bilateral internal thoracic artery harvest will be asked to participate in the study  by a research nurse. Then patient will be consented by a member of the the cardiac surgery research team.
Randomization will be single blinded by a sealed envelope method. Randomization will be performed independently by the cardiac research nurse office and the allocation communicated to the surgeon following opening of the pericardium and confirmation of the suitablility of coronary anatomy for randomization.</concealment>
