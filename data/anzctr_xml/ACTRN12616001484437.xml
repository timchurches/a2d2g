    <interventions>7 Tesla (7T) Ultra-High Field Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI)
Participants will be recruited from patients with cardiac scar tissue undergoing routine clinical CMRI with gadolinium contrast agent at 1.5 Tesla. All recruited subjects will have an additional 7T CMRI with gadolinium contrast agent.
CMRI is a painless, non-invasive test that involves lying in a scanner. Each patient will first undergo one 1.5T scan of approximately 1 hour duration as part of their normal clinical care. Within 4 weeks of their clinical scan, consenting participants will be asked to come to the imaging facility at The Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland. There they will undergo one additional 7T CMRI scan of approximately 1 hour duration.
The results of the clinical 1.5T CMRI scan and the experimental 7T CMRI scan will be compared to 
1. evaluate the performance of 7T CMRI compared with standard CMRI at 1.5 T.
2. determine whether 7T CMRI can provide adequate images to measure heart function and scar tissue imaging.</interventions>
    <comparator>The 7T experimental scan is compared to a 1.5T clinical scan, performed on the same patient. The clinical CMRI scan, used as a comparator, is performed at 1.5 Tesla magnetic field strength with injection of gadolinium contrast agent and has a duration of approximately 1 hour. LV and RV volumes and the presence/absence of myocardial enhancement are assessed.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The following parameters will be measured and calculated from CMRI results:
1.	Left ventricular (LV) volume fraction and ejection fraction (LVEF);
2.	Right ventricular (RV) volume fraction and ejection fraction (RVEF);
3.	Left ventricular mass (LV mass);
4.	Pulmonary artery flow and stroke volume;
5.	Aortic flow and stroke volume;
6.	Non-contrast Native T1 mapping (if available);
7.	End-diastolic mass;
8.	End-systolic mass and;
9.	Extracellular volume fraction.
An ANOVA will be carried out to test whether the measurements of each participant are internally consistent (for example, arterial stroke volumes are similar to ventricular stroke volumes) and across magnetic field strength. The multiple comparisons problem will be controlled using a Bonferroni adjustment, with the Family Wise Error Rate restricted to 0.05.
Finally, the Bland-Altman method will be used to examine the relationship between the measurements of the parameters at different field strength (that is, 1.5T versus 7.0T).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research project proposed is to develop cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) techniques currently used at standard magnetic field strengths (1.5 or 3 Tesla) for significantly higher field strengths at 7 Tesla (7T). The aims are as follows:
1. To valuate the performance of 7T CMRI compared with standard clinical CMRI at 1.5T.
2. To determine whether 7T CMRI can provide adequate images to measure heart function and cardiac scar imaging.
Methods:
Participants will be recruited from patients with cardiac scar tissue undergoing routine clinical CMRI with gadolinium contrast agent at 1.5T. All recruited subjects will have an additional 7T CMRI with gadolinium contrast agent.
CMRI is a painless, non-invasive test that involves lying in a scanner for a duration of approximately 1 hr. The results of the clinical 1.5T CMRI scan and the experimental 7T CMRI scan will be compared.</summary>
