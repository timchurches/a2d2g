  <interventions>
    <interventions>This 12 month study involves an educational intervention whereby: 
(a) GPs providing follow-up care to consenting patients may(group1) or may not ( group2) have access to an online education program. The education program being tested in this study is an online learning program. This educational program involves participants ( GPs) answering emailed case based questions which will be delivered to all practices via email. The Spaced Education  program will focus on the management of patients following active treatment by a specialist, which may include surgery, radiotherapy and hormonal treatment. GPs will be sent 2 case studies with questions 2-3 times a week with 2-3 reminders. Questions will be repeated 14 days later if answered correctly and 21 days later if answered incorrectly. The program is completed when each question is answered correctly twice. The intervention developed for this feasibility study is expected  to take only a few minutes  every second day for approximately 6 weeks.
There will be no additional resources provided to the patients.</interventions>
    <comparator>GPs allocated to group 2 do not have access to the educational program and patients are managed as per standard procedure. This means that the GPs are free to access existing prostate cancer guidelines if they deem this necessary to manage the patients.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 

Patients will be asked to complete the HADS. This scale contains 14 items; 7 items measure depression and 7 measure anxiety. It has established reliability and validity and is commonly used for cancer patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After each follow-up appointment with their GP for up to one year after recruitment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30): 
This questionnaire contains 30 items including functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive functioning); symptom scales (measuring pain, fatigue and nausea and vomiting); an overall health status and quality of life scale; and other items measuring dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial impact. The psychometric properties of the scale have been validated in a range of different cancer types. 

In addition the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-PR25) will be used. 
This prostate-specific questionnaire is used in conjunction with EORTC QLQ-C30. It contains 25 items, including five scales: urinary symptoms, bother due to the use of incontinence aid, bowel symptoms, hormone treatment-related symptoms and sexual functioning. Studies support the psychometric robustness of this questionnaire.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of cancer detected at an early stage of the disease is rising, which means that more people require adjuvant cancer treatment and are surviving for longer periods of time. As a result, cancer specialists are faced with large numbers of patients who not only require treatment but also long term follow-up care. In Australia, radiation oncology clinics are heavily subscribed and patients appointments are subject to waiting lists. This situation would be improved if patients who have completed their treatment could be discharged to the care of their GP. It is anticipated that routine follow-up with a specialist will not be possible in the future and alternative safe and effective strategies for follow-up need to be developed.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Australian men. Although prostate cancer is life threatening, the majority of patients who present with early disease live beyond five years. While treatment increases survival rates, a myriad of associated physical side effects may have an impact on the patients quality of life. Common side effects of radiation therapy include: loss of sexual potency, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, urinary tract symptoms, incontinence and proctitis. If prostate cancer is not treated early patients are also at risk of disease spread. Following radiation therapy patients therefore need to be monitored for both side effects and disease spread. The provision of follow-up care for prostate cancer is under-researched.

GPs are well placed to take on the role of providing follow-up care for patients who have previously been treated in specialist clinics. However, previous studies report that GPs have varying knowledge of the use of radiation therapy and  consequently have limited expertise in managing side effects and providing appropriate referral. Innovative educational resources therefore need to be developed to assist GPs in advising patients who have received radiation therapy.

Hypothesis:
The evidence based resources (GP educational program) will assist GPs in providing follow-up care to patients and increase patient enablement. If GPs are able to take on this role in the multidisciplinary team, other patients will be able to access radiation oncology sooner and radiation oncology will be able to provide rapid access to patients who require urgent treatment or care.</summary>
