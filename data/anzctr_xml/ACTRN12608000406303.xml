  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study treatment is allocated to eligible subjects randomly. Subjects have an equal chance of being allocated to receive Pyridorin 150 mg orally, twice a day (BID) taken for 52 weeks or Pyridorin 300 mg orally BID taken for 52 weeks or placebo taken orally for 52 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy variable is Serum Creatinine change from baseline to endpoint. The serum creatinine is measured via subject blood sample analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum Creatinine is measured in the blood samples drawn from subjects each full visit during the study. Visits typically occur at screening, randomisation (considered day 0), month 1, 3, 6, 9, week 51 and week 52. If the subject enters a run-in period, additional visit may occur to the discretion of the investigator, in order to allow the subject to meet eligibility criteria.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum Creatinine slope. The serum creatinine is measured via subject blood sample analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum Creatinine is measured in the blood samples drawn from subjects each full visit during the study. Visits typically occur at screening, randomisation (considered day 0), month 1, 3, 6, 9, week 51 and week 52. If the subject enters a run-in period, additional visits may occur to the discretion of the investigator, in order to allow the subject to meet eligibility criteria. Blood samples will also be measured at these visits if applicable.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>24-hour urine protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) change. This is measured by analysing subject urine samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at screening, month 6 and month 12. If the subject enters a run-in period, additional visits may occur to the discretion of the investigator, in order to allow the subject to meet eligibility criteria. PCR will also be measured at these visits if applicable.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety of Pyridorin compared to placebo, as assessed by adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), seated blood pressure, heart rate, physical examination, body weight, clinical chemistries, glycosylated hemoglobin, and hematology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Different safety parameters are measured at different visits in the study. Blood pressure, heart rate, body weight and Adverse Events are reviewed at each full visit. ECG and physical exams occur twice during the study, whereas certain blood parameters (such as serum chemistry and heamatology) occur three times (around the start, middle and end) during the study.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this project is to determine if the study drug, Pyridorin, at doses of 150mg orally twice daily or 300mg orally twice daily (compared to placebo), has an effect on the blood values (specifically serum creatinine) of subjects' who have kidney disease from type 2 diabetes.</summary>
