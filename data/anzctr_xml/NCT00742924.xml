    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Limiting Toxicity - The occurrence of Limiting Toxicity defined as Any CTC AE version 4 Grade 3 and 4 non-hematologic toxicity thought to be possibly, probably or definitely related to zoledronic acid with the specific exclusion of:
Grade 3 nausea and vomiting controlled with adequate antiemetic prophylaxis.
Grade 3 transaminase (AST/ALT) that occurs during the evaluation period but resolves to = Grade 2, before the planned dose of therapy after definitive surgery.
Grade 3 fever or infection.
Grade 3 or 4 hypocalcemia (see Section 5.1.1)
Grade 3 mucositis.
Grade 3 fatigue that returns to = Grade 2, before the planned dose of therapy after definitive surgery.
Grade 3 joint range of motion, decreased or joint effusion that is related to the primary tumor.</outcome>

      <outcome>Histologic Response as Assessed in the Primary Tumor and in Resected Metastases - Histologic response as graded according to the system of Huvos across all specimens resected at the time of local control in the primary tumor and in resected metastases.
The best response, as quantified by maximum necrosis grading according to the system of Huvos across all specimens resected at the time of local control, will be used to quantify the effect of Induction chemotherapy.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one
      drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of zoledronic acid
      when given together with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed
      metastatic osteosarcoma.</summary>
