  <interventions>
    <interventions>Camptothecin-11 (CPT  11): 80 mg/m2 in 250 ml normal saline 0,9% over a 90 min infusion followed immediately by:
Folinic acid (FA):   200 mg/m2 in 500 ml normal saline 0,9% over a 120 min infusion
5-Fluorouracil (5FU): 450 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) bolus, given 60 min after initiation of FA infusion.
The regimen will be administered once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks on days 1,8,15,22 followed by a 2  week rest period. Start next cycle on day 36, for a total of 6 treatment cycles (unless intolerable toxicity occurs, which requires discontinuation of treatment).
The treatment consists of 6 treatment cycles in total. Each cycle consists of 4 weeks of treatment followed by a 2-week rest period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this multicenter randomized phase III trial is to compare the disease free and overall survival and to assess the toxicity profile of Dukes B2 and C colon cancer patients treated postoperatively with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (FA)  (which is considered as standard adjuvant treatment) or with a regimen including the same drugs plus irinotecan (CPT 11).</summary>
