    <interventions>The M.A.D.E 4 Life program will be conducted as a pilot randomised control trial (RCT) with a wait-list control group. All participants (mothers and daughters) will be assessed at baseline, with follow-up assessments at 10-weeks and 20-weeks. The intervention involves mothers and daughters attending 90 minute information and physical activity sessions once a week for eight weeks, lead by a qualified PD/H/PE teacher. The sessions will involve educational information and physical activity fun. The information sessions will focus on physical activity and behaviours to support and achieve physical activity and fitness goals for mothers and promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles for their daughters. The physical activity sessions will involve the mother and daughter engaging in a variety of fun physical activities to increase self-confidence, fitness, role modeling behaviours of mothers and bonding time between mother and daughter. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory (SCT); self-efficacy, goal setting, social support and outcome expectations.</interventions>

    <concealment>Voluntary, informed and written consent will be obtained from all mothers and their daughters. Participants will be instructed to call the study phone line if they are interested in the study and screened for eligibility via telephone. Participants over 40 years of age will be required to receive doctor's clearance prior to commencement of the study. 
Once written consent is obtained, the participants will be invited to baseline assessments and randomized to one of the two study groups. To ensure concealment, the random allocation sequence will be generated by a statistician and given to the project manager. Randomization will be completed by a research assistant who is not involved in the assessment of participants and the allocation sequence will be concealed when enrolling participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The major aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a program designed to increase physical activity participation, and to improve self efficacy, health and lifestyle behaviours in both mothers and their daughters. M.A.D.E 4 Life program is specifically designed to unite mothers and daughters in a fun, educational setting where both parties can experience positive behaviour change the improvements in self-efficacy and overall health and wellbeing. A secondary aim of our project is to determine whether having a mother participate in a physical activity program has an effect on their daughters health and lifestyle behaviours. Parents influence the physical activity behaviours in the home environment through their behaviours, attitudes, and approach to physical activity and by being a role model. Parents of primary school children, in particular, play a pivotal role in changing a childs environment to facilitate healthy physical activity behaviours.</summary>
