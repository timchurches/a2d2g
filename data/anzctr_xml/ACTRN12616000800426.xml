  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cross-sectional observational study using real-time ultrasound to measure lumbar multifidus resting thickness and recruitment in amateur pace bowling cricketers and non-cricketers (the "control"group). Single session measurements to be performed with no follow up required. Approximately 15-20 minutes per session required to perform all measurements. A fourth year undergraduate Bachelor of Physiotherapy (Honours) student is assigned as the principal investigator and performed all measurements.</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy age matched control population to amateur cricket pace bowling group. Observational measurements made again.
Demographic details (age, hand dominance, low back pain or injury history, sporting history) were gathered through a survey sheet. Height and weight were measured to calculate BMI for each participant. Ultrasound movies approximately 20 seconds long captured for lumbar multifidus on the left and right sides at rest and in a contracted state (4 movies total). All collection to take approximately 15-20 minutes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Statistical difference between cricket pace bowlers and non-cricketers when comparing left and right sides of lumbar multifidus resting thickness. Ultrasound imaging (Venue 40 Model R1.x.x; GE Helathcare, Jiangsu, P.R. China) with a force probe (Gilbertson, M. &amp; Anthony, B., 2011) for between image standardisation used to capture images of the muscle. Image J software will be used to analyse the images.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Previous data from Hides et al (1992) was used in the sample size calculation, who reported medically relevant difference of 2.2 and an estimated standard deviation of 2.5. Alpha was set at 0.05 and Beta was set at 0.2, meaning the power was 0.8. Using a nonogram a required sample of 40 was found to be required. 
ImageJ software will be used to measure lumbar multifidus thickness and recruitment from still ultrasound images.
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets will be used for all calculations.
To determine between group differences SPSS Software (IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0) will be used. Parametric (unpaired T test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U) tests will be conducted to determine statistical between group differences.</statisticalmethods>
