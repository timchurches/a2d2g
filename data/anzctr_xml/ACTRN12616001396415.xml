  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the operation theatre of Safdarjung Hospital, new delhi, general anesthesia will be induced with midazolam 1mg, fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg, propofol 1- 2 mg/kg and vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg and trachea of the patient will be intubated, Patient will be given either ultrasound guided paravertebral block (n=25) or ultrasound guided serratus anterior plane block (n=25) with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine by a staff anesthesiologist with experience of both the blocks ( more than 50 each). 
1. Group SAB:--- Ultrasound guided serratus anterior plane block-  
This block will be given in supine position. Linear transducer (8-13Mhz) probe of ultrasound machine (Sonosite M-Turbo, Sonosite Inc., USA) will be  placed in mid-clavicular region of thoracic cage in the sagittal plane. The latissimus dorsi, teres major and serratus anterior muscles will be identified between 4th and 5th rib. The fascial plane between serratus anterior muscle and latissimus dorsi muscle will be identified. 20 G sonosonic needle will be introduced in-plane with respect to ultrasound probe from superio-anterior to posterio-inferior direction. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, 20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected superior to the serratus anterior muscle.

Group PVB:  Ultra sound guided paravertebral block--- 
This block will be given in the lateral position. The transducer (linear, 38mm, high frequency 8-13MHz) probe of ultrasound machine (Sonosite M-Turbo, Sonosite Inc., USA) will be placed parallel to the spine, above the transverse process of T4 vertebrae and T5 vertebrae. The thoracic paravertebral space will be identified as a wedge shaped hypoechoic space between internal intercostal membrane and pleura. 20 G sonosonic needle will be inserted in an out of plane approach and advanced under ultrasound guidance until the tip penetrates internal intercostal membrane. Hydro-dissection will be used to locate the tip of needle. 20ml of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected and movement of pleura downwards will be used as confirmation of block.
Anesthesia will be maintained with O2/ N2O/ 0.8-1% Isoflurane. At the end of surgery, .  Neostigmine 50 mcg/kg and glycopyrrolate 10 mcg/kg will be given I.V. and trachea  extubated. Patient is  shifted to PACU for intensive monitoring of vitals.A resident blinded to block will assess the pain relief and adverse effects at regular intervals for next 72 hrs.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome is post-operative morphine consumption in first 24 hrs post surgery. All observations intra-operatively and post-operatively will be made by a resident, who will be blinded to the type of block given to patient. .Postoperative analgesia will be provided using Patient Controlled Analgesia pump (PCA- T34L, Caesarea Medical Electronics, Israel), attached to the patient in the immediate post operative period.  The pump settings will be  morphine- 1 mg/ml; bolus dose 1mg, lock out time 15 mins and maximum dose allowed will be 4mg/hr. Patient will be instructed to use PCA pump whenever she has pain with VAS score greater than 4. PCA pump has a memory that stores the morphine administered to patient</outcome>
      <timepoint>The amount of morphine administered to the patient in  first 24hrs post-surgery by PCA pump will be recorded by the resident.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of the block- Patient will be instructed to note the first time she uses PCA pump for pain relief on a patient diary. That will be rescue analgesia time </outcome>
      <timepoint>Rescue analgesia time- Time between the administration of block to the first use of the PCA pump by the patient will be recorded as the duration of analgesia of the block</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Pain will be assessed by the patients themselves using self rating VAS ranging from 0 (pain free) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). This VAS score will be explained to the patient before surgery. </outcome>
      <timepoint>VAS score will be assessed at 4 hrs, 6hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs after block administration and recorded by the resident, who is blinded to the study</timepoint>

      <outcome>Resident will assess the patient for any adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, respiratory problem and itching. </outcome>
      <timepoint>assessment for any adverse effects like nausea, vomiting, respiratory problem and itching will be done at 4 hrs, 6 hrs, 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs. </timepoint>

      <outcome> morphine consumption by patient in first 48 hrs and 72 hrs postsurgery using the PCA pump will be recorded as secondary outcome</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) may be associated with severe post-operative pain, leading to impairment of respiratory gas exchange or chronic pain syndrome. We will compare the analgesic efficacy and safety profile of two new and promising ultrasound guided nerve blocks: paravertebral block and serratus anterior plane block for these surgeries.
Methods: This study will be conducted on 50 adult females,scheduled for Modified Radical Mastectomy. After inducing general anesthesia,patients will be given either ultrasound guided paravertebral block (n=25) or serratus anterior plane block (n=25) with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine to freeze the nerves. After completion of surgery, patient will be monitored in recovery for adequate pain relief and any adverse effects of the block. Patient will be attached to a I.V.PCA pump for morphine administration, whenever she has pain. The resident will assess the adequacy of pain relief and any side effects at regular intervals.
