  <interventions>
    <interventions>Receiving psychosocial care and evaluation by telehealth by a psychologist/social worker. The assessment will be administered via telehealth using a WebEx interface across the internet. Questionnaires will also assist in the evaluation and care processes. Communication for appointments may be via letter, email, text messaging, or phone. Semi-structured clinical interview based on the validated Home &amp; Environment Education, Employment Eating Exercise Activities and Drugs Sexual activity Sexuality and Suicide/Mental Risk (HEADSS) assessment. The assessment involves discussing a range of important aspects relating to the young persons psychosocial and mental health issues, family, peers, relationship, school and other concerns. This may involve incidental supportive counselling and may involve incidental support through cognitive behavioural coping strategies. however the primary intervention is the structural interview process. The assessment is intended to take approximately 15-20 minutes for completion of questionnaires and about 5 minutes after the interview assessment. The assessment with the psychologist will take approximately 1 hour.
The evaluation and care will be assessing satisfaction of care, perceptions of care providers, anxiety and depression aspects.
The psychosocial assessments will be administered at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 month timepoints. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	Acceptability of the assessment
Measured using: 
*Youth Satisfaction Questionnaire (YSQ)17,18: 5 items assessing satisfaction with care and overall experience, followed by several ratings of specific aspects of psychosocial assessment process. 
*Acceptability questions about online assessment/intervention relative to a hypothetical in-person version (or vice versa) by participant and by staff
*The Working Alliance Inventory (Horvath &amp; Greenberg 1983) : 12 items assessing the young persons perceptions of their relationship (rapport and understanding) with the AYA clinical psychologist/social worker who conducted their assessment. This questionnaire has been modified to use Australian terminology.
*Treatment Credibility and expectations questionnaire (modified for the purposes of this study).

</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures are completed by each study participant at 4 time points in total throughout the study (at study entry, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months). The data will be viewed once 40 patients have completed treatment, once 80 patients have completed treatment and finally once all study participants have completed treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2.	Feasibility 
*Protocol adherence to gold-standard processes (e.g., frequency of multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) where all the necessary people are there, proportion of times that a GP chooses to be linked in to the process, etc)
*Technical difficulties and logistical aspects of delivering/receiving intervention including Kilometers from YCS to home in kilometers (using Google maps) and total time taken to travel to appointment, including travel and parking time as well as any out of pocket expenses (eg parking, petrol). One direction only.
*% appointments conducted within a reasonable timeframe, timeliness of assessment administration

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3.	Distress and Quality of Life during study period
*AYA Oncology Screening Tool 
*Kessler10 (assesses anxiety and depression symptoms in the past 4 weeks). There are 10 items widely used with Australian AYAs and recommended as the Australian Federal Government mental health measure.
*AYA cancer-specific quality of life: Peds-QL-AYA (Ewings etc 2009)

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4.	Cost-effectiveness / cost-utility: Eight items will be devised in consultation with the Cancer Research Economics Support Team (CREST), an initiative of Cancer Australia. 
*Also, comparison of the cost of delivering psychosocial service in-person or by teleconference will be made. Savings for patients and their families in terms of distance, time and expense per visit will be collected for all the patients.
1.	How the participant heard about the service
2.	Demographics 
3.	Understanding of telemedicine and how they feel about having support using this method, as well as preferred method of support at baseline in an ideal-world situation

    <concealment>Patients are approached by the study coordinator/treating doctor/psychologist/social worker to consider the study. Once voluntary, informed consent is obtained, an independent person outside the Oncology Department is contacted to reveal the allocation for the patient.
The doctor/study coordinator who enrolled the patient will not be involved in patient allocation. Allocation is concealed using sealed opaque envelopes prepared by an independent statistician. The envelopes will be kept in another department.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size has been predetermined to be 130 participants. Assuming a standard deviation of the anxiety measure (AYA Oncology Screening Tool) from questionnaires to be 4.7, power of 80%, and 5% confidence interval, the minimum effective size difference between the two treatments is estimated to be 2.31 units. This means, that if there is a difference between telehealth and in-person treatments, it will be deemed to be significant if that difference is over 2.31 units with other factors remaining constant.
Patients who consent to participation will be allocated a randomised treatment based on a pre-determined randomised list that has been generated by an independent statistician. Patients who decline their allocated randomisation will be excluded and their allocation will be allocated to the next consenting study participant. Patients who want to move treatment arm will also be excluded. However data from excluded patients who completed the study will be used in the study analyses.
Randomised patients will be analysed according to the treatment they received. Interim results will be reviewed when 40 patients and 80 patients have been recruited and again when 120 patients have been recruited. The outcome measures will be analysed at start to examine baseline profiles, then at 6 months and annually. Data will be adjusted for fixed factors and analysed using multifactor models to test significant differences between telehealth and in-person evaluation methods. Other factors influencing the trial will be also examined.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether telehealth is more cost effective, feasible and acceptable than in person psychological support for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 15 years and 25 years and have been newly diagnosed or have relapsed with cancer, for which you will undergo curative or palliative therapy at any paediatric or adult cancer centre in NSW or ACT. 

Study details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive psychological support via telehealth, whilst participants in the other group will receive in person psychological support. The psychosocial evaluation will be carried out at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.  All participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires at these time points relating to treatment acceptability and satisfaction, anxiety and quality of life. This will enable us to work out how effective telehealth is in implementing psychosocial support among AYAs with cancer, while also assessing its use as an age-appropriate model of delivering support, taking into account developmental concerns around autonomy and independence. An additional aim is to demonstrate evidence supporting the validity of the AYA Psychosocial Assessment Screening Tool and Psychosocial Assessment. While the distress thermometer (DT) is widely used and has been validated in numerous adult cancer populations, participants under the age of 18 have been excluded. Thus, there isnt currently a validated instrument for measuring distress amongst AYAs with cancer. </summary>
