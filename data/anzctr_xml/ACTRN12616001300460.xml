  <interventions>
    <interventions>Encourage oral hydration up to 2.5 hours before commencement of afternoon colonoscopy list.  This is done by offering two 600 ml bottles of Gatorade at the pre-anaesthesia consultation along with written instructions for their use on the day of the procedure.  Each 600 ml bottle contains 36g sugars, 13.7 mmol sodium and 3.6 mmol potassium.  The written instructions explained that the drink was to be consumed between 0700 and arrival at hospital on the day of the procedure around 1100.  Participants were asked what actual volume they had consumed in the recovery room after the procedure.</interventions>

Sample size estimation:
The primary outcome of this study was to achieve a 50% reduction in the incidence of significant orthostatic changes in haemodynamic variables (blood pressure reduction and pulse increase).  The reported incidence of this being 20% after receiving sodium phosphate and picosulfate for bowel cleansing.  To achieve a reduction of 50% (20% to 10%) in orthostatic changes, 199 patients were required in each group, allowing for p 8 0.05 and power of 80%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to test whether enhanced fluid intake on the morning of a colonoscopy can avoid some of the deleterious effects associated with bowel preparation and prolonged fasting.
It will examine whether increased fluid intake of up to 1,200 mls of Gatorade during the morning, up to 2.5 hours before the start of the afternoon list will alter the incidence of fluid depletion and dehydration, and the associated symptoms and clinical signs such as headache, dry moth, thirst, dizziness, postural hypotension and concentrated urine.  This will be compared to a control group fasting from 0600 on the day of the procedure.</summary>
