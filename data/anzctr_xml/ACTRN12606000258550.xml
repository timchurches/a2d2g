  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project is a definitive randomised controlled trial of early CPAP in preterm infants of 25 to 28 weeks' gestation  comparing CPAP at birth with intubation and ventilation at birth. 
1. Nasal CPAP (continuous positive pressure) - applying oxygen under a low continuous positive pressure through the nose.
2. Intubation and ventilation - support from an infant ventilator with pressure delivered via a tube in the wind pipe (trachea).</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Sealed opaque envelopes</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatment allocation will be either to nasal CPAP at 8 cm H2O or to intubation and IPPV. Allocation will be assigned randomly using a random number generator and permuted blocks for each centre. This will be produced by the statistical department of the Royal Children's Hospital. Randomisation will be stratified into two gestational age groups: 25 and 26 weeks', and 27 and 28 weeks'. This will reduce any imbalance in gestational age between the groups and allow analysis of the groups seperately. The assinged treatment will be enclosed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. There will be a separate set of envelopes for each gestational age stratum in each centre.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The standard treatment of very premature babies has been intubation and ventilation at birth. Recent non-randomised studies have shown that some of these babies can be managed with oxygen provided under a low continuous positive pressure into the nose and that this may improve some of their outcomes. This trial will be the first randomised trial to compare these two treatments and determine which has the optimal outcome for the baby.</summary>
