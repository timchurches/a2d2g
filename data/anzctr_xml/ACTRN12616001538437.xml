  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either the intervention or usual care. The intervention consists of:

1)	A Question Prompt List (QPL) translated into the participants own language
2)	A copy of an audio-recording of one of the participants interpreted hospital consultations for the participant to take home and listen to.

The QPL is a paper-based list of commonly asked questions by people with cancer.  It is posted to the participant a week prior to their hospital consultation. 

The audio recording of the consultation is transferred to a USB stick  immediately after the consultation and given to the patient to take home with them.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual clinical care.  Usual clinical care in this context consists of the provision of an interpreter to interpret the consultation.  There is very little or frequently no other resources offered to patients in their own language.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Methods, procedures and feasibility testing will be assessed within each language group (Arabic, Greek, Mandarin and Cantonese), as well as review of overall trial function. Testing will be achieved through completion of the following objectives. 

1. Assessment of screening and recruitment processes
Including recruitment rates; inclusion/exclusion criteria; and adherence and withdrawal rates for patients, clinicians and interpreters.

2. Assessment of project resources
Including quality of translations; cultural acceptability of documents provided to patients; and usefulness and appropriateness of intervention materials including the QPL and audio-recording.

3. Assessment of project measures
Including quality of translations; questionnaire booklet suitability and completion rates; and the adequacy and appropriateness of the coding and matching process to the measurement application (assessment of information recall). 

4. Assessment of design and procedures
Including interpreter bookings and cancellations; clinician availability and appointment delays; intervention delivery; and any additional unexpected culturally-specific aspects arising as part of the trial.  

5. Assessment of time and costing
Including time spent by project team on recruitment, intervention delivery, questionnaire delivery, translation and transcription, patient contact and data management.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Indication of intervention effectiveness, specifically, proportion of information from the consultation accurately recalled by the patient, will be assessed by inspecting the mean differences between study arms. These will also be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data from Arabic, Greek, Mandarin and Cantonese speaking cancer patients will be analysed separately, because the outcome of feasibility assessment may be different for each language group. This information will be critical to the planning of a Phase III trial. 

For each language group, descriptive statistics will be used to summarise demographic and clinical data and data relevant to the assessment of recruitment processes, project measures, design and procedures, and time and costing. These will be calculated and presented for each study arm separately as required.

Mean differences between study arms on information recall and information seeking will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals to ensure the level of uncertainty associated with each estimate is clear.

Mean differences between study arms on the remaining outcomes will be included for completeness only. These will also be estimated with 95% confidence intervals. After inspection of the data, the appropriateness of the stated methods will be revised if necessary.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our team has recently completed two studies on the unmet needs, psychological morbidity, quality of life and patterns of care of 1483 people with cancer from Arabic, Greek and Chinese speaking backgrounds. Compared to English-speaking patients with cancer, patients from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds had greater communication issues, unmet information needs and psychological distress. Without sound understanding and recall of information provided, patients cannot be actively involved in treatment decisions and provide informed consent to treatment. Our team has level I evidence which demonstrates that audio-recordings of consultations and question prompt lists (QPL) are highly effective in increasing recall and meeting information needs in English-speaking patients with cancer. This Phase II study will investigate whether this level I evidence can be used in applied to a CALD population. This study draws on the Medical Research Council (UK) framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions.</summary>
