  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Clinical seizure(s) and history consistent with focal epilepsy

          -  At least two confirmed spontaneous seizures, at least 24 hours apart, in the 12 months
             prior to enrollment

          -  Complete AED history prior to enrollment (with approximate dates and doses) is
             available (exception can be made for AEDs taken for &lt;1 week)

          -  Age =12 years and =60 years at time of seizure onset

          -  Age =12 years and =60 years at time of enrollment

          -  Treatment instituted not more than 4 months prior to enrollment

          -  One of the following:

               1. Normal MRI with inter-ictal EEG showing focal abnormality (focal sharp waves or
                  focal slowing)

               2. Normal MRI and normal inter-ictal EEG, with clinical or electrographic seizure
                  activity on ictal EEG

               3. Definitive clinical history of recurrent seizures consistent with focal epilepsy,
                  adjudicated by central reviewers, if normal MRI and normal EEG

               4. Focal lesion (non-progressive) on MRI with normal EEG (acceptable focal lesions
                  include MTS, FCD, single cavernoma, and AVMs that are not of large size and lack
                  significant amounts of hemosiderin)</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Idiopathic or symptomatic generalized epilepsy

          -  Any epilepsy etiology that could produce significant gliosis or brain injury and would
             be likely to alter biomarkers. These include:

               1. Epilepsy with an etiology occurring in the previous two years that would produce
                  significant CNS injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury that involves direct
                  disruption of brain tissue, stroke, encephalitis)

               2. History of intracranial bleeding (e.g., subarachnoid, intraparenchymal)

          -  Identified genetic epilepsy syndrome

          -  Presence of moderate or greater developmental or cognitive delay prior to seizure
             onset (e.g., if an adolescent, not in self-contained classroom; if IQ is documented,
             should be &gt; 70)

          -  History of chronic drug or alcohol abuse within the last 2 years

          -  IGE/focal epilepsy mixed syndromes

          -  Progressive neurological disorder (brain tumor, AD, PME, etc.)

          -  Major medical co-morbidities such as renal failure requiring dialysis, metastatic
             cancer, HIV, or significant liver or renal disease

          -  Autism Spectrum Disorder

          -  Seizures only during pregnancy

          -  History of previous or current significant psychiatric disorder that would interfere
             with conduct of the study</exclusivecriteria>
