  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will attend four intervention sessions for each outcome measure in random order. These sessions will include:
1.	An experimental session where they will receive chiropractic care alone. Chiropractic care will involve a full spine adjusting session delivered by a registered chiropractor that will be approximately 15 minutes in duration. 
2.	An experimental session where they will receive a brain computer interface (BCI) intervention alone - this intervention involves the participant performing a motor imagination task where they picture a muscle movement taking place alone. No external device is used to apply the BCI intervention. This intervention will be approximately 15 minutes in duration and will be guided by a research assistant. 
3.	An experimental session where they will receive a chiropractic intervention followed by a BCI intervention as described above. This session will last approximately 30 minutes.
4. Control intervention
There will be a one week washout period between interventions.

</interventions>
    <comparator>A control session where they will receive no BCI intervention or adjustments but will be repositioned as if the chiropractor was going to adjust their spine (i.e. cervical, thoracic and lumbar adjustment setups). This will act as a physiological control for time, as well as the vestibular, cutaneous and muscular afferent discharge changes involved in moving and touching the subject when preparing for the adjustments. Care will be taken to ensure no forces are applied to individual segments during the control intervention.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants may include students, staff, faculty, and previous patients of the Colleges chiropractic centre. Subjects will be eligible for inclusion if they are English speaking, aged 18-40, and have previously sought chiropractic care, and have some history of recurring spinal dysfunction such as mild pain, ache, and/or stiffness with or without a history of known trauma. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects will be ineligible to participate if they exhibit no evidence of vertebral subluxations, have absolute contraindications to spinal adjustments, have experienced previous significant adverse reactions to chiropractic care, or they are suffering from a current upper limb disorder/dysfunction that would make them unable to carry out data recording sessions (e.g. sprain/strain/fracture), and if they have sought treatment for the subclinical pain symptoms.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is possible that chiropractic care may enhance the efficiency and accuracy of BCIs that are currently in development or operation. In this project we plan to investigate whether adjusting dysfunctional segments in the spine alters motor cortical output to the tibialis anterior muscle when it is applied in conjunction with a BCI intervention. If we find that spinal manipulation enhances BCI interventions this may be important for brain injury rehabilitation.</summary>
