  <interventions>
    <interventions>2.5mg/kg Ropivacaine (up to maximum of 200mg) based on booking weight, diluted to 40ml,  then injected under the Transversus Abdominis Plane 20 ml each side
The Ropivacaine will be injected by the surgeon under direct surgical vision
The injection will be administered prior to the final layers of tissue being sutured close
Fidelity will be maintained by providing specific training to 2-3 surgeons and only allowing them to perform the intervention for involvement in the study.

    <exclusivecriteria>Non- elective Lower Uterine caesarean Section (LUCS) patients as obtaining informed consent and accurate follow up and would be problematic. 
Those with a ASA status of 3 or greater have been excluded as they are likely to require a more flexible and a less protocolised anaesthetic and analgesic management for their treatment regime. 

Opiate tolerance  defined as those patients already on opiate medication or those with a history of opiate addiction

Perioperative medications that differ or are expected to differ from the study protocol
Those who receive a regional anaesthetic at the discretion of their treating anaesthetist that differs from the study protocol 
or obstetrician who considers or requests a uterotonic agent that differs from the study protocol 
postoperative analgesia regimen 
unable to tolerate NSAIDS, Paracetamol or endone/ Targin

Failure of the NAB

Bleeding diathesis ( e.g. vWF ): at risk of haematoma at injection or operative site

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is comparing the analgesia outcome of surgically guided direct vision Transverses Abdominis Plain ( TAP) block versus standard surgical infiltration of Pfannenstiel wound during elective Lower Uterine caesarean Section (LUCS)  delivery via the Pfannenstiel incision, under Neuraxial Blockade (NAB) anaesthesia at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. The Null hypothesis is that there is no difference in analgesic outcome between these two techniques. The study will also seek to compare post operative nausea and vomiting PONV rates, sedation, pruritis and patient satisfaction score between these two groups. It will also look at ease of instillation of the Local anaesthetic in the correct plane and whether this correlates to analgesia outcome.</summary>
