               1. past history of seizure due to any cause except a single febrile seizure in
                  childhood. Patients with a history of seizures should not have had a seizure
                  within 12 months of Screening and must have had no anticonvulsants for 12 months
                  prior to Screening,

               2. history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic attack (TIA),

               3. history of traumatic brain or head injury with loss of consciousness

               4. unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months,

               5. presence of a space occupying lesion in the brain including previously treated
                  brain metastasis(es) or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor,

               6. history of arteriovenous malformations of the brain,

               7. history of brain infection (i.e., abscess, meningitis, or encephalitis),

               8. current use of medication that may lower seizure threshold

               9. presence of Alzheimer's disease, meningioma, leptomeningeal disease from prostate
                  cancer.

          -  Subject is able to swallow the study drug and comply with study requirements.

          -  Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while on treatment.

          -  Male subject and his female partner who is of childbearing potential must use two
             acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier
             method of contraception) starting at Screening and continuing throughout the study
             period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.

             1. Two acceptable forms of birth control include:

               1. Condom (barrier method of contraception), AND

               2. One of the following acceptable forms of contraception is required:

                    1. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
                       caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

                    4. Vasectomy or surgical castration at least 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  Male subject must use a condom, if having sex with a pregnant woman.

          -  Male subject must not donate sperm starting at Screening and throughout the study
             period and for at least 3 months after final drug administration.</inclusivecriteria>
