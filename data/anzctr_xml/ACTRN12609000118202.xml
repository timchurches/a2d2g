  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intra-vaginal pressure generated by the contraction of pelvic floor muscle (PFM)of the participants was assessed through three different brands of perineometers (Neurodyn Evolution, SensuPower and Peritron) each consisting of a vaginal probe connected to an electronic device, which indicates the values of contraction.
the Neurodyn, SensuPower and Peritron models have latex, nontoxic PVC and silicone rubber probe respectively
Neurodyn Evolution: Probe Lengh: 9,3 cm, Probe Diameter: 3,2 cm, national equipment.
Sensu Power: Probe Lengh: 8,2cm, Probe Diameter: 3 cm, national equipment.
Peritron: Probe Lengh: 10,8 cm, Probe Diameter:2,8 cm, imported equipment.
Each volunteer was evaluated on three alternate days by a single investigator, using a single brand of perineometer daily. In the assessment was required to undertake maximum of 3 contractions of PFM, with an interval of 30 seconds between them, and sustained for 5 seconds.
The patients were evulueted through all three different brands of perineometers and the average peak value of the three contractions was used to compare the three equipments results between them.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison between measurements obtained from different equipment (perineometers: Neurodyn Evolution, SensuPower and Peritron)to measure the pressure vaginal.
