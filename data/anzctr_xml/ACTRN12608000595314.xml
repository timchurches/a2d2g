  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lack of physical activity (PA) is a major cause of ill health and disability, and increasing physical activity is one of the national health priority areas. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that 6.7% of the total disease burden in Australia is due to insufficient physical activity, and two of the three higher ranked causes are also related to PA: Overweight 8.6% and high blood pressure 7.3% of disease burden respectively. PA is protective against cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, several cancers, and diabetes, and forms part of the treatment plan for many diseases including depression.
General practitioners are aware of the benefits of exercise but do not currently have effective ways to get patients motivated and active, and generally do not make use of allied health staff in this area. If this project successfully demonstrates a PA intervention that is acceptable to GPs and patients it could have wide spread public health benefits.</summary>
