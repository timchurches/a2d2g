    <interventions>Sun-style Tai Chi exercise training
Short form Sun-style Tai Chi is a low-impact exercise which involves both upper and lower limb. This form consists of 21 moves in total and it was designed by Dr Lam, who is a general physician and Tai Chi master in Australia. 
The duration of the course is 12 weeks (2 times per week for 12 weeks, about 1 hour each time)
Assessments, for exercise capacity, muscle strength, balance and health related quality of life, will be performed at baseline and also after 12 weeks Tai Chi training</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group has no Tai Chi training. All participants will continue their standard medical care for the duration of the study - 12 weeks. 
Pulmonary rehabilitation including exercise training and education will be offered after the study</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to determine the effect on Tai Chi training on exercise capacity in people with COPD. 

Hypothesis: On completion of an 12 week training program, subjects with COPD will demonstrate significant improvement in exercise capacity, compare with the control group with no Tai Chit raining. 

Significance: If Tai Chi improves exercise capacity in people with COPD this would provide an alternate form of exercise training which does not require exercise equipment thus making effective exercise training more accessible for the large numbers of people with COPD.</summary>
