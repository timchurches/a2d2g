  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients allocated to the treatment group will receive two individual training sessions daily during the five weekdays, in which the morning session will be supervised, and the afternoon session will be unsupervised. The training sessions will comprise of walking and resistance exercises and will be carried out by a trained physiotherapist. The training will commence within 48 hours of admission until the patients are allowed to be discharged from the hospital. We expect each session (supervised or unsupervised) to take no longer than 30 minutes (inclusive of rests).

Resistance training includes sit to stand, half squats and step exercises. Initial prescription will be determined by one set of individualised number of repetition based on the baseline Sit-To-Stand-Test score. The exercise prescription will be increased by one set on every second day of training.

Walking training will be prescribed based on the baseline two-minute walk distance (2MWD) and progressed on every second day of training by increasing the distance walked during each session by 20%.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients allocated to the control group will receive the usual medical and physiotherapy care given to patients admitted with an acute exacerbation of COPD according to the Malaysian Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG). It is expected that patients will receive usual care each weekday and the duration of the treatment will range between 15 to 30 minutes (depending on their individual needs). 

In this guideline, a patient will be discharged if they meet all the criteria for discharge listed. Therefore, patients allocated to the control group will be involved in this study until they are allowed to be discharge from the hospital. 

Patients allocated to the control group will receive usual care which includes: 

Usual Medical care as described in the Malaysian COPD Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG).

Usual Physiotherapy care may comprise airway clearance (if required), strategies to minimise dyspnoea (e.g. pursed lip breathing and positioning), and encouragement to mobilise in the ward.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
Assuming a between-group difference of 15% +/- 14% (alpha = 0.05, 1 - beta = 0.8), a sample size of 15 participants per group was needed (30 in total). This number was increased from 30 to 38 to allow for a 20% attrition rate

Data analyses:
Within- and between-group differences were analysed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (two-way RM-ANOVA). Differences were expressed as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Analyses were undertaken according to an intention-to-treat basis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aims at investigating the effects of a standardised exercise training program that comprises of walking and resistance exercises on exercise capacity, quadriceps muscle strength and functional performance in patients hospitalised with an AECOPD.

Study hypotheses
In patients with COPD who are hospitalised with an acute exacerbation of their disease, those who are allocated to the treatment group will show a significantly greater improvement in 2MWD, quadriceps muscle force, performance in the STST and TUG, and physical activity compared to the control group.</summary>
