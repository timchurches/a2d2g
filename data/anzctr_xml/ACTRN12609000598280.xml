  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physical Therapy to pelvic floor, with exercises to strength the perineal muscles in different positions: lying, sitting and standing. The women were submitted to twenty sessions of 40 minutes duration each, twice a week for a total of twentysessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>one group with a protocol with pelvic's floor physical therapy with a physical therapist and other group with perineal exercises during their activities at home. These exercises at home were done twice a week during twenty minutes for a total of eleven weeks. The participants were instructed to clench their buttocks, contractig their pelvic muscles on standing position when they were washing their cloths, when they were squated to sweep the floor and when they were sitting with their backs comfortably. in all this positions they were instructed to count of three and repeat the exercise ten times, for a total of twenty minutes including all the exercises.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>muscle strength of pelvic floor. The muscle strength were  evaluated by the vaginal touch. This evaluation were performed by physical touch from the investigator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after a  physical therapy protocol</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the minumum  number of attended sessions to increase the strength on pelvic floor mucles. The number minimum means that the muscle of pelvic floor could be increase after ten, fifteen or twenty attendings, because the evaluation were done after ten, fifteen and twelve sessions, by the vaginal touch. The pelvic fllor muscles were evaluated by physical touch from the investigator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after ten, fifteen and twenty sessions.</timepoint>
