    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - irinotecan hydrochloride
Treatment: drugs - temozolomide

Experimental: Disease measurable by CT or MRI scan (Irinotecan/Temozolomide) - Measurable by CT scan (Computed Tomography) or MRI scan (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV (10 mg/m2/dose) over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 and oral temozolomide (100 mg/m2/dose) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Disease eval by bone marrow or MIBG (Irinotecan/Temozolomide) - Evaluation by bone marrow or MIBG scan (metaiodobenzylguanidine scan, a radiopharmaceutical). Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV (10 mg/m2/dose) over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12 and oral temozolomide (100 mg/m2/dose) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response - Complete Response (CR), Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) and Partial Response (PR) - The patient's best overall response obtained during Reporting Periods 1 and 2 will be scored as "best response". Patients enrolled on Stratum 1 with bone marrow disease, a responder has no tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on 2 subsequent bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least 3 weeks apart. For patients enrolled on stratum 1 with MIBG only disease, response will be assessed using the Curie scale. Patients who have complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions (CR) or resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion with persistence of other lesions (PR) will be considered responders. For Stratum 2 a responder is defined to be a patient who achieves a best overall response of CR, VGPR or PR from CT/MRI scans from central review using (RECIST) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor. A responder is defined to be a patient who achieves a best overall response of CR (Complete Response), VGPR (Very Good Partial Response) or PR (Partial Response).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and temozolomide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving irinotecan together with
      temozolomide works in treating young patients with recurrent neuroblastoma.</summary>
