    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring

Hypertensive patients - No intervention. Patients will be sumbitted to standard tests required for hypertension management, including ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and pharmacologically treated according to recommendations of international guidelines. The registry will include data from subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria and whose data are contained in existing databases collected by the participating centers and who are regularly followed-up at the center. New subjects can be enrolled for this project, but they must be submitted to ambualtory blood pressure monitoring because it is required for evaluating their hypertension status, according to current recommendations.


Treatment: devices: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with arterial stiffness evaluation at 6-12 month intervals.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Registry is an investigator-initiated, international, multicenter, observational,
      prospective study aiming at: i) evaluating non-invasive 24-h ambulatory blood pressure and
      arterial stiffness estimates (through 24-h pulse wave analysis) in hypertensive subjects; ii)
      assessing the changes in estimates following treatment; iii) weighing the impact of 24-h
      pulse wave analysis on target organ damage and cardiovascular prognosis; iv) assessing the
      relationship between arterial stiffness, blood pressure absolute level and variability, and
      prognosis. Approximately 2000 subjects, referred to 20 hypertension clinics for routine
      diagnostic evaluation and follow-up of hypertension, will be recruited. Data collection will
      include ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, performed with a device allowing simultaneous
      non-invasive assessment of blood pressure and arterial stiffness, and clinical data
      (including cardiovascular outcomes). A web-based telemedicine platform will be used for data
      collection. Subjects will visit the centers at 6-12 month intervals. First follow-up results
      are expected to be available in the next 2-years. The results of the Registry will help
      defining the normalcy thresholds for current and future indices derived from 24-h pulse wave
      velocity, according to outcome data. They will also provide supporting evidence for the
      inclusion of such evaluation in recommendations on hypertension management.</summary>
