  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be anaesthetized in an area with appropriate monitoring, resuscitation equipment and assistance in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand College of the Anaesthetists guidelines. After pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen to reach the end-tidal oxygen (O2) = 70%, patients will be given induction agents and neuromuscular agent of choice at the discretion of the anaesthetist involved with the patients overall care. Patients will be placed in the sniffing position with the head on a pillow and ventilated via a face-mask with 100% oxygen until complete paralysis is achieved. Patients will then be intubated with either the Miller straight blade laryngoscope or the Video Laryngoscope, according to the study allocation. The intubation will be performed by an experienced anaesthetist (&gt; 10 years experience) who is familiar with the use of both devices (&gt; 10 uses on each device) prior to the study. The McGrath Videolaryngoscope blade will be inserted along the midline of the tongue, with the introduction of a styleted endotracheal tube angulated according to the curve of the Video Laryngoscope blade, as suggested by the case series studies. If more than one attempt of intubation is required, the patient will receive bag-and-mask ventilation between attempts and various manoeuvres can be introduced, such as, external laryngeal pressure, readjustment of stylet and bougie assistance. Failed intubation is defined as failure after three attempts. An alternative airway management plan can then be resorted to at the discretion of the anaesthetist.  This is a one-off treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Intubation with the C-MAC Videolaryngoscope.  The tip of the C-MAC (registered trademark) Videolaryngoscope blade will be advanced towards the vallecula, in the same way it is advanced with a Macintosh blade. The position of the device will be adjusted to have the glottis in the center of the screen.  This is a one-off treatment.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patient information from the Royal Melbourne Hospital pre-admission clinic is reviewed, looking for patients that fit the inclusion criteria.
If it seems that they will fall into the inclusion criteria, one of the researchers will approach the patient and explain the trial before gaining informed consent.
The patient will then be given a number unique to the trial so that their hospital identification number is not used. This allows de-identification of participants.
Using a computer program, the patientâ€™s number will be randomly allocated into either the McGrath Videolaryngoscope group or the C-MAC Videolaryngoscope group.  The randomisations will be concealed in a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intubation is one of the most important skills that anaesthetists have. There are currently many different intubating devices available. Anaesthetists have to develop and maintain skills with more than one type of device, so that when faced with difficult tracheal intubation, a safe alternative technique can be used without causing complications. Both the McGrath and the C-MAC videolaryngoscopes are relatively new intubating devices, which have a high-resolution camera and light source embedded at the distal end of the blade. They allow a view of the anterior glottis without the need for a direct line of sight. Both devices claim to provide a comparable or superior glottic view when compared with direct laryngoscopy using the standard curved Macintosh blade. However, the design of the shape of the blades between the two videolarygoscopes are very different. Currently, there are no studies comparing the use of these two devices in patients with potential difficult airways, which are usually the most useful situations.

The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to compare the effectiveness of using these two devices in performing endotracheal intubation in adult patients with predicted difficult airways.

The research is designed to be conducted in 130 adult patients with Mallampatti 3 or 4 (one of the predictors of difficult airways) and ASA 1-3 having oro-tracheal intubation for elective surgery . After informed consent, the patients will be randomized to having either the McGrath or C-MAC videolarygngoscopes for the intubation. The primary outcome is the timing of intubation. Secondary outcomes include the glottic view, ease of intubation, number of attempts required, haemodynamic changes and also any associated complications.</summary>
