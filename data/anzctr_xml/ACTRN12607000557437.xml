  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Perineal tears or cuts are common with childbirth and are often painful. Women are often advised to use ice packs to help relieve the pain, although there is very little evidence that this is effective. This trial will compare pain relief using two regimes of applying ice to the perineum. One group of women will have an ice pack applied to the perineum after giving birth, then replace it occasionally. The other group will have ice packs held firmly in place and be advised to rest and elevate the region. The results will enable a more evidence-based approach to care than is currently available.</summary>
