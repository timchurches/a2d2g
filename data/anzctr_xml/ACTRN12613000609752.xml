  <interventions>
    <interventions>Students will be observed for presence of Paediatric flatfoot with use of the Foot Posture Index. The foot posture index is a measurement tool that uses 6 criteria (Talar Head palpation, Curves above and below the lateral malleoli, Inversion/Eversion of the Calcaneus, Bulge in the region of the TNJ, Congruence of the medial longitudinal arch, abd/adduction of the forefoot on rearfoot). 

The type of flatfoot (Typical Flexible flatfoot, Rigid Flatfoot, and Skewfoot)will then be determined using the Paediatric Flatfoot Proforma. The Proforma involves observations such as Medial arch height, Heel eversion, Heel Inversion with tip toe, Tibial and knee positions, Navicular Height, Resting Calcaneal Stance Position, Muscle tone, Ligament laxity as well as History taking. 

The Proforma will performed twice on each participant by four different raters. The second measurement will take place 2 weeks after the first measurement. The total time taken to perform the proforma on 1 participant by 1 rater will be approximately 5 minutes.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be entered and all analyses performed using constructed data sets in SPSS version 20 and Microsoft Excel 2010 software packages. Inter-rater, intra-rater and intraclass coefficients (ICC) will be calculated using 95% confidence intervals. Calculating ICCs allows for comparison to previous studies. 

For Samples size a power calculation concluded that eleven participants per examiner (3 Examiners) would be statistically significant. The power calculation was calculated using a probability of type 1 error of 0.05 and aiming for the study to have a power of 0.8. A correlation coefficient of 0.7 is the figure Evans claimed to be statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our study is to determine the reliability of the Paediatric Flatfoot Proforma assessment tool for differentiating pes planus sub types.

We will be recruiting primary school children aged between 7-12. We will then determine whether they have a flat foot and then determine what sub type of flat foot they have. All of these measures will taken by 4th year podiatry students using an assessment tool titled the Paediatric Flat Foot Proforma. </summary>
