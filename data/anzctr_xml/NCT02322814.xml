  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This three-cohort, multi-stage, randomized, Phase II, multicenter trial will evaluate the
      safety and tolerability and estimate the efficacy of cobimetinib plus paclitaxel versus
      placebo plus paclitaxel in Cohort I, of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab plus paclitaxel in
      Cohort II, and of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel in Cohort III in
      participants with metastatic or locally advanced, triple-negative adenocarcinoma of the
      breast who have not received prior systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
      Participants may continue on study treatment until the development of progressive disease
      (PD) or the loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal. The
      Cohort I target sample size is 12 participants for the safety run-in stage and approximately
      90 participants in the expansion stage. Each of Cohorts II and III will consist of a safety
      run-in stage of approximately 15 participants followed by an expansion stage of approximately
      15 participants.</summary>
