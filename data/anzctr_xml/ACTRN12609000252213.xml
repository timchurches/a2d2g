  <interventions>
    <interventions>low risk excercise intervention including low to moderate intensity walking, accumulating approximately 30 minutes daily, during 18 weeks of chemotherapy. Patients in this intervention will be undergoing first-line chemotherapy. Most ovarian cancer patients in Australia receive 6, 3 weekly cycles of intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy. The length of time in between cycles will be 3 weeks i.e. women receiving first-line chemotherapy are generally administered agents intravenously on day 1 of week 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility i.e. ability to recruit and retain participants, assessing achievable amount, intensity and pace of exercise prescription (via a log-book), measuring exercise adherence (via a log-book and accelerometer) and any adverse effects (via a log-book and medical records review). During the intervention women will be asked to complete a exercise log-book of their exercise duration and intensity each week of the intervention. "Assessing achievable amount" simply refers to the weekly medium minutes (and range) of exercise women with ovarian cancer achieve over the course of their treatment. Participants complete the exercise log-book. The exercise physiologist will visit each participant weekly and collect exercise adherence data and information on any adverse events.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at end of study ie end of primary treatment
Participants will be contacted by our exercise physiologist to organise a baseline assessment prior to chemotherapy commencement and a follow-up assessment, at the end of first-line chemotherapy. The timepoint above refers to the follow-up assessment. Both the baseline and follow-up assessments will include the six minute walk test and questionnaire about demographics (baseline only), distress, quality-of-life, symptoms, current physical activity and support services utilised. At the end of the study we will look at changes in outcomes from baseline to follow-up. Additionally the exercise physiologist will collect weekly data on exercise adherence and any adverse effects. A follow-up post-intervention review of medical records will also be conducted to obtain other outcome data e.g. chemotherapy completion information and adverse events recorded by clinicians. The exercise physiologist will collect data on exercise adherence and any adverse effects weekly for 18 weeks during the study duration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Potential efficacy i.e. number of chemotherapy cycles completed and overall chemotherapy completion rates (assessed by medical records review) and change in fatigue, physical function and distress over the chemotherapy course (assessed via baseline and follow-up questionnaires). The questionnaire includes validated measures of current physical activity (Active Australia Survey), fatigue, pain, cognition, and insomnia (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale), distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality-of-life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian) and standardised demographic questions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the feasibility and potential benefits of exercise for women undergoing primary treatment for ovarian cancer.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have ovarian cancer and you are about to start your first or second cycle of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (a treatment given in addition to surgery to try to prevent a cancer from coming back) and if you live within approximately 30kms of Brisbane CBD. 

Trial details
Participants will take part in a specially-designed exercise program, which includes low to moderate intensity walking, for around 30 minutes daily, over 18 weeks of chemotherapy. It will measure chemotherapy completion rates, fatigue, physical function and distress. Participants will be required to complete two questionnaires to measure these. 

Approximately 36% of women do not complete adjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer due to treatment side-effects, in particular fatigue. Incomplete chemotherapy may result in poorer survival. In other cancer groups, exercise programs are effective for increasing functional capacity, relieving fatigue, distress and extending survival.</summary>
