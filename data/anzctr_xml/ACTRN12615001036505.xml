  <interventions>
    <interventions>Implants of the MVADRegistered Trademark pump may be performed via a median sternotomy or lateral thoracotomy. In all cases a cardiopulmonary bypass is required. An expert from HeartWare will be present during surgery. During implantation, the pumps integrated inflow cannula is inserted into the left ventricle and is secured to the myocardium using an adjustable sewing ring. A 10mm diameter, gel impregnated, polyester outflow graft connects the pump to a major artery. A strain relief fits over the outflow graft to prevent kinking and to secure the outflow graft to the pump housing. The percutaneous driveline connects the implanted pump to the Pal 'Trademark' Controller and power sources. The driveline is wrapped with a woven polyester fabric to encourage tissue in-growth at the skin exit site. The pump size and intraventricular inflow cannula allow for pericardial placement, eliminating the need for an abdominal pocket. Implant procedure goes between 2-4 hours. Time in situ is difficult to determine as this depends on patient condition and may vary until clinical indicated explanation is required, the patient can receive a heart transplant or it can be even indefinitely.
