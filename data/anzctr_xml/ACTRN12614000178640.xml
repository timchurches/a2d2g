  <interventions>
    <interventions>A self-administered psychoeducational package will be given to the participants in the experimental group 1 week prior to their surgery.  The pack is in printed form and will include a relaxation CD.  They are expected to take the information pack home with them and practice the exercises and read the information regarding PTSD and their surgery.  They are required to complete a self assessment battery once a week to monitor progress (takes a half hour to complete) as well as complete 3 psychological assessments during their meetings with the researcher. The package will contain breathing and relaxation exercises, basic cognitive training skills, and medical information regarding their surgery which they are expected to practice every day for 6 weeks. This will take approximately half an hour.  The participants will be asked to keep a daily log indicating adherence to the intervention.  </interventions>
    <comparator>A control group will receive standard treatment that includes information regarding their surgery and psychoinformation regarding Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  They will not be required to practice relaxation and cognitive behavioral exercises, but will be asked to monitor their progress using the same weekly self-assessment as the experimental group.  The control group will be required to complete 3 psychological tests to assess baseline functioning and any changes during the study.  Immediately following the end of the treatment period (10 weeks after surgery) the control group will receive the same self-administered treatment package and full instructions.  Both groups and their welfare will be continuously monitored by a registered Clinical Psychologist.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participant is awaiting cardiac surgery and has signed consent to participate.  Subject will undertake initial screening to evaluate incidence of pre-existing PTSD or similar.  They will receive an pack of information related to the study with full instructions on how to self-administer it. The allocation concealment will be performed by a computer program, and the treatment will be allocated according  to the number that is assigned to each participant.  The control and experimental treatments are issued to the participants in sealed opaque envelopes that is concealed from the researcher and distributor.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a psychoeducational treatment for people who survive the ICU, but develop post traumatic reactions to the medical interventions involved. The treatment will be given prior to surgery and outcomes measured.  Previous research has suggested that people may benefit from using cognitive self-assessment skills and education regarding their surgery.  It is intended that the treatment will alleviate PTSD symptomology.</summary>
