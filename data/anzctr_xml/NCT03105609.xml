  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Hyperspectral imaging

Naive wet age-related macular degeneration - Patients recruited to the study will be patients who meet the Australian MBS criteria for treatment of exudative CNV with Lucentis. For the duration of the study, the patients will have standard induction and monthly dosing of Lucentis (Ranibizumab; intravitreal; 0.5 mg) to allow comparison with published studies. The only extra intervention for the study is the acquisition of hyperspectral mages with the hyperspectral camera and the acquisition of additional fundus autofluorescence images to the clinical norm.


Treatment: devices: Hyperspectral imaging
Hyperspectral retinal images will be taken at baseline (before treatment with Lucentis) and then at 3 and 9 months after treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hyperspectral image characteristics that predict response of choroidal neovascularisation to Lucentis - Hyperspectral images will be analysed to define specific characteristics that identify which types of choroidal neovascularisation will respond to Lucentis. Responsive patients will be differentiated from non-responders and distinguishing image features will be identified.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-9 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Specific spectral signature for identification of exudative AMD - Spectral bands of the HSI containing the most predictive information for diagnosis and treatment response will be characterised.</outcome>
