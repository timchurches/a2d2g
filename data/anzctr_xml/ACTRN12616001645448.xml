    <interventions>INTRODUCTION 
The Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression (CRUfAD) have developed an online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety and depression in advanced-stage cancer patients. It is called iCanADAPT Advanced. Aspects of existing online interventions for anxiety and depression were adapted to the cancer context in the development of the iCanADAPT Advanced program. iCanADAPT Advanced is a 12 week self-managed mixed anxiety and depression program that is tailored to unique aspects of the cancer context, such as adapting to illness, fear of cancer progression and end-of-life concerns. 

PROPOSAL 
The proposed study will explore the outcomes of the clinician-guided iCBT program for people experiencing anxiety and/or depression symptoms who have been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. 

ALLOCATION 
Participants with elevated anxiety and depression scores who have been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer will be recruited. They will complete online screening questionnaires on CRUfAD's clinical trials website (www.virtualclinic.org.au) to assess eligibility to participate and provide informed consent, before being interviewed over the telephone to assess eligibility for inclusion into the study. 

OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM
The iCanADAPT Advanced program consists of six 'Modules' based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). They include all treatment components typically seen in face-to-face CBT (the first-line treatment for depression and anxiety in people diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer). Each of the six 'Modules' can be considered as a discrete package. Each of the 'Modules' contains: 
- A Lesson (consists of a comic based, easy to read story, pertinent to all participants)
- An associated Lesson Summary (consists of more dense reading material, likely pertinent to all participants) 
- Any additional resources for that Module (which may not be needed by all participants) 
- Any additional worksheets for that part (pertinent to all participants) 

THEMES OF THE MODULES 
The overriding messages in each Module i.e. the each Lesson and its associated Lesson Summary, and any additional resources is arranged by themes. The main themes are: 
Lesson 1: Learning about Depression and Anxiety
Lesson 2: Adjusting to change
Lesson 3: Identifying and Tackling Thoughts
Lesson 4: Tackling unhelpful Behaviours
Lesson 5: Facing your fears
Lesson 6: Maintaining your skills

EXAMPLE OF A MODULE 
Hence, for Module 4 the theme is Tackling Unhelpful Behaviours, hence the Lesson shows the characters addressing their unhelpful behaviours in a comic based, easy to follow story. Further specific, more detailed, writing is contained in the Lesson summary, in this case under the following headings: 
1. Tackling Low Activity 
2. Before starting activity scheduling and physical activity 
3. Daily Activity Scheduling 
4. Physical Activity
5. Your Checklist
6. Summary

HOW TO WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAM 
Participants will be asked to complete the Lesson (including the questionnaires beforehand for that lesson). Each lesson will take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. They may go through all the slides in a single sitting, or they may take multiple sittings to get to the end. Once they have completed the Lesson, the computer system automatically releases the associated Lesson Summary (i.e., it becomes available for download on completion of the lesson). The participants are asked to practice any associated skills/activities over the course of the following 14 days. Furthermore, upon completion of the Lesson, the extra resources for that part of the course, or 'Module'', similar become available. We ask participants to aim for an additional 3 hours per week to read these associated resources and to put into practice the CBT skills. 

TIMING OF EACH MODULE
There is a purposeful lock-out time of 5 days between release of the subsequent 'Module' i.e., next Lesson and Lesson Summary etc. The 5-day lock-out refers to specific time points for the release of the next lesson and it's associated Lesson Summary. For example, if a participant undertook Lesson 3 in one sitting and hence downloaded the Lesson 3 Summary on 01st of the month, we purposely do not allow them to start 'Module 4' i.e., Lesson 4, until at least 5 days later, the 05th of the month. We will recommend instead that they spend up to two weeks (until the 14th of the month) reflecting and working through the prior Module i.e., Lesson 3, Lesson 3 Summary/recommendations. However, as some patients prefer to progress at a quicker pace we do not necessitate the full 14 day period. Instead a five day minimum is set; to ensure that the patient does not get information overload and to encourage them to reflect and undertake activities for at least a short time period. 

CONTACT 
Routine email contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist or psychiatry registrar/medical officer) after completion of the first two lessons will occur. Further email contact will occur then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email. 

ADHERENCE 
Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.</interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>Mental health exclusion criteria will include psychosis, bipolar disorder, substance abuse or dependence and current suicidality, 

Cancer related exclusion criteria will include: 
- Early-stage cancer patients or cancer survivors (i.e., localised cancer, no current cancer). The rational being that the iCanADAPT Advanced Program is specifically designed for advanced-stage cancer i.e., cancer with no curative intention to treat. 
- Being within the first 6 weeks of de novo metastatic cancer diagnosis or initial diagnosis of recurrence of cancer. The rationale being that the program is not designed to address the immediate shock/distress of a cancer diagnosis; instead it is aimed to address clinical depression and clinical anxiety states
- Brain cancer/malignancy. The rationale being that intracranial neoplasm and their associated treatments regularly cause cognitive impairment and burdening a patient with an online modality of CBT would be a poor choice. 
- Current hospitalisation. 
- Physical Health status exclusion will be an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of greater than 1 (Oken et al., 1982). </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION 
In order to detect a difference on the primary outcome measure (HADS score) between baseline and post-treatment, recruitment of 30 participants will enable us to detect a minimum of 3.5 points difference (assuming standard deviation of 6.5 points on HADS total scores), at 80% power, and alpha set at 0.05. 

ANALYSIS PLAN 
All analyses will be undertaken using linear mixed and marginal models, with times as a fixed factor in the model, and subject as random intercept. Planned contrasts will be used to compare changes between pre- and post-treatment. Within-group effect sizes will be calculated (Hedges g) to measure the size of the within-group difference on primary and secondary outcome measures between pre- and post-treatment. </statisticalmethods>

Study details
The iCanADAPT Advanced Program is a 12 week online program which involves learning about tackling depression and anxiety with a form of therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT looks at improving how we manage our thoughts, actions and feelings. There are 6 lessons, each one taking up to an hour to complete, with the recommendation to do a new lesson every 1-2 weeks. There will also then be additional activities to do for around 3 hours per week. The program is tailored to unique aspects of the cancer context, such as fear of cancer progression, adapting to illness and end-of-life concerns. 
Participants will complete a number of important questionnaires to assess their depression and anxiety levels among other psychological factors, at the beginning of the program, mid-way through, then again at the end of the program and the last time is 3 months after finishing the program. Participants will also be asked to complete a short questionnaire before every lesson. 
It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information regarding the efficacy of the iCanADAPT Advanced Program in reducing depression and anxiety in advanced cancer patients.
