    <interventions>This study is a Phase IIIB/IV, randomised, open label comparison of two independent regimens of combination antiretrovirals as second-line therapy following confirmed virological failure of a first-line non-nucleoside and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI/2N(t)RTI) combination antiretroviral (ART) regimen.  Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of the two study regimens.

I.	ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) 200mg/50mg 4 tablets once daily or 2 tabs twice daily + 2-3N(t)RTIs
II.	ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) 200mg/50mg 4 tablets once daily or 2 tabs twice daily + raltegravir 400 mg 1 tablet twice daily.

All treatments will be adminstered orally.
The dose of 2-3N(t)RTIs given will be at the treating physician's discretion, according to the local guidelines and the patient's condition.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will undergo screening procedures as described in the protocol. All data will be entered onto a web-based electronic case report form (eCRF). Once all screening data has been entered and verified as correct and meeting the eligibility criteria, participants will be randomized immediately via the web-based system. Randomisation will be stratified for the following variables:
- clinical site
- plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load &lt; or = 100,000 copies/mL</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratification was by baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load &lt; or =100,000 copies/mL. A computerised random number generator with a blocking factor of four was used to produce a random number list, which was then built into the eCRF to maintain blinding of physician and participant until randomisation occurred.</sequence>

    <summary>Research Hypothesis:
In HIV-infected subjects who have virologically failed first-line antiretroviral therapy comprising 2NRTI + NNRTI a regimen of second-line therapy incorporating ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and raltegravir provides comparable (i.e. non-inferior) antiretroviral efficacy over 48 weeks to a regimen containing ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and 2-3NRTIs.

Study Design:
This is a Phase IIIb/IV, international, randomised, open label study comparing two regimens of combination antiretroviral therapy in people living with HIV with confirmed virological failure of first-line NNRTI/2 NRTI regimens.  The study will run for 96-weeks but the primary analysis will take place at the week 48 time point.
Eligible participants will be randomised in equal proportions to one of two regimens of combination ART as follows:
I. ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) + 2-3NRTIs
II. ritonavir boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) + raltegravir 

Number of Subjects per Group:
Approximately 275 eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to each of the two treatment arms giving a study total of 550 participants.</summary>
