  <interventions>
    <interventions>The resource pack that the intervention group will receive will include the Tummy Rumbles CD and Raising Children DVD with accompanying instructions on how to optimally use the resources over the ensuing three and nine months intervention period. These resources are to both be used at parents' discretion. The media contain nutrition and parenting information and strategies for parents of children aged 2 - 5 years (topics include five food groups, fussy eating, label reading, child feeding). A pen and paper survey to evaluate the acceptability and utilisation of these media will be conducted at the conclusion of the study ( 9 months)</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive the generic Good For Kids Good For Life Heres 3 steps you should know printed resource, a simple colour brochure promoting physical activity, consumption of water andfruit and vegetables. This will not be monitored as provided on the assumption that parents in control group would be likely to receive some form of nutrition and physical activity literature during the study period.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes to child feeding practices meaured using The Child Feeding Questionnaire, a 30-item questionnaire, which will be completed by parents to help identify if a relationship exists between parents child feeding practices and the actual foods and drinks consumed by children, as determined by the Food Frequency Qusetionnaire (FFQ).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this proposed study is to find out whether the use of interactive electronic nutrition and parenting resources will provide parents with the skills and knowledge required to change their child feeding practices. This will result in children aged 2  5 years (whose parents are part of the study) increasing vegetable consumption and decreasing consumption of sweetened drinks and foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar when compared to the control group who are provided with traditional written nutrition education resources that are targeted at the same key nutrition messages.</summary>
