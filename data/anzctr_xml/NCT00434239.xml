             to 10 (50% of patients anticipated to receive combination treatment). Patients with
             CMML are eligible but restricted in number to up to 3 in total.

          5. The patients must have either:

               1. symptomatic anemia as defined as Hb &lt; 10g/dl OR

               2. transfusion-dependent anaemia as defined as requiring more than 4 units of packed
                  red blood cells over 8 weeks

          6. All previous cancer therapy, including erythropoietin, thalidomide and other
             experimental therapies must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to treatment
             in this study.</inclusivecriteria>

          3. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of baseline.

          5. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

          6. The development of erythema nodosum if characterized by a desquamating rash while
             taking thalidomide or similar drugs.

          7. Any prior use of Revlimid or SCF.

          8. Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments including erythropoietin.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is mainly assessing the safety of Revlimid in combination with Ancestim
      (recombinant human stem cell factor) in patients with symptomatic myelodysplasia. Of those
      two compounds, Revlimid has been shown to be an active drug in myelodysplasia. Clinical
      responses will also be assessed.</summary>
