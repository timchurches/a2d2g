  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
      safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab in participants with Systemic Juvenile
      Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA). Participants with body weight less than (&lt;) 30 kilograms (kg)
      will receive subcutaneous (SC) tocilizumab dose every 2 weeks (Q2W) and participants with
      body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 kg will receive weekly (QW), for 52 weeks.
      Tocilizumab was administered every 10 days until pre-planned interim analysis was performed
      and changed to Q2W in participants with body weight &lt;30 kg.</summary>
