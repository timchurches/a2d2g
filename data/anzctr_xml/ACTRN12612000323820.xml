  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single-center, controlled, study using a blood stage Plasmodium Falciparum challenge (BSPC) inoculum to characterize the effectiveness of mefloquine against early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection. The study will be conducted in up to 3 cohorts (n= 8 in each) using different doses of mefloquine.A single dose of oral tablet mefloquine will be administered when PCR quantification is confirmed to be greater than or equal to 1,000 parasites/mL. The first dose of mefloquine investigated will be 5 mg/kg. Subsequent doses will be determined following a review of observed mefloquine safety, and pharmacodynamic outcome. It is anticipated that subsequent doses will be 10 and 15 mg/kg. However the doses will be determined following review by the Safety Review Team, and will be selected based on patient safety and tolerability and by defining the desired broad concentration response profile. If no safe alternative dose can be determined the option exists to curtail the study to less than three cohorts. 
Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~1,800 viable Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. On an outpatient basis, participants will be monitored daily (AM) or morning (AM) and evening (PM) (from day 3 until PCR positive for presence of malaria parasites) for adverse events and the unexpected early onset of symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of malaria. On the day designated for commencement of treatment, as determined by qPCR results, participants will be admitted to the study unit and confined for safety monitoring and mefloquine administration with parasite load and drug levels being monitored. The threshold for commencement of treatment will be when PCR quantification is confirmed to be greater than or equal to 1,000 parasites/mL. If clinical or parasitological evidence of malaria (either the identification of two or more malaria parasites on a malaria thick film, or the onset of clinical features of malaria) occurs, or PCR quantification of greater than or equal to 1,000 parasites/mL is detected before day 7 morning, allocated treatment will begin at this time. Following treatment with mefloquine, participants will be followed up as inpatients for at least 48 hours, to ensure tolerance of the therapy and clinical response, then if clinically well on an outpatient basis for safety and continued presence of malaria parasites via PCR and thick blood film review.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase II clinical trial for the study of the efficacy of Lariam (Mefloquine) antimalarial drugs against Plasmodium falciparum by experimental challenge with a low dose of blood stage parasites in healthy adult volunteers. This trial is to be conducted under the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Clinical Trial Notification Scheme(CTN). The purpose of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of mefloquine on clearance of Plasmodium falciparum parasites from the blood in healthy volunteers following infection with blood stage parasites, to characterize the pharmacokinetics and the relationship between mefloquine pharmacokinetics and parasite kinetics in healthy volunteers following infection with blood stage Plasmodium falciparum.</summary>
