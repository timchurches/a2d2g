  <interventions>
    <interventions>Analgesic effects of intravenous parecoxib have been investigated in orthopedic surgery. Postoperative pain is still a common problem after total knee arthroplasty. The purpose of this double-blind, randomized study was to investigate whether the addition of intraarticular bupivacaine to intravenous parecoxib could improve pain relief in patients receiving total knee arthroplasty. One hour before operation, a single dose of parecoxib 40 mg was injected intravenously within 30 seconds. After the closure of the surgical wound, a single dose of intraarticular injection of 0.5% bupivacaine 60 ml (300 mg) was given into the joint space within 2 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control group, patients received the intravenous parecoxib 40 mg injection as per the intervention group, but received a placebo (intraarticular 0.9% normal saline 60 ml) instead of the intraarticular 0.5% bupivacaine.

      <outcome>The secondary outcome was the amount of meperidine use within the first 24 hours after the operation.
After operation, the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores, wherein score 0 denoted no pain and score 10 denoted the worst pain, were used for the first time for pain assessment. If the NRS score exceeded 4, an intramuscular meperidine 50 mg injection was given for pain relief. The frequency of assessment was every 4 hours and an intramuscular meperidine 50-mg injection was given if needed.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Analgesic effects of intravenous parecoxib have been investigated in orthopedic surgery. Postoperative pain is still a common problem after total knee arthroplasty. Recent studies have shown that intraarticular bupivacaine injection has analgesic effect after total hip replacement and good opioid-sparing effect at the first 12 hours after hip surgery. Local anesthetic is injected into intraarticular cavity after surgical wound closure, spreading into muscle and soft tissue, which can effectively decrease postoperative pain. In view of this, we hypothesized that intraarticular bupivacaine in combination with intravenous parecoxib might improve postoperative pain relief in patients receiving total knee arthroplasty.</summary>
