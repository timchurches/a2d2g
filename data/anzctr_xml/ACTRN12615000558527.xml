  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children in the intervention sites will be participating in a community weight management programme (namely Go4Fun)and will also be eligible to receive incentives for reaching certain levels of attendance and for goal attainment. An overview of the incentives being as follows;
1.	Attendance: children are incentivised for attending program sessions. Children will receive a skipping rope for attending 80% of program sessions (8 sessions) and a frisbee for 100% attendance (10 sessions).
2.	Goal attainment: children are incentivised for achieving mutually-agreed (child/leader/family) goals before the next session. Specific, achievable and measureable goals will be and examples include I will go for a family walk at least once a week for the next month or I will not drink soft drink on school days for the next month. Once the goals are achieved children are eligible to receive agreed incentives as follows; a vegetable slicer once two goals are achieved, a $10 Rebel voucher once four goals are achieved and a height adjustable tennis set (Totem Tennis) once six goals are achieved.

The existing Go4Fun program is a community-based, multidisciplinary family-focused program that targets weight-related behaviours and self-esteem of children aged 7 to 13 years who are overweight or obese. The program includes 10 x one hour-sessions per week during school terms. Sessions are group-based and comprise face-to-face physical activity sessions and education (behaviour change, nutrition, self-esteem) provided by trained health professionals. In line with current evidence about the importance of family engagement, both parent/guardian and the child attend the weekly sessions. To monitor adherence, weekly attendance records and participant diaries (physical activity, diet and goal achievement) are kept.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Children in the control sites will participate in the standard community weight management programme (namely Go4Fun) without the structured behaviour incentives. As described above, the standard program consists of weekly group sessions for 10 weeks during the school term.

    <concealment>Eligible sites will be randomised to either deliver the intervention (standard Go4Fun + incentives) or control (standard Go4Fun) program for 10 weeks. For site recruitment, all Go4Fun programs across NSW were invited to participate, 22 agreed and have secured ethical approval. Based on prior process evaluation work16 and from prior attendance records the recruited sites are likely to enrol an average of 25 children per site per term (~550 children per term). Given we intend to recruit across 2 terms (total 1100) and having recruited 214 children to date, our target of 570 children across 22 sites is highly feasible in terms of program delivery and participant capacity. Local program leaders will assess eligibility, obtain informed consent and conduct baseline study visits and research assistants will conduct the blinded follow-up assessments. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated sequence (1:1) managed by the research team based at The George Institute and independent of any program leader or LHD. Clusters were stratified according to local health district to ensure equal representation across groups within each LHD.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A formal statistical analysis plan has been developed Analysis will be conducted at the individual level and will follow the intention-to-treat principle. The control and intervention groups will be compared on baseline characteristics using independent t-tests for continuous variables or chi-square tests for categorical variables. For the primary outcome, the mean difference in BMI z score at 12 months between control and intervention groups will be analysed after adjusting for the baseline characteristics using a generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression model. For the secondary outcomes, with continuous dependent variables GEE regression models will be used and for categorical dependent variables GEE logistic regression models will be used. These models will account for the between cluster variance and will be adjusted for baseline characteristics. All analyses will be undertaken using SAS 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) and statistical significance will be set at P &lt; 0.05.

Sample size: Intra-class correlation was calculated based on preliminary data (214 individuals) across the recruited 22 sites and was found to be 0.16 for BMI z score. To detect a between-group difference of 0.24 (+/- 0.43) in BMI z score (based on outcome data from a previous Australian randomised controlled trial examining 12 month weight loss outcomes in children), 23 participants from each of the 22 sites (11 intervention, 11 control) are required to achieve 80% power based on an alpha of 0.05. To account for 10% drop-out our target sample size is 570 children across 22 sites.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence and impact of childhood overweight and obesity is increasing and is of growing concern to the wellbeing of Australian society. Scientific literature suggests that providing an incentive scheme may improve motivation and completion of behaviour change programs, but the potential of such schemes and their optimal delivery remain relatively unexplored in children. This project will be the first RCT internationally to test the effectiveness and implementation of an incentive scheme targeting behaviour change in children. Conducting a robust study testing the impact of incentive schemes in children may open up a whole new approach for managing a range of conditions that are directly associated with health-related behaviours.</summary>
