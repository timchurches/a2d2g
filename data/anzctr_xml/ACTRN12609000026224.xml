  <interventions>
    <interventions>Apixaban which is Factor Xa inhibitor. From this intervention treatment, we try to determine if apixaban is noninferior to warfarin in the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism, in
subjects with Atrial FibrillationF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke.
The mode of administration of the intervention treatment is orally taken tablets. The dosage amount and dosage frequency is 5 mg given twice a day or matching placebo for the treatment period. Subjects will receive either apixaban and warfarin-placebo or apixaban-placebo and warfarin following randomization.
Treatment period:  Lasting until the earlier of a subjects treatment discontinuation or the attainment of 448 primary efficacy events (average of 1.8 yrs of follow-up from
randomization).
Follow up period: Lasting until the latter of 30 days after treatment discontinuation or the attainment of 448 primary efficacy events</interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment is warfarin which is anticoagulant to inhibit vitamine K dependent coagulation factors.
The mode of administration of the comparator treatment is orally 2 mg tablets.  The dosage and frequency is warfarin dose titrated to a target International Normalised Ratio range of 2.0 - 3.0 or matching placebo for the treatment period. Subjects will receive either apixaban and warfarin-placebo or apixaban-placebo and warfarin following randomization
Treatment period:  Lasting until the earlier of a subjects treatment discontinuation or the attainment of 448 primary efficacy events (average 1.8 years
of follow-up from randomization).
