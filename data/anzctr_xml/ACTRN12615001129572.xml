  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be screened based on their taste sensitivity to sucrose and MSG before they participate into the soup preload and eating behavior study..

The study will be conducted over 3 non-consecutive test days with one-week interval at the sensory laboratory at the University of Queensland.Three different soups will be tested:
1- control soup: 12g plain flour + 200ml water;
2-MSG soup: 12g plain flour + 1g MSG + 200ml water;
3-sweet soup: 9.6g plain flour + 2g sucrose + 200ml water;
Participants will arrive at 8:00 - 8:30 a.m. in a fasted state having consumed nothing but water from at least 2300 hours the night before. After brief introduction and the first saliva collection, they will be provided with 200ml of either MSG soup, placebo soup or Sweet soup in randomised order 10 min after arrival. The washout time between two soup conditions was one-week. They will be asked to finish the soup within 5 minutes using a given spoon. Subjects will then stay in the lab for 60 minutes before the buffet meal was provided. They will choose any kinds of food and consume as much or as little as they want until reach comfortably fullness and satiation. Participants are free to ask for more foods if they finish any of the food served. The ad libitum meal session will last for up to 40 minutes..
Subjects will also taste 5ml samples of MSG and sweet soup before preload, then at 0 minute and 60 minutes after the soup preload. Soup pleasantness was measured by rating on a visual analogue scale after tasting the sample. Subjective appetite and sensory specific appetite will be measured using visual analogue scales. Saliva samples will be taken at the following time points: arrival, 0min, 30 min 60 min after the soup and after the ad libitum meal.</interventions>
    <comparator>cross-over intervention. All participants will consume all three types of soups.. The sweet soup, the MSG soup and the control soup.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>sensory specific satiety to sweet soup/MSG soup; subjects will rate the pleasantness on visual analogue scale with very unpleasant and very pleasant at the two ends, after tasting a small sample of the sweet soup and the MSG soup, both before and at two time points (0min and 60min) after soup consumption, sensory specific satiety score will be calculated with the subjective ratings;</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before soup preload and at both 0 minute and at 60 minutes after soup preload consumption</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Macronutrients and energy intake, All food items will be weighed before and after consumption to calculate the quantity of each food item consumed, the macronutrients and energy  consumption will be further calculated based on the nutritional value provided by manufacturer with the amount (gram) of food consumed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Directly after the ad libitum Buffet food eating at each of the 3 testing sessions</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite/satiety sensations (hunger/fullness) using a labeled magnitude satiety scale (LMSS);
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At arrival, 0, 15, 30, 60 minutes after soup preload and after ad libitum meal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite/satiety sensation (subjective desire to eat) using a visual analogue scale (VAS);
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At arrival, 0, 15, 30, 60 minutes after soup preload and after ad libitum meal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Appetite/satiety sensation (subjective ratings on how much food they think they can eat, also known as perspective food consumption) on a visual analogue scale (VAS);</outcome>
      <timepoint>At arrival, 0, 15, 30, 60 minutes after soup preload and after ad libitum meal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hormone in saliva: ghrelin, GLP-1 and leptin will be measured using ELISA</outcome>
      <timepoint>At arrival, 0, 30, 60 minutes after soup preload and after ad libitum meal</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to study whether the oral sensitivity to basic tastes (umami taste, Monosodium glutamate MSG and sweet taste; sucrose) would influence on human eating behavior which include total energy intake, sensitivity to satiety, appetite hormone profiles and salivary flow rate and hormone profiles. The purpose of this project is to improve the understanding of the correlation between taste perception and food eating behaviors.</summary>
