  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Main Trial (Primary Endpoint): Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) After 26 Weeks of Treatment - Change from baseline in HbA1c after 26 weeks of treatment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 26</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Extension Trial (Primary Endpoint): Rate of Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes - Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol /L.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 53 + 7 days follow up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Extension Trial (Primary Endpoint): Rate of Nocturnal Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes - Rate of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia as well as minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as occurring between 00:01 and 05:59 a.m.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 53 + 7 days follow up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Extension Trial (Primary Endpoint): Rate of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) - Corresponds to rate of AEs per 100 patient years of exposure. Severity assessed by investigator. Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject's daily activities. Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable. Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</outcome>

    <summary>This trial is conducted in Europe, Oceania, and the United States of America (USA).

      The aim of this clinical trial is to compare NN5401 (insulin degludec/insulin aspart
      (IDegAsp)) with insulin detemir (IDet) plus insulin aspart in patients with type 1 diabetes
      (main period) followed by the extension period comparing the long-term safety of NN5401 plus
      insulin aspart with insulin detemir plus insulin aspart.

      The main period is registered internally at Novo Nordisk as NN5401-3594 while the extension
      period is registered as NN5401-3645.</summary>
