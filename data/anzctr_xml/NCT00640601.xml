  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With Improved Clinical Benefit From Assessment of Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit (CGI-CB) Scale From Baseline to Week 24 or End of Study - Proportional change in CGI-CB score The CGI-CB scale is used to evaluate investigator's global weighted impression of efficacy and interference of adverse events (AEs) from enrolment to every visit. The score ranges from 1 to 10. The lower the score the better the outcome, e.g.: a score of 1 means that there is marked therapeutic effect with no burden of AEs. A score of 10 signifies that the burden of AEs outweighs the therapeutic effect, or no therapeutic effect with high burden of AEs. A change score for each subject will be calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the visit score.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Clinical Global Impression-Clinical Benefit (CGI-CB) Score - Numerical change in CGI-CB score. The CGI-CB scale is used to evaluate investigator's global weighted impression of efficacy and interference of adverse events (AEs) from enrolment to every visit. The score ranges from 1 to 10. The lower the score the better the outcome, e.g.: a score of 1 means that there is marked therapeutic effect with no burden of AEs. A score of 10 signifies that the burden of AEs outweighs the therapeutic effect, or no therapeutic effect with high burden of AEs. A change score for each subject will be calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the visit score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score - Change in PANSS total score which includes Positive, Negative and General psychopathology. The PANSS is a 30-item scale where each symptom is rated on a severity scale ranging from 1-7, where 1=absent, 7=extreme). Maximum total score: 210, minimum total score is 30. Seven items are referring to positive symptoms (P1-7), seven items to negative symptoms (N1-7) and 16 items to general psychopathology (G1-16). The assessment prior to start of treatment is considered the baseline assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Positive Scale Score - Change in positive subscale of PANSS. This subscale calculates the sum of the scores in PANSS items P1-P7. (1=absent symptoms, 7=extreme symptoms). Maximum total score: 49, minimum total score: 7.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Negative Scale Score - Change in negative subscale of PANSS. This subscale calculates the sum of the scores in PANSS items N1-N7. (1=absent symptoms, 7=extreme symptoms). Maximum total score: 49, minimum total score: 7.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Global Assessment Scale (GAS) - Change in GAS score. The GAS is a 100-point single item scale that rates patient's functioning on a hypothetical continuum of mental health to mental illness. The scale values range from 1 to 100 (1=most impaired, 100=healthiest).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale - The CGI-S assesses severity of illness which is scored to rate the patient's current clinical state at start of treatment. The scores range from 1 to 7, where 1= normal, not at all ill, while a score of 7=among the most extremely ill of subjects. The change from start of treatment in the severity of illness is calculated by subtracting the score at start of treatment from the visit score. Alleviation of symptom severity will be indicated by a negative change score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale - Change in CGI-I scale. This scale is the second part of the CGI scale that is scored at Visit 3 to week 24 to observe the patient's change from start of treatment. The scores for the CGI-I subset ranges from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved, 7=very much worse and a score of 4 indicates no change.)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 7 - week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) - Change in SOFAS score. The SOFAS is a 100 point single item scale that rates functioning of a patient. The scale values range from 1=most impaired to 100=healthiest individual. The scale also includes a rating point of 0=missing information.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Safety Measure: Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) - The Percentage of patients with change in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS)was calculated. This is a 10 item scale that is rated on a five-point scale where 0=normal and 4=severe symptoms of Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with a focus on parkinsonian symptoms of EPS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) - The Percentage of patients with change in BARS score was calculated. The BARS is a 4 item scale that is rating Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) on a 4-point scale for the first three questions and on a 6-point scale for the last question. 0=normal and a higher value represents more pronounced symptoms of EPS. BARS has a focus on the akathisia symptoms of EPS.</outcome>
