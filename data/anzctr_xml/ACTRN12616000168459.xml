  <interventions>
    <interventions>Investigator M (podiatrist) will manufactured a pair of customized foot orthoses per participant asigned to the experimental group. A weight-bearing phenolic foam cast will be obtained previously from these participants. Foot orthoses will consist of 2 mm-thick polypropylene from heel to inmediately proximal to the metatarsal heads, a 5 mm-thick, 35-40 shore A, ethylene-vinyl superior sheet, personalized subdigital crest and rearfoot posting. Participants in experimental group will be encouraged to wear these foot orthoses during 3 months, at least 8 hours a day, in a physiologic shoe (wide tip shoe and less than 4 cm heel). To monitor adherence to the intervention monthly reviews are scheduled.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo intervention will consist in using a 5 mm-thick, 35-40 shore A, ethylene-vinyl acetate flat sheet (without adaptation to the positive cast) during the same follow up period than the experimental group, and in similar conditions.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Visual Analogue Scale pain (VAS) is a continuous quantitative variable.
This measure instrument has been traditionally used for measuring foot pain. It consists of a line of 10 centimeter divided into 10 sections where 0 means no pain and 10 means the maximum tolerable pain.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (inmediately before the intervention), 30, 60 and 90 days after the intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFPDI) is a self assessment questionnaire developed in the UK to measure foot pain and disability. It is based on 19 statements, two of which are related to the difficulty in performing work or leisure activities and are excluded from the questionnaire if the respondent is of a retirement age. The remaining 17 items constitute three constructs (subscales): functional limitation (10 items), pain intensity (5 items) and concern with personal appearance (2 items). Each of the 17 statements has a 3-category response structure: none of the time = 0, on some days = 1 and on most/every day(s) = 2. The MFPDI has been validated in middle-aged and older populations and has been used as an outcome measure both in large population- based surveys and in clinical studies, including randomised controlled trials. The MFPDI has also been used in studies of various diseases with foot manifestations including systemic. sclerosis, EhlersDanlos syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. It has been translated and cross-culturally adapted and validated into Spanish recently.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The short form Health Survey (SF-12) is a general health questionnaire. It consists in 12 questions that measure eight dimensions (variables) of quality of life related to health and two abstract components, obtained by applying an algorithm that transforms scores typifies subjects and making them directly comparables 1) Physical Function (PF) 2) Physical role (PR) 3) bodily pain (BP) 4) General Health (GH) 5) Vitality (VT): 6) social functioning (SF): 7) Role emotional(RE) 8) Mental Health (MH)</outcome>
