  <interventions>
    <interventions>For one year, participants in the intervention arm will be allowed to have HIV and syphilis serology at either MSHC (unlimited) or Melbourne Pathology (maximum 6) whenever they choose, without needing another clinical consultation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care. Tests can only be requested at a clinical consultation. Note that after the one year trial period members of the control group are entitled to a similar intervention (unlimited testing without consultations) but at MSHC only. This will be reported separately and is not part of the main study.</comparator>

The coordinator recruiting patients will be unaware of the study group until the envelope is opened in front of the patient.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The incidence rate ratio of HIV testing in the two study arms will be calculated. A recent study of HIV testing by the target population at our clinic found a rate of 1.6 tests per year with a standard deviation of 1.4.  Assuming 80% power (p=0.05, 2 sided) and using this testing frequency in the control arm we will need 192 participants in each arm to detect an increase in testing of twice a year or more (up from 1.6 per year). We added 10% to allow for losses to follow-up and HIV infection.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Men having sex with men attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) who volunteer will be randomised to usual care OR the availability of additional HIV and syphilis serology tests whenever they choose, for up to one year. They can have these at MSHC or at Melbourne Pathology. The primary outcome is the frequency of HIV testing and participants will be followed for one year. Controls will have the usual access to HIV and syphilis testing at clinical consultations. In the second year controls will be able to have tests without consulations only at MSHC.</summary>
