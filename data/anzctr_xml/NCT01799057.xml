  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Metformin
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Metformin - Metformin at a maximum dose of 1000mg twice daily for 16-18 weeks (i.e. maximum of 2000mg per day).

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Matching placebo twice daily for 16-18 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Metformin
Participants randomized to metformin will be treated at a maximum dose of 2000mg per day (i.e. 1000mg twice daily for 16-18 weeks; up-titrated from 500mg twice daily for the first 2 weeks). Participants may complete the 16-18 week treatment intervention at the lower dose of 500mg twice daily if limited by side effects.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Participants randomized to placebo will take matching oral capsules according to the same dose schedule specified for the metformin intervention.
