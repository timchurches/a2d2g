  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute achilles tendon ruptures are increasing in incidence, however there remains a lack of consensus on the optimum treatment for acute ruptures. Non surgical treatment is favoured in many parts of the world and it is unclear what is the best post operative protocol. we believe that early weight bearing may assist in the healing of the tendon resulting in better functional outcomes and faster return to work. This study aims investigate whether early weightbearing with a bohler iron is beneficial for conservatively treated patients with acute achilles tendon ruptures</summary>
