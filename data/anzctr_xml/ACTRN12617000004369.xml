  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a shared care model  where 2 of the 4 routine hospital visits in the year after end of treatment (EOT) are replaced by GP visits (30 minutes) at the 3 and 9-month post EOT. An additional GP visit at 2 weeks post-EOT is included to discuss the follow up plan and establish common ground about the model of shared care. The following core elements will support shared care:
1. Survivorship care plan (SCP). The SCP is tailored to each participant by the research team which may include a nurse, research assistant and/or data manager and comprises a summary of the patient's diagnosis of treatment, recommendations for follow up and strategies to remain well. The patient and GP will receive copies. 
2. GP clinical management guidelines. Guidelines are in line with the Australian Cancer Network Colorectal Cancer Guidelines and recommendations from the American Cancer Society of Clinical Oncology and include guidance about tests to detect recurrence, possible late and long-term effects of treatments and how to manage these, as well as how to re-refer patients to a rapid review clinic.
3. Assessment will be based on issues frequently encountered by cancer survivors (e.g. fatigue, fear and cancer recurrence) and issues experienced by colorectal cancer survivors (e.g. bowel disturbance, sexual problems).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is care according to current practice, consistent with national and international guidelines. Usual care consists of 4-routine hospital-based visits and includes taking patient history, performing a physical examination and blood tests for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months post-EOT.

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>For each site, a research team will be appointed. This may include a nurse, research assistant and/or data manager. The research team will screen cancer patients and identify eligible patients from the Gastro-Intestinal (GI) outpatient and chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy lists, with the assistance of GI unit clinicians. Eligibility will be confirmed with the treating clinician prior to approaching any patients to clarify any details from the medical records, and to ensure the clinician is aware of the patient’s involvement with the study. If a patient is considered too unwell by his/her treatment team to participate in the study at the time of initial screening, the patient may be approached at a later date consistent with  the study’s specified recruitment time frames.
 
Once it has been established that a patient is potentially eligible for the project, the research team will approach the patient to explain the project in detail and answer any questions. If the patient wishes to participate, the Participant Information and Consent Form will be provided and consent obtained. Patients will also be asked to provide consent for access to their Medicare Australia data and hospital records. Following the initial discussion, the patient’s preferred GP will be contacted to confirm eligibility and willingness to be involved in the research study should the patient be randomised to the intervention arm. An opt-out approach will be used in this instance. If the GP returns the  form noting that they prefer not to be a part of the study, no further contact will be made. If the GP contacts the research team stating they would like to take part or if the form is not returned within one week, consent to take part in the study will be implied. 

Patients who decline to take part in the research study will be asked for their verbal consent to collect basic demographic and clinical information from their records to examine potential recruitment bias. Reasons for refusal will be recorded.

    <sequence>The research team at the Coordinating site will randomly allocate patients to either usual care or the shared care using centralised randomisation database. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the potential of a shared-care model of follow-up for survivors of colorectal cancer. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, have a confirmed diagnosis of colon or or rectal cancer at stage I-III, completed treatment with curative intent within the past 3-months at one of the participating sites and have a GP willing to participate in the study.

Trial details: Participants in this trial are randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive usual care according to current hospital practice. Participants in Group 2 will receive shared-care between specialist and general practitioner in which two routine hospital appointments will be replaced by GP appointments. In addition participants in Group 2 will receive a tailored survivorship care plan with care guidelines detailing information and recommendations about common concerns after treatment with additional support services information. Once the survivorship care plan is complete the patient will receive a written copy, with a copy provided to the patients preferred General Practitioner (GP). This is to ensure that the GP is familiar with the issues the patient is working on and can provide ongoing assistance as necessary. All participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires at the start of the study, and 6 and 12 months later in order to assess unmet needs, perceived experience of oncology care, satisfaction of the intervention and quality of life. Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the two interventions will also be assessed. </summary>
