  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel treatment approach for depression
      that has shown promising efficacy in four recent double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled
      trials (RCT) and a meta-analysis. This study is a RCT of tDCS in depressed patients, testing
      its efficacy in both unipolar and bipolar depression. Mood, cognitive test performance and
      biomarkers will be measured during the trial.</summary>
