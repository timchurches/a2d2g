  <interventions>
    <interventions>Zonisamide is the study drug. These will be used as monotherapy in newly diagnosed subjects. 
the dose will depend on how well the drug controls seizures and how it makes a subject feel. Not everyone in this study will take the same dose of medication.
 
The maximum dose for Zonisamide will be 500mg per day and the minimum dose will be 200mg per day. </interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator is carbamazepine. These will be used as monotherapy in newly diagnosed subjects. 
the dose will depend on how well the drug controls seizures and how it makes a subject feel. Not everyone in this study will take the same dose of medication.
 
The maximum dose for Carbamazepine will be 1200 mg per day and the minimum dose will be 400mg per day till they get a seizure</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of subjects remaining seizure free for at least a 26 week period when treated with zonisamide or carbamazepine as compared to baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Seizure diary will be measured at every visit from week 1 to week 56</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects seizure free for 52 weeks. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Seizure diary will be reviewed at every Visit from week 3 to between week 31 to week 103. Time to withdrawal due to lack of efficacy/due to an Adverse Events from week 3 to between week 31 to 109. Time to the start of a 26 weeks and 52 week seizure free period. For this the seizure diary will be measured between week 31 and 109 and at week 109.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study the sponsor want to find out if zonisamide can be used on its own to control epilepsy. To find out if zonisamide works on its own, we are comparing it to another drug that we already know works: this drug is called carbamazepine (carb-a-maze-a-peen). We also want to get some more information on the safety of zonisamide.</summary>
