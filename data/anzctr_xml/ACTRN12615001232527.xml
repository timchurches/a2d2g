  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be monitored with a monitor for hemodynamic assesment (Most Care, Vytech Health, Padova, Italy), which uses a Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM). 
PRAM is a method designed for arterial pressure-derived continuous Cardiac Output and it is the only methodology that does not need any starting calibration, central venous catheterization, or any adjustments based on experimental data. As a consequence, PRAM needs only an arterial line (radial, brachial, femoral) for working. 
When the patient has been monitored with Most Care device, baseline data will be acquired for 2 minutes. Afterwards, incremental values (15, 25 and 35 cmH2O) of positive airway pressure will be applied for a short period of 4 seconds in a random order. Between each single trial of incremental pressures, a return to baseline conditions will be guarantee for 3 minutes, to avoid carry-over effects.
In the end, a fluid challenge of 500 ml of normal saline will be infused in 5 minutes and the hemodynamic response will be evaluted to define if the patient is fluid responsive or not (i.e. if the cardiac index incremented of 15% at least, or not).
Furthermore, in the first 10 consecutive patients, we will insert a catheter able to measure the esophageal pressure to properly assess the incidence of inspiratory effort during each single trial of incremental pressures (i.e. 15, 25 and 35 cmH2O randomly applied for a short period of 4 seconds).</interventions>
    <comparator>Every patient will be a self control. In fact, patients will be defined as fluid-responsive or not according to the modifications of the Cardiac Index after the fluid challenge. Therefore, the data obtained during the positive airway pressure applications will be classified and analyzed accordingly.</comparator>

    <sequence>We will use a computer-generated randomization sequence, which will be generated by an independent statistician who is not otherwise involved in the trial. The envelopes will be kept in the head nursesâ€™ office. The nurses who open the envelopes will be those on shift and will be totally independent from the enrollment process. They will communicate the random sequence of the application of the incremental positive pressures to the physician responsible for the patient enrollment.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Basing on the amount of patients enrolled in previous study to test the efficacy of a fluid responsiveness test, we believe that a total of 40 patients could be sufficient to define if Pulse Pressure Variation could be a valid indicator for fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing incremental applied values of positive airway pressure. However, a precise sample size computation is not possible, since to date no data are present in the literature regarding the investigated test.
The data of the two resulting groups of patients (i.e. responsive or not) will be compared with a Mann-Whitney U-test or a Student t-test, according to the normal distribution of data. p values &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proper infusion of fluids is a challenge in critically ill patients undergoing partial support ventilation. The clinically used indexes for fluid-responsiveness are affected by several limitations. In the present study we hypothesized and aim to verify if the application of incremental values of positive airway pressures are able to predict the fluid responsiveness in patients with clinical signs of fluid repletion and undergoing Pressure Support Ventilation.</summary>
