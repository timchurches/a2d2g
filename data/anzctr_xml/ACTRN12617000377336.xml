  <interventions>
    <interventions>NRP2945 (0.64mg/mL net peptide weight) is formulated in 0.4% PEG (MW 3000-3200), 1% mannitol, 0.5 M D(+)-Trehalose in 20mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5). 
In Part 1, it will be administered as a single dose by subcutaneous bolus injection in the lower abdomen (anyone of the 4 quadrants may be used for the injection). 
In Part 2, multiple doses will be injected in the 4 quadrants of the lower abdomen over a period of 27 days every second day starting from Day 1. All 4 quadrants will be used for each subject. Two injections will be given if the volume to be administered is more than 2mls.
Part 1: Single ascending dose cohorts; doses to be administered are 1.0, 3.0, 10.0 and 25.0 microgram/kg.
Part 2: Multiple ascending dose cohorts  3 doses will be administered and will be determined by a data monitoring committee after completion of the SAD cohorts in Part 1.

    <statisticalmethods>The analysis of study endpoints will be performed using the ITT participant population. Secondary analysis using the Per Protocol Population will also be performed.

Simple summary descriptive statistics, (means, medians, standard deviations, inter-quartile ranges and ranges) and participant data listings will be used to summarize all data.
Primary Analyses:
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarised with 95% confidence intervals and linear and non-linear regression will be used to determine the form of the dose response curves for both single and multiple doses. If these key variables are not normally distributed then confidence intervals will be derived using the log-normal distribution or failing this, empirical non-parametric intervals will be generated.
Any missing data required for the pharmacokinetic derivations will be interpolated using WinNonlin.

Secondary Analyses
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be listed individually for each subject, and summarised by dose group. Other secondary variables, including laboratory assessments, vital signs and ECG parameters, will be summarised and graphed for each dose group at each time, using means or medians with standard deviations or inter-quartile ranges as appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neural Regeneration Peptide 2945 (NRP2945) is an experimental drug being developed by CuroNZ Pty. Ltd for the potential treatment of severe childhood-related refractory epilepsy such as Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). 
In animal models, NRP2945 has been shown to be a driver molecule in central nervous system (CNS) neural regeneration processes during stages of disease or injury.
In this first time in human study, single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses of NRP2945 will be assessed in healthy male volunteers. NRP2945 will be administered by subcutaneous injection in the abdomen. 
Assessments of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics parameters following administration of NRP2945 will guide decisions to further develop the drug.
