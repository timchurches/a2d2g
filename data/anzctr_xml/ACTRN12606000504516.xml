    <studytitle>Safety Assessment of Two Popular Legal Party Drugs: BZP and BZP+TFMPP</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) combination "party pill" with and without alcohol on driving performance in subjects who have used BZP or BZP+TFMPP on at least 3 previous occasions.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions will be given blinded on the morning of the testing day to each subject: 2 caspules and 3 drinks at time = 0 and again at time = 2 hours. Each subject will be randomly allocated one of the following 4 options:
1. Placebo capusles + orange juice (alcohol control)
2. Capsules containing a combination of 270mg BZP + 70mg TFMPP ("E-formula") + orange juice
3. Placebo capsules + vodka (6 units) + orange juice
4. BZP + TFMPP combination capsules (as above) + vodka (6 units) + orange juice
A unit of vodka = 30mls 'Absolut' vodka
Quantity of orange juice = 290mls
Placebo capsules contain lactose +114mg thiamine.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hypothesis is that BZP+TFMPP will result in an unsafe driving performance which can be detected using a driving simulator. Primary outcome variable is standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Tested 1.5 hours and 4.5 hours after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Another hypothesis is that the party pill combination adversely affect psychological and physiological functioning. Primary outcome variables for these aspects of study are confusion score, body temperature, heart QTc and Stanford Sleepiness score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On third day after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For driving performance secondary outcomes include speed of driving, number of times out of lane, ability to track a leading car.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments 1.5 and 4.5 hours after intervention. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mood and attention</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed 1, 3 and 72 hours after intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Other psychological and physiological tests after 1 and 3 hours including Vital signs, ECG, temperature, tremor, nystagmus, pupil size, myoclonus/fasiculations, urinary retention, feelings of nausea and palpitations Profile of Mood States (POMS), Digit-Symbol Substitution Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Conner's Continuous Performance Test II Computer Program.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Legal party pills or 'herbal highs' are commonly used as recreational drugs in New Zealand. They contain the chemicals BZP (1-benzylpiperazine) and TFMPP (trifluoromehtylphenylpiperazine) and are often taken with alcohol. This study is the first to look at how party pills, with and without alcohol, affect driving performance. It also aims to clarify the effects of party pills on attention, mood and sleep. This clinical trial therefore provides important new information on the safety of party pills.</summary>
