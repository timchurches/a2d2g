  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a structured self-paced program that is delivered on a tablet device. The program consists of 3 acceptance and commitment therapy based modules, including strategies and tools to manage thoughts and emotions, and goal setting tips. Each module can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour to complete depending on what activities the participant chooses to engage in. Once all 3 modules are completed, a participant is free to repeat any module within the app. Participants will be asked to use the intervention for a duration of 6 weeks. </interventions>
    <comparator>A wait list control group will receive the same intervention immediately after the intervention group completes the program (6 weeks after start of program). </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate whether a self-help interactive program delivered via tablet devices can help Indigenous youth to reduce their suicidal ideation. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which includes therapeutic activities grounded in acceptance and commitment therapy or a wait list control group. We predict those using the intervention program will report reduced suicidal ideation and mental distress after using the program for 6 weeks. </summary>
