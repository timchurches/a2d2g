  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We want to know the best type of intravenous (drip) fluid to give children with diabetic ketoacidosis.
There are several kinds of intravenous fluids commonly given to children with diabetic ketoacidosis. The commonest one is normal saline, which is salt dissolved in water. This is the one we use at the Womens and Childrens hospital. Another fluid sometimes used is called Hartmanns solution, which contains salt and another substance, lactate, to prevent the build up of acid (acidosis) in the blood that can be caused by too much salt.
One difference between different fluids could be their effect on the recovery from acidosis. All children with diabetic ketoacidosis have acidosis when they are admitted. As they recover from this kind of acidosis, some develop another kind of acidosis, perhaps due to excessive salt. We want to know whether using Hartmanns solution instead of normal saline will prevent this type of acidsosis, and perhaps speed their recovery.</summary>
