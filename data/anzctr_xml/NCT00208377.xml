  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor the performance and determine the metal ion release
      of the DePuy ASR System in the treatment of patients with hip joint disease requiring hip
      resurfacing surgery. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular intervals
      following hip surgery using patient, clinical and x-ray assessments. A subset of patients
      will also have blood samples taken at regular intervals to allow the metal ion levels to be
      determined and undergo scans to allow the bone mineral density of the bone surrounding the
      implant to be monitored.

      DePuy decided to close this Study in 4Q 2009. The Study was terminated with effect from
      December 2010 to allow for the completion of the 5 year follow up assessments.

      Please note that subsequent to this decision DePuy voluntarily recalled the ASR products on
      24 August 2010. Additional information regarding this voluntary recall and the follow-up of
      patients affected by the recall can be found at the following links
      http://www.mhra.gov.uk/Publications/Safetywarnings/MedicalDeviceAlerts/CON079157 and
