  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>The health condition studied was Type 2 Diabetes, more specifically blood glucose control, lower limb strength and proprioception in the lower limbs.</healthcondition>
    <conditioncode>
      <conditioncode1>Metabolic and Endocrine</conditioncode1>
      <conditioncode2>Diabetes</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve resistance training exercise using machine, free weights, body weight and resistance band exercises. There will be 2 x 60 minute sessions weekly for 16 weeks. Weeks 1-12 will be supervised by a qualified exercise scientist and and weeks 13-16 will be home based using only resistance bands and body weight exercises. Each session will involve 8 exercises aiming for 70-90% of the individual 1-repetition maximum or 7-9 on Borgs category-ratio rate of percieved exertion with 1-4 sets of 4-14 repetitions.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants must be female aged between 60-80 years who have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for greater than 6 months.
Blood glucose levels must be currently controlled by a combination of diet, exercise and/or oral hypoglycemic agents and all participants must have access to a mobile phone to receive and send SMS text messages. Participants will also be required to gain medical clearance from a General Practioner and undertake a HbA1c (Glycosylated hemoglobin) test before and after the program.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded from participation in the study if they have participated in a supervised resistance training program (2 or more sessions per week) in the past 6 months, or if their diabetes is being managed with insulin. Individuals with recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, orthopedic, cardiovascular or respiratory conditions that would prevent participation in a progressive resistance training program will also be excluded from the study.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The aim of this research is to determine the effect of a 16 week progressive resistance training program (12 week supervised program and a 4 week home-based program) on female adults with Type 2 diabetes. Specifically, this study will focus on the measures of lower limb proprioception and strength, blood glucose levels and adherence to these programs.</summary>
