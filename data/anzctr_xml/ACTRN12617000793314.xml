  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients after cardiac surgery often develop a low blood pressure because of the inflammation associated with surgery and bypass. This low blood pressure is mostly due to the small blood vessels losing their normal tightness. This condition is called vasoplegia. When vasoplegia occurs after cardiac surgery, it can lower the blood pressure to dangerous levels, which can lead to organ malfunction and may even be life-threatening. In order to maintain safety under such a situation, intensive care doctors administer drugs that tighten blood vessels. These drugs are called vasopressors. Such vasopressors can restore safe levels of blood pressure. However, they have significant side effects. Thus, it would be desirable to restore a safe blood pressure without the use of such vasopressor drugs. Over the last few years, evidence has emerged that high dose vitamin C injected into the blood stream can restore the normal tightness of blood vessels and is free of side effects. This makes treatment with vitamin C potentially desirable in cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegia. However, no studies have assessed whether vitamin C at high dose is effective in this setting. Thus, we propose to conduct a pilot study to test whether vitamin C at high dose can improve blood pressure and decrease the need for vasopressor drugs in patients with vasoplegia after cardiac surgery.</summary>
