  <interventions>
    <interventions>One group will have a transilluminator device that will be allowed to be switched on. The other group will start the same but then not be able to switch on the light. Either group may discard the device if they feel it is not helpful at this stage (e.g. they cannot find veins with or without the device,they feel the device is getting in the way). Duration of intervention is the duration the child is in the treatment room having the IV attempts (less than 30 minutes usually).</interventions>

      <outcome>Reduction in the number of children requiring three or more IV attempts while in the childrens emergency department. Children who would not qualify for this outcome would be those that leave the department to obtain IV access after less than 3 attempts or those children in whom IV access was not obtained but then deemed not necessary (usually pending blood results).</outcome>
