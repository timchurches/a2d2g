  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome: will be self-reported pain and physical function measured on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index. The WOMAC consists of 24 items covering three subscales: pain (five items), stiffness (two items) and physical function (17 items). The pain and physical function subscale will be used, each subscale transformed to a score ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater pain and physical function. The WOMAC is a widely-used questionnaire specifically designed to evaluate knee and hip OA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures and data collection will occur prior to commencement of the program, at program completion, three months following the intervention, and 3 months post surgery.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objectives of this project are to: (1) identify currently levels of distress in a waiting list for Total joint arthroplasty (TJA), and (2) administer an eight-session group mindfulness training intervention to 30 volunteers on the TJA waiting list. 

It is hypothesised that (1) levels of pain will be adversely associated with depression, anxiety and lower Quality of Life; (2) the intervention will lead to better tolerance of symptoms, an improved quality of life. Mindfulness is the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment.  Training involves instruction in a number of meditation techniques as well as teaching on how to remain focused on the present moment in day to day activities. There is now extensive scientific evidence showing that mindfulness training leads to an improvement in emotional and physical symptoms in a variety of disorders such as chronic pain, cancer, depression, anxiety and substance use among others. To our knowledge, this technique has not previously been used with TJA patients. 

135 participants (waiting list of TJA-surgery patients [Currently: 78 knees and 57 hips] who do not have a date for surgery as yet) will be mailed a PICF and study questionnaire (with pre-addressed-stamped envelope). Those who wish to participate in the 8 weekly group mindfulness intervention will indicate their interest on the study questionnaire and contacted by the researchers to organize the intake interview and commencement intervention details. 30 volunteer patients who identify as experiencing pain and emotional distress associated with their TJA who are on the St Vincents TJA surgery wait list will be recruited. Participants who wish to complete the study questionnaires, but not part of the mindfulness intervention will also be recruited; this treatment-as-usual group will provide a comparison to the TJA mindfulness group. 

All participants will be aged 18 years or more, and will be fluent in English. Participants will be excluded if: (1) they experience psychotic symptoms, delirium or dementia, (2) they suffer drug or alcohol dependence; or (3) they have a diagnosis of intellectual disability.  Based on the results of this study it is planned to apply for grant to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the piloted intervention. Surgical date will not be adversely impacted upon, if participants do (or do not) participate in this pilot study.

In addition to the initial questionnaire data, participants will also be asked to complete the questionnaire again at the program completion, three months following the intervention, and 3 months post-surgery.</summary>
