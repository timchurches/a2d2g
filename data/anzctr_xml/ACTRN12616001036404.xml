  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral capsule containing 2.5mg THC and 2.5mg CBD, derived from Cannabis Sativa L. Extract, containing Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD) in near-equal amounts. 
Frequency and duration of administration: taken once the day before chemotherapy and three times daily for 5 days for the first 5 days of participants' chemotherapy cycle and for three consecutive cycles.
Adherence in monitored by counting the returned capsules and comparing with the amount dispensed less the amount documented to have been ingested by the participant.

Participants enrolled in the pilot phase of the study are excluded from enrollment in the definitive phase.

In the Phase II part of the study, the first two cycles will be a placebo controlled, randomised crossover design, with the third being decided by participant preference.

In the Phase III part of the study will be placebo controlled, randomised parallel design.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to compare, amongst patients randomised to oral THC/CBD or placebo, the compositie outcome of the ability to control emesis and nausea. This will be assessed using patient reported outcomes recorded in a diary daily for the 6 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles and the completion of the Functional Living Index - Emesis 5 day questionnaire at the end of each cycle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily for the 6 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare Cannabinoid-related adverse events amongst patients randomised to oral THC/CBD or placebo.
Participants will be assessed by the study nurse via phone call, daily for the 6 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles, for the following possible adverse events; dizziness, disorientation, hallucinations, anxiety, palpitations and sedation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be assessed by the study nurse in the clinic on day -1 and via phone call daily for the 5 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles as well as at clinic visits at the end of each cycle and at the follow up visit 30 days after last treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare health-related quality of life amongst patients randomised to oral THC/CBD or placebo using the Functional Living Index - Emesis  5 day (FLIE 5D) and Australian Quality Of Life - 8 dimensions (AQOL-8D) questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint> Questionnaires will be completed at baseline and at clinic visits at the end of each cycle and at the follow up visit 30 days after last treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the regimens acceptability amongst patients randomised to oral THC/CBD or placebo.
Phase II study this is assessed by the proportion receiving at least one dose of oral THC/CBD during all 6 x 24 hour periods, as assessed by self-report and pill counts and the proportion preferring oral THC/CBD or placebo, as determined by expressed preference for cycle 1 versus cycle 2 of study treatment.

Phase III study this is assessed by the proportion receiving at least one dose of oral THC/CBD during all 6 x 24 hour periods, as assessed by self-report and pill counts.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Phase II study, Participants will complete the dose taken daily for the 6 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles. In addition, participants will complete a preference questionnaire at the end of the second cycle.

Phase III study, Participants will complete the dose taken daily for the 6 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare health system resource use and costs amongst patients randomised to oral THC/CBD or placebo.
This composite outcome will be asssessed as follows: resource use will be identified and measured from trial case report forms (for hospitalisations), and through linkage to Medicare claims data for outpatient visits (MBS) and prescribed medicines (PBS). Australian unit costs will be applied to the resource usage data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be assessed for hospitalisations in the clinic on day -1 and via phone call daily for the 5 days of study treatment through each of the three chemotherapy cycles as well as at clinic visits at the end of each cycle and at the follow up visit 30 days after last treatment.

Participants will be asked to sign a consent form to allow for MBS and PBS data to be extracted at the time of consent. </timepoint>

The primary analyses will include all patients who were randomised. Missing values will not be imputed. The results will be examined for differential effect in the two periods and if necessary, the data from cycle A will be analysed separately.
The primary outcome is complete response. The primary analysis will be a McNemars test. In the event that there is differential drop-out between period, or a period by treatment interaction, the results from the first period will be analysed using a chi-square test. Analyses to assess period by treatment interaction will use Generalised Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for the correlation within a patient. Secondary analyses to adjust for any baseline variables will also use GEEs. All tests will use a two-sided significance level of 10%. 
A sample size of 80 patients utilising a cross-over design, randomising patients to either study drug followed by placebo or placebo followed by study drug, will have 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 10% to detect a 20% difference in discordant responses (response on one intervention but not the other).

Definitive study
The primary analyses will include all patients who were randomised.
The primary outcome is complete response. The primary analysis will be a chi-square analysis. Secondary analyses adjusting for baseline variables will use GEES. Binary secondary outcomes will be analyses as for the primary outcome. Count data will be analyses using a Generalised Linear Model with a Poisson distribution. Cannabinoid-related adverse events and measures of adherence will be analyses with a chi-square test or two-sample t-test or just listed depending on numbers. All tests will use a two-sided significance level of 5%.
A sample size of 250 patients provides 80% power at 2-sided 5% level of significance to detect improvement in complete response from 22% to 42.5%.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of an oral capsule containing plant-derived tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with any cancer for which you are scheduled to receive at least three further chemotherapy cycles using intravenous chemotherapy of high or moderate emetic risk.

Study details
We will first enrol 80 participants in a pilot trial and if the data from these participants shows the medicine works and is well tolerated, a further 250 participants will be enrolled, this is called the definitive trial.

Participants enrolled in the pilot trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive the study drug for the first five days of their first chemotherapy cycle following enrolment, followed by a placebo capsule for the first five days of the next chemotherapy cycle, or to receive the placebo first followed by the study treatment. All participants will then choose which treatment they would prefer to take for the first five days of the third chemotherapy cycle. Participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires relating to their nausea and vomiting, quality of life and any side effects of the treatment. 

Participants enrolled in the definitive trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive the study drug or the placebo for the first five days of their next three chemotherapy cycles following enrolment,  Participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires relating to their nausea and vomiting, quality of life and any side effects of the treatment. 

It is hoped that this trial will provide preliminary information on the efficacy of THC and CBD capsules for the prevention of CINV, which will inform further clinical trials.</summary>
