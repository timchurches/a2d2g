    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants over 65 presenting to primary care services will be asked to complete a mood screener (GDS). Those who screen as having "possible depression" will be telephoned and the diagnostic interview given over the telephone. Those who have a diagnosable disorder will be consented into the trial by the assessor. The assessor will contact an independent research assistant (yet to be appointed), who is not involved in the assessment of participants, will then allocate the participant to conditions. These will be concealed in opaque envelopes (or equivalent) prior to allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of two evidence-based treatments for late-life depression for patients who also have at least one co-morbid health problem. Participants will be randomised to two active interventions (ie PST or CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). Randomization will be stratified by diagnosis: major depressive episode or minor depression/dysthymia, using computer-generated random numbers. All assessments will be completed by a researcher that remains blind to the allocation throughout the study. Participants will be assessed, using a range of questionnaire measures and a diagnostic interview, at pre and post-treatment, 6, and 12 months follow-up.</summary>
