  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response-100 (as Defined by a Decrease in Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] Score of at Least 100 Points From Baseline) or Clinical Remission (CDAI Score Less Than [&lt;]150) at Week 26 - Clinical response-100 was defined as a reduction in CDAI score of at least 100 points from baseline of the parent A3921083 study. Clinical remission was a CDAI score &lt;150 points. CDAI is a composite index consisting of a weighted scoring of 8 disease variables: number of liquid or very soft stools, extent of abdominal pain, general well-being, occurrence of extra-intestinal symptoms, need for anti-diarrheal drugs, presence of abdominal masses, hematocrit, and body weight. CDAI score was based partly on entries (7 days before evaluation) from participant's diary kept while on study. CDAI scores range from 0 to approximately 600, higher score indicates higher disease activity.</outcome>
