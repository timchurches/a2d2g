  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumor Response Rate - Volumetric measurements of the primary tumor using an elliptical model (0.5 x the product of the 3 largest perpendicular diameters) to assess response to neoadjuvant therapy. The RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) from the NCI will be used for assessment of the size of measurable metastases, including nodal metastases. Primary Tumor Measurement: Technical guidelines for cross-sectional imaging computed tomography (CT) slice thickness should be 5mm or less and the diameter of the "measurable" mass should be at least twice the reconstructed slice thickness. Smaller masses are considered detectable, but will be counted as "non-measurable." Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of the tumor confirmed at &gt;4 weeks. Partial Response (PR): At least 64% decrease in volume compared to the measurement obtained at study enrollment. Progressive Disease (PD): At least 40% increase in tumor volume compared to the smallest volume obtained since the beginning.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, irinotecan, ifosfamide,
      etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving high-dose combination
      chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well giving high-dose combination chemotherapy
      together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed metastatic
      rhabdomyosarcoma or ectomesenchymoma.</summary>
