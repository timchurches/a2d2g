  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess whether inhalation of 7% hypertonic saline (HS) twice
      daily for 48 weeks reduces structural lung disease as assessed by computed tomography (CT) in
      comparison with inhalation of 0.9% isotonic saline (IS) in preschool children (ages 3 to 6)
      with cystic fibrosis.</summary>
