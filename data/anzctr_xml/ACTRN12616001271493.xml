  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be assessing the efficacy of micronutrient fortified biscuits on improving the nutrition status of children aged between 6 and 12 years in schools within the city of Lae. Two schools will be selected from urban Lae for the study, which is planned to commence in April 2017 and conclude in December 2017 for a 3 terms of the school year. This equates to approximately 150 school days.

Following screening, enrolment, baseline assessment, deworming and allocation (randomised, stratified by age, and blocked by sex), each child will receive wheat flour-based biscuits. In the case of the 'Intervention Group', these biscuits will be fortified with food-grade vitamins and minerals. Specifically, thiamin mononitrate (Vit. B1), riboflavin (B2), nicotinamide (B3), folic acid (B9), cyanocobalamin (B12), retinyl palmitate (Vit. A), iron (ferrous fumarate), and zinc (zinc oxide).

The recommended fortification level in wheat flour is provided below based on a per capita daily consumption of between 75-149g of wheat flour:

Micronutrient (compound form) - concentration (microgram/g in wheat flour)
Iron (Ferrous fumarate) - 60 microgram/g
Vitamin A (Retinyl palmitate) - 3 microgram/g
Zinc (Zinc oxide) - 80 microgram/g
Folic Acid - 2.6 microgram/g
Thiamine (Thiamine mononitrate) - 10 microgram/g
Riboflavin - 2 microgram/g
Niacin (Nicotinamide) - 130 microgram/g
Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) - 0.02 microgram/g

When formulating the biscuits for children, the targets for addition have been based on the lower end of the consumption range. Therefore, the dose of vitamins in each biscuit has been calculated to provide the equivalent intake as would be found in the daily consumption of 75g of fortified wheat flour, These figures will be:

Micronutrient (compound form) - concentration (microgram/g in biscuit formulation)
Iron (Ferrous fumarate) - 225.00 microgram/g
Vitamin A (Retinyl palmitate) - 11.25 microgram/g
Zinc (Zinc oxide) - 300 microgram/g
Folic Acid - 9.75 microgram/g
Thiamine (Thiamine mononitrate) - 37.5 microgram/g
Riboflavin - 7.5 microgram/g
Niacin (Nicotinamide) - 487.50 microgram/g
Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) - 0.08 microgram/g

Each child will receive one biscuit per day of attendance throughout the full school year except school and public holidays.

Biscuits will be provided to students by their school teachers, who will have been trained by the research team on allocation methods and compliance. Teachers will have access to a sheet linking students' identities to biscuit code allocations, but will be blind to which biscuits are intervention or control. Students will be called from a roll sheet by name to collect their biscuits from the teacher.

Intervention fidelity will be assessed by means of spot checks by local researchers and assistants from the PNG University of Technology in Lae. Teachers will also be asked to record absentees, and reasons for absenteeism. This will assist in post-trial association between intervention and morbidity throughout the course of the intervention.

Researchers and assistants will also be blinded to intervention product code identities throughout the trial from allocation to after statistical analysis (by means of SealedEnvelope), so privacy and research fidelity will likewise be secure from the researcher side during spot-checking activities.

Deworming treatment will be provided to all participants at the time of baseline assessment, and at the conclusion of the second term (mid year) when biological sample collection and assessments are being taken. This treatment will be in the form of a single 400mg tablet dose of Albendazole administered by trained nurses. Albendazole is effective on Hookworm, Roundworm and Whipworm soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections common in PNG, and is recommended by the World Health Organization for use in Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programs.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Control Group's treatment will consist of wheat flour-based biscuits with the same macronutrient profile and sensory/organoleptic characteristics as the intervention product, but with the exclusion of added vitamins or minerals.</comparator>

    <concealment>Recruitment will be conducted by the research team (UNSW and PNG University of Technology) 	with the direct assistance of the Morobe Divisions of Health and Education, and through the use of Sealed Envelope Ltd., an independent and centralised service widely used for randomising subjects into clinical trials. 

Personally identifiable details of the participating children will be blinded from the recruitment and research teams through the allocation of Participant ID numbers at the time participant survey completion. 

Study foods, control and intervention will be identified according to unique code numbers. Randomisation, blocking and allocation concealment will be managed through the use of Sealed Envelope Ltd., an independent and centralised service which is accessible in the field through text message, telephone or internet as services allow. In this way, the randomisation will be performed double-blind so that neither the researchers and their associates, nor students are aware of the linkage between participant and food allocation.


</concealment>
    <sequence>Eligible study participants will be stratified into seven groups on the basis of age (ages 6-12 years) at the time of enrolment. Every child in each stratum will then be allocated food products with randomly permuted blocking, taking gender into account as a potential prognostic factor. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Owing to high endemic morbidity from malaria and soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections (Hookworm) in Papua New Guinea, the primary outcome factor for this study will be haemoglobin concentration as an indicator of anaemia, with remaining nutrients playing a supportive and complementary role in addressing micronutrient deficiencies in the local diet.

According to the 2005 National Nutrition Survey conducted in PNG, the baseline mean haemoglobin levels of the target population in the Mamose region of Papua New Guinea was found to be 102 g/L (+/- SD 18). Other studies conducted in the same region have revealed Hb levels in the range of 91 - 105 g/L (SD: 11-18), all of which fall within deficient levels. On the basis of these findings and the results of a wider literature search into similar fortification studies globally, calculations to compare two independent means (2-sided) have determined a sample size requirement of 308 children per treatment group (616 students total), with a power of 0.91, an alpha of 0.05, a standard deviation of 18g/L, and a minimum difference of 5 g/L haemoglobin. This calculation takes into consideration a possible loss to followup of approximately 25%, with the power of the study remaining over 80% with 224 students per treatment group (448 students total).

Blood and urine samples will each be pooled into two groups per strata, per intervention arm, for analysis, which will reduce the burden of analytical assessment &amp; associated requirements whilst maintaining the statistical validity of the study outcome. Individual students samples will continue to be stored separately in long term storage (-80C) should further testing be required.

308 subjects per study arm (total of 616 children) will be aimed for with an attempt to include equal number of children in each age group- 6-12 years (pre-pubertal) from urban elementary and primary schools. Random allocation of students within each group will be done. Two urban schools will be targeted for the intervention, with unfortified wheat flour based products as control and fortified wheat flour products (having the recommended level of the nutrients in one portion) being randomly distributed according to the sampling plan. The baseline levels of serum albumin, retinol, ferritin (and C-Reactive Protein), folate and zinc, and the urinary excretion levels for thiamine, riboflavin, niacin will be measured in the 616 school children, in addition to stool samples for assessment of STH infection. Anthropometric measures such as height, weight, body mass index, mid arm circumference and muscle circumference will be measured using standard anthropometric measurement tools.

Data analysis will be conducted using statistical package in SPSS, and comparisons will be made between control and intervention subjects assessing for nutritional changes as a consequence of the food products consumed. This will assist the local authorities in shaping a public health response as necessary.

    <summary>1. Project Aims
In response to findings from the most recent national nutrition survey in 2005, and anthropometry data collected over thirty years, this project aims to assess the efficacy of multiple-micronutrient-fortified, wheat-flour based food product in improving the nutritional status of primary school children aged 5 to 12 years in rural and urban settings within the capital region of Lae in the Morobe Province (Mamose Region) of Papua New Guinea.

This project will fortify wheat flour with eight nutrients -Vitamins A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid, cyanocobalamin, iron and zinc (there has only been a need to add a maximum of six micronutrients into wheat flour in some asia-pacific countries). In order to assist the PNG health authorities in their deliberations with regard to the fortification of wheat flour, our study will show the efficacy of fortification through ex-vivo bioavailability studies and in vivo validation in school children in PNG in the Morobe province.

The nutrition intervention trial aims to examine the efficacy of feeding micronutrient deficient children wheat-based biscuits fortified with thiamine (Vit. B1), riboflavin (B2), nicotinic acid (B3), folic acid (B9), Cyanocobalamin (B12), Retinyl palmitate (Vit. A), iron and zinc on nutritional outcomes over a 12-month period.

The hypothesis being tested is that fortification will improve the test populations nutritional status, and impart subsequent biochemical and physical improvements as compared to a control population which receives an unfortified wheat-based biscuits. All students, intervention and control, will continue to be provided food currently served in pre-existing school meal programs.

2. Short summary of the project
This project, subject to necessary ethical clearance and having sought informed consent, sets out to:

* Develop a nutritive food for primary-school children (aged from 6- 12 years) using fortified wheat flour as a base
* Recruit a study population from urban Lae
* Conduct a baseline study to assess the biochemical and physical indices prior to intervention.
* Control all participants for soil-transmitted helminth infections (Hookworm) via a course of deworming medication throughout the course of the 9 month study.
* Conduct a nutrition intervention trial over 9 months and elucidate nutritional outcomes by means of biochemical, anthropometric assessments baseline and at the conclusion of 9-months.
* Deliver findings and issue recommendations as relevant.</summary>
