  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigates whether addition of the drug acetazolamide to a dexamethasone treatment for controlling raised intracranial pressure symptoms, related to high grade glioma brain tumour (such as headache, nausea and vomiting), will allow the dexamethasone dosage to be reduced, and whether this leads to less dexamethasone-related side-effects. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are required to restart or increase a dexamethasone treatment to control recurrent or increased symptoms of intracranial pressure, that may be related to your brain tumour, high grade glioma.

Study details:
If you like to join this study you will first be screened by your specialist to see if you meet the eligibility criteria to participate in this study. If you are deemed eligible to participate you will be randomly (by chance) assigned to
one of two possible treatment groups:
Group 1 will receive 1 tablet of 250mg acetazolamide twice per day for 8 weeks, in addition to the dexamethasone treatment. 
Group 2 will receive 1 tablet of placebo twice per day for 8 weeks, in addition to the dexamethasone treatment. 
Your chance to receive the group 1 treatment is equally high as to receive the group 2 treatment. You cannot choose to which group you are assigned and both you and your doctor will not know which treatment you received until the study is finished.

Participants will be asked to attend clinic visits every 2 weeks during the treatment period and then 1 more time (about 1 month  after having received the last treatment). During these visits the specialist will assess your physical and mental
health, and ask you about your well-being. Participants will also be asked to undergo tests and procedures, such as blood testing, scans, and questionnaire completion.</summary>
