  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will inhale 4mL technetium-99m DTPA radioaerosol in two positions in random order throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes for each of the positioning regimens on two separte days: 1. Upright sitting: or 2. Alternate Side Lying: (alternated between left and right at each minute)
The two study days will have a minimum of 48 hours washout between them and not greater than 7 days (to ensure clinical stability).
After each nebulisation a gamma camera will perform a 20 minute deposition scan incorporating a 2 minute transmission scan to outline the three-dimensional margin of the lung fields. This data will be reconstructed to determine the distribution of the deposited radioaerosol in the lungs.</interventions>

      <outcome>The 3-dimensional map of the lung fields will be divided into unit volumes (voxels). The amount of radioactivity in each voxel will be calculated. The standard deviation of the radioactivity across all voxels within the margins of the lung fields will be used as an index of uniformity of the pattern of deposition for each participant.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The concentration of the dose in the apical regions compared to the concentration for the whole lung. The 3-dimensional map of the lung fields will be divided into unit volumes (voxels). The amount of radioactivity in each voxel will be calculated. The ratio of apical:non-apical deposition of radioactivity will be determined by the mean number of counts per voxel in the apical one third of the lung field divided by the mean number of counts per voxel in the basal two thirds of the lung field.</outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be invited to read an Information for Participants document, and sign a consent form to participate in the study. Eligibility will then be confirmed with reference to the willing participantâ€™s spirometry in standing according to the most recent American Thoracic Society criteria
Participants will then be randomised via a coin toss to one of:
1. Upright sitting: to be maintained throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes, or
2. Alternate Side Lying: to be alternated between left and right at each minute during the nebulisation period of 20 minutes. 
Participants will be requested to adopt this position and maintain a normal tidal breathing pattern during the subsequent standard study inhalation. When participants return for their second study day, they will adopt the other positioning regimen.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants will inhale a 4mL radioaerosol in two positions in random order throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes:   1. Upright sitting: or
	                        2. Alternate Side Lying: (alternated between left and right at each minute) 
After each nebulisation a gamma camera will perform a 20-minute deposition scan incorporating a 2-minute transmission scan to outline the three-dimensional margin of the lung fields. This data will be reconstructed to determine the distribution of the deposited radioaerosol in the lungs. A 15% improvement in uniformity of deposition is the proposed minimum difference that would make further investigation of the alternate side lying strategy worthwhile in patient populations.

Significance of project: In many patient populations (eg, cystic fibrosis, HIV and bronchiectasis), the pattern of deposition of inhaled medication is poor and non-uniform. Typically the upper lobes receive a reduced dose compared to the rest of the lung. The ability to deliver a drug more uniformly to the lung using a strategy of side lying may have a significant impact on treatment efficacy for people with lung disease. Data from healthy participants will aid interpretation of subsequent studies in patients.</summary>
