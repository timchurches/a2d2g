  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be required to measure their own observations using a tablet based device four times per day for the length of their admission to the Hospital in the Home Service.  The observations recorded will be pulse rate, temperature, blood pressure and blood oxygen saturations.  These will be recorded using devices connected to the tablet device via a Bluetooth (TM) connection.These observations will be automatically uploaded to a secure internet based server where they will be viewed by the Clinical Nurse or Senior Medical Officer affiliated with the HITH Service.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients eligible for admission to the Hospital in the Home Service at The Townsville Hospital will be eligible for entry to this study.  Patients will receive a written information sheet on the purpose of the study and it hypotheses.  If they sign consent they will then be block randomised to receive either usual care - observations performed during nursing visits - or to take home a home monitoring device whereby they will then record their observations four times per day.  This randomisation will occur using an internet based central randomisation tool.</concealment>
    <sequence>Trial participants will be block randomised using Stratified Block Randomisation, we would achieve equal number of subjects stratified based on above 50 years and below 50years. Sample size calculations and Randomisation will be performed using the validated online resource, www.openepi.com.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size is based on the hypothesis that the satisfaction score will be higher in the Monitor group compared against the control (no monitor group). 
If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 3 %, we will need to study 400 experimental subjects (monitor group) and 400 control subjects (no monitor group) to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.9.   With the estimated standard deviations of 10 for each group, the Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.
The sample size has factored in a 15% drop out rate of patient discontinuing the study for various reasons that include, discontinuing use of machine, machine not functioning etc.
Data will be analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics by THHS epidemiologist and the statistician. Comparison of the number of nursing visits, hospital admissions and the satisfaction surveys will be conducted using either parametric  t-tests or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U tests depending on whether the distributions are approximately normal or not.   For comparing the differences between the groups ANOVA or Kruskal-wallis test will be used. Comparison of the proportions of readmissions will be performed using chi-square tests and 95%-confidence intervals. The statistical software SPSS version 21 (IBM SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) will be used for analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Hospital in the Home (HITH) Service is a new model of care in Townsville Hospital and Health Service (THHS) whereby acute patients are treated in their own home by experienced nursing staff.  This model of care has been employed at various locations across Australia and indeed the rest of the world for the past 25 years and has been established as a safe model of care with respect to patient morbidity and mortality.  The current service provision model involves patients being visited up to three times per day by nursing staff to perform observations and provide wound care, IV antibiotics and physical review.  In many instances a patient would only be visited once per day if they are physiologically stable.  In comparison, admitted inpatients receive observations on average four times per day.  This has implications for the perception of the quality of care provided under the HITH model by both patients and referring clinicians.
In the literature there are many examples of the use of Telemedicine and tablet based Telemonitoring devices in the management of chronic diseases such as Diabetes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Congestive Cardiac Failure.  There is a paucity of evidence for the use of this technology in the acute sphere such as that seen in HITH with only one article published reviewing outcomes in 41 patients.  The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate the use of a wireless TGA approved home monitoring device into the HITH Service at The Townsville Hospital.
