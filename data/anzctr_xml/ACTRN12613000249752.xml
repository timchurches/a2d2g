The selection of which eye to receive either dose was random ( central randomisation was done by computer).Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was at central administration site.
The time for intravitreal injection between both eyes of the same patient was one week</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients with bilateral advanced diabetic macular edema was selected.
randomization was done in selection of which eye will receive 4mg and the other eye will receive 8mg. Simple randomisation by using a randomisation table created by computer software 
so sometimes the right eye receive either 4 or 8 mg and vice verse.  </sequence>

Data were then imported into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 16.0) software for analysis. Baseline characteristics of the study population were presented as frequencies and percentages (%) in qualitative data or mean values and standard deviations (SD) in quantitative data. Differences between frequencies were compared by Chi-square. Differences between means were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. P-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Pearson correlation coefficient test was used to evaluate the correlations between the studied variables. Analysis Of  Variance (ANOVA) test was performed for repeated measures.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Aim: To evaluate the changes of intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide for the management of diabetic macular edema .
Design: This prospective interventional two-arm dose-response study.
Materials and Methods: 
 Nineteen patients with bilateral diabetic macular edema were included, one eye for every patient underwent intravitreal injection of 4m triamcinolone acetonide (group A, 19 eyes) and the other  eye of the same patient underwent intravitreal injection of 8mg triamcinolone acetonide (group B, 19 eyes), the selection of which eye to receive either dose was random. The patients were followed up for six months after injection , complete Ophthalmological examination and optical coherent topography were done.
Results:
 Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide was effective  in reduction of  diabetic macular edema in group A in the first three months only, while in group B with high dose (8mg) the improvement continued for 6 months after injection.
Significant intraocular pressure rise  was observed in both groups with an  incidence of 68.1 % and 73.7% in group A and  B respectively. Intraocular pressure lowering drugs were used to control intraocular pressure, two eyes, however, in each group of the same patients needed glaucoma filtration surgery after intractable glaucoma with failure of medical treatment.
 	Conclusions: Although intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide is very effective in managing diabetic macular edema and has  a lower cost than other modalities, the rise of intraocular pressure and glaucoma burden is another major concern .High corticosteroid responder is an individualized reaction irrespective of the intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide dose used.
