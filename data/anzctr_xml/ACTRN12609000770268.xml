    <interventions>Interscalene block
A single operator Dr Michael Fredrickson (MF) will place all interscalene catheters (ISCs) in the operating room.  Patients will be premedicated with oral acetaminophen 1g, diclofenac SR 75mg and omeprazole 20mg one hour before surgery.  Intravenous midazolam 2mg, alfentanil 0.5mg and cephazolin 1g will be administered 5 min prior to interscalene catheter placement.  Catheters will be placed following either the administration of a superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) or after the induction of general anaesthesia depending on patient preference.  ISCs will be placed using a combination of ultrasound and nerve stimulation.

General anaesthesia will then be administered and ropivacaine 0.5% 0.5mL/kg to a maximum of 30 mL will be administered through the ISC.

Patients with a continuous interscalene block (CISB) will then receive an ambulatory infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at the end of surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients receiving the one-off interscalene block would receive identical treatment, except no ambulatory infusion of ropivacaine would be administered at the end of surgery.</comparator>

    <concealment>An invitation to participate in the study will be posted to patients identified from the operating list.  One preoperative phone call will be made by the research assistant to assess patient's suitability for the study.  At this stage participation in this study would be discussed with the patient.  Post operatively, patients will be questioned by phone for some simple data for the first 2 days following surgery.  
Patients will be assigned to one of the two groups by random number generator, and assignments delivered in a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computerised random number generator will be used to assign the patient to one of the 2 groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Continuous interscalene block (CISB) has been shown to provide better analgesia and patient satisfaction than opioids for rotator cuff surgery.   Although CISB has been shown to provide better analgesia and patient satisfaction than opioids for rotator cuff repair, it is unknown whether these benefits apply to less painful procedures such as open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) clavicle.  For this procedure randomized trials comparing CISB with traditional opioid analgesia have not been conducted.
The purpose of the current study is to determine whether CISB provides better analgesia and patient satisfaction than traditional single shot interscalene block (the community standard) following minor shoulder procedures (ORIF clavicle).
If the primary hypothesis is confirmed, this study will provide evidence supporting the use of continuous interscalene block for this surgery.</summary>
