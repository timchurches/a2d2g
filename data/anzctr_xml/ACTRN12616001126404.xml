  <interventions>
    <interventions>For those participants randomized to receive Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT), in addition to usual care as described below, participants will receive 12 sessions of LLLT over a six-week period (twice per week) at the School of Physiotherapy Clinic, University of Otago. Treatment will be performed by a trained registered physiotherapist (Lesley Inglis (LI)) holding a current practising certificate. LI has forty years clinical experience in Physiotherapy (expertise in rehabilitation, neurobiology, and management of musculoskeletal disorders), and two years clinical experience in using LLLT to treat patients with musculoskeletal disorders.

The parameters for laser therapy treatment are standardised as follows: wavelength 980/810nm (80:20 power); output power 500mW; treatment head of 12.57cm2; irradiance of 39.79mW/cm2; treatment time per area 1 minute; dosage per area treated 30J (2.38J/cm2); 10 points of treatment from axilla to wrist; total laser therapy treatment time of 10 minutes; total dosage delivered 300J.

A total of 12 treatments will be performed, twice weekly, across a six week period. The latter may be extended to ensure all 12 treatments are provided. LI will be present throughout the treatment, and monitor the participants response to LLLT. All the costs relevant to the treatment (e.g. therapist consultation, treatment materials and administration) will be covered by the funding support.
</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will be advised to continue their usual care management for breast cancer-related lymphedema during the course of the study. This may include any pragmatic management as directed by lymphedema physiotherapists (e.g. massage and compression garments.) at the Department of Physiotherapy in Dunedin Hospital. Data on usual care treatments received by participants throughout the study will be collected at baseline (Week 0), and at 6 (Week 6) and 12 weeks post randomization (Week 12).</comparator>

      <outcome>Psychological impacts: participants will be asked to rate the impact of lymphedema on their psychological wellbeing over the past week (e.g. self-consciousness, perception of symptoms, anxiety, and emotions). Response for each item will range from 0  10, where 0 indicates not at all affect and 10 extremely affect. Scores for each item will be summed for the total score of psychological impacts. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analyses will be conducted at the end of study when all data collection, entry and validation is completed. The analysis will be descriptive in nature and provide estimates of key trial elements to determine whether to proceed a larger definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT). Demographic data and primary outcomes will be classified as continuous or categorical, and appropriate descriptive statistics and percentages will be calculated. 

Secondary outcomes will be analysed using SPSS (version 22.0) on a modified intention-to-treat basis excluding participants who have no post-randomization data. Since this is a feasibility study, tests for significance will not be performed. Descriptive statistics will be applied, and focused on confidence interval (CI) estimation. Data will be reported as mean +/- standard deviation, together with 95%CIs. Differences from baseline to the interim (6 weeks post randomization), and the primary endpoint (12 weeks post randomization) will be calculated by subtracting the mean at baseline from that at the relevant time-points, and descriptively compared between groups for the primary endpoint.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the feasibility of a fully-powered randomized controlled trial of Low Level Laser Therapy photobiomodulation (LLLT) as an adjunct treatment for management of breast cancer-related lymphedema. We will recruit 20 participants attending for treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema at the Dunedin Hospital. Patient participants will be recruited over a 6 month window, and subject to informed consent, will be offered LLLT in addition to regular treatment. Twelve treatment with laser will continue for up to 6 weeks (twice weekly), based upon current evidence. We will assess outcome measures at baseline, 6 weeks post randomization, and at 12 weeks post randomization. Primary outcome measures include the feasibility of the recruitment approaches, the acceptability of and adherence to the LLLT for patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema, and the follow-up rates. Secondary outcome measures include limb circumference, participants perceptual symptoms, psychological impacts, and activity disability.
