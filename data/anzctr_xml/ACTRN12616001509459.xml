  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised into an exercise group of either treadmill or cycle exercise. 
Exercise will last for 45 minutes (moderate intensity at 65% of VO2peak) and will last for 10 sessions over a two-week period at the Murdoch University exercise physiology laboratory.

An oral glucose tolerance test will be completed pre and post-training with blood samples taken every 30 minutes. Blood samples will also be used to measure immune related cells such as regulatory T cells. 

Familiarisation will preceed training with a VO2peak test, body composition analysis and anthropometrics measured. 

Exercise will be supervised  by the PhD student who is running the project. </interventions>

Based on Nieman et al. (Brain, Behaviour and Immunity, 2014 DOI: 10.1016). 20 participants will provide 80% power accounting for drop out to detect a difference in IL-6 marker with the a-error probability set at 0.05; f=0.875. This sample size was also increased as other markers will also be measured.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current evidence suggests exercise plays an important role in the management of blood glucose levels for individuals with T2DM.The comparison on mode of exercise on glucose regulation is not well understood and limited. Previous research have investigated treadmill or cycling exercise on glucose tolerance separately, however the comparison between the two modes of exercise on glucose regulation is limited. We seek to determine which mode of exercise would be more effective in managing glucose tolerance since walking/running is freely accessible without having the need to sign up to a gym or to invest in a bicycle. It is now understood that type 2 diabetes is associated with a chronic state of inflammation. Recent evidence have shown that exercise is beneficial in improving inflammation along with reducing insulin resistance. We aim to identify whether the mode of exercise influences the level of inflammation and glucose tolerance following a two-week training period. Findings of this study may help inform future exercise prescription to improving health status in this population.</summary>
