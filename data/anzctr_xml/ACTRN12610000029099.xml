  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Circulating testosterone levels in young healthy women exceed those of oestrogen and by the time women reach their 40s, their blood testosterone levels are about half those of women in their 20s. Restoration of testosterone levels in postmenopausal women to those of younger women improves several aspects of cognitive function using conventional tests of cognitive performance. More recently, in a pilot study of postmenopausal women given transdermal testosterone over a period of 26 weeks we observed improved verbal and visual learning and memory using highly sensitive measures of cognitive performance. The aim of this study is to use these sensitive measures of cognitive function, which can detect subtle changes in cognitive performance in well older individuals, in a randomised placebo-controlled trial to determine whether restoration of blood testosterone levels in older women to those of premenopausal women over 26 weeks enhances cognitive performance when compared with placebo therapy.</summary>
