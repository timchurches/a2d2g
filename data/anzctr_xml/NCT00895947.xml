  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to see if lozenges containing a low dose of interferon-alpha can
      prevent and/or reduce the severity of colds and flu. Starting about 1 month before the
      expected start of the winter colds and flu season in Perth, Australia, healthy volunteers
      will allow a lozenge containing interferon, or a lozenge containing no medicine (a placebo),
      to dissolve in their mouth once a day for 16 weeks. Blood tests at the start and end of
      treatment will determine whether interferon was able to prevent infections with cold/flu
      viruses. Once a week, volunteers will complete a survey about their cold/flu symptoms,
      medications taken, days of work missed, etc. to see if interferon was able to make their
      winter colds and flu less severe.</summary>
