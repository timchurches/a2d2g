  <interventions>
    <interventions>Senior anaesthetists will participate in a simulated scenario of a critical incident in theatre.  The scenario will run for approximately 20 minutes.

This will be followed by a debrief where the participant will watch  how they performed in the scenario and discuss and self assess their decisions, actions, use of resources, communication techniques, situational awareness and outcomes.  It is expected that this debrief will last for not longer than 1.5 hours

A second debrief will occur 3 to 4 weeks after the simulation where participants will reflect on the events and whether or not the experience has initiated any changes in practice or identified gaps in knowledge and expertise and any action taken or to be taken.  It is anticipated that this debrief will last approximately 1 hour.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preferred decision making processes: during the first debrief session, participants will be asked to discuss their preferred decision making processess in a crisis situation, e.g. follow algorithms or trust intuition and/or past experience</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of the first debrief</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability to reflect on decisions made during the critical scenario, and if necessary change practices: during the second debrief participants will be asked to discuss any changes to their behaviour as a result of participating in the scenario</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of the second debrief</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the means and mechanisms by which self reflection and introspection mediate adaptive behaviours and complex decision making during simulated anaesthesthetic critical incidents.  

It will also explore whether simulation can be used effectively by experienced specialist anaesthetists to self identify gaps in skills and knowledge, increase awareness of personally preferred decision making methods and strategies aimed at optimising clinician welfare.</summary>
