  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label extension of the JIGSAW studies (WA28117 [NCT01904279] and WA28118
      [NCT01904292]) is designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subcutaneous (SC)
      tocilizumab treatment in participants with polyarticular-course and systemic juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis (pJIA and sJIA). Participants from the 2 JIGSAW studies will continue to
      receive 162 milligrams (mg) of SC tocilizumab with treatment schedule according to arthritis
      subtype and body weight. Participants will receive the treatment until commercial
      availability of the drug or for a maximum of 3 years, whichever is earlier.</summary>
