  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who meet ALL of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered participation in this study and will be randomised into treatment and control group after informed consent has been obtained. 

Under endoscopic guidance, test group patients will have a sinus swab performed, followed by 10mls of the Chitodex+budesonide+mupirocin (CBM) complex applied to each side of their sinuses (total 20mls of CBM gel in one patient) by the surgeon. This is experimental practice. The treatment gel consists of 10mL 5% chitodex + 2mL buffered saline + 2mg/4mL budesonide + 10mg/4mL mupirocin (total dose for bilateral sinus cavity). This will be applied under direct visual endoscopic guidance by the surgeon to ensure all sinus cavities are filled with gel and will add approximately an additional 15 minutes to the patient's usual appointment.

Patients in the control group will be given culture sensitive oral antibiotics. This is usual practice.

The patient will be asked to return to the outpatient department 7 days later for a repeat sinus swab and a recording of their endoscopic sinus examination. The endoscopic video examination will then be scored by a blinded independent clinician for infection (pus), oedema, granulation tissue, and crusting using a standardised scale which are the study outcomes of this study. In addition, patients will be asked to complete a self-directed symptom and comfort questionnaire at each time-point.

If there are signs of persistent infection at 7 days post-application of the CBM complex, then a second swab will be taken and sent for repeat microbiological evaluation. Patients who were in the CBM group will receive another 10ml dose of CBM applied endoscopically by the surgeon into each side of their sinus cavity and patients who were in the control group will be swapped over to the gel group.

If there are no further clinical signs of infection at the 1 or 2 week post-recruitment visit, the patient will have a final microbiology swab taken to confirm eradication of infection and would be considered as having completed the study. If the patient has still not improved after 14 days, they will resume usual outpatient/surgical care for their symptoms.

The outcomes will be assessed by both the patient and an independent blinded clinician.

Pre and post treatment endoscopic scores will be performed by an independent blinded clinician using a scoring sheet specific for this study which consists of the validated Lund-Kennedy Endoscopic Score (LKES) with the addition of an evidence of infection section.

The patient will be scoring their pre and post symptoms using the VAS and SNOT-22 scoring sheet.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>After signing the consent form, participants will be randomised into one of two treatment groups:
1.	Test group, participants will receive Chitodex + Budesonide + Mupirocin gel applied to their sinuses by surgeon OR
2.	Control group, participants will receive oral antibiotics appropriate to their infection for 7 days 

At the end of the 7 day treatment participants will be re-assesses. If their infection has resolved, they would have completed the study.

If participants have not improved and were in the:
1.	Test group, they will receive another dose of the Chitodex + Budesonide (steroid) + Mupirocin (antibacterial agent) gel
2.	Control group, they will be swapped over to the test group to receive a dose of the Chitodex + Budesonide (steroid) + Mupirocin (antibacterial agent) gel

    <statisticalmethods>All results will be statistically analysed at the completion of the study. The proposed statistical test will be 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Students t-test, with a significance value set at p&lt;0.05.  

Power analysis estimates a sample size of 19 patients per arm would be required (total patients to be recruited is 38) to achieve statistical significance (80%, p = 0.05), based on response rates of 25% in control group and 70% in treatment group, as well as accounting for a 10% drop out rate.

This 70% treatment response rate may represent an underestimation as previous study conducted showed 88.9% of patients were culture negative following mupirocin sinus rinses (Jervis-Bardy et al, 2012). We have done this because it would be the first time we would be using Chitodex gel as a drug vehicle for Mupirocin and by doing so it would increase our probability of detecting smaller clinical responses.  For the control group, the 25% response rate estimation is based on clinical observation that chronically infected patients have responded poorly to conventional therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is aimed at improving outcomes for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, particularly the cohort of patients who experience persistent CRS symptoms despite optimum medical and surgical therapy, termed as recalcitrant CRS (rCRS). 

We hope that we are able to developed an agent that could help manage persistent infections in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis even after they have had surgery and potentially improve patient's symptoms and reduce the need for revision surgery.

The primary end point of this study is to:
1. To assess the efficacy of Chitodex-Budesonide-Mupirocin gel in treating patients with recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitits
Measured by:
1) Eradication of bacteria confirmed with microbiological swab
2) Independently scored video endoscopic examination of sinuses pre and post treatment
3) Patient's symptoms score pre and post treatment
The secondary end point of this study is to:
1. Assess the tolerability of the treatment gel vs oral antibiotics
