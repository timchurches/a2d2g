  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A5301005 is a phase 1 study in patients with solid tumors which is testing the safety and
      tolerability of adding targeted agents to a standard chemotherapy. CP-868,596 is a
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor (PDGFR) and AG-13736 is a vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor (VEGFR). This study will test the use of
      docetaxel (the standard chemotherapy) with either CP-868,596 or the combination of CP-868,596
      and AG-13736.</summary>
