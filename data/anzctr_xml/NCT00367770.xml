  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tracleer®

Experimental: Tracleer - The starting dose for all patients will be 62.5 mg b.i.d. At the Week 4 visit, patients who were started on 62.5 mg b.i.d. will be uptitrated to 125 mg b.i.d. if the 62.5 mg b.i.d. dose was well-tolerated.


Treatment: drugs: Tracleer®
Patients will receive up to 125 mg b.i.d. of Tracleer.
