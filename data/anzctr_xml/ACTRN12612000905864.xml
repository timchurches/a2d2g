  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises 5-10 minutes of electronic motivational assessment and personalised feedback on alcohol consumption via an iPad. Specifically, participants in the intervention group complete: the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); questions concerning the largest number of standard drinks consumed on one occasion in the last four weeks, the duration of the drinking episode in hours, and body weight for the purpose of estimating their blood alcohol concentration; and the 10-item Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ). 

On completion of the above, participants in the intervention group will receive personalised feedback comprising the following:
(i) the patients AUDIT score and guidance on its meaning;
(ii) an estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for their heaviest episode in the previous month with information on the behavioural and physiological sequelae of various BACs, and traffic crash relative risk;
(iii) estimates of spending per month;
(iv) a bar graph comparing episodic consumption with medical recommendations, and that of adults of the same age and gender;
(v) a bar graph comparing weekly consumption with medical recommendations, and with adults of the same age and gender;
(vi) an LDQ score with an explanation of the associated health risk and information about how to reduce that risk.

Further web pages will be presented as options, offering facts about alcohol, tips for reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm, and information as to where medical help and counselling support could be found. 

Participants will be contacted for follow up 6 and 12 months later.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group only completes the first 3 items of the AUDIT, known as the AUDIT Consumption subscale (AUDIT-C). Subjects in the control group will not receive personalised feedback. Participants in the control group will be contacted for follow up 6 and 12 months post randomisation.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients attending the Ambulatory Care Centre will be eligible for inclusion if they are 18 years of age or older, live in the Hunter New England Local Health District, provide informed consent, and screen positive for hazardous drinking.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients who cannot read English, unable to self-administer the e-SBI instrument via the iPad, or are moving to an unknown address during the next 12 months (ie., will be lost to follow-up) will not be recruited. 

Following screening, participants will be excluded if they: 
(i) have not consumed any alcohol in the past 12 months;
(ii) report they are currently receiving treatment for their drinking;
(iii) do not screen positive for hazardous drinking in the past 12 months (AUDIT-C &lt;5); 
(iv) may be dependent on alcohol (AUDIT-C &gt;9).</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Research assistants located in one (South Block) of the waiting areas in the Ambulatory Care Centre (ACC) will be trained in the application of a study protocol stipulating they should invite the next patient leaving the reception desk (awaiting a medical consultation) to participate in the study, obtain informed consent, and log the participant onto an iPad. When the participant has finished with the iPad, the research assistant will return to the reception desk to recruit the next patient. In the event that there are no patients leaving the reception desk (for a period of 5 minutes), research assistants will invite patients occupying particular seats in rotation around the waiting area (clockwise and then anticlockwise).

As randomisation after screening will be effected by computer, research staff will not be aware of participantsâ€™ group allocations. Participants will be blind to the true nature of the study also as they will be asked to consent to participate in a series of surveys rather than a trial.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Since alcohol consumption is linked to more than 60 different medical conditions and is the most common preventable risk factor associated with injuries in Australia, interventions that can reduce these harms are needed.  This study is designed to determine whether a computer-based brief alcohol intervention reduces hazardous drinking among hospital outpatients. If effective, the intervention could be implemented nationally as part of routine service delivery.</summary>
