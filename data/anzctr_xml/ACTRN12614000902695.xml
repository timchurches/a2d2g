  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twelve month observation of sleep quality and activity levels in patients implanted with the Medtronic RestoreSENSOR implantable pulse generator (IPG) for management of chronic back pain +/- leg pain.

The Medtronic RestoreSENSOR IPG uses motion sensors to detect changes in posture and activity and then automatically adjusts the level of electrical stimulation needed for relief of chonic pain symptoms.  The motion-sensing implant eliminates the need for constant manual real-time adjustments for positional changes, and stores the frequency of posture and activity changes.

The range of electrical stimulation is approximately 60-80hz.  The duration of treatment is up to 12 months for observational data collection.  Following this, the patient will resume standard of care, with duration of implant to be determined by the patient/physician.

The IPG/sensor is located internally in a position determined by the physician (eg. buttock, lateral flank/axillae).  The duration of implant procedure is approximately 20-30mins.  The entire procedure is conducted as per usuual standard of care.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a minimally invasive procedure used for the treatment of persistent, refractory and neuropathic pain. 

Conventional SCS systems require regular manual adjustments of the level of electrical stimulation after initial programming. These adjustments are necessary because the level of the spinal cord stimulation is dependent on the distance between the spinal cord and the implanted electrodes, which changes with patients daily activity (e.g., standing, lying down, seating, etc.). When a patient changes body position, the movement of the spinal cord relative to the implanted lead may result in uncomfortable or inconsistent stimulation. This may lead to suboptimal pain control and significantly reduce the effectiveness of the SCS therapy, which may impact heavily on patients quality of life. For instance, one of the most important daily activities  sleep, may be significantly affected by the inconsistent stimulation. This may compromise effective treatment and lead to increase in the levels of dissatisfaction and pain.

The RestoreSENSOR (Medtronic Inc, USA) is the first in its class implantable pulse generator for spinal cord stimulation that automatically changes stimulation settings in response to position changes and provides objective patient activity data. It achieves this thanks to the inbuilt acceleration sensor that enables continuous motion sensing. The Medtronic RestoreSENSOR neurostimulator also records and stores the frequency of patients posture and activity changes.  These objective data can be used by the clinician to understand whether the patients individual stimulation requirements are changing over time.

If the SCS therapy with RestoreSENSOR improves patients quality of sleep and activity levels in this study, this will demonstrate superior effectiveness of position-adaptive stimulation technology in providing pain relief and convenience to patients suffering from chronic pain.

Improvement in quality of sleep and daily activity levels will serve as an indicator of efficacy of the treatment.</summary>
