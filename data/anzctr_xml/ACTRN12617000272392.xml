  <interventions>
    <interventions>Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) will be compared using three different surgical approaches. Anterior, Lateral and Posterior. Each approach has approximately the same surgical time of 90-120 minutes.

Posterior Approach:
This approach is the most common approach for THA worldwide today, made popular by Moore in 1959. This approach also allows excellent visualisation of the femoral shaft but involves detachment of the short external rotators of the hip with a posterior capsulotomy.
Hardinge Approach:
This was first described by Hardinge in 1982. This approach requires the reflection of gluteus medius and minimus muscles off the greater trochanter.
Anterior Approach:
Initial description of this approach to the hip joint was by Smith-Petersen. It utilises the anatomic internervous plane between the superior gluteal nerve laterally and femoral nerve medially and has recently been popularised for THR, but its first reported use dates back to 1947 in France by Judet and colleagues.

Patients will be randomised to surgical approach for THA.
Each consultant surgeon will perform the approach which is their usual standard of care.
Pre-operatively and post-operatively PROMs (OHS, VAS) will be taken at 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months.
Complications will be monitored, specifically dislocation, infection and revision.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a three-arm randomised controlled trial. Three arms will be compared directly.
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between approaches.
It is not possible to use one approach as the surgical control.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The null hypothesis for this study is that patient reported outcomes following three different approaches for THA are no different when directly compared after 24 months post-procedure. In addition we hypothesise that complication rates are the same between approaches. There is no randomised controlled trial that directly compares these three approaches for THA. We are hence designing our study as a superiority study looking for a significant difference in OHS and VAS between the different trial arms.

The randomization list will be computer-generated by an independent statistician. A stratified block permuted randomization will be used with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale (grade 0-2 vs. grade 3-4) as the stratification variable. The block size will not be disclosed to ensure concealment. Randomization will be enabled through a secure, web-based application. 
The trial investigators will perform patient enrolment and random assignment. Patients will be randomised to one of three operative types within the patients Kellgren-Lawrence grading stratum. 

The nine surgeons performing the operation will be assigned to an operation type according to their expertise. Each surgeon will perform a single operation type and each operation type will be conducted by three surgeons.
A patient will be managed by one of the three surgeons corresponding to the treatment group the patient is randomly assigned to with the actual surgeon depending on the surgeons roster at the time the patient presents him/herself for the operation. It is anticipated that each surgeon will treat roughly the same number of patients
The study will enrol a total of 243 patients to be treated by nine orthopaedic surgeons at Western Health or 81 patients per operation type. 

The primary hypothesis will be examined by three contrasts evaluating the change from pre-operation to 24 months post-procedure in OHS overall score for the posterior versus Hardinge approach, the posterior versus anterior approach, and the Hardinge versus anterior approach using an alpha level of 1.67% for each contrast to allow for the three comparisons. The primary hypothesis will be rejected if at least one of the three comparisons reaches statistical significance using the two-sided Holm-Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level.  An estimate and corresponding two-sided multiplicity-adjusted 98.33% confidence interval will be provided for each comparison. This analysis method uses a model-based approach to handle missing data providing valid inference if the missing data mechanism is ignorable (i.e., missing completely at random or missing at random). A range of sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the primary model results will be performed to explore the impact of the results of different missing data techniques under the same and under different missingness assumptions. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a project analysing three surgical approaches for the same orthopaedic procedure, total hip arthroplasty (THA).
This study will be conducted as a pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing three approaches to the hip joint for this procedure  anterior, posterior and direct lateral (Hardinge) approaches.
The null hypothesis is there will be no difference in outcomes between three approaches in terms of patient satisfaction with the procedure. We will measure this via validated scores: patient reported outcome measures (PROMs).</summary>
