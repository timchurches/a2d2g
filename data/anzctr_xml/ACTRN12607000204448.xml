  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment group: receive verbal instruction and standardised written advice and an exercise program from a physiotherapist. This is given at the time of, or within one week of,  plaster removal at an out-patient appointment. Subjects are instructed to peform range of motion exercises immediately following removal of plaster, 5 times every hour during the day. Stretching exercises begin 2 weeks after plaster removal and involve 3-4 stretches hourly. Strengthening exercises begin 3 weeks after plaster removal and involve up to 12 repetitions twice per day. Patients are instructed to continue these exercises until they feel their hand/wrist has returned to normal.</interventions>
