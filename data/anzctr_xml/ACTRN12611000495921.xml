  <interventions>
    <interventions>From the main study criteria (ACTRN12611000479909), patients with reduced PCR/ATP ratio of &lt; 1.7 will be eligible to participate in the therapeutic metformin sub-study.  They will have a baseline 10ml blood sample before having 12 weeks treatment of either metformin 1g orally 3 x daily or placebo orally 3 x daily before crossing over to the other treatment after a 4 week drug wash-out period.  At the end of each 12 week treatment phase they will have another 10ml blood sample, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast (0.025mmol/kg body weight), cardiac magnetic resonance spectroscopy with adenosine intravenously (140mcg/kg/min) for 3-6 mins and echocardiography.</interventions>
    <comparator>40 patients will take part in the therapeutic metformin sub-study. In a double-blind randomised control trial manner, they will either receive metformin tablets 1g 3 x daily or placebo tablets 3 x daily for 12 weeks, and be crossed over to the other treatment arm after a 4 week drug wash-out period.  Placebo is packed with microcrystalline cellulose.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>HCM is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder and can cause significant morbidity and mortality, including the most serious complications of heart failure and sudden death.  At present, there are no proven pharmacological therapies that either prevent or cause regression of clinical features.  This is largely due to a lack of knowledge in our understanding of the molecular and functional consequences of the disease-causing gene mutations leading to the clinical disease.  The proposed study will aim to test whether cardiac energetic compromise is a central pathophysiological mechanism in HCM.  We will investigate potentially beneficial treatments based on our hypothesis, by trialling the use of metformin in an HCM group.  If the results from this proof of concept study are confirmatory, it could pave the way for larger multi-centre randomised studies (with longer duration of treatment) with either metformin or facilitators of fatty acid oxidation such as ranolazine.  If realised, these treatments could prevent the vicious cycle of cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial dysfunction seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, leading to improved morbidity and mortality. 
These investigations will establish early phenotype changes in HCM patients and provide insights into potential therapeutic interventions for a condition that currently has little therapeutic evidence base.  This therapeutic sub-study is linked to the main study ACTRN12611000479909.</summary>
