  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be a multicentre, prospective, double blind, RCT with a 2 x 2 factorial design

Participants (N= 232) will be randomised to receive:

Arm 1: Pre-operative immunonutrition and post-operative immunonutrition (n=58)
Arm 2: Pre-operative immunonutrition and post-operative control nutrition (n=58)
Arm 3: Pre-operative control nutrition and post-operative immunonutrition (n=58)
Arm 4: Pre-operative control nutrition and post-operative control nutrition (n=58)

Pre-operative supplement- Active

Participants are required to consume orally, in addition to their normal diet, 3 x 74g sachets of pre-operative supplement to be dissolved in water up to 900ml for seven days prior to surgery (21 sachets total/ participant). Patients who have total dysphagia will be fed enterally (either nasoenteric or jejunostomy feeding tube).

The oral immunonutrition supplement contains 909kCal, 50.4g total protein (includes 11.4g free L-arginine), 3.0g omega-3 fatty acids EPA, DHA and alpha linolenic acid (LNA) and 1.2g RNA per 900ml. 

Post-operative supplement- Active

Patients will be fed the post-operative formula supplement for 7 days consecutive days after oesophagectomy via their jejunostomy which will be inserted during the oesophagectomy procedure. Feeding will commence on day +1 following surgery at a rate of 40ml/hr (for 24 hours) unless otherwise indicated by the treating surgeon or delegate. Feeds will be upgraded daily if tolerated in 20ml increments to the maximum rate required to meet 100% of their estimated postoperative energy and protein requirements or at the treating surgeon/ delegates discretion. The total volume of fluid should not exceed 90mls/hr without the treating surgeon/ delegates approval. 

The post-operative immunonutrition supplement formula contains 1010kCal, 56g total protein (includes 13g arginine), 3.3g omega-3 fatty acids EPA, DHA &amp; LNA and 1.3g RNA per 1000ml.</interventions>
    <comparator>Pre-operative supplement- Control

Participants randomised to the pre-op control group are required to consume orally, in addition to their normal diet, 3 x 74g sachets of  supplement to be dissolved in water up to 900ml for seven days prior to surgery (21 sachets total/ participant). Patients who have total dysphagia will be fed enterally (either nasoenteric or jejunostomy feeding tube). The oral control supplement contains 909kCal, 39g total protein (without free L-arginine), nil omega 3 fatty acids or RNA per 900ml.


Post-operative supplement- Control
Patients randomised to the control group post-op will be fed as per the active group. Nursing staff, Dietetic Assistant/Aides or Dietitians will be blinded to the type of supplement allocated to the patient. The feeds will be labelled trial formula. There is no difference in administration between the active and control groups. The post-operative control supplement formula contains 1020kCal, 70g total protein and does not contain added arginine, omega 3 fatty acids or RNA.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutritional status assessed by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). 

The PG-SGA is a validated tool for assessing the nutritional status of cancer patients. This tool provides a global rating of either A (well nourished), B (suspected or moderately malnourished) or C (severely malnourished). This global rating is based upon weight change, dietary intake, gastro-intestinal symptoms, a physical examination and the patient's functional capacity. A total PG-SGA score is also calculated. A higher score reflects a higher risk of malnutrition and an increased need for nutrition intervention and symptom management.

The site Dietitians conducting this assessment will undergo training and testing for inter-rater reliability on nutritional status measures prior to commencing data collection.</outcome>

QOL will be assessed using three tools;

1. the general oncology QOL tool: the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire QLQ-C30 (version 3.0)

2. the oesophageal cancer-specific QOL tool; the EORTC QLQ-OESI8 (phase III module)

    <concealment>Patients will be assessed to ensure that they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the study and be given a participant information sheet. This process may occur at any stage up to within seven days of surgery.

The investigator must keep a log of all patients screened (both eligible and not eligible) and a confidential record of all eligible patients recruited into the study. Patients who undergo any study related procedures (and thus assign a patient screening number) but fail to receive study treatment for any reasons will be included in the analysis of the study. A screening and enrolment log, which documents the screening number, patient initials and reason(s) for screen failure is to be maintained by the investigator. A copy of the log must be retained in the investigator’s study file.

A consenting patient will be allocated the treatment by a Randomiser independent of the study, who will provide the staff responsible for the dispensing the treatment (either Pharmacy or Food Service Staff independent of the study) the treatment allocation in a sealed opaque envelope. The dispensed treatment will be decoded and labelled ‘trial product’ so that neither the patient, nor the ward nursing staff administering the ‘trial product’ are aware of the treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patient numbers will be assigned sequentially to patients as soon as they sign the informed consent form.

At each site, patients will be randomly assigned in variable blocks using a computer generated randomisation sequence. The randomisation sequence will be kept separately from the study investigators.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares the effects of a specialised nutritional supplement to boost the immune system compared with the standard formula, both before and after surgery, in people undergoing major surgery for oesophageal cancer. 

You can participate in this study if you are scheduled to have oesophagectomy or oesophago-gastrectomy for oesophageal cancer. 

Participants will be randomly divided into one of four groups. One group will receive a nutritional supplement with added immunonutrition (IN) pre-surgery and the standard isocaloric nutritional supplement post surgery. A second group will receive IN both before and after surgery. The third group will receive the standard supplement prior to surgery and IN following surgery, whilst the fourth group will receive the standard formula both before and after surgery. Patients will be monitored at 7 and 1 day before surgery and 14 and 42 days after surgery. 

The study aims to see whether the IN product before and/or after surgery will decrease the rate of infective and non-infective complications that often occur in people undergoing this surgery.</summary>
