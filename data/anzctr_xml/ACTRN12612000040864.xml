  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a pilot cohort study in which women will be approached to take part in the antenatal or early post natal period and explained the advantages and disadvantages of immediate post partum insertion of an IUD or an implant. Women will be free to choose which method they wish to use and will be given a script to obtain the implant or IUD prior to their admission for delivery.  Women having an elective caesarean section will have the device placed at the time of surgery. Women having a vaginal birth will have the implant or the IUD inserted within 48 hours of delivery. We will follow women up clinically at 6 weeks and then at 6 months via email or telephone contact. The implants can remain in place for up to 3 years, the intrauterine copper device (depending on the type) for 5-10 years and the intrauterine system for 5 years. These methods can be removed at any time if the woman experiences sides effects or wishes to conceive.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To document the safety and acceptability of intrauterine devices and implants inserted immediately post partum.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 6 weeks the woman will be assessed clinically to confirm that the device is correctly placed and to document any   any side effects experienced to that point. Women will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about their satisfaction with the method. At 6 months post partum women will be contacted via email or telephone and asked to complete a questionnaire to record side effects and satisfaction with the method.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine ongoing use of these methods at 6 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Women will be contacted at 6 months post partum via email or phone and asked to complete a structure questionnaire about their continued use of their chosen method and if they have ceased using the method what were the primary reasons</timepoint>
