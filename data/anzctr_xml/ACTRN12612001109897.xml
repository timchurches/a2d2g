  <interventions>
    <interventions>It is comparison of two different surgical techniques for flexor tendon repair. 1knot technique(Group A) or 2 knot technique(Group B) with approximate duration of 60-120 min in both techniques. Early active mobilization of affected digits will be started from 1st postoperative day in both groups.Patients will follow this rehabilitation protocol for 8 weeks ,with change of exercises will be told to patients on followups.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group A patients will have 1 knot for flexor tendon repair while group B patients will have 2 knots.Group A can be described as control treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>1-knot flexor tendon repair is stronger than 2-knot repair in term of total active motion</outcome>
      <timepoint>Total active motion 3, 6 and 8 weeks postoperatively and a final assessment performed at 12 weeks  postoperatively.Total active motion will assessed with by goniometry.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Tendon rupture</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 3, 6 and 8 weeks postoperatively and a final assessment performed at 12 weeks  postoperatively by clinical examination .In suspicious cases Ultrasonic exam will be done.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the study is to compare the outcome of flexor tendon repair techniques in term of total active motion between two groups. Flexor tendon repair will be done by consultant using 4 strands of double modified Kessler grasping core suture 4-0 polypropylene suture material with 1 knot(Group A) or 2 knot (Group B) placed between tendon ends. Both groups will undergo early active mobilization protocol starting from first post operative day. All patients will be clinically assessed in term of total active motion 3, 6 and 8 weeks postoperatively and a final assessment performed at 12 weeks  postoperatively by the researcher and data will be entered in the proforma.</summary>
