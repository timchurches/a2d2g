  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will utilise routine cardiotocography (CTG) to monitor the fetal heart rate of the fetus antenatally.  At the same time, a novel device , the fetal heart rate device (HEARD) will be attached to their abdomen to monitor the fetal hear rate as well. Heard utilises a form of abdominal ECG to monitor the fetal heart rate. For this study, HEARD will not be utilised to guide care and only for passive monitring.  This process will take place for a duration of 30 minutes. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For the following study, a sample size of 50 was estimated based on similar proof of concept studies. This was based on the assumption that the level of a was set at 0.05 and a power of 90% This was based on an estimated recruitment rate of 55 with non responders of 10%.  
For the primary objective, statistical tests will be utilised to test the device agreement with routine CTG for measurement of the FHR- considered to be the gold standard. 
For device concordance, outputs onHEARD and the CTG will be measured and compared electronically using cross correlation. Signal to Residue Ratio (SRR) will be used to compare similarity and how much different the signal from HEARD is from the control and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be used for the error for each point in the plot. For UA, a cross correlation statistic will be utilised. 
Measurement of device diagnostic accuracy will be made by calculating the sensitivity, specificity , negative predictive value and positive predictive values of HEARD to regular CTG. This will be done by comparing the assessments by clinicians of the CTGs through the reporting tool provided.
For the secondary objectives, information of the views of the patients and clinicians, as recorded on the Lickerts scale, will be measured utilising not parametric procedures, given its ordinal nature.
For the qualitative feedback provided through their forms, a deductive approach will be utilised to group data from questionnaires to highlight themes based on the similarities and differences in the responses provided by the women/ clinicians.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The fetal heart rate device (HEARD) is a novel device developed by BIORITHM, a medical technology company, to assess fetal heart rate. For the following study, the current phase entails a proof of concept in women antenatally to assess the quality of signals obtained on HEARD.For this, HEARD will be utilised together with the conventional cardiotocography (CTG) to ascertain the equivalence of HEARD with conventional electronic fetal monitoring 
Aims
1. Examine the efficacy of HEARD in capturing fetal heart rates in comparison to conventional CTG monitoring (i.e can we capture the FHR on HEARD as well as we can on CTG?)
2.  Examine the interpretation of the output from HEARD in comparison to CTG by clinicians (do clinicians interpret both traces the same way?) 
3. Elicit patient opinion about utilising HEARD ( i.e. What do patients think?)
4. Elicit clinician opinion about utilising HEARD ( i.e. What do doctors think?)
Research design
The following study is a cross sectional survey with a cohort design. The following design has been chosen as it is the design of choice in evaluating a diagnostic test. Utilising the following design, measurements of test accuracy and precision will be carried out on HEARD in comparison to CTG.
Methods
Primary outcomes:
1.   Correlation between the duration of output obtained from HEARD and routine CTG over a similar time period
2.   Correlation between the information obtained from HEARD and CTG as interpreted by clinicians
Secondary Outcomes
1.   Patient views on HEARD (i.e  pros, cons, will they recommend it, areas for improvement etc.)
2.   Clinician views on HEARD (i.e pros, cons, ease of application, areas for improvement, will they utilise it for their own patients)
