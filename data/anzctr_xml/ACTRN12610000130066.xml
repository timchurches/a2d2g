  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B in a daily dose of 3mg/kg body weight for 5 consecutive days. Efficacy will be based on clinical response (No fever, weight gain = 0.5 kg compared with baseline, and any decrease in spleen size compared with baseline), laboratory findings (Increase of haemoglobin by 10% compared to baseline or to at least 10g/dl) and parasitological assessment (eradication of parasite at day 19 or 45 after end of treatment)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six months after end of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety of liposomal amphotericin B when administered in the proposed dosage regimen. Safety will be assess by recording and calculation of overall incidence of all adverse events which is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory (or vital, etc.) finding, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During treatment, at end of treatment and at six months after end of treatment</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Liposomal preparation of amphotericin B is found to have good efficacy (&gt;97%) against visceral leishmaniasis in India. As there is there is no information about the use of liposomal amphotericin B in Bangladesh, this study is proposed to determine the efficacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in Nepalese patients. Fifthy patients will be enrolled to receive a dose of 3 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B for 5 consecutive days (total dose 15mg/kg) with regard to final cure rate at six months after the end of treatment.</summary>
