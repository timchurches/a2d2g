Experimental: Treatment (combination chemotherapy) - INDUCTION THERAPY COURSE I: Patients receive cytarabine IT on day 1 and cytarabine IV continuously over 96 hours, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously, and oral thioguanine BID on days 1-4. COURSE II: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV over 3 hours BID on days 1, 2, 8, and 9 and asparaginase (IM) on days 2 and 9.
COURSE III: Patients receive treatment as in course I. COURSE IV: Patients receive cytarabine IV, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV, and oral thioguanine as in course I
INTENSIFICATION THERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 168 hours on days 1-7 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating young
      patients with Down syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
