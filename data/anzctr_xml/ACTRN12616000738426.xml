    <interventions>Patients will be treated with Oral Dasatinib at one of 4 dose levels: Dose level 0 = 100mg daily; Dose level -1 = 70mg daily; and Dose level -2 = 50mg daily. Dose level -3 = 50mg alternate daily (exists in this protocol only for treatment re-introduction in the event of treatment cessation for toxicity).
All patients will commence treatment with dasatinib at 100mg once daily. Dose adjustments may occur at day 7, 28 and 56. In general, a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) result should be available from the central lab within 5 days of sample receipt.
At day 7, plasma dasatinib trough level will be performed for all patients.
1. Patients with trough level greater than or equal to 3nM will decrease their dose
from 100mg once daily to 70mg once daily (i.e. dose level 1).
2. Patients with trough level less than 3nM will continue with 100mg once daily
At day 28, all patients will have a further dasatinib trough level performed
1. Patients with trough level less than 3nM will continue with their assigned dose at day 7
2. Patients with trough level greater than or equal to 3nM will decrease their dose by 1 dose level
-Patients on 70mg once daily will take 50mg once daily
-Patients on 100mg once daily will take 70mg once daily
At day 56, all patients will have a further dasatinib trough level performed.
1. Patients on 70mg at this time point with a plasma trough level of greater than or equal to 3nM will dose decrease to 50mg daily. No dose adjustment will occur for other patients for pharmacokinetic reasons.
In addition to TDM directed dose reductions, patients may have dose reductions for toxicity management at any time during their treatment.
Further trough levels will be performed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Dose adjustments at these time points will only occur for toxicity management and will not be determined by trough drug level.
Molecular monitoring for disease response will be performed on all patients, specified as a series of time dependent molecular targets: BCR-ABL1 = 10%, 1% and 0.1% at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. Patients on reduced dose dasatinib will automatically dose escalate for failing to meet any of these targets:
i) Failing to achieve BCR-ABL1 =10% at 3 months or beyond OR BCR-ABL1 =1% at 12 months  resume 100mg daily;
ii) Failing to achieve BCR-ABL1 =1% at 6 months OR BCR-ABL1 =0.1% at 12 months 
 patients to dose increase by one level every 3 months up to 100mg once daily, until target response is achieved.
The treatment period of this study will be 2 years. If clinically appropriate, patients will remain on their assigned therapy beyond this point and receive active follow-up for a further 3 years.  Drug accountability logs will be used.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of individualised dosing of dasatinib for elderly patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia. Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 60 years or over, and have been diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukaemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) in the previous three months. Study details All participants in this study will start taking dasatinib at 100mg per day. At day 7, a blood sample will be taken to measure the levels of dasatinib in the blood just prior to taking that day's dose. If the blood dasatinib level is above a certain point, then the daily dose will be decreased to 70mg per day. If the blood dasatinib level is adequately low, then the participant will continue taking 100mg per day. This process will be repeated on days 28 and 56, with further lower dose levels of 50mg per day and 50mg every other day available if blood dasatinib levels are above the specific concentration. The dose level may also be dropped at any time if signs of drug toxicity are present. Participants may also be escalated back up a dose level (up to a maximum of 100mg per day), if further blood tests every 3-6 months show that the drug has not sufficiently decreased markers of the leukaemia, i.e. treatment has not been adequately effective. Participants will continue taking the drug for the two year study period, followed by a further three years if it has proven to be safe and effective in these patients. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information on whether an individualised dose of dasatinib can be used in elderly CML-CP patients to minimise toxicity whilst maintaining the therapeutic effect to treat the disease</summary>
