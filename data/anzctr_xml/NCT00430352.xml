  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE) - Overall Summary - Data presented include percentage of participants with any AE, any infusion-related AE, any serious adverse event (SAE), any infusion-related SAE (counted separately from SAEs), death, and participants with toxicity as the primary cause for treatment discontinuation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - Percentage of Participants With an Event - PFS was measured from the day of first rituximab maintenance infusion until the date of first documented disease progression or death by any cause. Participants who experienced none of these events at the time of analysis (clinical cutoff) and participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at their last clinical assessment date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after last dose</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-Free Survival (EFS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event - The percentage of participants who experienced PD or death or required a next or new lymphoma treatment over a study period of 2 years with 1 year of follow-up. EFS was measured from the day of first rituximab maintenance infusion until the date of first documented disease progression, death by any cause, or the institution of new anti-lymphoma treatment. Participants who experienced none of these events at the end of the study and participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at their last clinical assessment date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, every 8 weeks during treatment, and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after last dose</timepoint>

      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event - As a measure of overall survival (OS), the percentage of participants who died over the study period of 2 years with 1 year of follow-up. OS was determined from the day of first rituximab maintenance infusion until the date of death irrespective of cause. Participants who had not died at the time of end of the whole study and participants who were lost to follow up were censored at the date of the last contact.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Next Lymphoma Treatment (NLT) - Percentage of Participants With an Event - As a measure of time to NLT (TNLT), the percentage of participants with new lymphoma treatment over a study period of 2 years with 1 year of follow-up. TNLT was measured from the date of first rituximab maintenance infusion to the date of first documented intake of any new anti-lymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, etc). Participants who did not have documentation that an NLT had started and participants who were lost to follow up were censored at their last visit where the assessment for start of any new lymphoma medication was actually made.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Response by Best Response to Study Treatment - Percentage of participants with complete response (CR), unconfirmed CR (CRu), no change, or progressive disease (PD). For each participant, the last response to induction therapy immediately prior to study entry was compared to the best response observed during rituximab maintenance therapy. Where possible, assessment of response was based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With PR Who Converted to CRu - Percentage of participants with PR or CR(u) conversion while on rituximab maintenance therapy over a study period of 2 years with 1 year of follow-up. For each participant, the last response to induction therapy immediately prior to study entry was compared to the best response observed during rituximab maintenance therapy. Assessment and definition of response was based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for NHL.</outcome>
