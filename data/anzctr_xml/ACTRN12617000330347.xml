  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Gala Airway Treatment system will be used to deliver treatment to all participants enrolled in the trial (single arm - no blinding).  
The Gala Airway Treatment system is a  device-based, energy delivery system that delivers high frequency short duration energy to the airway epithelium and sub-mucosal tissue layers.  The energy is delivered via a proprietary catheter through the bronchoscope.
Two sessions of treatment will be delivered one month apart.   Energy of 2500 volts will be delivered to the airways in very short bursts between 15 and 20 times per lung.  The right lung is treated at the first treatment session and the left lung is treated at the second treatment session (approximately one month after the right side is treated). Treatment will be delivered by a respiratory physician (interventional pulmonologist) in a tertiary teaching hospital during a bronchoscopic procedure.  The bronchoscopy will be delivered during general anaesthesia. It is anticipated that the bronchoscopic procedure will last less than 60 minutes in total.  Treatment will be deemed to have been delivered following the successful treatment during the two bronchoscopies.
A third bronchoscopy will be performed three months following the second treatment session where treatment is not delivered but a cryo-biopsy will be taken from the airway sites that have been treated during the two previous bronchoscopic treatment session to evaluate the effect of the treatment on the airways producing excessive mucous.
Subjects will be required to submit to several tests during the study including two CT scans (lung), respiratory function tests, exercise testing.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Gala Therapeutics Airway Treatment System for Chronic Bronchitis in Australia will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the technology in up to 12 adult patients across three sites in Australia,  
Patients with chronic bronchitis for a minimum of 2 years will be enrolled.  Patients with a history of pacemaker / implantable defibrillator and cardiac arrhythmias as well as prior lung surgery, such as lung transplant, LVRS, lung implant/prosthesis, metal stent, valves, coils, bullectomy, segmentectomy, or lobectomy will not be considered for the trial.. The trial is  single arm / non randomised (it is intended that each patient enrolled in the trial will receive the treatment under investigation) and is non blinded (patients and clinicians will be aware that the treatment is being delivered). 
The trial will subject consented participants to treatment by the Gala Therapeutics Airway Treatment system over 2 bronchoscopies that will be performed by trained respiratory physicians (interventional pulmonologists) in tertiary teaching hospitals.  Patients will be anaesthetised for these procedures.  A third bronchoscopy will be performed in order to take airway biopsies to assess the effect of the treatment on the cells that produce mucous in the airways. 
Subjects will also be required to undertake several tests during the study including 2 CT scans (Lung), respiratory function tests, exercise testing and blood tests.  Subjects will be followed for 1 year following the second bronchoscopy.</summary>
