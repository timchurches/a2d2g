  <eligibility>

4.	Be levodopa responsive and have been receiving treatment with a stable dose of levodopa [3-10 doses per day of any levodopa preparation (including controlled release (CR), immediate release (IR) or a combination of CR/IR), plus benserazide/carbidopa; with or without addition of a catechol O methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor] and may be receiving concomitant treatment with stable doses of a dopamine agonist, an anticholinergic for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening visit.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dyskinesia is the jerking or twisting movement that can occur in patients with Parkinsons disease when their medication is working. Dyskinesia impacts on quality of life in Parkinsons disease. Treatment of dyskinesia is difficult. Recent scientific evidence from an animal model of Parkinsons disease suggests that Famotidine, a medication used in the treatment of excess stomach acid, may reduce dyskinesia in Parkinsons disease. Famotidine works by blocking histamine receptors. Histamine receptors are present in the stomach and also in the brain. In this study we will test the effectiveness of Famotidine on dyskinesia in Parkinsons disease. The study will be a cross over design. 25 patients will be randomised to either Famotidine or placebo. At the end of the first three weeks the study participants will present for a levodopa challenge. During a levodopa challenge, the patient is given 1.5 times their normal morning Parkinsons medication, the degree of dyskinesia will be assessed. The patient will then cross over and after another 3 weeks, the levodopa challenge will be repeated. The levodopa challenge and dyskinesia assessments will be videotaped and rated by a neurologist unaware of which treatment the patient had been taking.</summary>
