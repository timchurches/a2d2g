  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Age = 18 years old

          -  Persistent (= 1 month) or permanent atrial fibrillation. Persistent AF will be where
             obtaining and maintaining sinus rhythm is deemed either not worthwhile, or to be
             ineffective in the long term, or where both the patient and physician accept the
             presence of AF, where rhythm control intervention is, by definition no longer pursued.
             Permanent AF is defined as atrial fibrillation where sinus rhythm cannot be restored.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a treatment for heart failure in patients who also
      suffer from ventricular dyssynchrony, a form of uncoordinated contraction of the ventricle
      (lower pumping chamber of the heart). In the past decade, CRT has become an established
      treatment for heart failure patients who are in normal rhythm, called sinus rhythm. An
      important subset of heart failure patients are those with atrial fibrillation (AF), who make
      up around 1 in 4 HF patients, and are over-represented amongst HF patients with more advanced
      symptoms. In heart failure patients with AF, CRT has proven not to be as effective as in
      sinus rhythm, due to competition between beats generated by the CRT device and beats
      conducted from the heart's own electrical conduction system. In the current study, we aim to
      test the hypothesis that ablating the AV node, which controls electrical conduction from the
      heart's atria (top chamber) to its ventricles (lower chambers), will improve survival and
      heart failure symptoms in CRT patients with co-existent AF. The results are important,
      because they will provide a way of passing on the benefits of CRT, such as improved survival,
      less heart failure symptoms, and better quality of life, to heart failure patients who also
      suffer from AF.</summary>
