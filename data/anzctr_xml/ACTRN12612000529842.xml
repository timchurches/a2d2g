  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fish oil supplementation: Consisting of three 1100 mg fish oil capsules per day, for 12 weeks. Each capsule contained 550 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid per 1100 mg capsule (YourHealth Group, Australia).
Exercise: Consisted of 20 minutes of high intensity interval exercise (8 s sprint, 12 s recovery) on an electronically braked cycle ergometer for each session three times a week for 12 weeks.
Diet:  Participants were asked to eat a low glycemic Mediterranean style diet and complete a food diary before and after the 12-week intervention. No caloric amount was introduced rather a change in the quality of foods consumed was stressed to participants. The FEM women were given an overview of the healthy eating plan prior to commencing the program. Participants were also given recipes, advice, and nutritional information along with a Mediterranean pyramid. After the initial diet sessions, FEM women were given more dietary guidelines throughout the study (every 3 weeks) along with feedback from their previous one-day diet diary and ways to progress towards the recommended Mediterranean diet. Use of a Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) provided adherence information on a scale of zero to nine; zero represented the least adherent to a Mediterranean diet and nine represented total adherence to a Mediterranean diet. MDS was based on the median values calculated from mean scores for all women in FEM. 
For the study as a whole, all 3 components (fish oil, exercise, and Mediterranean diet) were implemented simultaneously over the 12 week period in the randomized intervention group known as FEM.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decrease risk of metabolic syndrome: lower total and central adiposity measured by either dual energy xray absorptiometry or a Tanita body composition scale, improved triglyceride, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoproteins, and glucose levels measured by a Cholestech analyzer to detect whole blood levels, and blood pressure values measured by a manual sphygmomanometer. All the above mentioned variables were measured pre to post intervention. Improve hormone and inflammatory concentrations from plasma samples analyzed with High-Sensitivity Enzyme Immunoassays (hs-ELISA) and increase fitness levels assess with a cardiorespiratory fitness test on a cycle ergometer.</outcome>
