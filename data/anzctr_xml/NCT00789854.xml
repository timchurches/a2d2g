    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Quetiapine XR
Treatment: drugs - Lithium carbonate
Treatment: drugs - SSRI/Venlafaxine

Active Comparator: Add-on Quetiapine XR+SSRI/Venlafaxine - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or Venlafaxine from previous therapy + add-on treatment with quetiapine XR, 300mg tablet once daily (od).
From previous anti-depressant treatment 64% of the patients had SSRI and 35% had Venlafaxine at baseline.

Active Comparator: Add-on Lithium+SSRI/Venlafaxine - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) or venlafaxine from previous therapy + add-on treatment with lithium, approximately 900mg tablet once daily (od).
From previous anti-depressant treatment 67% of the patients had SSRI and 33% had Venlafaxine at baseline.

Active Comparator: Monotherapy Quetiapine XR - Switch from previous treatment with SSRI or venlafaxine to quetiapine XR monotherapy, 300mg tablet once daily (od)


Treatment: drugs: Quetiapine XR
300 mg once daily (od)

Treatment: drugs: Lithium carbonate
900 mg once daily (od)

Treatment: drugs: SSRI/Venlafaxine

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Quetiapine extended release
      (XR) in combination with an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or Venlafaxine
      versus Lithium in combination with an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or Venlafaxine
      versus Quetiapine extended release monotherapy in subjects with treatment resistant
      depression as assessed by the changes from randomisation to week 6 in the Montgomery-Åsberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. As an independent objective, the primary
      objective will also be evaluated in two subgroups of patients: (1) patients who were
      resistant to two previous antidepressant therapies and (2) in the subgroup of patients with
      one previous failure.</summary>
