    <interventions>The Nursing Intervention APECC Acceptance In People With Cardiac Stimulation Cardioverter is a direct attention treatment, based on the knowledge and clinical judgment, that the nurse performs independently in the pre-implantation period, to help the person to Accept the cardiac stimulation device Cardioverter, in response To the physical, psychological and social needs that can appear from the implantation to the performance of the daily functions.
The intervention is proposed from the Social Learning Theory for behavior modeling, these are developed through three components, the first corresponds to an educational component provided by the nurse who is the person that has the knowledge to address the main issues of the implantation and that have been reported in the evidence, such as:
1  What is a cardio-defibrillator, how it acts, how the implantation is performed, what are the indications
2  Physical consequences of implantation to the device: wound care, physical activity, body image change, what can I expect and how can I act?
3  Social Consequences: Changes in the job, family and social role, sexual activity, driving limitations, activities of daily living, What can I expect and how can I act?
4 Psychological Consequences: primary emotions (fear, apprehensiveness, anger, sadness) and Anxiety and Depression. What is normal and how can I act?
The second component refers to the modeling of behavior through the peers or people with similar conditions, so those two people who have a cardiodesfibrilador express their experience of living with the device, its advantages and disadvantages and how they settle their difficulties. Through 15 minutes video of two people who have had an implant talking about their experiences is watched in the session.
Finally, the last component is an exercise in relaxation that will allow the implanted person to practice it in their moments of anxiety or stress. Are 15 minutes of video with images, music and instructions for the relaxation of body and mind, is watched in the session.
The Nursing intervention will be delivered by the nurse face to face, in a single moment with a duration of approximately 60 minutes for the session, be supported using tools such as the educational flipchart designed for this study contains illustrative images to explain the educational content of physical, psychological, social changes and the use of a DVD designed for this study, which contains three small videos of 15 minutes duration,  with the components educational, experiences and exercise in relaxation, the study participants can take home, for your consultation anytime you require it.
note: The participants will be assigned one by one to each group
30 participants to intervention group 1, persons receiving intervention before to device implantation.
30 participants to intervention group 2, people receiving the intervention once the device is implanted  and before clinical discharge.
30 participants to the control group, people receiving standar care.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention Group 2: The intervention will be delivered the day after the implantation of the device and before clinical discharge.

1. Null Hypothesis: The nursing intervention applied in the pre-implantation has no effect on the person's acceptance to the Cardioverter.H0: p=0
Alternative Hypothesis: The nursing intervention applied in the pre-implantation has positive effects on the person's acceptance to the Cardioverter.H1: p=&lt;0

2. Null Hypothesis: The nursing intervention applied in the pre-implantation does not decreases the adjustment time in people with cardioverter. H0: p=0
Alternative Hypothesis:The nursing intervention applied in the pre-implantation decreases the adjustment time in people with cardioverter.H1: p=&lt;0

3.Null Hypothesis: The nursing intervention applied in the pre-implantation does not decreases the physical, psychological and social consequences in people with cardioverter. H0: p=0
Alternative Hypothesis:The nursing intervention applied in the pre-implantation decreases the physical, psychological and social consequences in people with cardioverter.H1: p=&lt;0

SAMPLE SIZE
The calculation of the sample size will be made for the purpose of judging the hypotheses of the investigation and for which the following elements will be taken into account:
  1) Error Type I or Alpha: is the error that is committed when the investigator does not accept or reject the null hypothesis, being this true, which is set at p = &lt;0.05
2) Error type II or Beta: is the error that is committed when the investigator accepts the null hypothesis being false, confidence intervals calculate a 95%.

The sample size to support the comparisons between the experimental group and its respective control group is based on the adjustment to the Gaussian model and in this case they are independent samples. To support the conclusions to be drawn from the statistical analysis is required a non-probabilistic global random sample.Therefore, this sample size is calculated by the following mathematical expression:

n=2{raiz cuadrada de (x_(1-alfa)^2 (k-1)-(K-2) )+Z_(1-beta) }^2+(sigma/Delta )^2+1

Values established for the validity of the sample:
alfa=0.05
Beta=0.01
Delta= Sigma

Taking into account these precisions, the required sample size is 90 People, each group will have 30 participants, according to the inclusion criteria established

DATA ANALYSIS
Descriptive Analysis: Descriptive statistics are used to detail and synthesize the data, allows to characterize the behavior of the sociodemographic variables, a frequency distribution is proposed for these data, taking into account the nature of each variable.

Inferential Analysis: It will be done based on the hypothesis and the question of the study. For this study, we used comparison tests that consider the presence of a given factor in one of them, while in the other the opposite occurs. For the inferential analysis it is used, Student T for Related Samples to test the hypothesis that the scores of a variable differ over time for the same subjects. This type of before-after design is measured twice for the same individuals between the applications of the tests. This test requires the normal distribution of the data, otherwise a nonparametric test such as Friedman can be used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research it is proposed to design and apply a nursing intervention, to improve the level of acceptance to device in daily life, Approaching the physical, psychological and social consequences caused by the implantation of the ICD, with the goal that the implanted people achieve the greater benefit of the device, in years of quality survival. The knowledge generated will provide evidence for nursing professionals in relation to the effects of the intervention applied in the pre-implant period and provides new tools for nursing practice in relation to the care of this population group.

Hypothesis
A Structured Nursing Intervention with two components: educational and relaxation strategies, applied in the pre-implantation period, provides the person the necessary tools to achieve acceptance of the device, reducing the physical, psychological and social consequences of the implantation of the Cardioverter, Allowing the integration of technology into life.</summary>
