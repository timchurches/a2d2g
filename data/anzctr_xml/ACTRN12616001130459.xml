  <interventions>
    <interventions>Target Population: Western Victorian farmers and agricultural workers engaged in crop and livestock operations, with self-reported use of agrichemicals and cholinesterase inhibiting insecticides.

By measuring the activity of the enzyme cholinesterase, exposure to organophophates can be identified. Enzyme activity will be monitored every 4 weeks over the 12 months period.

Each participant will receive a baseline health check during the first visit including:
a) Measurements: Height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, pulse rate. 
b) Capillary blood sample : Collected using a finger prick, will test for : Fasting blood glucose, establish personal quantitative estimates of both red blood cell ChE and Plasma ChE.
c) Health and Chemical usage survey: Complete chemical use and well being questionnaire

For the subsequent visits, each participant will undergo:
a) Capillary blood sample: Individualised cholinesterase activity level measured , recorded and discussed by registered nurse. 
b) Health and Chemical usage survey: Chemical use and well being questionnaire</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>To evaluate if a difference in cholinesterase activity was present in farmers before and after exposure, sample size is determined at the power of 80% (Beta=0.2) with a set at 0.05 for an effect size of one standard deviation. This requires the sample size to be a minimum of 30 farming individuals exposed to pesticides. By considering the probable retention rate (=85%) for a 12-month study, based on previous research in similar populations, the target recruitment number is fixed at a target of minimum of 50 farmers.
All data will be managed and analysed with SPSS, which is a statistical package widely used in quantitative social science research and is suitable for multivariate analyses. Data will be analysed using repeated measures (subjects as own controls) within the General Linear Model. Correlation coefficients between pesticide exposure and metabolic variables will be calculated using Pearson's and Spearman's correlation as appropriate. p values will be considered statistically significant at the level of &lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:
This study aims to develop the methodology for clinical point of care (POC) sampling to determine the level of exposure to organophosphates (OPs) by western Victorian farmers.
Significance:
This methodology will test for cholinesterase activity and provide the basis for future research work by identifying the potential chemical exposure pathways of individuals most at risk in farming communities.
Expected outcomes:
The study will provide a methodology for cholinesterase activity measurement in farmers and the possible integration of POC sampling in farmer health checks. Importantly it will highlight pesticide contact as a risk for farmers, leading to further research to quantify pesticide exposure both on the farm and in the home of farming families.</summary>
