    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiological implant failure. Rate of implant failure (e.g. screw breakage or loosening, with or without a second surgery for removal) will be measured for each group. Broken screws will be defined as those in which there is a fracture of the screw. Loosened screws will be defined as those surrounded by a radiolucent zone 1 mm in width extending the length of threads in either the fibula or tibia. For the group randomised for screw removal, the rate of implant failure will only be measured at 6 weeks postoperatively.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients with ankle fractures, who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria, requiring syndesmosis screw fixation will be offered a chance to participate in the study. Following informed patient consent, the principle investigator will be contacted with the patient's details. The principle investigator will randomise the patient into one of the two study groups. Randomisation will not be revealed to the operating surgeons, admitting team, or anyone else involved in patient management. Randomisation will only be revealed following the patient's 6 week postoperative clinic review.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed by a source independent to patient clinical management, and will be concealed from the operating surgeons and admitting team. Randomisation will be performed using a random number generator with restricted blocks. The study will be performed according to an intention-to-treat protocol.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Screw stabilisation of the disrupted ankle syndesmosis maintains reduction as healing of the distal tibiofibular ligaments occurs. It has previously been thought that syndesmosis screws may contribute to ankle dysfunction by restricting the normal motion between the tibia and fibula. Screw removal, breakage, or loosening may restore motion but can permit loss of reduction if these occur before complete ligamentous healing. As a result, although some well-established principles exist for reduction and surgical treatment of syndesmotic injuries, there remains controversy regarding whether routine syndesmosis screw removal is desirable. We plan to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to investigate the outcomes of patients with ankle syndesmosis screws left in situ and compare these with the outcomes of patients with removed syndesmosis screws. To date, there have been no randomised, controlled trials comparing these two patient groups.</summary>
