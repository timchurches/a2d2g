  <interventions>
    <interventions>use of a super potent corticosteroid ointment (Clobetasol Propionate 0.05%) on grafted burn wounds.
Clobetasol Propionate ointment applied as the treatment and a common moisturizing ointment as the control.
Dosage of treatment is half fingertip unit i.e.0.25g once daily for 8 weeks, self-administered by participants.
Each patient acts as their own control, by applying the treatment or placebo to a randomized site 1 or 2(crossover). Participants being asked to wash their hands between application of the two ointments to avoid mixing the effect of the two ointments.
The investigator will decide anatomical location of two comparable areas of 3cmx3cm that are accessible for self application of ointment and will mark them as site 1 and site 2. 
The jars marked A and B, will be prepared by company and the content is unknown to the investigator and the participant. The investigator then randomly allocate which jar on which site using procedure such as coin-tossing . Then the record for each participant will be made giving code number to the participant. (e.g. 001, jar A- site 1, jar B- site 2).
There is no break in-between application of two ointments during the 8 weeks trial. The two ointments will be applied at the same time for 8 weeks on their allocated sites for comparison record.</interventions>
    <comparator>Common moisturising ointment as called Dermaveen ointment.
it is an active treatment of the burns wound. It doesn't have  Clobetasol Propionate base.Dermaveen Moisturizing ointment has a formulation containing natural colloidal oatmeal that gently soothes, protects and hydrates the skin.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>&gt;75% reduction in thickening and contracture of scar tissue following grafting of burn wounds.
Demographic data of participants will be collected by co-investigators at the time of recruitment.
Principal investigator will document, assess, and photograph the grafted area on a weekly basis for 8 weeks. Changes to the tested and control areas will be assessed by:
1.Modified Vancouver scale which includes
-Vascularity
-Surface area
-Color
-Contour
-Height 
2.Visual analogue scale (VAS) for assessment of the pain and itching
3.Photography: The grafted wound will be photographed every week with bluish background and distance of 20cm.
4.Ultrasound imaging will be conducted before the application on Day 7 and on week 8 visit</outcome>
      <timepoint>At six months after randomization</timepoint>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1.Identify eligible patient (check inclusion/exclusion criteria) on initial presentation to the burns clinic or burns unit. 
2.Obtain written informed consent 
3.Allocate Subject Trial Number by co-investigator 
4.The investigator will allocate two sites of 3cm×3 cm of grafted skin wounds and decide which one is 1 or 2.
5.The participant will receive two jars of ointment labeled A and B. These jars will be prepared by the pharmacist and will be allocated as jar A and B. Only The independent assessor who is involved in this study will have a concealed envelope from the pharmacy naming the content of jar A and jar B.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method to be used to create the random order for the allocation of subjects into different groups is simple randomisation by using procedures such as coin-tossing and dice-rolling.
1.All patients in the trial will have burns that require a skin graft as part of their treatment. Two sites of 3cm×3 cm of grafted skin wounds called site 1 and 2 will be identified by the investigators.
2.The participant will receive two jars of ointment labeled A and B.
3.The participant will apply ointment labeled A on site 1, and ointment labeled B on site 2.
4.The investigator will allocate the sites and decide which one is 1 or 2.
5.Neither the participant nor the assessor will know which ointment is the Clobetasol and which is the moisturiser.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Burn injuries result in pain, inflammation and destruction of skin cells. Skin grafting will be required when the depth of the injury destroys the deeper skin layers. Despite grafting, the burn injury continues to produce inflammatory chemicals or mediators. These mediators result in a thickened and raised scar with increased sensitivity and itching. 
The purpose of this research is to see if Clobetasol propionate can reduce the inflammatory mediators thereby reducing active scar tissue formation.</summary>
