  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive washing of the limb and wound in potable water, application of moisturiser to the lower leg, conservative sharp wound debridement if necessary, application of a silicone negative pressure wound therapy dressing with battery operated pump (which applies 80mmHg continuous negative pressure (PICO Trademark) )and four layer compression bandaging. Acquired wound infection will be treated with nanocrystalline silver dressings. If patients are unable to tolerate nanocrystalline silver (5% estimated), cadexomer iodine will be used. Wound washing, moisturising, debridement and dressing application will be attended by a registered nurse. The decision to perform wound debridement will be made by the treating registered nurse based on the presence of loose avascular tissue in the wound bed and whether in her clinical opinion it can be safely removed.
The Silhouette (Trademark) (ARANZ) device will used to collect accurate, reproducible, laser calibrated, three dimensional wound measurements at weekly intervals.
Dressings will be attended twice weekly for twelve weeks or until the treating registered nurse decides that the wound no longer requires dressing.
Adherence to the treatment regime will be evidenced by an intact dressing at time of next treatment. Variations from this treatment will be documented in the participant's record.
The Charing Cross Venous Leg Ulcer Tool will be used to determine the quality of life impact of a venous leg ulcer and each of the study treatments. 
The EQ-5D-5L  tool will be used to measure quality adjusted life years. 
These self assessment tools will be completed at first, thirteenth and final treatments.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation was assisted by Drs Parsons and Spilsbury, Biostatisticians, Curtin University, using the Stata statistical software. The conservative assumption made is that 60% of patients in the control group will heal in 3 months (Australian Wound Management Association Inc &amp; New Zealand Wound Care Society, 2011; Simon et al., 2004). Previously published pilot data causes us to anticipate that the intervention will halve the healing time (i.e. that 60% of patients will heal in 6 weeks). With 90% power and an alpha value of 0.05, and assuming that up to 20% of patients will be lost to follow-up, 150 patients in total (75 patients in each arm), will be required to demonstrate whether there is a statistically significant difference in the key outcome measures of time to heal and cost effectiveness between the two groups.
Data will be input into a database using SPSS software version 22. A p value of &lt;0.5 will be considered to indicate statistical significance. Intention to treat analysis will be used.
Descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations) will be used to analyse demographic data. Chi-square analysis of categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables will be used to assess the differences between control and intervention groups. Homogeneity of demographic data will support the premise that the randomisation process was appropriate and group size adequate.
A series of t-tests will be used to compare outcomes between groups at baseline. Mixed regression analysis will be performed to compare change over time between intervention and control groups. Effect size will be based on the average time to healing as a correlation of the two variables as the regression coefficient. Quality of life scores will be analysed using descriptive statistics. T-test comparison of the two scores will permit analysis of the effect of treatment arm on QoL.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Venous leg ulcers (VLU) account for 80% of all leg ulcers. They adversely affect quality of life and exact a financial burden on individuals and the health care sector. The use of graduated compression is considered gold standard for the treatment of venous leg ulceration. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), used in the management of wounds, has been found to reduce time to healing. However, no robust studies exist which compare the healing rates of VLU treated with compression bandaging and NPWT as compared to those treated with compression bandaging alone.

Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of NPWT and four layer compression bandaging (4LCB) as compared to 4LCB and usual treatment, for healing venous leg ulcers.

Objectives:	
1.	To investigate the efficacy of NPWT dressings and 4LCB as compared to usual treatment and 4LCB for healing VLUs.
2.	To determine the impact of a VLU and its treatment on quality of life (QoL).
3.	To conduct a prospective economic analysis to determine the costs associated with healing VLUs and the effect on quality adjusted life years (QALYs). 
         
Method: A single site two arm RCT with 150 patients, randomised to two groups of 75 will be undertaken. Patients will receive NPWT dressings and 4 LCB or usual treatment (tulle gras wound contact layer and absorbent pad) and 4 LCB for 12 weeks, or less if healed prior to 12 weeks. Ulcerated legs will be graded according to the CEAP classification. The Silhouette (Trademark) (ARANZ) device will be used to collect measurements. The EQ-5D-5L Tool and the Charing Cross Venous Leg Ulcer Tool (CXVLU) will be used to determine the impact of the VLU and treatments on quality of life  and quality adjusted life years. Statistical analysis of healing times and QoL will be performed using t-test and regression analysis. A prospective economic analysis will be performed to determine the costs associated with healing VLUs and QALY.
