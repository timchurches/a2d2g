  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective study to screen for osteoporosis in all patients presenting to Concord Hospital with a minimal trauma fracture, and to initiate appropriate treatment in osteoporotic patients. The aim is to assess, in a randomised study, the efficacy of semi-annual specialist reviews vs. GP follow-up in terms of compliance and osteoporosis complications.</summary>
