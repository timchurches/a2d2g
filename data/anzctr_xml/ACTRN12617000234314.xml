  <interventions>
    <interventions>Huo Xue Tong Luo Decoction will be provided as a whole concentrated granulated extract (45 g) (Salvia miltiorrhiza; Carthamus tinctorius L.;Paeonia veitchii; Ligusticum Siense; Angelica sinensis; Prunus persica; Rehmannia glutinosa; Polygonum bistort; Ginger) for topical use.
Participants will dissolve daily sachets in a basin with 3 litres of warm water (approximately 37- 40 degrees) at home. Once the sachet is dissolved, participants will soak both hands in the basin for 20 minutes, and then soak both feet for 20 minutes once per day. Discard the solution when finished. Participants will have a total of 40 days using HXTLD treatments (5 days/per cycle x 8 cycles) over the six months of chemotherapy treatment. To ensure compliance, the participants have to return each cycles home diary and the empty sachets at each next visit. Participants will complete eight cycles home intervention records with one follow up home intervention record. </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo formula control; The placebo looks like real thing but it is not. It mainly contains dextrin (90.4 %), sucrose (5 %), and citric acid (0.2 %) with artificial colour (gardenia yellow 300 (0.6 %) and caramel (1.8 %) and bitter flavour (broadleaf holly leaf Tea extract (2.0 %).

    <statisticalmethods>We estimate that a sample size of 78 (allocation ratio of 2:1; 52 in treatment group and 26 in placebo group) participants by randomised group would provide 90% statistical power to detect an absolute difference of 5 degrees in the primary outcome after the third cycle of XELOX (baseline of cold pain threshold in the hands at 8 degrees and standard-deviation equal to 6.3 degrees) for a two-sided a level of 0.05.

A two-sided p value of less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance (except interim analysis). Baseline characteristics will be presented for each randomised group as the mean +/- SD or the median (IQR) according to the statistical distribution for continuous data, and as the number of patients and associated percentages for categorical parameters. Comparisons between independent groups will be analysed using the Chi-square or Fishers exact test for categorical variables, and Mann-Whitneys test for quantitative parameters (cold pain thresholds in the hands and NRS), with normality verified by the Shapiro-Wilk test and homoscedasticity by the Fisher-Snedecor test. The EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 subscales will be computed according to the standard scoring algorithm and then transformed to a 0100 scale, where high scores meant less symptom burden. The analysis will employ longitudinal mixed effects models to assess the difference in sensory neuropathy by prevention arm over time.
Linear growth curve models will be utilized for the motor and autonomic subscales. Frequencies and percentages will be calculated for discrete data and analysed using chi-square or Fisher exact methodology. Summary statistics, including means and medians, will be compiled for continuous data and analysed using two-sided t test, Wilcoxon, or Kruskal-Wallis techniques, as appropriate. Times to neurotoxic events/ drop-out rate/ reduction in oxaliplatin dose will also be calculated, and KaplanMeier techniques will be employed to determine differences.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether Chinese herbal topical wash (Huo Xue Tong Luo Decoction) can relieve and/or prevent Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in gastrointestinal cancer patients.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or above and are going to receive XELOX chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancer. 

Study details
Study participants will be allocated by chance (allocation ratio of 2:1) to one of the two intervention groups. One group will receive Huo Xue Tong Luo Decoction solution while the second group receives a placebo solution. Participants will use provided solutions to separately soak hands and feet for 20 minutes once a day for five consecutive days during each chemotherapy cycle (8 cycles). Participants will be required to complete a quantitative thermal testing from baseline, midway through each chemotherapy cycle and at the end of 3 months follow-up along with pain and QoL questionnaires in order for researchers to monitor whether the intervention is safe and whether it is effectively treating Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will establish the benefits of Huo Xue Tong Luo Decoction as topical wash for the prevention and treatment of Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in gastrointestinal cancer patients.</summary>
