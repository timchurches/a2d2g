    <interventions>DUR-928 powder for reconstitution.
In Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, each subject will receive 5 daily doses of either active DUR-928 or placebo (calcium carbonate) according to the Cohort they are participating in and the intervention they are randomised to. In Cohort 3 each subject will receive a single dose of DUR-298 in an open-label (fasted/fed) crossover design. There will be a 3-7 day washout between fasted and fed periods.
The doses of the intervention are described below per cohort:
Cohort 1: DUR-928 or placebo (100 mg)
Cohort 2: DUR-928 or placebo (300 mg)
Cohort 3: DUR-928 (300mg), in fasted and fed state

In Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, each subject will receive 5 daily doses of either active DUR-928 or placebo (calcium carbonate) according to the Cohort they are participating in and the intervention they are randomised to. There is no placebo in Cohort 3; all subjects receive active DUR-928.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety of multiple doses of DUR-928 in healthy volunteers at steady state. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety Timepoints: Safety assessments including vital sign measurement, safety laboratory tests, 12-lead ECGs and Adverse Event collection are carried out at various timepoints during the 5 day dosing period, in the 48 hours post Dose 5 (last study drug administration), and during the follow up visit (7 days post Dose 5).  
Pharmacokinetic Timepoints: PK samples are collected at the following timepoints: Dose 1(Pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours post Dose 1), Dose 2  4 (Pre-dose), Dose 5 (Pre-dose, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12,  16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post Dose 5).

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of DUR-928 in healthy volunteers at steady state. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic timepoints are: Dose 1(Pre-dose, and at 0.5 , 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours post Dose 1), Dose 2-4 (Pre-dose), and Dose 5 (Pre-dose, and at 0.5 , 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post Dose 5).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine any dose limiting adverse drug effects at steady state following multiple oral dosing of DUR 928 in healthy volunteers.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Adverse events are collected for the duration of the study; from Day 1 (Dose 1) to Day 12 (follow-up visit).

Based on currently available animal toxicology and the first in human trial experience, adverse drug effects are not expected. Therefore, subjects will be monitored for any and all adverse events.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate dose proportionality of DUR-928 at steady state. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Dose proportionality information will be obtained by comparing plasma levels at all Pharmacokinetic timepoints, across the two dose levels (100 and 300 mg) evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetic timepoints are: Dose 1(Pre-dose, and at 0.5 , 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 hours post Dose 1), Dose 2-4 (Pre-dose), and Dose 5 (Pre-dose, and at 0.5 , 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours post Dose 5).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of a standard meal on the pharmacokinetics of DUR-928. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Standard PK parameters will be determined for DUR-928 from treatment Period 1 (fasted) and Period 2 (fed) in Cohort 3 and the food effect will be determined from the exposure data (Cmax and AUC).</timepoint>

    <concealment>In Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, ten subjects per cohort will be randomized with a 4:1 randomization whereby 8 subjects receive DUR-928 and 2 subjects receive placebo. The dose will be provided to blinded study staff in a blinded fashion.
A central randomization schedule will be generated by the INC Research Head of Biometrics â€“ who will have no further involvement in the study. The central Randomization schedule will be provided only to the site pharmacy staff (unblinded) who will be exclusively responsible for preparing the doses. Subjects will be assigned a randomization number in sequential order, as their eligibility is confirmed, by blinded site staff (who have no access to the Randomization schedule).

In Cohort 3, all eight subjects will receive a single dose of DUR-298 in an open-label (fasted/fed) crossover design. There is no requirement to conceal treatment allocation.

    <designfeatures>In Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, ten subjects per cohort with a 4:1 randomization ratio will be treated with 8 subjects receiving DUR-928 and 2 subjects receiving placebo for a total of 2 cohorts (20 subjects total will be enrolled). The second cohort of 10 subjects continues only after the safety assessment of the first cohort.
Following review of all data from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, eight new subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 3. All eight subjects in Cohort 3 will receive a single dose of DUR-298 in an open-label (fasted/fed) crossover design.

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Safety  Safety will be evaluated by assessment of clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations including vital signs, and ECGs, and by the documentation of all spontaneously reported adverse events. 
Pharmacokinetics  Plasma concentration data of DUR-928 and its metabolite at each dose level will be used to calculate relevant pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will summarized by dose level and fasted vs fed state, using descriptive statistics.
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no power or sample size calculations have been performed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at how safe and well tolerated a new drug called DUR-928 is when given to healthy volunteers, once daily for 5 days at 2 different dose levels. The pharmacokinetics of DUR-928 will also be studied; this is done by measuring the amount of DUR-928 in the blood at different times throughout the 5 day dosing period, allowing us to evaluate how DUR-928 is handled by the body (for example how quickly it gets into the blood stream). This study will also look at the effect the food may have of the pharmacokinetics of DUR-928.</summary>
