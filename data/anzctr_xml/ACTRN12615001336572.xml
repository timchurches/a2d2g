  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary purpose of this pilot study is to assess feasibility. The co-primary feasibility outcomes will be: 1) enrollment of 20 patients across four sites in six months, and 2) at least 60% of enrolled patients progressing to study completion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after commencement of trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility:
Feasibility outcomes will measure additional processes, resource and management factors associated with undertaking the research.
Staff time spent administering the intervention will be documented in the  Clinical Research File. </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after commencement of study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy:
To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of the addition of oral dexamethasone to optimise opioid therapy on cancer pain
This will be assessed using the Brief pain inventory tool at baseline, visits days 2-6 and visit 14
Concurrent medication use including co-analgesics will be assessed each visit. This will be assessed at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14. For inpatients the medication chart will be reviewed at these time points. For outpatients patients will self report use to study staff at these study visits </outcome>
      <timepoint>The Brief Pain Inventory measurement will be administered at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14 to assess changes over the intervention period 
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events:
Symptoms will be identified at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14 using criteria established by the National Cancer Institute, and will be graded accordingly. Specifically for this study, the symptoms of interest will be;
Abnormally elevated mood, irritability, accelerated speech or activity, flight of thought, psychosis, confusion, anxiety, depression. These will be evaluated at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14 with the ESAS and study staff assessment and patient self reporting. 
Symptomatic hypoglycemia which will be monitored by random BSL at baseline and then according to site specific institution guidelines.
Increased peripheral oedema will be assessed by study staff and patient self reporting of symptoms at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14.
Dyspepsia and/or other evidence of gastric mucosa damage assessed at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14 by patient self-reporting of symptoms and study staff assessment of patient.
Oral candidiasis will be assessed by oral examination by study staff at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14.



</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14.
A grade of 3 (that has not responded to symptomatic treatment instituted by the treating physician according to local protocols) or 4 will activate cessation of study intervention and an adverse event report. 
Any Serious Adverse Events will be reported to the independent medical monitor for review as per ICH GCP guidelines.
All adverse events will be collated by the project officer, and reported to the executive committee on a monthly basis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Opioid dose
To obtain preliminary data on the effect of oral dexamethasone on total opioid dose during and after the intervention period
For in-patients study staff will review the medication chart at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14 for total morphine equivalency and number of breakthrough doses taken.
For patients at home they will self report total opioid consumption at baseline, day 2-6 and day 14. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Background opioid use will be recorded at each study visit and any rescue medication (additional opioid breakthrough medication) will be recorded at each study visit
These will be recorded at baseline, days 2-6 and day 14 visits.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger Phase III study. The outcomes that will be measured to assess whether the trial is successful are 1) enrollment of 20 patients across 4 sites in six months, and 2) at lease 60% of enrolled patients progressing to study completion.  Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and are experiencing pain related to cancer or its treatment with an average pain score of 3/10 or greater on the Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-SF) in previous 24 hours. Study details: Participants in this study will all receive dexamethasone oral 8mg daily for 5 days. Participants concurrent medication use, background opioid use, co-analgesics, any rescue medication, The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System score, Brief Pain Inventory, Australian Karnofsky Performance Scale, EORTC QLQ-C30/15 will be collected by the research nurse following review of the patient each day of study intervention. The patients global impression of change will be collected on D6 and follow up D14 visit. Many doctors believe dexamethasone is helpful in relieving cancer related pain and it has been used in this way, in addition to strong pain medications, for many years. However, there is limited clinical evidence to support this use of dexamethasone, which is why this study is being conducted.</summary>
