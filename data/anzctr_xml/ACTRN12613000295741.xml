    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through advertising in local newspapers and community bulletin boards. Participants will contact researchers where they will be screened for eligibility over the phone to ensure they are eligible to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to treatment A or B once allocated a trial participants number.

Randomisation of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. All participants will be assigned to treatment group A or B using a computer generated random number generator by a disinterested third party. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The treatment number that has been placed next to the participantâ€™s number will be the allocated treatment for that individual. Randomisation codes will be kept in a password protected computer file. 

Blinding will be achieved by enlisting a person outside of the project to code the treatments, conceal them in sealed opaque containers for dispensing and maintain the key to this code until data collection is completed. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be achieved through the use of computerised random number generator software.   </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Given the range of observed (randomised controlled trials) and purported (anecdotal and epidemiological evidence) effects of both multivitamin and Omega-3 supplementation has upon mood and behaviour the general aim of the study is to investigate the combined effects of Omega-3 and multivitamin supplementation. The study will focus on the effects on mood, workplace stress and cardiovascular health in a workplace sample. 

More specifically, a three month supplementation with Healthy Body Vitamin Pack is expected to improve the experience of workplace stress, workplace variables, cardiovascular risk parameters and mood in conjunction with an improvement in biological measures such as antioxidant status and triglycerides. </summary>
