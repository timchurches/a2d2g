  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being done to look at the absolute bioavailability of fluticasone furoate and
      GW642444 inhalation powder when administered in healthy subjects. Bioavailability is
      determined by measuring the amount of the dose of inhaled medication that reaches the
      circulation; the amount of inhaled fluticasone furoate and GW642444 powder will be compared
      to the medication administered intravenously (where bioavailability is 100%).</summary>
