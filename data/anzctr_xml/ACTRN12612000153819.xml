  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recombinant FSH (rFSH) treatment  with a starting dose of 50-75 IU per day was commenced by the day 3 of menstrual cycle 
a) according to low dose step-up protocol (Speroff L, Fritz MA (2005). Assisted reproductive technologies. In Clinical Gynecologic Endocrinology and Infertility, 7th ed., pp. 12161274)
b) by a once daily subcutaneous injection in the abdominal wall, injected by the patient using pen
c) until the follicle diameter reach 20 mm (usually within 7-14 days)
From day 7 onwards, the gonadotropin dose was adjusted and individualized based on the follicular growth observed by ultrasonography. 
Ganirelix, GnRH antagonist, was administered 
a) at the dose of 0.25 mg per day starting from the day in which a follicle &gt; 14 mm in mean diameter was visualized at ultrasound scan (flexible multiple dose protocol)
b) by subcutanous injection
c) till the follicle reaches 18 mm (usually within 4-5 days)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Two weeks after the intrauterine insemination procedure, an hCG assay was performed. If the assay was positive, transvaginal ultrasonography was scheduled for 2-3 weeks later. 
Only a positive hCG was determined as biochemical pregnancy, both positive hCG assay and determination of embriyonic heartbeat was accepted as clinical pregnancy. Ultrasonography was done at 12-16th week to establish ongoing pregnancy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>two years period from June 2007
Two weeks after the intrauterine insemination procedure, an hCG assay was performed.
Ultrasonography was done at 12-16th week to establish ongoing pregnancy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Luteinizing hormone (LH) levels &gt; 10 IU/L and progesterone (PRG) levels &gt; 1 ng/ml was considered as premature luteinization.
PRG level was determined by competitive electro-chemoluminescent immunoassay method by auto-analyzer. LH levels were determined by sandwich electro-chemoluminescent immunoassay method by the same autoanalyzer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>two years period from June 2007
LH and PRG levels were determined 10-14 days after menstruation</timepoint>
