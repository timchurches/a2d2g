  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will receive capsules of sodium selenate 15mg three times a day (which may be reduced to 10mg three times a day) for 52 weeks. A dose reduction will be made in the event of intolerable adverse events experienced by the participant at their next scheduled or unscheduled visit as decided by on the the study doctors. 
Participants/partners will be required to bring unused medications to each visit to measure compliance, as well as recording any missed doses in their study diary.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of sodium selenate. Participants will be provided a diary card to record solicited (10 most common AEs) and unsolicited AEs as well as missed doses of medication. Safety laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG and physical and neurological examination will also be used to assess safety measures.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of sodium selenate in patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. All participants will be given sodium selenate for 52 weeks, and assessed regularly to investigate any negative reactions to the drug, as well as any positive effects on the symptoms of their dementia, as measured by biological samples, cognitive tests and brain scans.</summary>
