    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible to be randomized into the
        pivotal study or enrolled in the separate substudy:

          1. The patient has clinically significant non-Hunter syndrome-related CNS involvement
             (such as Fragile-X syndrome) which is judged by the Investigator to be likely to
             interfere with the accurate administration and interpretation of protocol assessments.

          2. The patient has a large chromosomal deletion or complex rearrangement that includes a
             deletion of the FMR1 and/or FMR2 genes.

          3. The patient has a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity(ies) that might
             affect study data or confound the integrity of study results.

          4. The patient has contra-indications for performance of lumbar puncture such as
             musculoskeletal/spinal abnormalities or risk of abnormal bleeding.

          5. The patient has a history of complications from previous lumbar punctures or technical
             challenges in conducting lumbar punctures such that the potential risks would exceed
             possible benefits for the patient.

          6. The patient has an opening CSF pressure upon lumbar puncture that exceeds 30.0 cm H2O.

          7. The patient has experienced infusion-related anaphylactoid event(s) or has evidence of
             consistent severe adverse events related to treatment with Elaprase which, in the
             Investigator's opinion, may pose an unnecessary risk to the patient.

          8. The patient has received a cord blood or bone marrow transplant at any time or has
             received blood product transfusions within 90 days prior to Screening.

          9. The patient has a history of poorly controlled seizure disorder.

         10. The patient is unable to comply with the protocol (eg, has significant hearing or
             vision impairment, a clinically relevant medical condition making implementation of
             the protocol difficult, unstable social situation, known clinically significant
             psychiatric/behavioral instability, is unable to return for safety evaluations, or is
             otherwise unlikely to complete the study), as determined by the Investigator.

         11. The patient is enrolled in another clinical study that involves clinical investigation
             or use of any investigational product (drug or [intrathecal/spinal] device) within 30
             days prior to study enrollment or at any time during the study.

         12. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought to
             be at an unacceptably high risk for anesthesia due to compromised airways or other
             conditions.

         13. The patient has a condition that is contraindicated as described in the SOPH-A-PORT
             Mini S IDDD Instructions for Use (IFU), including but not limited to the presence of a
             CSF shunt device in the patient.</exclusivecriteria>
