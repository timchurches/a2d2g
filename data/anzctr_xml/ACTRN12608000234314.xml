  <interventions>
    <interventions>The R3 Acetabular System is designed with large ball heads providing increased range of motion and greater stability.  This can significantly reduce the risk of hip dislocation, which is a crucial factor in the long term success of an implant. CoCr is an alloy of cobalt chrome with improved properties that make it suitable for use against ultra high molecular weight polyethylene surfaces in opposing friction couples.the length of the study is upto 5 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be measured by assessing all adverse events experienced by patients implanted with the study device.The incidence of surgery-related and device-related events such as device revision, component failure, malfunction, migration, subluxation, dislocation, loosening, nerve damage, deep infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or bone breakage/fracture will be collected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be seen at the 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year and 5 years interval post surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness will be measured using the Harris Hip Score, a patient self assessment questionnaire, and radiographic assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be seen at the 6 months, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year and 5 years interval</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.Patient is of legal age to consent and skeletally mature.

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects with any of the following characteristics must be excluded from
participation in the study.

1.Patient has active infection or sepsis (treated or untreated)
2.Patient has any vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or
neuromuscular disease severe enough to compromise implant stability or
postoperative recovery.
3.Patient is female of child-bearing age and not taking contraceptive
precautions
4.Patient has inadequate bone stock to support the device (e.g. severe
osteopenia, family history of severe osteoporosis or osteopenia)
5.Patient has inflammatory joint disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis)
6.Patient has known moderate to severe renal insufficiency.
6.Patient has a known or suspected metal sensitivity.
7.Patient is immunosuppressed with diseases such as AIDS or receiving
high doses of corticosteroids.
8.Patient has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt
their ability or unwillingness to participate in the study including mental
illness, mental retardation, or drug, alcohol abuse.
9.Patient is severely overweight.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate functional performance of the R3 Acetabular System, compared to a previous design, the Reflection System. Both systems are under approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, however the functional performance of the R3 Acetabular System compared to other systems has not yet been investigated.</summary>
