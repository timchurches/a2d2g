    <concealment>After obtaining consent and confirming eligibility, the participant will be enrolled in the study. Randomisation will occur prior to administration of Study Drug on Day 1. Study drug will be prepared for each participant by pharmacy staff, according to the randomisation code. All clinical staff will remain blinded. Individual randomisation envelopes will be provided in case the identity of study drug administered to a participant needs to be known.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a Phase 1B study and therefore an industry- standard sample of 9 participants per dose cohort has been chosen.

Participant demographic and presenting clinical features will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics, including means, medians, ranges, standard deviations, and frequencies and percentages as appropriate. These summaries will be presented by randomized  group.  

Adverse events and serious adverse events collected after study drug administration will be listed individually and be summarised by relatedness and severity classes by randomised group. Other safety variables, including laboratory and ophthalmological assessments, C-SSRS responses, vital signs, and ECG data will be summarized at each sampling time after study drug administration for each dose group and placebo, using means, medians, standard deviations and ranges. 

Data listings and summaries of the pharmacokinetic parameters by dose level will be presented for the noribogaine PkP and methadone PkP. Descriptive statistics including means, medians, standard deviations and ranges or frequencies and percentages) will be used to summarize these. The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC(0-24), AUC(T), AUC(8), half-life, Tmax, Vd/F and CL/F ) will be estimated using standard non-compartmental models from the noribogaine and methadone plasma concentration data. Cmax, AUC(0-24), AUC(T) and AUC(8) parameters will be dose adjusted (divided by the dose of each group) and compared between groups using ANOVA or Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric ANOVAs as appropriate. These comparisons test the null hypothesis of dose proportionality for each parameter.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effects of noribogaine, an atypical opioid. We will also be looking at its effects on opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid dependent people who are maintained on stable doses of methadone and who want to stop taking methadone. </summary>
