  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two groups will receive vitamin D supplementation: oral cholecalciferol 600IU/day and cholecalciferol 2000IU/day. These groups will receive standard (Cancer Council) sun exposure advice

Enhanced sun exposure advice - advice to receive as much sun exposure as possible to as much exposed body surface as is practicable, without experiencing sunburn, on as many occasions as possible.

A control group will receive placebo capsules and standard sun exposure advice.

All participants will receive the intervention over a 12 month period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo gelcaps (zero cholecalciferol), one per day, orally and
standard sun exposure advice for the 12 month duration from baseline.

Standard sun exposure advice is that provided by the NSW Cancer Council - to use sun protection (Slip, Slap, Slop, Seek and Slide) if the UV Index is 3 or above</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vitamin D deficiency is common in Australia. But Australia has high skin cancer incidence. While advice is given on safe sun exposure to avoid the risks of skin cancer, it is not clear how much sun exposure is required, at different locations in Australia, to maintain sufficient vitamin D levels throughout the year. This study thus addresses the following public health questions: 1). Can safe patterns and doses of sunlight exposure achieve and maintain vitamin D adequacy with no vitamin D supplementation? and 2). How does sun exposure advice calibrate against 2 different doses of vitamin D3 supplementation to manage mild vitamin D deficiency? We will recruit 228 Australian adults aged 18-64 years who have been diagnosed with mild vitamin D deficiency on routine testing (25(OH)D of 40-60nmol/L) in each of four regions in Australia - Canberra, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four groups receiving different types of sun exposure advice and supplementation. Outcomes will be the proportion of participants who are vitamin D sufficient at 12 months, and at the end of winter, the time when vitamin D levels are usually lowest.</summary>
