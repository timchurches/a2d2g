  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 169 - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Days 2, 28, 56, 84, 112, 168, and 169. Baseline is defined as the mean of the assessments made 30 minutes pre-dose and 5 minutes pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Trough FEV1 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained at 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning's dosing (i.e., trough FEV1 on Day 169 is the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after the morning dosing on Day 168). Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the trough FEV1 at that visit minus Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline, smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions. ITT=Intent-to-Treat.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline (BL) in Weighted Mean (WM) 0-6 Hour FEV1 Obtained Post-dose at Day 168 - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The WM FEV1 was derived by calculating the area under the FEV1/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The WM was calculated at Days 1, 84, and Day 168 using the 0-6-hour post-dose FEV1 measurements collected on that day, which included pre-dose (Day 1: 30 minutes [min] and 5 min prior to dosing; other serial visits: 23 and 24 hours after the previous morning dose) and post-dose at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours, and 6 hours. Change from BL at a particular visit was calculated as WM at that visit minus BL. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, BL (mean of the two assessments made 30 minutes and 5 minutes pre-dose on Day 1), smoking status, center group, day, and day by BL and day by treatment interactions.</outcome>

    <summary>This is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder,
      GSK573719 Inhalation Powder via a Novel Dry Powder Inhaler and tiotropium via HandiHaler when
      administered once-daily over a 24-week treatment period in subjects with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will
      complete a 7 to10 day run-in period followed by a randomization visit (Visit 2) then a
      24-week treatment period. There will be a total of 9 clinic study visits. A follow-up phone
      contact for adverse event assessment will be conducted approximately one week after the last
      study visit (Visit 9 or Early Withdrawal). The total duration of subject participation in the
      study will be approximately 26 weeks. The primary measure of efficacy is clinic visit trough
      (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) on Treatment
      Day 169. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, and clinical
      laboratory tests.</summary>
