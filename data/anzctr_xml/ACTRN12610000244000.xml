  <interventions>
    <interventions>To investigate the effect of quetiapine, in addition to CBCM (cognitive behavioural case management) on the incidence of first episode psychosis. The quetiapine dose will be flexible at the discretion of the treating clinician (within the 50-400mg range). 

Patients will commence on a dose of 50mg per day. This will gradually be titrated upwards in increments of 50mg per week with 400mg as the maximum dose. Note that 400mg is the mximum dose and therefore not necessarily the ideal dose for each patient. Duration of treatment will be over a 6 month period. The mode of administration will be oral capsules. 
Cognitive Behavioural Case Management (CBCM) is a psychological treatment that incorporates Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) into case management, and will be provided by the clinician on a one-on-one  (approximately one hour) weekly session for 6 months, and then on an "as needs" basis for up to 12 months from entry. A standardised manual has been developed by Orygen to ensure consistency across all sites.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo and CBCM. 

Administration of the placebo will follow the exact same titration schedule as the quetiapine. 
Patients will commence on a dose of 50mg (one placebo tablet) per day. This will gradually be titrated upwards in increments of 50mg per week with 400mg (so 2 x 200mg placebo tablets) as the maximum dose. 

The placebo tablets will taste and appear the same as the quetiapine. Patients can clearly be withdrawn if they do not seem to be improving. 

Duration of treatment will be over a 6 month period. The mode of administration will be oral capsules. 

The CBCM in the placebo group will be the same in both the intervention and comparator groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effect of quetiapine, in addition to CBCM, on the incidence of first episode psychosis in an Ultra High Risk (UHR) group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome variable is the rate of transition to psychotic disorder in the two treatment groups at 6 months post study entry.

This will be measured using the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental States (CAARMS). The CAARMS is a semi-structured interview-based instrument designed to assess attenuated and frank psychotic symptoms, in addition to other prodromal symptoms.  The severity, frequency and duration of symptoms is measured.  It is used to determine UHR status and includes operationalised criteria for full threshold psychotic disorder.  The CAARMS displays good to excellent psychometric properties. The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID IV) will also be used to look at whether a patient has transitioned to psychosis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effects of quetiapine, in addition to CBCM, on clinical status and the level of symptoms and functioning in the UHR group. The corresponding outcome variables are remission from UHR status and dimensional measures of symptoms and functioning at 6 months post study entry.

The secondary outcome will be measured using a variety of measures which look at level of symptomatology, including depression, positive, negative and basic symptoms. The following measures will be used to assess this: the CAARMS, the SCID IV, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post study entry</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate if any candidate risk factors, such as neurocognitive deficits, negative symptoms and sociodemographic characteristics influence treatment response in the UHR group.  The outcome variables that will be used to measure this objective are transition to psychotic disorder, response rates, and dimensional outcome measures of symptoms and functioning in relation to relevant baseline measures. 

The following measures will be used to assess this: the CAARMS, the SCID IV, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). A neurocognitive battery of assessments will also be implemented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post study entry</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To study the relationship between progression of the disorder and key neurobiological variables and to examine for any potential neuroprotective effects of treatment in this stage of illness.  This aspect will be studied with the use of local sources of research funding as a linked project.

This objective is still being developed and hence we are unable to provide information about how this outcome will be assessed at this stage.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post study entry</timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patient eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  Patients will be randomised strictly sequentially, as patients are eligible for enrolment/randomisation.  Allocation concealment will operate because the researcher who determines if a subject is eligible for inclusion in the trial will be unaware (when this decision is made) to which group the subject will be allocated. Allocation will be generated by a centralised randomisation system and sealed opaque envelopes will contain this information. 



a patient discontinues from the study, the patient number will not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re-enter the study.

All patients screened will be documented in a screening log. For patients who fulfil all inclusion and no exclusion criteria and have provided written informed consent, treatment will be assigned.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be stratified by site and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, and there will be equal allocation to the two treatment groups. Computer generated random numbers will be used to carry out the randomization.  A unique centre number will be allocated to each participating centre. Each participant will have a unique identification number (Participant ID#) for anonymous data analysis.</sequence>
