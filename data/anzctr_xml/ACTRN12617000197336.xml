  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prospective investigation of patients from the Princess Alexandra Hospital Orthopaedic outpatients, undergoing conventional surgical management (lumbar fusion surgery) for chronic low back pain associated with isthmic spondylolithesis and corresponding pars defect. Samples of bilateral pars defects, ligamentum flavum, intervertebral disc, and para-spinal muscle tissue will be collected; tissue normally discarded during your lumbar fusion surgery. These samples will then be sent for microbiological analysis.  Approximately 50 patients will be recruited over 2 years.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will performed at the completion of the study to evaluate the data collected (including regression analysis, Chi-squared and T-tests). Participant numbers are based on the sample size required to conduct appropriate statistical analysis while taking into account external constraints of participant availability in a public hospital. In study analysis will also be performed during the study to determine if the participant numbers are sufficient to calculate significance or a larger sample size is needed. Variables such as previous steroid injections, age, gender and other medical conditions will also be considered in correlation analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate whether an underlying subacute infection at the pars defect is a possible cause of pain in patients requiring lumbar spinal fusion surgery. The study will perform microbiological analysis of the bone, ligamentous, muscle and disc tissue at/adjacent to the pars defect, taken from normally discarded material intraoperatively. The presence of infection will be determined by positive bacterial culture from these sites and results analysed for statistical significance. Detection of bacteria would support an infectious rationale, as a source of back pain, in this population. This research endeavors to clarify the source of back pain in isthmic spondylolithesis patients the search for suitable, reliable and reproducible conservative treatments.</summary>
