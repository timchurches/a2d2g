  <interventions>
    <interventions>A psychological treatment method Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing, usually used in the treatment of trauma, is used in a modified manner to target binge eating, comorbid mental health symptoms (e.g. depression, anxiety), self-esteem, body image, exercise motivation and weight. It will be used in ten 55-minute sessions one week apart by trained, qualified and experienced, registered psychologists in one-on-one sessions. They are required to pay $10 per session. Sessions will be audio-taped. Participants will be given pre- and post-treatment questionnaires to assess changes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Clinical and Statistical significance will be analyzed using a repeated ANOVA to compare change from pre to post treatment of 2 groups (treatment or no treatment). Analyses will be conducted on completers vs intent to treat analyses for all relevant variables. Groups will also be compared using t-tests and chi square analyses for demographic variables and baseline symptom measures.
Effect size to achieve sufficient power will be achieved at 52 participants. Sample Size calculations are based on power analyses conducted using GPower with alpha set at 0.05 and power=0.8 needing 52 participants for a large effect size between groups (n=26 per group)</statisticalmethods>
