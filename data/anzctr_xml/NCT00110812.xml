  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - IL-2

No Intervention: No IL-2 - Participants will receive no aldesleukin or HAART

Experimental: IL-2 without ART - Participants will receive aldesleukin under the skin twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles, then as needed to maintain CD4 counts at or above a goal level. Some Group 2 participants may take part in additional cycles of aldesleukin if they meet certain study criteria.

Experimental: IL-2 with pericycle HAART - Participants will receive aldesleukin under the skin twice daily for 5 consecutive days every 8 weeks for 3 cycles, then as needed to maintain CD4 counts at or above a goal level; Group 3 participants will also take HAART for 3 days prior to the start of each aldesleukin cycle, throughout the 5-day aldesleukin cycle, and for 2 days after the end of each aldesleukin cycle (for a maximum of 10 days with each aldesleukin cycle). Some Group 3 participants may take part in additional cycles of aldesleukin if they meet certain study criteria. HAART is not supplied by the study, and choice of drugs is left to the participant and physician. The HAART regimen should include at least one protease inhibitor and at least 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors.


Treatment: drugs: IL-2
7.5 MIU injected intramuscularly; one arm uses Proleukin together with HAART of choice (protease inhibitor and at least 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of short cycles of recombinant
      interleukin-2 (also known as rIL-2 or aldesleukin) given with or without anti-HIV drugs in
      HIV infected patients. The effects will be compared with a study group that receives no IL-2
      or antiretroviral therapy.

      Study hypothesis: Intermittent aldesleukin, when given without antiretroviral therapy to
      patients with early HIV infection, will produce no change in HIV viral load and increases in
      CD4+ T lymphocyte counts comparable to aldesleukin administered with antiretrovirals.</summary>
