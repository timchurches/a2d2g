  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 6-month intervention is a multi-component telephone call, a Google+ hangout setup on an ipad or tablet plus health promotion and dementia information on the tablet. Trained nursing and psychology therapists will conduct intervention contacts.  The intervention will be tailored to individual carer/participant needs, will be conducted in sessions of up to 30 minutes per session, usually weekly and will be conducted approximately once per week for up to 12-weeks, followed by regular negotiated calls (0-12) for a further three months. Participants will be provided with a Stroke Foundation information pack together with information about risk factors, knowledge of dementia and other educational resources on their ipad/tablet. The intervention will include psycho-education about dementia, counseling for mood disorders in the family carer and emotional support and education about risk factors. Participants will be counseled about health risk behavior including quarterly general practitioner visits, risk factor management and monitoring. Therapists will refer participants to appropriate health professionals where necessary. Therapists will liaise with health professionals, case managers and other health practitioners. Information will be provided on the ipad about contacts with relevant health professionals. Psychotherapy will be structured by assessment, diagnosis, formulation, implementation of formulation and evaluation of process, centered around behaviors of the care recipient and the carers thoughts feelings and and behavior.

We will seek approval for all study intervention contacts between therapists and participants to be recorded. The investigators will review individual intervention contacts with each therapist at 1-week, 3-weeks and 6- weeks to ensure adherence to the study protocol.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants assigned to the control group will receive standard care plus the standard Stroke Foundation hard copy information pack and assessment feedback including follow-up assessment. Standard care from a participating stroke unit will usually require outpatient neurology follow-up and community management of risk factors and medical conditions with the participants own General Practitioner. Control participants recruited from the community will continue to use current community supports.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Carers of people with a history of cognitive impairment associated with stroke or a history of dementia will be screened by to determine eligibility. For those determined eligible to enter the study a baseline assessment will be undertaken blind to allocation using a clinical baseline assessment interview comprising the standard scales mentioned. Randomization will then occur to either the intervention or usual care as completed by the blinded trial statistician. Participants will be either assigned to to a telephone therapist or current standard of care available in the community.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated random sequence available to the trial statistician but not other research staff will be used to produce randomized allocation using a randomised permuted block design in order to maintain approximately balanced randomization across sites throughout the trial. Assessors will be blinded, but therapists will be unblinded to treatment allocation. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>For carer efficacy, to detect a standardised interaction effect of 0.15 (based on published mean effect sizes) we would need at least a sample of 45 participants per group (calculated using G-power). Using published mean effect size for studies of mood change achieved as a result of cognitive behaviour therapy we would need at least 65 participants per group to achieve 80% power at the 0.05 alpha error probability level. Assuming 10% dropout we therefore conservatively estimate we would need at least 140 participants enrolled in the trial. 

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference at follow-up assessment between groups in primary outcome measures. The adequacy of the randomization procedures will be assessed by comparison of all baseline characteristics between the two study groups. Non-paired comparisons will be done for intervention and control groups. The statistical test for comparison of baseline and follow up scores will depend on the skewness of distribution of responses. Change in knowledge and caring efficacy before and after implementing the study tool will be analyzed using paired Wilcoxon rank tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will offer family carers of people living with mixed or vascular dementia support in their own homes using both telephone and ipad technology to deliver an intervention that combines mental health support for the family carer with information about stroke, dementia and how to manage risk factors. Currently there is little known about how best to provide support for family carers of people living with vascular or mixed dementia over the telephone or using technology such as ipads/tablets. Family carers and people living with vascular or mixed dementia in the community are at risk of social isolation, mood disorders, and carer strain. Risk factors for vascular dementia are high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol so it is important to avoid and control these risk factors to maintain functioning for as long as possible. Community awareness of dementia and management of behavioural symptoms is low. Face-to-face delivery of interventions can be hard to achieve and costly. With service providers introducing ipads for community clients who choose consumer directed care, there is the potential to utilise the new technology together with telephone support to provide a multi-modal support service in the carers own home.</summary>
