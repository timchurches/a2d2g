  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project compares three different interventions: a risk reduction intervention called Body Brain Life-GP (BBL-GP) that is designed to reduce risk of cognitive decline; a Lifestyle Modification Program (LMP) that is designed to enhance general wellbeing and improve lifestyle to reduce risk of chronic disease, once a week making a total of six sessions; and an Active Control condition involving emails containing information about healthy lifestyle.

BBL-GP is an intervention package that builds on two published interventions developed by our team: the BBL intervention (Trial ID:ACTRN12612000147886) and the Fitness for the Ageing Brain (FABs; Trial ID: ACTRN 12609000755235). For BBL-GP we revised our previously published interventions to include newly available health self-monitoring technology, we adapted our modules after extensive consumer evaluation, and included a more intensive physical activity program designed for a younger age-group. This revised program (Body Brain Life-Fit) was piloted with the general public (Trial ID: ACTRN12615000822583). The sample for the current project is adults in Primary Care who meet criteria to participate in the GP Practice's Lifestyle Management Program. These are the types of adults who a GP would refer to a dementia risk reduction trial in 'real life' and we are aiming to evaluate our intervention in a naturalistic context. Primary care is the appropriate setting for the implementation of this program because it is where adults with high risk of developing dementia are identified. 

Participants in the BBL-GP group will be required to complete 8 modules (dementia literacy, risk factors, physical activity, nutrition, health, cognitive activity, social activity and mood) delivered online, and receive an individually tailored one hour face to face physical activity session and where indicated an individually tailored one hour face to face nutrition intervention. They will complete one module per week, each taking approximately 30-40 minutes. Participants will receive an email reminding them of the next module (during the first 8 weeks of the trial). Participants who are late competing modules will receive up to 3 reminder emails. The first eight weeks will be spent completing the 8 modules and the following four weeks will be spent revising the materials in the modules. 

The session duration and frequency of the physical activity (PA) program will vary between participants based on individual tailoring. An exercise physiologist/physiotherapist will design an individual program for the participant, deliver this in a face-to-face workshop and monitor the physical activity program via the returned diaries and telephone monitoring. For those not doing any regular PA at baseline, the target will be 150 minutes/week moderate intensity PA, for those doing less than 100 minutes/week, an additional 100 minutes/week will be prescribed and for those meeting the target, an additional 50 minutes/week will be prescribed. A diary in the format of a calendar returned monthly for 24 weeks, will be used to record PA and rating of perceived exertion.

The dietary intervention will be provided to those individuals who have experienced significant weight gain in the last 6 months or indicate an unhealthy dietary pattern at the baseline assessment. A one hour face to face intervention will involve individually tailored dietary advice, formal dietary prescription, and a dietitian tailored plan. Participants will complete an online diary to record their dietary intake.

Participants in the BBL group will be asked to continue being active and having a healthy dietary pattern after the completion of the intervention but they will be monitored through phone calls at week 4, 12 and 20. In addition, they will receive a general booster session at 12 months with a phone call and a mailed out booklet. 

Participants in the LMP group will receive group sessions on basic nutrition, meal planning, physical activity, health conditions, motivation and goals, medications, and sleep. This program will be provided by various health professionals (dietitian, exercise physiologist, nurse practitioner, psychologist, pharmacist and sleep physician) for a duration of 6 weeks. Each session will last for 2 hours. The course is currently run by the practice for their patients to assist them to improve their lifestyle and management of chronic disease and so it is a real-life comparison condition. 

This trial will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of health promotion interventions (BBL-GP and LMP) compared with the Active Control. There will be 240 participants (80 in BBL-GP, 80 in LMP and 80 in the Actvie Control group) followed for 62 weeks from baseline. There will be 4 follow-up assessments (immediately after the completion of the intervention or at 13 weeks for the Active Control, and at 18, 36 and 62 weeks after commencement of the intervention).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the Actvie Control group proceed with their normal activities and access health services as required over the trial period. They will also receive weekly emails with links to websites providing information on lifestyle risk factors and disease management for a duration of 12 weeks. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Primary Outcome measure is the score on the ANU-ADRI.  The ANU-ADRI is comprised of validated scales assessing 15 individual risk and protective factors for Alzhiemer's disease and dementia.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>ANU-ADRI assessments will be assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention for LMP and BBL groups, and 13 weeks for the Active control. The Active control assessment is aligned with the BBL time-point for followup at 13 weeks immediately post intervention. The LMP and BBL interventions are of different lengths (6 and 12 weeks). We have decided that it is more important to capture change immediately post intervention for all groups, than to align the time point for the first follow-up. (It is not possible for us to do both). This is a constraint of conducting a trial in a real-life setting and comparing BBL-GP to an existing program. Follow-ups will also occur for all 3 groups at 18, 36 and 62 weeks after commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive function will be assessed with tests of processing speed and task switching using Trail A and B, and Digit Symbol Modalities Test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline for all groups, immediately after the intervention for the BBL and LMP groups and at 13 weeks for the Active Control, and for all groups assessments will also be made at 18, 36 and 62 weeks after commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Moderate-vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) is a continuous measure of activity that registers 3 or more Metabolic Equivalents of Task (METs) for 10 minutes or longer on an ActiGraph Link (http://actigraphcorp.com/products/actigraph-link/), which is worn for 7 days at baseline and at 18, 36, and 62 weeks follow ups. MVPA will be recorded in all three groups. Self-reported phyical activity will also be recorded using the IPAQ which is part of the ANU-ADRI.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline for all groups, immediately after the intervention for the BBL and LMP groups and at 13 weeks for the Active Control, and for all groups assessments will also be made at 18, 36 and 62 weeks after commencement of the intervention.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria are those used by the General Practice for referring patients to the Practice's Lifestyle Management Program which it offers for free. Adults who are overweight or obese (BMI (kg/m2)&gt;= 25 and &lt;=35), with a chronic health condition (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes or 'pre-diabetes', osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, PCOS, kidney or liver disease, depression/anxiety) and who live in the ACT and surrounding areas. In addition for our project, all participants will be required to have internet access at home,  and agree to participate in the baseline and four follow-up assessments. 

Note: The LMP program involves a baseline and followup assessment when offered (i.e. not as a research condition) and patients are evaluted on outcomes in usual care, so the assessments for this trial were designed to coincide with usual care as far as possible.</inclusivecriteria>

Sample size calculations were estimated using G*power (version 3.1.). To detect a medium effect in a three-group design (1:1:1), with a 5% risk of type 1 error, 80% power and 4 measurements, a total sample size  of 159 persons is required. Previous LMP had attribution of approximately 30%. With this in mind, we will recruit 240 participants at baseline.  </statisticalmethods>
