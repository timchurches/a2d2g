Experimental: Exercise and cognitive training - This intervention includes a combination of high-intensity exercise (10min/day) and computerized cognitive training (20min/day). The software for the latter has been developed by our group, and includes 8 mini-games targeting different cognitive abilities. Both are developed for the MovinCog intervention. The intervention is personalized, based on individual performance.

Experimental: Exercise - High-intensity training regimen, 10min/day. Developed for the MovinCog intervention.

Experimental: Cognitive training - Computerized cognitive training, 20min/day. Developed for the MovinCog intervention.

Active Comparator: Games - The active control is composed of a blend of board games, computer games, and trivia quizzes. Specific content is personalized based on individual preferences, so as to reflect the flexibility of the experimental arms.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test the efficacy of the MovinCog Intervention to enhance cognitive
      abilities in children 7-15 yrs. The intervention consists of two parts: a physical exercise
      regimen, based on high-intensity training, and a cognitive training component. The design
      will contrast the intervention with an active control group, matched for expectancy effects.</summary>
