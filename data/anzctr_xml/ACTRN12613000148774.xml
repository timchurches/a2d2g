  <interventions>
    <interventions>One-off remediation of certain home fall hazards identified by a home hazard inspection protocol, the Healthy Housing Index. Hazards (such as steps without handrails) are remediated (e.g., by installing a handrail) at the start of the trial for the treatment group. Remediation of the hazards will typically occur within a month of the inspection. Injuries occurring in the house are monitored for about 3 years following the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Status quo. 
After the treatment group has received the home hazard remediations and approximately three years has passed to allow an assessment of home injury rates, home fall hazards are remediated for the controls. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Home injury hazards are a likely to be a major cause of injury for Maori.  This study will capitalise on an existing cohort of Maori houses which are participants in the Best Outcomes for Maori : Te Hoe Nuku Roa longitudinal study.  Audits of 250 Maori houses will be undertaken using the Healthy Housing Index developed by members of this research team. Half of the houses will be randomly assigned to an intervention group where remediation of selected hazards will be undertaken by professional builders.  At the end of the randomised control trial, the balance of the houses will be remediated.  We will also assess preparedness for earthquakes and other disasters, determining structural (i.e. building) and behavioural (i.e. planning) risks for Maori.</summary>
