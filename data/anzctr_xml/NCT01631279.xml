  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PR610 for Both a 1-hour and a 24-hour Weekly IV Infusion - The first cohort of three subjects will receive PR610 at Dose Level 1. Subsequent cohorts will receive PR610 at a dose levels determined as per dose escalation criteria. The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which one (1) or fewer subject in six exhibit DLT with the next highest dose level demonstrating two (2) or more of six (6) subjects with DLT (or for which more than =33% of subjects exhibit DLT if the cohort size exceeds 6 subjects).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of PR610 for Both a 1-hour and a 24-hour Weekly IV Infusion - DLT is defined as the following:
Occurs during the first cycle of PR610
Is considered PR610-related, as defined by "Definitely-related", "Probably-related" or "Possibly-related"
Is clinically significant, as determined by the Principal Investigator
In addition, DLT will meet at least one of the criteria listed below using grading criteria from the CTCAEv4.
Grade 4 hematologic toxicity
Any drug-related toxicity that prevents administration of 100% of all doses of PR610 planned for Cycle 1
