    <exclusivecriteria>1. Persistent, chronic, or active recurring infection requiring treatment with
             antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals within 4 weeks prior to the screening visit

          2. Any clinically significant (determined at the investigator's discretion) abnormalities
             observed during the screening physical examination

          3. Onset of a new exercise routine or major change to a previous exercise routine within
             4 weeks prior to the screening visit. Patients must be willing to maintain a similar
             level of exercise for the duration of the study and to refrain from unusually
             strenuous exercise for the duration of the trial

          4. Hospitalization for any reason within 60 days prior to the screening visit

          5. Participation in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug
             or therapy within 30 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of the
             investigational drug prior to the screening visit

          6. Any medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the investigator or
             Regeneron, would place the patient at risk, interfere with participation in the study
             or interfere with the interpretation of study results
