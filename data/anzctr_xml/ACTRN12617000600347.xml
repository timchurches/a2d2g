  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is the prescription of 40g of nuts (specifically raw almonds) daily for 4 weeks to individuals undertaking hemodialysis in a satellite hemodialysis unit in the Illawarra  Shoalhaven Local Health District. Participants will undergo a 2 week washout period , then commence the intervention for 4 weeks. This will be followed by another 2 week washout period and 4 weeks of usual diet with no nuts.  

 Intervention adherence or fidelity will be assessed by a self recorded food diary and via the assessment of the remaining supply returned to the project coordinator each week</interventions>
    <comparator>In this trial, patients will act as their own control (crossover study). The control period consists of 4 weeks of dietary intake as per usual dietary recommendations for people with kidney failure undertaking hemodialysis. 

The usual recommendations for people undertaking hemodialysis are &gt; 30kcal per kg; &gt; 1.1g / kg of protein; &lt;1000ml fluid per day; 1mmol/kg of potassium; &lt; 100 mmol per day of sodium; &gt; 30g fibre per day; &lt; 1000mg of phosphate per day. Nuts are not recommended in the normal hemodialysis diet due to their high potassium and phosphate intake. The washout and control diet are the same recommendations as listed above ie the usual recommendations for people undertaking hemodialysis.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be collected in paper form and transferred to a study-specific database. Statistical analysis will be carried out using SPSS software (Version 22.0 for Windows, SPSS, Chicago, USA). Data normality for continuous variables will be assessed using the Shapiro Wilk test. Data will be reported as mean and standard deviations; median and interquartile range (IQR) or proportions as appropriate. All analyses will be conducted using the intention-to-treat (ITT) population corresponding to subjects having consumed at least 40g per day of almonds. Wilcoxon signed ranks, McNemar and paired sample t tests will be used where appropriate. Spearmans correlation coefficient will used to assess the strength of association between variables such as fibre intake and frequency of bowel habit. Statistical significance will be set at P of less than 0.05.  A trial sample size of n=34 was calculated using an effect size of 0.5 for the primary outcome with a power of 80% for detecting a within group effect  for the primary endpoint. An additional 30% was added to account for dropouts and incomplete data to reach a final sample size of n=45. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Constipation is a common problem in people with end stage kidney failure. Treatment of this condition with a high fibre diet and adequate fluid is not possible in this group of people because they need to follow a specialized diet and restrict their fluid intake. The aim of this study  is to determine if a non drug treatment in the form of 40g of almonds daily for 4 weeks will help improve the symptoms of constipation. Other outcomes such as improvements to the level of inflammation, dietary intake, memory, gut bacteria and quality of life will also be investigated.  </summary>
