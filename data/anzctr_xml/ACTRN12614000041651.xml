  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Plant-origin berry extract is predicted to be able to activate satiety mechanisms which may suppress both hunger and food intake.
Aim: This study aims to measure the effect of encapsulated Plant-origin berry extract consumed with breakfast meal on hunger, appetite and energy intake at a subsequent buffet lunch meal.
Design: This will be a high-dose, low-dose and placebo, crossover intervention study comprising 20 healthy lean male subjects (aged 18-60 years) with both researches and participants blinded to treatment. Participants will be given a standard 2 MegaJoules (MJ) breakfast followed 3 hours later by a lunch meal which is consumed ad lib until the participant is comfortably full.
Outcome variables will be feelings of hunger, fullness and associated appetite sensations as well as energy and macronutrient intake at the ad lib lunch meals.</summary>
