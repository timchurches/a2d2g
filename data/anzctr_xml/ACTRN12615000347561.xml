    <interventions>This study is a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial and a sub-study of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly trial (ASPREE, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01038583, website www.aspree.org). 
ASPREE is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial that is examining the benefits and risks of low-dose aspirin in 19,000 healthy people (16,500 aged 70 years and over from Australia and 2,500 people aged 65 years and over from the US) without overt cardiovascular disease or dementia. The primary aim of ASPREE is to determine whether low-dose aspirin (100mg enteric coated, daily) will prolong disability and dementia free survival; and provides a net benefit for older people in a primary prevention setting. 
The ASPREE-Fracture sub-study will mirror the design of the ASPREE principal trial and extends current ASPREE data collection to include fracture events and fall-related hospital presentation events from all participants from the beginning of the study. The ASPREE-Fracture sub-study aims to determine the effect of daily low-dose aspirin on fracture risk (primary outcome) and falls resulting in a hospital presentation (secondary outcome) in the 16,500 ASPREE participants recruited in Australia. 
Participants in the ASPREE principal trial are allocated to one of two treatments (intervention and placebo). The intervention group participants will receive a once daily dose of 100mg enteric-coated aspirin for an average of 5 years post randomisation (range 3-7 years). Compliance and retention of the intervention is maintained through research staff direct phone contact every 3 months, interspersed with annual face-to-face visits.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive a once daily dose of a placebo enteric-coated un-scored white tablet with identical appearance to aspirin. The enteric coating will
ensure that both active and placebo medication have an identical taste.</comparator>

A fracture event will be defined as any type of vertebral, hip and non-vert-non-hip fracture (including traumatic and pathological) confirmed by medical imaging (e.g. x-ray). Data on fracture events will be collected via annual face-to-face visits with study participants; 6-monthly  interviewer administered questionnaires (designed specifically for this study) through telephone contact; and audit of hospital, general practice and specialist medical recordsincluding hospital admission notes, hospital discharge summaries, medical imaging reports (x-rays, MRI, CT and bone scan reports), ED progress notes and death certificates.</outcome>

A fall-related hospital presentation event will be defined as any event which results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or floor or lower level that results in a hospital presentation (including emergency department presentations and hospital admissions).  Data on fall-related hospital presentation events will be collected via annual face-to-face visits with study participants; 6-monthly  interviewer administered questionnaires (designed specifically for this study) through telephone contact; and audit of hospital, general practice and specialist medical recordsincluding hospital admission notes, hospital discharge summaries, ED progress notes and death certificates. </outcome>

    <concealment>Enrolment
The majority of participants are recruited through general medical practices (approximately 2,000) and a small number through community advertising. At the general practice, limited key terms are used to derive a list of potentially eligible patients on the basis of age, pre-existing cardiovascular disease or anti-platelet therapy, although not all criteria are available from each clinic database. Each potentially eligible patient is sent a letter from their usual GP inviting them to consider participation in the trial. The letter advises those who are interested to call a toll-free ASPREE number to discuss their participation in the study. On calling the number, interested participants are checked for self-reported eligibility, and suitable persons are invited to attend a screening visit (week 0) where baseline examination and testing is organized and run-in medication (placebo) is provided for four weeks. If entry testing and compliance with run-in medication is deemed satisfactory at a second visit (week 4) and the GP has authorized participation, each participant who meets the inclusion criteria is randomized and enters the study. Participants enrolled into the ASPREE principal trial in Australia will automatically be included in the ASPREE-Fracture sub-study.
Treatment allocation
Enrolled participants will be randomly assigned into one of the two groups: intervention (daily dose of 100 mg enteric-coated aspirin) or control (daily dose of a placebo enteric-coated un-scored white tablet with identical appearance to aspirin), using a computer-generated randomisation schedule via the ASPREE web portal. </concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated randomisation schedule via the ASPREE web portal will be generated by an independent statistician, in a ratio of 1:1 to active or placebo therapy. Permuted block randomization stratified by recruitment site and age (less than 80 years or greater than or equal to 80 years) to ensure equal number across groups.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Outcome analyses will be undertaken on an intention to treat basis by a statistician blinded to group allocation. 

Fracture end-points will be analysed without Bonferroni correction using a survival time method and the proportional hazards assumption (which will be tested). This analysis will compare time to first fracture between aspirin and placebo groups. Primary analysis will be unadjusted. Secondary analysis will adjust for a number of covariates including: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, use of medications that affect BMD, cognitive impairment, age, malignancy, alcohol intake and smoking. This will increase the efficiency of the analysis and allow for any imbalance between groups in these baseline variables. We will also perform an unadjusted log-rank test on final results. Secondary analysis, using recurrent events survival models will also be conducted including all fracture events (not just the first fracture) to compare the overall fracture risk between aspirin and placebo groups over the 5 year follow-up.

Fall events will be analysed using negative binomial regression models, where the dependent variable will be the total number of fall-related hospital presentations for each participant during the trial, and group allocation will be the independent variable. The rate of fall-related hospital presentations in the aspirin compared with those in the placebo group and will be expressed as an incidence rate ratio (IRR). Using a negative binomial regression model will allow for the fact that fall-related hospitalisations can be recurrent events with a non-normal distribution; individual participants may have different follow-up times; and allow the investigation of the treatment effect adjusted for known confounding variables. Secondary analysis that adjusts for covariates (cognitive impairment and age) will be undertaken if found to be significant when added to the model. This will increase the efficiency of the analysis. 

Data from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study and a national report on fall-related hospital presentations were applied to the expected age distribution of Australian participants on recruitment to the ASPREE principal trial of 50%, 30%, 15%, 5% in the age groups 70-74 years, 75-79 years, 80-84 years, 85 years and over, respectively to estimate outcome event rates in the placebo group. Based on the an average follow-up of 4.25 years per participant, and that 14% of participants in the placebo group will sustain a fracture in the follow-up period, a sample size of 16,500 provides 80% power to detect a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.88 comparing the intervention group to placebo in an intention to treat analysis (P=0.05; two tailed). The underlying true effect for all fractures is assumed to be a HR of 0.85 on the basis that we expect 5% per annum of placebo-group participants to initiate aspirin use or vice versa.
Based on the an average follow-up of 4.25 years per participant and an expected event rate of 53 fall-related hospital presentations per 1,000 person-years in the placebo group, a sample size of 16,500 provides 80% power to detect an IRR of 0.88 comparing the intervention group to placebo in an intention to treat analysis (over-dispersion parameter=1.3; P=0.05; two tailed). The underlying true effect for fall-related hospital presentations is assumed to be an IRR of 0.85 on the basis that we expect 5% per annum of placebo-group participants to initiate aspirin use or vice versa.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Disability, mortality and healthcare burden from fractures in older people is a growing problem worldwide. During 2007, there were an average 262 fracture-related hospitalisations per day in Australia with the financial burden associated with direct treatment cost for fractures in Australia estimated at $1.9billion per year. A small number of low-quality observational studies examining the effect of aspirin on fracture risk in older people have demonstrated conflicting results. A large-scale controlled trial is required to provide more accurate information on this effect.
The ASPREE-Fracture sub-study aims to investigate whether daily low-dose aspirin (100mg) is associated with decreased incidence of vertebral, hip and non-vert-non-hip fractures in healthy men and women aged 70 years and over; and whether the reduced fracture risk is explained, in part, by reducing risk of fall-related hospital presentations.
The ASPREE-Fracture sub-study has the potential to change current fracture prevention practice and policies for older people by offering a population intervention. Even if small impacts are observed on fracture incidence, the net benefits of aspirin in terms of reduced fracture risk at a population level may be substantial. </summary>
