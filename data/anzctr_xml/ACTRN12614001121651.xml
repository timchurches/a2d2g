    <exclusivecriteria>Patients will be excluded from the study if they had previous hip surgery, aged less than 18 or more than 75 years, diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome, contraindications to or allergic reactions to any of the standardized analgesic/ anaesthesia medication or local infiltrate components, ASA 3 or more and those requiring ketamine analgesia or regional block.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The control and two intervention wings will receive the standard consent discussion as carried out by the senior author. After obtaining written consent, these patients will then be assessed for eligibility to enter the study before being randomly allocated into three different groups. Allocation concealment will be achieved by group allocation being designated to central pharmacy once eligibility is confirmed, and instructions to theatre scrub staff as to which local anaesthetic will be prepared per patient communicated by sealed envelope. Chief recruiter/ investigator and intervening surgeon will be unaware of group allocation</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, California, USA). Continuous data will be analysed with unpaired t-tests of unequal variance. VAS data will also be treated as continuous data after confirmation of normality by histogram frequency distribution analysis and the Kolgomorov-Smirnoff normality test. 

Sample size calculation was performed using G*Power 3.1 (University of Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany) statistical software. Use of 50mg of intra-articular bupivucaine results in a reduction in a mean VAS score reduction of [mean (SD)] 1cm (1.8cm) in the setting of a multimodal analgesic regime5. As the potency of 1mg bupivucaine is approximately equal to 1.5-2mg ropivacaine, the use of 200mg intra-articular ropivacaine should result in an additional VAS score reduction of 1cm, compared with the equivalent of 50mg intra-articular bupivucaine. To detect a mean difference in VAS scores of 0.3cm, the standard deviation quoted and power of 0.8, the sample size required is 150 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hip arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that gives doctors a clear view of the inside of a hip joint. Little attention has been paid to the pain management of patients undergoing hip arthroscopy. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the difference in quality of analgesia between dosage and timing of IALA (intra-articular local anaesthetic) administration in the hip joint. 

150 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy by the study surgeon in a private hospital setting will be recruited in the study. Group 1 (Group R100E) will be the control group and will be administered 100mg IA Ropivacaine at the end of the procedure, as per standard practice. Group 2 (Group R200E) will be administered 200mg IA Ropivacaine at the end of the procedure. Group 3 (Group R100BE) will be administered 100mg IA Ropivacaine immediately after access is gained to the joint space, and 100mg IA Ropivacaine IA at the end of the procedure. Post-operative pain will be recorded using a VAS scale after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-operatively.</summary>
