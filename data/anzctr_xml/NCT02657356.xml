             therapy must have been at a stable dose for at least 90 days prior to Day 1. No

             for the duration of the study;

          -  Has maintained a stable dose for 30 days prior to Day 1 if receiving any of the
             following therapies that may affect PAH: vasodilators (including calcium channel

             embolism). If V/Q scan was abnormal (i.e., results other than normal or low
