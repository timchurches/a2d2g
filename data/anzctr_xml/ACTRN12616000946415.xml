  <interventions>
    <interventions>Personalised exercise program prescribed by physiotherapist. The exercises are placed on a DVD for the patient to complete as a home program with the patient choosing the frequency of completing the program. Exercise to be performed for 7 weeks. All exercises personalised for participant by physiotherapist after one hour consultation. Participant performs same exercise routine for 7 weeks - participant chooses duration and number of repetitions to perform. Exercises are videoed in the clinic and a DVD is given to participants to use at home to complete the exercise. Participants keep a diary to record their exercise adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>usual care - no active treatment. Participants in control group continue at home as previously after baseline assessment. They visit any Health care professional or other person of their choosing including exercise class. They are not instructed to perform any different activity for the period of the trial.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Differences in continuous outcome measures will be compared within the two groups (pre and post intervention) using dependent t tests, or their non-parametric alternative. CHAMPS MET groups will be compared pre and post using Chi-square analysis.  Differences in continuous outcome measures will be compared between the two groups (control and intervention) using independent t tests.
We will also examine the effect size to calculate a sample size for future larger randomised trials. </statisticalmethods>
