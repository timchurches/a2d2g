    <interventions>Intervention Arm 
8 Intensive Care Unit rooms have been permanently randomised to receive Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour (HPV) disinfection cleaning as the normal cleaning on discharge of patients from the Intensive Care Unit. 

The process involves using the existing hospital cleaning staff (sometimes nurses).  The cleaning staff remove all visibly soilded material and any dust.  The mattress of the bed is propped up on the bed frame.  Any equipment is to be left in the room (including electical equipment).  The consumables are left exposed in the room.  The Hydrogren Peroxide vapouriser is placed inside the room and the room is then sealed.  A control panel linked to the machine is located outside the room.  The Vapouriser performs a cleaning cycle.  The room is then checked and consumables, mattress and equipment replaced back into the correct position.

The vapouriser cleaning cycle will take approximately 90 minutes, with overall room cleaning time expected to be similar to the traditional cleaning mthods.

It is expected that the intervention period will be approximately 9 months.  We will have a more accurate time frame after the planned interim analysis at 4 months to confirm the sample size required.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clostridium difficile and/or Multi-Resistant Organisms (MRO's) acquisition rate (composite of all MROs)  as determined by
- admission swabs screening for MROs only (not C.Difficile)
- discharge swabs screening for MROs only (not C.Difficile)
- any positive culture result (clinical specimen) for Clostridium difficile and/or MRO acquisitions  (both clinically meaningful and non-clinically meaningful acquisitions) from 48 hours post admission up to 48 hours post discharge from ICU.

To record an acquisition for a specific MRO, there must be a negative result for that organism on the admission screen followed by detection in either the discharge swabs or a clinical specimen obtained up to 48hrs following ICU discharge.  

Any positive culture result from the first 48 hours of an admission would be excluded on basis that the organism is unlikely to have come from Intensive Care.  Similarly upon discharge, the next 48 hours would be considered as having come from Intensive Care. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary timepoint will be at time of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and at time of discharge, as well as 48 hours post admission and at 48 hours post discharge.

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any clinical infections, as evidenced by commencement of antibiotics within ICU (excluding cephazolin which is used as surgical and post trauma prophylaxis) from 48 hours post admission up to 48 hours post discharge from Intensive Care Unit with objective evidence (positive culture result)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary timepoint will be at time of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and at time of discharge, as well as 48 hours post admission and at 48 hours post discharge.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any clinical infections, as evidenced by commencement of antibiotics within ICU (excluding cephazolin which is used as surgical and post trauma prophylaxis) from 48 hours post admission up to 48 hours post discharge from ICU without objective evidence (i.e. started without positive culture results). </outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary timepoint will be at time of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and at time of discharge, as well as 48 hours post admission and at 48 hours post discharge.
 </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICU associated blood stream infections, as evidenced by significant positive blood cultures (single set coagulase negative staphylococci are defined as contaminant isolates) from 48 hours post admission up to 48 hours post discharge from ICU.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The secondary timepoint will be at time of admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and at time of discharge, as well as 48 hours post admission and at 48 hours post discharge.

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a single centre, cluster randomised controlled trial.

The rooms were randomly assigned within each group of four rooms to either standard cleaning or the intervention of Hydrogen Peroxide cleaning.  This assignment was completed prior to the trial starting and will be maintained throughout the trial.

The John Hunter Hospital Intensive Care Unit has a bed occupancy of over 90% and hence patients are allocated to a room based on first available and nursing considerations which will continue unchanged from current practices.

The patients are blinded.  The laboratory staff analysing the cultures sent to the laboratory are also blinded.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Initial analysis will seek to confirm that cluster randomisation has worked and that patient characteristics in the HPV rooms are similar to those in the standard rooms on key characteristics, in particular: age, gender, APACHE score, significant comorbidities and ICU length of stay.

Analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be by Chi-squared test since each of these is dichotomous (acquisition of MRO during the ICU stay, clinical infection as judged by starting an antibiotic.  These tests will incorporate the design effect created by the cluster design.

An interim analysis will be made at 4 months to confirm the actual sample size required.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The transmission and acquisition of health care associated microorganisms by hospitalised patients is associated with serious morbidity.  

Critically ill patients are particularly susceptible to serious infections with these organisms due to the nature of their illness and the numerous vascular and intra-cavity devices they have. It is known that persistence of these organisms within the healthcare environment is a major source of these transmissions.

Environmental cleaning is important in the control of these organisms and traditionally relies on wet cleaning methods of the patient environment with detergents and disinfectants. This process of cleaning is time consuming, requiring significant resources and personnel. In addition, much of the environment is not easily amenable to these cleaning methods (e.g under surfaces, monitoring devices). Increasing bed occupancy and bed turnover creates added pressure to the effectiveness of these traditional cleaning methods.

Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) is an attractive alternative to these traditional cleaning strategies.  This is due to being less personnel dependent, the vapour will effectively reach more difficult areas, simplifies complex cleaning process for numerous types of surfaces and recent evidence suggests that it is more effective in eliminating environmental organisms than traditional disinfection treatments.

This study aims at assessing the effectiveness and practicality of using HPV compared to traditional cleaning methods in the routine ICU patient discharge cleaning process. Specifically we are looking at the control of the acquisition of hospital acquired organisms by patients in a busy general intensive care unit.

Null Hypothesis:
 That Hydrogen Peroxide Vapour is no better than standard double cleaning (viraclean and detergent, no bleach) procedures in regards to acquisition of hospital acquired Clostridium difficile and multiresistant organisms during the course of an ICU admission. 

The Multi Resistant Organism (MROs) acquisitions to be measured include:
- Multi Resistant Gram Negative bacteria (MRGN),
- Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
- Vancomycin Resistant enterococci (VRE) and

Clostridium Difficile cultures will only be collected if they are clinically indicated.  Clostridium Difficile will not be included on routine admission and discharge swabs to Intensive Care.

There will be a planned interim analysis at 4 months to re-calculate the sample size required.</summary>
