  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment involves 13 x 50 minute weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy with a self-efficacy focus. A dual clinician model is used where one clinician sees the young person and the other with their parent/guardian(s).A self-efficacy focussed cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) involves working with participants beliefs about their abilities to succeed in a number of domains including social, academic and self-regulation of mood and behaviour. To achieve this, the therapy will focus on introducing mastery experiences to the young person, the need for persistence and effort and, to limit rumination. Established CBT techniques will be used including psycho-education, relaxation training, communication skills training, problem solving skills training, cognitive restructuring, social skills training, life goals planning,  pleasant events scheduling and relapse prevention. The young person will receive the therapy modules as discussed above while the parent, in a parallel session, will receive a separate program which overlaps to some degree with the young persons therapy. However the focus will be on psycho-education on depression in adolescents, behavioural parenting strategies, communication, problem solving, and support for the parent. A benefit of the dual-clinician model is access to multiple sources of information regarding the psychological and behavioural functioning of the young person.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of Self-Efficacy Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (SEFCBT) for adolescents with depressive disorders and demonstrate that SEFCBT improves self-efficacy as well as depressive symptoms.
It is hypothesized that study participants receiving SEFCBT will experience significant reductions in depressive symptoms.</summary>
