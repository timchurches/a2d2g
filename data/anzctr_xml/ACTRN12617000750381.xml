  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this methodological study, a cerebral and a somatic (abdominal) Near-infrared (NIRS) sensor were used to register regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) during planned and acute transports of critically ill patients to and from the PICU of a tertiary university hospital Patients (n=38) were transported in air ambulance and connecting ground ambulance (convenience sampling) by a pedaitric specialized transport team. The electronically stored data from the INVOS 5100C was afterwards extracted and examined. In order to reduce as much noise as possible in the NIRS-signal without improperly busting the underlying information  the signal was smoothed by using the Savitzky-Golay filtering method. The duration for which the NIRS monitoring took place was from time of departure to arrival at hospital site in all patients. If patients were monitored due to clinical considerations in the PICU before time of departure, this data was also analyzed.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Data was presented as median and inter-quartile range.
The NIRS curves were smoothed by the Savitzky-Golay filtering method.
The noise of the NIRS curves was defined as the median value of the absolute differences of all adjacent data points.
Mann-Whitney U-test was used for the comparison of data from two independent populations. Several independent populations were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. 
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test was used for comparison of two related populations. 
Several related populations were compared with the Friedman test with Dunn's multiple comparison test. 
Correlations were established by the Spearman rank correlation test.
All statistical tests were two-sided and p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistical significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) of the underlying tissue and may be a useful additional monitoring tool to already existing medical monitoring equipment during inter-hospital transports. Values are usually read using real time monitor readings on-line, but real-time readings are sometimes unreliable during transport. NIRS data can also be electronically stored by the monitor, for example during the period of transport, and extracted and examined afterwards. However the electronically stored data is associated with a high degree of noise in the signal. The aim of the present study was to investigate how monitoring with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during pediatric air ambulance transports can be optimized by processing of the electronically stored data using a mathematical algorithm to reduce as much noise as possible in the signal without improperly busting the underlying information, </summary>
