    <concealment>Concealed allocation is prepared by a statistician not involved in the study. A randomization schedule is prepared using a random number generated by computer with permuted block randomization (block of 10) prior to the enrolment of the first participant. Another person not involved in the study placed randomized numbers into opaque envelopes. The assignments were placed in sealed opaque numbered envelopes prior to the onset of the study and treatments determined after the baseline assessments had been completed. Each person who met the eligibility criteria was given the next opaque envelope treatment in sequential order. </concealment>
