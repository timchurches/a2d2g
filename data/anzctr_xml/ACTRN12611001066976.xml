  <interventions>
    <interventions>The FamilyFIT Program will be conducted as a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). Families (parents and children) attend eight, approximately ninety minute face-to-face sessions once a week, for eight weeks. The sessions will be conducted out of school hours, at a local venue and delivered by a qualified health promotion practitioner and physical education teachers. Each session  parents will receive a thirty minute information component to receive information, skills and tailored resources to support parenting strategies which influence activity behaviour and establish a family-home environment conducive to physical activity. Each session, will also involve a sixty minute practical component involving parents and children participating in interactive fun and skill-based physical activity together; to develop childrens self confidence and ability in performing various fundamental movement skills (e.g. run, hop, skip and throw a ball), increasing incidental physical activity (e.g taking stairs instead of lifts) and health-related physical activities.</interventions>

    <concealment>Parents interested in participating in the study will contact the researchers. Family eligibility, based on the studyâ€™s inclusion/exclusion criteria will be screened over the telephone. All participants (parents and children) will be required to pass a Pre exercise Screening Questionnaire. Participants deemed to be at a potential risk of an exercise related complication will be required to obtain a doctor's clearance prior to enrolling in the study.  
 
Once written consent is obtained and baseline assessments conducted for all participating family members (parents and children), families will be randomised to one of the two study groups.

To ensure concealment, the random allocation sequence will be generated by a statisticain and given to the project manager. Randomisation will be completed by a research assistant who is not involved in the assessment of participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to test the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a family focused, community-based physical activity program (FamilyFIT) conducted out of school hours, to increase the physical activity levels of primary school- aged children.  It is hypothesized that the FamilyFIT program will be more effective then no program in increasing childrens physical levels. Objectively measured child and parent physical levels will be assessed by pedometers worn over 7 days; self-reported child (parent proxy) and adult physical activity levels, sedentary behaviour, parenting variables and aspects of home physical and social environment will be measured using items from validated instruments; and health-related assessments will be conducted using standardised protocols.  Data will be collected for children and their parents at baseline (including demographic indicators) and post intervention for all measures.</summary>
