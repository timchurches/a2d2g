  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) - EFS distributions will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method for patients with high risk features (treated with adjuvant chemotherapy) and separately for subjects without high risk features (treated with enucleation alone).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) - OS distributions will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method for patients with high risk features (treated with adjuvant chemotherapy) and separately for subjects without high risk features (treated with enucleation alone). Survival data will be formally reviewed separately for subjects with and without high risk features for which adjuvant therapy is indicated, using the Lan-DeMets implementation of group sequential boundaries.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 - Toxicities associated with the adjuvant therapy for patients with high risk features will be descriptively summarized. The prevalence of well-defined, histopathologic features of interest will be summarized with descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals for proportions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide to see how well they
      work compared to observation only in treating patients who have undergone surgery for newly
      diagnosed retinoblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, carboplatin, and
      etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. Sometimes, after surgery,
      no additional treatment is needed for the tumor until it progresses. In this case,
      observation may be sufficient.</summary>
