    <concealment>The researcher conducted daily screening of all eligible geriatric patients admitted to the ward during the study period. A total of 90 subjects who fulfilled the criteria were recruited. After informed consent was obtained and family members or caregivers were notified, patients were randomized by block randomization (1:1) and random number table placed in one of the two arms. The intervention group received oral care with chlorhexidine while the control group received routine oral care with thymol. 
Both solutions were provided by hospital pharmacy. In order to maintain concealment of treatment, both solutions were similar in appearance in terms of bottle type and size, its amount, and color. They were labeled as A or B as a code key (A for Chlorhexidine and B for thymol gargle). 
The nurses who performed oral care procedure were blinded to the code key. This is a double blind study where the patients, nurses, and medical laboratory technicians were not exposed to the code key. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>The researcher developed a list of numbers from 1 to 300; from there total 90 samples were randomly chosen through a random number table which was generated by Stattrek Random Number Generator. Participants with number from column one received bottle 'A' consisting of chlorhexidine mouthwash while participants with numbers from column two received bottle 'B' consisting of thymol gargle. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for the study was calculated using the formula by Sakpal (2010). The mean difference 0.5 with standard deviation of 0.71 was calculated based on the results of previous studies done by Clavero, Baca, Junco, &amp; Paloma (2003). In order to reduce the risk of committing type II error due to insufficient sample size and statistical power, the researcher fixed the power at 0.80 and alpha value of 0.05. To anticipate the potential attritions of subjects during the course of study, additional 10% of the samples were recruited. Thus, the total sample size was 90 (45 in each group). 
Demographic, clinical and microbiology data was examined using Chi Square and Independent t-test. Chi Square was used to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine. Repeated measured ANOVA was used to test the oral health condition in both groups. The statistical significant was set at 0.05.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A double blinded parallel randomized controlled trial was carried out. The intervention group received oral care with chlorhexidine whereas the control group received routine oral care (with thymol). Oral care was performed by nurses with assigned solutions once daily with 20 ml assigned solution per procedure for 7 days. Oral cavity assessment using Brief Oral Health Status Examination (BOHSE) form was performed before procedure day 1 to day 7. Data on medication received and the development of aspiration pneumonia was taken. Specimen for oral swab for colonization was taken on day 7.
The final sample consisted of 35 (control) and 42 patients (intervention) subjects. CHX was effective in reducing oral colonization compared to routine oral care with thymol (p&lt;0.001).Thymol group had nearly 3 times higher risk of oral bacterial colonization compared to the CHX group.
