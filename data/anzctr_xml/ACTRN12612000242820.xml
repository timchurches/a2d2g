    <interventions>The purpose of this study is to determine the best type of exercise for people with heart conditions.  

This intervention will include either Eccentric Exercise Training of the lower limb muscles, Conventional Resistance Exercise Training of the lower limb muscles, or no training (control group).  Participants will be randomly assigned into one of these three groups.

The exercise programs will consist of 30 minutes of exercise 3 days per week for a period of 12 weeks and will be conducted in small classes of participants.  The exercise will consist of localized calf muscle exercises and will be  supervised by a trained exercise physiologist.

The Conventional Resistance Exercise training is similar to standard concentric calf raises. The the participant is asked to push against a footplate in a manner to move the plate away from the foot (similar to pressing a gas pedal).  In this exercise the muscles shorten as they are active.

The Eccentric Exercise Training involves resisting the footplate as it forces the ankle to dorsifles (opposite direction of movement to the Conventional Resistance Exercise). In this exercise the muscles lengthened as they are active.</interventions>

      <outcome>Exercise Capacity (Peak rate of oxygen consumption; VO2)

We will assess peak VO2 using a modified chronotropic assessment protocol in which stages are incremented by set and regular workloads. Heart rate and rhythm and
oxygen saturation will be measured continuously by 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) and pulse oximeter respectively.
Blood pressure, rating of perceived exertion (Borg Scale) and perceived dyspnoea (Borg Scale) will
be recorded during the final 30 seconds of each level. Indirect calorimetry will be measured employing a Vmax metabolic cart to establish VO2peak.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle Mechanical Work Capacity.  This outcome measure will be measured on an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex), whereby the participant will push as hard as possible (e.g. one repetition maximum) against an instrumented footplate throughout the ankle range of motion.  Recordings from the footplate will measure the torque and displacement of the ankle and will be used to calculate total mechanical work.  These measurements will be repeated 3-4 times with a minimum of two minutes rest between contractions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major health burden in Australia, with an estimated 300,000 patients affected. Our goal is to optimise approaches aimed at enhancing exercise capacity in these patients, which will directly translate to improved prognosis and morbidity in advanced CHF.
Our aims will be achieved by bringing together novel biomechanical and physiological approaches that have not previously been applied in the context of CHF in testing the following hypotheses:
1) The mechanical work capacity of skeletal muscle will be significantly lower in CHF patients, compared to age-matched controls.  This will be linked to sub-optimal in vivo mechanical properties of the muscle.  
2)  Eccentric exercise training (EET) will significantly increase a) the mechanical work capacity of the skeletal muscle and b) exercise capacity in CHF, relative to the impact of conventional exercise training approaches.
  
Significance:  Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of CHF and is associated with poor prognosis.The locus of physical limitations in CHF is typically in the periphery (skeletal muscle). However, traditional approaches to exercise rehabilitation in CHF have borrowed from ideas that work in healthy populations, in whom the limitations to performance differ from those relevant to CHF. Surprisingly, no studies have investigated the relevance of in vivo skeletal muscle mechanical characteristics in these patients.  Consequently, no exercise interventions have been applied which are specifically designed to ameliorate skeletal muscle biomechanical limitations in CHF.  We propose that eccentric training will significantly improve skeletal muscle mechanics and exercise capacity, compared to conventional exercise approaches. The findings from this study will help to optimise exercise prescription in CHF, directly benefiting CHF life expectancy and quality, and will encourage the widespread prescription of evidence-based exercise approaches for patients with CHF.</summary>
