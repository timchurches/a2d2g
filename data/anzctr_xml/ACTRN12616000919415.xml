  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following orthognathic surgery (corrective jaw surgery), patients are randomised into control group and exposure group.
The exposure group will be administered a Patient Controlled Analgesics (PCA) on top of their regular pain relief.
The patients in the PCA group will follow the PCA protocol of 100microgram of fentanyl per delivery with a lock out time of 5 minutes. The patient will be given a push button which is connected to the PCA machine. At each press of the button, the machine will deliver 100micrograms of fentanyl. with a lock out time of 5 minutes. This means that patient will receive 12 doses of 100 micrograms of fentanyl per hour. There are no limits on the dosing per day. 
The regular pain medications will be Paracetamol 1g every 6 hours, Ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours or Celebrex 100mg every 12 hours. These medications will be given as tablets.  
The PCA and oral pain relief will be administered until patient is discharged 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Following orthognathic surgery (corrective jaw surgery), patients are randomised into control group and exposure group.
The control group will only receive oral pain relief administered orally by the nursing staff.
This includes Paracetamol 1gram every 6 hourly, Ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hourly or Celebrex 100mg every 12 hours, Tramadol immediate release 100mg every 6 hours (with maximum of  400mg per 24hr) as required (PRN), and Oxynorm 5mg every 4 hours as requried (PRN).
These medications will be given until discharge. These patients will be discharged on Paracetamol 1g every 6 hours for 7 days, Ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours for 7 days and oxynorm 5mg every 4 hours for 3 days.</comparator>

      <outcome>Health economics - the cost of hospital stay for each patient, cost of using patient controlled analgesias. This will involve the review of medical records on how many days patient has stayed post surgery and the amount of patient controlled analgesics used during the post operative period. 
The analysis required for the health economics will involve cost-minimization analysis, costbenefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to show whether if there is a difference in the length of hospital stay and effect on health economics for patients who are using patient controlled analgesics (PCA) compared to those patients who are on conventional oral or intravenous pain relief administered by nurse. 
The significance of this project is that, if there is a difference between the two groups, PCA and conventional pain relief group, this can help improve the cost of service to the patient. Reduced length of hospital stay means earlier discharge for the patients to their own environment for recovery and prevents nosocomial infections, this will also free up hospital bed for other patients and reduce the cost of administering PCA. 
The research question is whether there is a difference in the length of hospital stay for patients who are using PCA compared to conventional analgesics after orthognathic jaw surgery. 
Our hypothesis is that, those patients who are on PCA will have prolonged hospital stay compared to those who are on conventional oral or intravenous analgesics. </summary>

    <publicnotes>Orthognathic surgery (jaw corrective surgery) is carried out for patients who have jaw (maxilla and/or mandible) size/length/width or relationship discrepancy or masticatory function problem or obstructive sleep apnoea. These patients require orthodontic treatment combined with Orthognathic surgery that could involve one jaw or both jaws. In most cases post operative pain is controlled with routine regular simple analgesics orally. However there are cases where patient would be prescribed with patient controlled analgesics, that are self-administered morphine or fentanyl via a pump, controlled by patient with a lockout time. Clinical observations showed that when patients are prescribed the PCA, it increased the length of hospital stay due to prolonged immobility and side effects from the use of PCA medication such as nausea, vomiting and decreased sensorium and also the use of indwelling catheter which also delays the discharge of patient from the hospital.

This project is to compare the length of hospital stay for patients using PCA versus conventional analgesics and the effectiveness of pain control during the recovery period, side effects and impact on health economics for those patients who are on PCA versus those on conventional analgesics (oral or iv administered by nurse). The oral analgesics will be of same action and class as the intravenous pain relief given in the PCA pump, therefore the practice of pain relief remains the same but via a different route of administration.</publicnotes>
