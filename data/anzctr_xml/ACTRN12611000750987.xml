  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic use prior to cystoscopy in outpatients in decreasing the incidence of postprocedure urinary tract infection.
Urinary tract infection will be assessed by clinical assessment (asking for lower urinary tract symptoms) and by urine culture taking 3 -5 days after cystoscopy, both of them positive. It will be assessed as a categorical variable yes or no (positive or negative).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum ten days after randomization. 
While reviewing literature we found that outcomes were assessed during these first ten days, it?s arbitrary but after this day one can find that any etiology other than the procedure can cause a urinary tract infection.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the incidence of postprocedure asymptomatic bacteriuria in both groups.

Asymptomatic bateriuria will be assessed by clinical assessment (asking for lower urinary tract symptoms) and by urine culture taking 3 -5 days after cystoscopy.
Urine culture will be negative and symptoms will be positive .   It?ll be assessed as a categorical variable yes or no (positive or negative).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum ten days after randomization.
While reviewing literature we found that outcomes were assessed during these first ten days, it?s arbitrary but after this day one can find that any etiology other than the procedure can cause a asymptomatic bacteriuria.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish the incidence of complications associated with the procedure.

Urinary retencion: Complete inhability to void. -- Clinical assessment.

Sepsis: UTI plus systemic inflammatory response signs -- Clinical assessment.

Hematuria: Bleeding in urine (including clots) -- Clinical assessment

Bladder perforation: Presence of a perforation in the bladder during the procedure -- Clinical asessment

Hospitalizacion: Requirement to act as inpatient for bladder perforation, sepsis, hematuria or other.</outcome>
      <timepoint>maximum ten days after randomization.
While reviewing literature we found that outcomes were assessed during these first ten days, it?s arbitrary but after this day one can find that any etiology other than the procedure can cause a complication.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To Identify adverse effects presented by the drug administered.

Nausea: Feeling like vomiting -- Clinical assessment

Emesis: Output of food from mouth --- clinical assessment

Diarrhea: Loose stools with increased frequency  --- clinical assessment.

Headache: Pain in the head. --- Clinical assessment

Delirium: False belief not supported by your social group belonging.  Idea firmly held and not be corrected by the logic. ---- Clinical assessment

Hallucinations: Perception that does not correspond to any external physical stimulus --- Clinical assessment

Seizures: Generalized tonic and clonic movements or targeted with or without loss of consciousness --- clinical assessment

Exanthema: Changes in erythematous, scaly skin --- Clinical assessment

pruritus: Itching in the patient's body --- Clinical assessment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum ten days after randomization.
While reviewing literature we found that outcomes were assessed during these first ten days, it?s arbitrary but after this day one can find that any etiology other than the tablet can cause a reaction.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To Identify microorganisms involved in urinary tract infection postprocedure and antibiotic sensitivity pattern.
Assessed by urine culture 3 -5  days after cystoscopy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum ten days after randomization (It?s evaluated 3 to 5 days after cystoscopy but if patient has any trouble to take the test we can wait up to 10 days)
While reviewing literature we found that outcomes were assessed during these first ten days, it?s arbitrary but after this day one can find that any etiology other than the procedure can cause a urinary tract infection or asymptomatic bacteriuria.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>For the assignment of each patient in the experimental group or control group in the study it is  conducted a stratified randomization.
 In the allocation of treatment once the patient is included in the study, sealed envelopes will contain the respective code generated randomization in blocks and will open in consecutive order in the order of arrival of patients at each center.  The envelope will only be opened once the patient signs informed consent.  In sealed boxes marked with the appropriate drug code on the outside, were stored the drug or placebo to be administered, both in the same presentation and same number of tablets.  Medications will be administered by a nursing assistant in each school and as the treating physician, blinded to the intervention will be offered to the patient. 
 The placebo will be conducted by an external laboratory in tablets of identical presentation to Levofloxacin 500 mg.</concealment>
    <sequence>In each of the centers perform randomization by permuted blocks of variable size to ensure a similar number of patients in each group.  
The generation of the sequence will be done by computer for each site independently by a person outside the research group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There will be a double-blind controlled clinical trial Multicentre, with the aim of providing critical information for making decisions regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who undergo outpatient cystoscopy.  It makes the next project is to determine for 2011, the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with sterile urine, will be to establish the incidence of urinary tract infection in each group as the primary outcome variable and determine the possible complications and effects adverse experimental therapy.  Will take care of the proper use of the principles of medical ethics such as: justice, beneficence and respect.</summary>
