    <scientifictitle>A study evaluating the efficacy and safety of artemether lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum infections in  4 sites in India Annuppur district, Madhya Pradesh, Jhabua district, Madhya Pradesh, Bastar district, Chhattisgarh and Palamudistrict, Jharkhand</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Artemether-lumefantrine will be administered according to body weight, twice a day over 3 days, as per WHO recommended dose (WHO guidelines). Tablets containing 20mg base of artemether and 120 mg base of lumefantrine will be administered orally. The number of tablets administered is based on the weight of the patient, twice a day, over three days  1 tablet for patients of  5-14kg, 2 for patients of  15-24kg, 3 for patients of  25-34kg, 4 over 34kg. All antimalarial drug(s) must be stored in a cool dry environment.

All doses of medicine will be administered under the supervision of a qualified member of the staff designated by the principal investigator. The study patients will be observed for 30 min after medicine administration for adverse reactions or vomiting. Any patient who vomits during this observation period will be re-treated with the same dose of medicine and observed for an additional 30 min. If the patient vomits again, he or she will be withdrawn and offered rescue therapy. The therapeutic efficacy study will be carried out in the field clinic and 3-day treatment will be given at field clinic or their home by visiting each day for 3 days as in most malarious places public transport system is not available. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study end-point is the classification assigned to a patient. Valid study end-points include: treatment failure, completion of the follow-up period without treatment failure (adequate clinical and parasitological response), loss to follow-up, withdrawal from study, and protocol violation. At all times, the well-being of the patient will take priority over his or her continuation in the study.  Treatment outcomes will be classified on the basis of an assessment of the parasitological and clinical outcome of antimalarial treatment according to the latest WHO guidelines.  Thus, all patients will be classified as having early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A standard physical examination will be performed at baseline (day 0 before dosing) and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. A complete medical history, including prior and concomitant medication, demographic information and contact details will be recorded at baseline.</timepoint>
