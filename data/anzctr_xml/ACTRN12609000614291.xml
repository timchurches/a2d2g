    <studytitle>Epidural Pethidine after Caesarean Section.  A pilot study of initiation of lactation, plasma and milk levels of pethidine and norpethidine and the behaviour of breast-fed infants.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In women undergoing caesarean section with post-operative patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) with pethidine and their infants, is the initiation and establishment of lactation and breastfeeding behaviour comparable to those who have not received pethidine PCEA after caesarean section and to those who had vaginal delivery.</scientifictitle>
