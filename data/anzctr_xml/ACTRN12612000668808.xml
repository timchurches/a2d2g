  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Healthy eating and regular physical activity are important for maintaining an appropriate body weight in adolescents and prevention of chronic disease later in life.  Whilst some information is available on the food choices and physical activity patterns of New Zealand adoescents, there is currently a lack of data on the factors that may influence these patterns. Food choice and physical activity may be influenced by social factors such as personal beliefs, attitudes of friends and family and environmental factors such as access to and availability of healthy foods or activity spaces. Therefore the purpose of this project is to conduct an in-depth investigation of physical activity habits and food choices in Otago adolescents and the factors that influence these.</summary>
