  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ranibizumab injection is a prescription medicine for the treatment of patients with neovascular (wet) AMD with satisfactory results, our clinical observation is that once the eye enter wet AMD it will never regain best corrected visual acuity like before the disease process so if we can use ranibizumab injection as a prophylactic in the sound eye in patient suffering from manifestations of Wet AMD in the other eye, it will be a good achievement.
Ranibizumab is injected intravitreally with a dose of 6 mg/mL LUCENTIS (0.3 mg dose vial).injection applied 3 times (one every six months). the follow up for two years.
The progression of the disease is monitored with two investigations
1- fluorescine angiography.
2- optical coherence tomography</interventions>
    <comparator>The other eye of patient with wet AMD will undergo follow up for two years without treatment.

    <concealment>134 patients with Wet AMD in one eye and nearly normal other eye will be included in the study.
67 patients will receive intravitreal Ranibizumab in the better eye as prophylactic to prevent wet AMD while the other 67 patients will be followed without intervention.

    <statisticalmethods>SAMPLE SIZE
The sample size will be calculated according to the following equation:  
n=(p1q1)+ (p2q2) Ã— F(alpha,power)
     (p2-p1) 

  
f = the value of (alpha, power) for a two-tailed test = 3.8 at significant level of 0.05  
p1 = rate in group 1 = 5% 
q1 = 1  p1; 
p2 = rate in group 2 = 15% 
q2 = 1  p2;
n (sample size) = 67 in each group; total sample = 134 subjects. 
Collected data will coded, entered and analyzed using Microsoft Excel software. Data will then imported into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 16.0) software for analysis. Baseline characteristics of the study population will presented as frequencies and percentages (%) in qualitative data or mean values and standard deviations (SD) in quantitative data. Differences between frequencies will compared by Chi-square. Differences between means were compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. P-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Pearson correlation coefficient test will used to evaluate the correlations between the studied variables. Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) test was performed for repeated measures.</statisticalmethods>
