  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness and visual loss in the developed
      world. It is a condition where long term exposure to high eye pressures (intra-ocular
      pressure) damages the nerve fibres in the eye. This damage can be seen by examiners as
      changes in the optic nerve. The exact mechanism of how the high intra-ocular pressure causes
      nerve damage is unknown. Both physiological and mechanical mechanisms are thought to play a
      role. Previous authors have reported structural changes in the connective tissue of optic
      nerves of eyes with glaucoma. Structural changes in the optic nerve head which affect the
      mechanical compliance of the nerve may be significant in the cause of glaucomatous nerve
      damage. This study aims to assess the compliance of the optic disc in subjects with and
      without glaucoma. We would test compliance by imaging the optic discs of participants before
      and during a brief (less than two minutes) increase in intra-ocular pressure. We would aim to
      repeat the tests on the same subjects 3 years later to see how compliance changed. We would
      also seek to correlate other important parameters such as corneal thickness and visual field
      changes with our findings</summary>
