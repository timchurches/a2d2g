  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves a 6-8 week online mindfulness-based resilience program for emergency workers. The intervention will be delivered via IPADs and comprises 6 interactive online modules running for about 20 minutes each. Each week a new module will be made available online to participants. They will have the opportunity to opt-in for text-message reminders or email reminders to practice the skills in the program. The program will provide participants with quick access to a range of adaptive skills, which could enhance their ability to manage stress and cope with trauma more effectively. These core skills are derived from the principles underpinning a number of evidence based cognitive therapies including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Compassion focused Therapy (CFT) mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (mBCT) and Mindfulness based Stress Reduction (MBSR). Adherence to the program will be assessed by the sum total number of sessions completed by each participant. This information will be collected by the backend IT programming system.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will involve providing control participants with online information regarding psychological health and well-being. This information will be delivered via IPAD. 
Access to this resource is unlimited for the study duration.  The online information will included basic mental health information on the following topics :

what is psychological health and well-being
Tips on looking after your psychological well-being
What is stress 
Where to get more information
Who can help you to improve your psychological health and well-being

    <concealment>24 Fire stations will be randomly allocated to either an Intervention Group or Control Group. Allocation will not be concealed.   Firefighters in each of the 24 station will be notified  about the Resilience Program study in a brief introduction letter that will be circulated via email 3 weeks prior to recruitment.  The letter will also invite participants to attend an information presentation about the program and the study which will be delivered by the Station's Peer Support Officer. The letter will stipulate that attendance at this introductory presentation and participation in the study is completely voluntary.     The Peer Support System within the NSW Fire and Rescue is a successful and long running non-hierarchical support service for firefighters. During the presentation, the PEER support officer will reiterate that participation in the research is voluntary.  Following this introductory presentation, male and female firefighters within the station will be given the opportunity to opt-in to participating in the study.  Those firefighters who opt-in to participating in the study will then be provided with the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form. The Participant Information  Sheet will outline the aims of the study and will highlight  that participation in the research study is entirely voluntary and that they will be able to receive the training at a later date without participating in the evaluation. The information sheet will also highlight that withdrawal from the study is possible at any time and under no circumstances will it incur any consequences from management at NSW Fire and Rescue.   </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The statistical software package STATA was utilised to perform a power calculation in order to establish the number of participants required to achieve this study's objectives. 
The primary outcome of interest in this study is level of psychological resilience as measured by both the Connors-Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Previous research has reported baseline levels of resilience as measured by the CDRS in similar trials to be 67.7 out of 100 with an increase of about 1 standard deviation (10 points) observed with resilience interventions (Steinhardt &amp; Dolbier, 2008). Any increase in resilience of greater than 0.5 standard deviation in the intervention group would be considered a meaningful and clinically important effect. As the intervention is being delivered in fire stations, the potential clustering of resilience/psychological factors within fire stations needs to be accounted for in the power calculations. Pilot data collection has shown that we should be able to recruit at least 6 firefighters from each station will agree to be part of this study. Based on an average of 67.7 on the CDRS resilience scale and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, a total of 24 fire stations (clusters) including 144 firefighters would need to be recruited to this study to achieve 0.8 power of detecting a 5 point (0.5 standard deviation) improvement in the Connors-Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS)with an alpha of 0.05 (two sided).

The statistical analysis for this project will be conducted using the statistical software package STATA. The RCT data will be analysed using both intention to treat analysis (ITT) and per protocol analysis. The primary outcome in both analyses will be a comparison of the resilience levels between the intervention group and the control.  The per protocol analysis will also be contacted to examine the effect of completing different amounts of the intervention program.

    <summary>BACKGROUND
It is well established that emergency workers have increased rates of psychiatric morbidity, which is presumed to be related to their regular exposure to potentially traumatic events. However, to date there is very limited information regarding what strategies may enhance psychological resilience among emergency workers. The RAW program has been developed in close consultation with the emergency services, meaning the findings of the evaluation study are likely to have direct translational benefits.   It is anticipated that an engaging and interactive online program will help address the issue of accessibility and delivery that NSW Fire and Rescue faces in terms of offering psychological training and support to their workers.   This program differs markedly from the first generation of online therapy programs, which have typically involved the reproduction of cognitive therapy manuals into an online format.  Rather than sifting through wordy paragraphs on a website, the RAW Mind program will involve the worker in a highly interactive process of learning by utilising a combination of video vignettes, interactive exercises, audio and animation. To ensure the training is memorable, it will be delivered in a series of six short, attention-grabbing segments, running no longer than 20 minutes. The program will provide firefighters with quick access to a range of adaptive skills, which could enhance their ability to manage stress and cope with trauma more effectively. These core skills are derived from the principles underpinning a number of evidence based cognitive therapies including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy (mBCT) and Mindfulness based Stress Reduction (MBSR). 

Aims and Objectives
The proposed study seeks to examine the effectiveness of a new online mindfulness-based resilience program for emergency workers. Specifically, it will examine whether a combined program of mindfulness training, evidence-based cognitive therapy skills and psychoeducation will increase overall psychological resilience and well-being of emergency workers. 

Hypotheses:  The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the RAW Mindfulness Program to test the following hypotheses: 

1. There will be no difference between the intervention and the control group at the point of baseline
2. At baseline, participants with greater mindfulness scores will have higher resilience and bounce-back resilience scores 
3. Post training, the intervention group will report higher levels of resilience, bounce-back resilience, and well-being and lower levels of psychological symptoms and maladaptive coping strategies.  
4. These differences will be maintained at 6 month follow up 

If all of the above hypotheses are confirm, this would provide substantial evidence that combined mindfulness training, cognitive therapy skills and psychoeducation is not only useful in terms of building psychological resilience but is also capable of changing firefighters ability to cope and manage stress in an effective and positive way.  This project will represent the first ever published RCT of resilience training amongst emergency workers.  This resilience program, has been developed in close consultation with the FRNSW, meaning the findings of the evaluation program are likely to have direct translational benefits in terms of informing future prevention programs for emergency services personnel.
