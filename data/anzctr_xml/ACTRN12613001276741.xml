  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three groups of patients with Parkinson's Disease of grades 1-3 according to Hoehn and Yahr staging system (51 patients in each group) who have not been or are not on any formulation of levodopa will randomly receive daily oral L-tyrosin 500 or 3000 mg plus other elements including 50 mg (in cases on 500 mg L-tyrosin) or 300 mg (in cases on 3000 mg L-tyrosin) 5-hydroxytriptophan (5-HTP), 500 mg cysteine, 1.5 mg pyrodoxine and 0.05 mg selenium (Dr Daniel capsule) in the intervention groups; or oral placebo (glucose) in the control group for 6 consecutive weeks. 
Exercise and diet profiles will be similar during the study period in all three groups.
Adherence interventions will include weekly instruction in forms of oral and written material. 
Adherence to taking medication will be monitored by drug capsule return weekly.

</interventions>
    <comparator>All the patients will continue their previous treatment(s) such as those against Parkinson' disease or depression. Patients in the control group will receive oral placebos (capsules identical to those with medication in the intervention groups, containing
only glucose) once daily for 6 consecutive weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dopamin is the mainstay in treatment of Parkinson's Disease. L-Dopa containing medications have been long used in these patients. However, there are multiple, major complications associated with these medications. Although the main mechanism is not known, it has been suggested that imbalance between dopamine and serotonin may cause this. In this study, for the first time, we are going to test concomitant use of dopamine and serotonin precursors (tyrosine and 5-HTP, respectively) in these patients. </summary>
