    <interventions>Introduction of a 'code sepsis' at first presentation to ED triage at Alice Springs Emergency Department.
A triage nurse trained and experienced in the use of the Australian Triage Score and qSOFA (quick sequential organ function assessment) will assess the likelihood of an infection being present and measure the parameters in qSOFA. If the patient has a clinical suspicion of infection and scores 1 or more on qSOFA a sepsis page will alert a medical officer.
qSOFA is a bedside clinical score calculated using physiological parameters (blood pressure, respiratory rate) and clinical assessment of conscious level to provide a risk assessment of the likelihood of having or developing severe sepsis and septic shock.
Block quasi-randomisation will be used on a week on week off basis with group one having clinical assessment (90% centile within 10minutes) and group two a clinical assessment (90% centile within 10minutes) and point of care lactate (serum blood test performed on analyser within the Emergency Department 90% centile within 10minutes from the time of triage).
End points measured will be antibiotic rates, time to antibiotics and validation of the sensitivity of qSOFA with and without the addition of point of care lactate in a remote and mainly Indigenous ED population
length of stay, rates and timing of ICU admission and mortality will be reported but this study is not expected to be powered sufficiently to detect a significant difference in these parameters
Adherence to the protocol will be monitored and updates and education as well as recruitment figures supplied to triage and medical staff at weekly education meetings</interventions>
    <comparator>Retrospective case note review will be used to validate qSOFA in the population presenting to Alice Springs emergency department as well as compare historical times to antibiotics. Comparison will also be made with other commonly used sepsis scoring systems (SIRS, LODS) and the locally developed early warning score to be used in Remote health nurse led clinics in Central Australia; Remote Early Warning Score (REWS)
The historical control group will be identified by case note review of patients presented with suspected sepsis between January 2016 and December 2016 inclusive.
SIRS/LODS and REWS for the intervention group participants will be calculated from retrospective case notes review by the investigators, not calculated at the time of triage to reduce the workload burden on the triage staff</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>To show reduction in the time to antibiotics to below 1hr from the current median of &gt;2hrs (case note review) in the block randomised prospective component of the study at alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 we require 63 patients in each group
To show an increase of antibiotic use within 1 hour (evidence of clinician suspicion of sepsis) of 10% following a raised point of care lactate result with alpha of 0.05, beta of 0.2, q1 and 2 of 0.5 each and effect size of 0.2 we require 393 patients in each group assuming a positive lactate rate of 40% in patients with +ve qSOFA (case note review)
 Statistical analysis of the block randomised groups to assess the change in time to antibiotics and lactate effect will be using Student's two-tailed t test
Validation and comparison of qSOFA/SIRS?LODS REWS will use area under the receiver operating curve</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to validate the sepsis-3 quick Sequential Organ Dysfunction Assessment (qSOFA) score in a remote ED population and setting, it will be compared retrospectively by case note review against the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Remote Early Warning Score (REWS) and Medical Emergency Warning Score (MEWS) for rates of Intensive Care Unit/High Dependency Unit (ICU/HDU) admission and in-hospital mortality.
A prospective introduction of the qSOFA score with and without point of care lactate as an early warning tool at the first point of contact with ASH ED triage and its use as an alert for early senior medical staff involvement, will attempt identify the most efficient way to shorten the time to treatment of patients with severe infections.
