  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the treatment groups will complete 5 lessons in 8 weeks of a guided program for OCD. The internet group will complete these lessons online, the bibliotherapy group will complete these lessons from a hard copy self help workbook. Both groups receive the same information. The lessons for both groups take approximately 30 minutes to read through, with homework exercises taking a further hour per day. The lessons are based on current best practice cognitive and behavioural techniques and include exposure and response prevention, and cognitive techniques. The participant is phoned twice weekly by a clinical psychologist (these days are determined by the participant) and may also be contacted at other times by the participant by email or phone. A printable information summary will also be provided, and some homework assignments will be set</interventions>
    <comparator>The waitlist control group receive their choice of the two methods of administration (Internet or Bibliotherapy) with weekly contact from a clinical psychologist once the other groups have completed the program (week 9).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an internet guided education program for OCD and a guided bibliotherapy education program for OCD compared to waitlist control. It is hypothesized that: 1. Participants in the Internet Group will obtain results at least equivalent to those obtained in the recent pilot study (ACTRN12610000687099), and superior to those in the Waitlist Group. 2. Participants in the Bibliotherapy Group will obtain improvements significantly greater than those in the Waitlist Group. 3. There will be no difference in outcome between the two active groups 4. Both active treatment groups will find the treatment acceptable.</summary>
