  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine objective tumour response rate (RR) (partial or complete response as defined by RECIST criteria version 1.1).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the rate of progression free survival (PFS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Progression free survival (PFS) will be measured from date of patient randomisation to the date of first evidence of disease progression, the occurrence of new disease or death from any cause.  In patients who received treatment on study without a progression date or death, the PFS will be censored on the date of last clinical assessment, tumour assessment or enrolment, whichever is the later event.   Disease progression is defined according to the RECIST version 1.1 criteria. The time point for PFS is 6 months after the last patient has been enrolled</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine overall survival (OS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known follow-up alive. The time point for OS is 3 years after the last patient has stopped treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine safety</outcome>
      <timepoint>The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03) will be used to classify and grade the intensity of adverse events after each treatment cycle.  This outcome may be assessed until 30 days +/- 7 days after the last dose of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess quality of life (QoL) using the EORTC QLQ C30 and QLQ-GINET21 questionnaires.</outcome>

    <summary> The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel in comparison with carboplatin plus etoposide chemotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with advanced and/or metastatic, unresectable gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). 
Study details All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel or carboplatin plus etoposide. Participants receiving carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel will be required to visit the study site once per week, for weekly administration of nab-paclitaxel plus adminstration of carboplatin once every three weeks. Participants receiving carboplatin plus etoposide will be required to visit the study site for three consecutive days every three weeks for administration of etoposide plus adminstration of carboplatin once every three weeks. Treatment will continue for all participants until disease progression or until side effects become unmanageable. All participants will be reviewed for side effects, outcomes of survival and cancer progression. Blood and tissue samples will also be taken, as well as specialised scans, to identify markers of prognosis and response. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will identify which treatment is the most promising, for further investigation to be undertaken to guide best practice.
