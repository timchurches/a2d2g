  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves the appointment of a trained physical educator whom we refer to as a Physical Literacy Facilitator. The facilitator will use a socio-ecological framework approach to improve physical activity levels and physical literacy at the child (participant) level by targeting barriers at the teacher, school, family, and community level. Barriers to physical activity and physical literacy will be identified using surveys and questionnaires completed at the start of the study.
The facilitator will be assigned to a cluster of approximately 6-10 geographically linked schools on a full-time working basis for the 10 month study period.
Examples of day to day activities of the Physical Literacy Facilitator will include:
1) Teacher level: providing assistance, resources, support and professional development for generalist classroom teachers to improve the planning, quality and delivery of physical education classes.
2) Family level: Encouraging parents (through educational materials) to provide more opportunities and support for their child to by physically active
3) School level: assisting schools to develop and/or improve their school physical activity policy
4) Community level: encouraging sports clubs to receive new participants and facilitating community role models to visit schools to promote physical activity.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored using school and teacher attendance records.

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Quasi-randomization is limited to the level of schools. Of 16 schools in the western and north-western suburbs of Melbourne, principals and teachers of each school are invited to participate through meetings and discussion of the design, and provided with information sheets. Grade 5 children make up the sample of the school population to be tested before and after the intervention. Parents and guardians are provided with information sheets and consent forms signed prior to beginning the trial. Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was "off site".</concealment>
    <sequence>A cross tabulation method will be used to determine which schools are quasi-randomly allocated to the intervention and control schools; as a pure random selection may introduce inadvertent bias. Variables considered are: School Size (&gt;300 or &lt; 300); specialist PE resident teacher or not; ethnicity (&lt;30% or &gt;30% ethnic backgrounds.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Schools in the study are separated geographically to such and extent that teachers and students are not likely to collaborate and share ideas;  
All schools in the geographical area have include children from families of non English speaking ethnicity, mainly from middle-eastern countries.  
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Our model fits within the general framework of general linear mixed model; similar to the model associated with  publications concerning our previous quasi-randomized control trial, the LOOK (Lifestyle of our Kids) Project (search Telford RD for papers)
The design structure involves three levels: Level 1 is the School; Level 2 is the Child within school; Level 3 involves the repeat observations (i.e. longitudinal observations) on a child. 
Consider the variable MVPA (Moderate and Vigorous Physical Activity)as an example of a response variable of interest
MVPA  = constant + Group effect+ SES effect + + school random effect + Sex effect + Sex.Group interaction +child random effect + Year effect + Sex.Year effect + Group.Year effect + possible interactions between fixed effects + within-child random error
Group in the intervention or control group
The Group.Year effect is the effect of the intervention
Restricted maximum likelihood is used to estimate variance components and weighted least squares for estimating fixed effects. Statistical significance of effects is assessed by calculating adjusted Wald statistics.  General model checking procedures will be routinely used to identify aberrant data and to check the model assumptions. 

With regard to sample size calculations and statistical assumptions, Professor Ross Cunningham (research team member and statistical consultant) makes the following comments: 1) It is not possible to undertake a formal power analysis with sufficient precision for the current study 2) Statistical knowledge gained from the LOOK study indicates that 16 schools will ensure internal validity of the design i.e. there is sufficient information to estimate the 'experimental' error and intervention and control effects with adequate precision 3) At least 20 children in each school is needed to estimate school effects with high precision. Window of opportunity for testing at the start and the end of the year precludes greater numbers of schools and students.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective is to determine the effectiveness of a method of assisting classroom teachers to conduct physical education and sport in primary schools. 

We are testing the Physical Literacy (PL) Facilitator scheme which proposes to introduce a trained PE teacher into a group of 8 schools.

Roles of the Physical Literacy Facilitator include:

1) In-class professional development for the generalist classroom teacher. He or she provides teachers with new and innovative classroom teacher-friendly lesson plans, designed to be consistent with the new Physical Education National Curriculum guidelines. 
2) Promote cooperation between school sport and community sport/active recreation groups by introducing children and parents to sporting groups and other clubs and physical activities, including after-school programs 
3) Education of junior sport coach through local media and discussion groups.  
4) Identify children with special barriers to developing sufficient physical literacy (e.g. obesity, postural problems, and motor coordination disorders) and contact parents to discuss options to overcome the barriers.
5) Encourage and facilitate engagement (and increased physical activity) in the school environment (at recesses, before and after school)</summary>

    <publicnotes>This trial is a collaboration between the Victorian DEECD and University of Canberra, and School Governance Australia and the Clinical Trials Unit of The Canberra Hospital. The ongoing Lifestyle of our kids (LOOK) study has been an underlying motivation influence, given its findings that children who do not receive specialist physical education and sport are likely to have increased incidence of risk factors for metabolic dysfunction, as well as inferior progression in classroom academic work.
