  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Omega-3s in fish oil are important for brain function and Australian children are not consuming enough in their diet. The purpose of this study is to give primary school children fish oil capsules or placebo capsules to determine whether the fish oil capsules assist them with their learning and behaviour, specifically literacy, attention, cognitive development, and parent/teacher reports of learning and behaviour as well as quality of life.</summary>
