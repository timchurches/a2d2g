  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patient Matched Instrumentation - ie custom made cutting blocks in preparation for total knee replacement.
Patients undergoing a TKR using the Visionaire technology will have an MRI scan of their knee from which specific cutting blocks will be manufactured to match precisely the architecture of their knee.  These cutitng blocks are made from nylon material and are single use for that patient and disposed off after the procedure.  The aim of this study is to determine whether the surgical time is reduced along with confirming the accuracy of the technique in terms of overall alignment of the prosthesis.  we would expect surgical time to be similar if anything slightly shorter.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We aim to assess the overall alignment of the prosthesis between the group using standard intramedullary alignment systems and the second group using the patient specific instruments (Visionaire).  Post-op the patients will undergo a CT scan (Perth Protocol) in order to establish the position of the prosthesis in relation to the femur and tibia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>CT scan will be carried out as an inpatient post-op but timing of this is not relevant as we are assessing a static component position within the bone.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Expense</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessing the expense will involve looking at cost of sterilisation of instruments compared to patient specific instruments and also length of stay for patient in terms of bed days.  This process will be priced as operative costs and post-op care estimated after patient discharged.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Surgeon assesses patients in outpatient setting as to whether appropriate candidate for TKR. If so then patient and surgeon discuss whether they are happy to enter the trial.  Patient is then randomised using a random number schedule to receive either standard preparation technique or Visionaire technology.  This randomisation process will be carried out by a registrar off site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alignment of total knee replacement is of importance with regards to the length of survivorship.  Currently a rod is passed down the centre of both the tibia and the femur so as that the correct bone cuts are made in order the prosthesis fits the bone in the correct alignment.  New technology now exists that enables custom cutting blocks to be manufactured specifically for that individuals patients knee so as the bone cuts made are as accurate as possible.  This involves undergoing an MRI scan of the knee and from this the cutting blocks specific for the patients knee are made.
This new technology is used to aid in establishing the correct bone cuts in the tibia and femur and hence ultimately the overall alignment of the knee replacement.  The knee replacement used will be the same type in each group and the method of insertion will be the same.
Post-operatively both groups will undergo a CT scan of the knee in order to establish the precise alignment of the knee replacement in relation to bony landmarks.  From this we can establish whether or not there is any difference between the two different methods of bone preparation in the overall alignment of the knee replacement.</summary>
