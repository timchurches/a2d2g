    <interventions>This randomised crossover trial involves three single-day treatment conditions, each separated by a one-week wash out period
Intervention 1: One day (total duration=7 hours) of prolonged sitting with intermittent light-intensity activity breaks.  Participants will remain seated for the initial 140mins (steady-state) period, after which they will complete a 2 min bout of light-intensity walking activity on a treadmill (level, firm surface, slow pace - 3.2km/hr). Participants will then return to the seated position. The light-intensity walking breaks will be repeated on another 13 occasions every 20 mins during a 7 hour period (total walking time=28mins). 
Intervention 2: One day (total duration= 7 hours) of prolonged sitting with intermittent moderate-intensity activity breaks. Participants will remain seated for the initial 140mins (steady-state) period, after which they will complete a 2 min bout of moderate-intensity walking activity on a treadmill (level, firm surface, slow pace - 3.2km/hr). Participants will then return to the seated position. The moderate-intensity walking breaks will be repeated on another 13 occasions every 20 mins (total walking time=28mins).</interventions>

    <concealment>Interested volunteers will receive written information about the study in lay terms and a full description of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After obtaining informed consent and background information, the potential participants will be screened to confirm eligibility. Once a potential subject has been deemed eligible, the subject will be randomised to the order of experimental conditions. 
The method for allocation concealment is closed envelopes. The allocation information will be placed in numbered envelopes (1 allocation per envelope) by an independent researcher. After a subject has been enrolled in the study, the study co-ordinators will contact an independent staff member to ask for the sequence of experimental conditions. The independent staff member will keep a log of the date and time the envelope was opened, the envelope number, the initials and gender of the participant and the order of experimental conditions. The study co-ordinator will also keep a record of this information.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well known that being physically active is important for maintaining good health. However, new evidence has emerged showing that being sedentary (sitting for prolonged periods) is associated with indicators of poor health, such as elevated blood glucose and blood fats. Importantly, it appears that the effects of sedentary behaviour are independent of a persons physical activity level. This suggests that each should be looked upon as being separate behaviours, meaning that a person could engage in appropriate physical activity (30 minutes of daily activity), yet spend many hours for the rest of the day being sedentary, such as at an office desk. More recently, data from observational research (AusDiab) indicates people who break up their sitting time throughout the day with light-intensity activity (such as light walking) may have better blood glucose and blood fat levels than people who sit for prolonged periods without activity breaks. The implications of these findings are that lifestyle strategies to reduce the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease may need to also focus on reducing sedentary time through regular activity breaks, in addition to the promotion of regular physical activity. However, before such intervention strategies can be developed and tested, we need to understand the short-term effects of being sedentary (sitting) on blood glucose and blood fats within a well-designed experimental trial. Therefore, this study aims to examine the short-term effects of prolonged sitting with and without intermittent activity bouts.  The study will provide information that will assist in the design, implementation and evaluation of strategies that target reducing sedentary behaviour in older, overweight adults.</summary>
