  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions consist of administration of the following substances in a randomised, counterbalanced order at each testing session:

Arm 1: single oral dose of codeine 60mg (2 x 30mg tabs)
Arm 2: single oral dose of oxazepam 30mg
Arm 3: ethanol (target BAC=0.05g/100ml, dose=0.34g/kg) administered as a bolus oral dose to reach the target BAC (vodka mixed with orange juice in ratio of 1:3), followed by an intravenous infusion of 5% ethanol in 5% dextrose for the remainder of the study period to maintain the participant at a BAC of 0.05g/100ml.

Participants are required to attend a total of 8 testing sessions, in a random order, comprising of the following conditions:

Session 1 - Placebo IV infusion + placebo codeine tablet + placebo oxazepam tablet
Session 2 - Placebo IV infusion + 60mg codeine tablet + placebo oxazepam tablet
Session 3 - Placebo IV infusion + placebo codeine tablet + 30mg oxazepam tablet
Session 4 - Ethanol IV infusion (0.34g/kg) + placebo codeine tablet + placebo oxazepam tablet
Session 5 - Ethanol IV infusion (0.34g/kg) + 60mg codeine tablet + placebo oxazepam tablet
Session 6 - Ethanol IV infusion (0.34g/kg) + placebo codeine tablet + 30mg oxazepam tablet
Session 7 - Placebo IV infusion + 60mg codeine tablet + 30mg oxazepam tablet
Session 8 - Ethanol IV infusion (0.34g/kg) + 60mg codeine tablet + 30mg oxazepam tablet

A washout period of 72 hours between sessions is adopted in this study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo of the study medications will be administered in a blinded and randomised manner. The placebos are as follows:

Arm 1 placebo: two lactose tablet matched in appearance to the codeine tablets
Arm 2 placebo: single lactose tablet matched in appearance to the oxazepam tablet
Arm 3 placebo: bolus oral dose of orange juice with 5ml vodka floated on the surface for olfactory masking followed by an intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose solution for the remainder of the study period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Performances on an advanced driving simulator for each of the study intervention(s) combinations. Performance was measured on parameters of driving such as standard deviation of lateral lane position, mean travel speed, time-to-collision and traffic infringements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On each experimental day, measured prior to administration of any study intervention (baseline), and 2, 3 and 4 hours post administration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Performances on higher order cognitive tests for each of the study  intervention(s) combinations as measured by the OSPAT and CANTAB systems.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On each experimental day, measured prior to administration of any study intervention (baseline), and 2, 3 and 4 hours post administration.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the individual and combined effects of common prescription medicines, at therapeutic doses, on driving performance. It is hypothesised that, while the interventions alone may not cause impairment, the combined effect of the medications will have an additive effect on driving performance.</summary>
