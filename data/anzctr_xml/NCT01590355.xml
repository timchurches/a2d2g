  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: other - Radiotherapy
Treatment: surgery - Transoral Robotic Surgery + Neck Dissection

Active Comparator: Radiotherapy plus or minus Chemotherapy - Radiotherapy plus or minus chemotherapy with surgical treatment for salvage of persistent disease

Experimental: Transoral Robotic Surgery + Neck Dissection - Transoral robotic excision will be carried out using the da Vinci surgical robot. The spatula cautery will be used to remove the tumours with 1 cm margins. At the time of surgery circumferential margins will be taken and sent for frozen section analysis. The resection will proceed until negative margins are obtained if feasible.


Treatment: other: Radiotherapy
Gross Tumour and Nodes: 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks. High-risk nodal areas: 63 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks. Low-risk nodal areas: 56 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks

Treatment: surgery: Transoral Robotic Surgery + Neck Dissection
Transoral robotic excision will be carried out using the da Vinci surgical robot.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The historical standard treatment for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx
      is radiation therapy. Some patients require chemotherapy with the radiation, and some
      patients require surgery if the tumour or lymph nodes have not responded after radiation.

      This study will compare radiation therapy with a new surgical treatment called transoral
      robotic surgery (TORS). TORS is a new surgical approach using a robot to assist the surgeon
      in removing the tumour, potentially with fewer side effects than older surgical techniques.</summary>
