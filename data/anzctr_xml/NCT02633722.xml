  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a serious medical condition, the adverse consequences of which include increased
      risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, reduced fertility and cancer. The economic
      cost of obesity was placed at $58 billion dollars in Australia in 2008. Studies in mice and
      non-human primates have shown that moderate caloric restriction (CR) increases lifespan and
      reduces the incidence of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Reduced risk of
      chronic diseases is also observed in humans following CR. However, daily CR is difficult to
      maintain long term, since the body defends against weight loss by inducing "metabolic
      adaptation" and altering the hormonal appetite response. An emerging number of studies are
      examining the effects of limiting food intake to prescribed time periods per day, or every
      other day. Intermittent, or time restricted feeding describes a dieting approach where food
      is available ad libitum, however only for a limited period of time (i.e. 3-12 hours). This
      study will examine the effects of fasting for 15h/day and eating for 9-h per day on glycemic
      control and metabolic health. This study will build on the existing knowledge base in humans
      as to whether meal timing, rather than caloric restriction per se, is important to provide
      the stimulus required to improve metabolic health and reduce risk of chronic disease.
      Moreover, it will examine whether restricting feeding to later in the day is of lesser
      benefit to health.</summary>
