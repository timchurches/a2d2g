    <interventions>Biostimulation Low Intensity laser therapy (LILT) Scanner device (850 nm, 400 mW, 4 J/cm2)  on the cervical region for 10 minutes, once every other day for 12 sessions (4 weeks). in addition to traditional drug therapy for Multiple sclerosis (MS). 

 and

 Ultraviolet Radiation (UV)with a broad band Ultraviolet B class (UVB) device (280- 315 nm) will be used to deliver UV radiation on the whole back and neck regions from 50 cm distance and for 10 minutes, once every other day for 12 sessions (4 weeks). in addition to traditional drug therapy for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) .

The Range of broad band UVB wave length is (280- 315 nm), which is fixed range in all broad band UVB devices. as for the dose used in this study it would be determined according to the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) which is a pretreatment test for erythema caused by the exposure to ultraviolet radiation.  we would start with a dose equal to 50% of the MED- that would differ from one patient to another- then we would increase 10% of MED each successive session. As to keep the treatment dose at the sub-erythemal level for all patients.  

There will be 3 study groups :

1- Laser group
2- Ultraviolet (UV) group
3- Laser + UV group</interventions>
    <comparator>Randomized controlled  study, the control group would receive only the traditional Multiple sclerosis drug therapy (Immuno-supressant  drug [Steroid (Solu-medrol) 1 mg intravenous injection- once per month]) for the control of patients on remission stage of the disease, the drug would be used before the enrollment and after the end of our treatment program because of the chronic nature of the disease ( the duration of drug therapy is related to the disease course not related to the study time). they will be tested soon after allocation and retested twice (after one month and after another 3 months).</comparator>
