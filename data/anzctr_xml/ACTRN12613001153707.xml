  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 6-month community-based randomised controlled trial with a 6-month follow-up in which participants aged 65 years and over will participate in a progressive resistance training program and consume a protein enriched diet achieved through the consumption of lean red meat on 3 days per week, or a carbohydrate control diet. The exercise program will be an individually tailored and supervised community-based program in which participants will undertake progressive resistance training three times a week. Each session will last 45-60 minutes and target all major muscle groups. Participants will perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions at a weight that cannot be lifted for more than 8-12 repetitions. Training will be made progressively more challenging by incorporating the principle of progressive overload (increments of 2-10% weekly). All training will be supervised by accredited exercise trainers. Participants in the lean red meat group will consume approximately 160g (cooked) of lean red meat three days per week on each training day while participants in the carbohydrate control group will consume at least half a cup of carbohydrates. Participants in both groups take one 1000 IU vitamin D3 capsule daily for the duration of the study. Exercise logs and completed exercise cards will be regularly checked by the trainers and will be used to monitor exercise adherence. Adherence to the lean red meat and carbohydrate diets will be monitored using a daily food calendars and compliance to the supplements will be monitored by a capsule count from bottles returned at 6 months. At the completion of the 6-month intervention, a follow-up assessment will be conducted 3 and 6 months post-intervention completion to evaluate any long-term behavioural changes with regard to maintaining participation in exercise and/or continuing to follow the intervention diet.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the comparator group will also undertake the same progressive resistance training program  as those in the intervention group, but will consume a carbohydrate control diet.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded on the following criteria: 1) aged &lt;65 years; 2) current or prior participation in resistance exercise (&gt;1 week) and/or moderate-intensity physical activity greater than or equal to 150 minutes per week in the past 3 months; 3) acute or terminal illness, including current (treated or untreated) cancer or surgery/cessation of chemotherapy/radiotherapy less than 12-months ago; 4) history of a recent low trauma fracture with functional impairment that would limit participation in the exercise program; 5) body mass index (BMI) &gt;40; 6) use of insulin to treat diabetes; 7) chronic liver disease, coeliac or inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis or Crohns disease; 8) recent use of corticosteroids (past 6 months); or 9) inability to commit to the study and its requirements. Participants will not be excluded if they were currently taking vitamin D supplements, but will be asked to take the vitamin D that was provided as part of the study.

Eligible participants will then be screened using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to evaluate whether they are cognitively healthy and have no signs of depression. Those with a score of greater than two on the SPMSQ and/or a score of greater than six on the GDS will be excluded from the study. Participants that remained eligible will then be required to obtain approval from their local doctor to clear them of any contraindicated medical conditions to exercise, based upon American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines, to participate in the program. Finally, participants will be asked to provide a fasted, morning blood sample to confirm that their estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) was &gt;45 mL/min/1.73m2.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis using Stata (version 11). Wherever possible, we will obtain endpoint measures from all withdrawals and include all randomised participants in our final ITT analysis. Time, group and group-by-time interactions will be examined using generalised linear mixed models. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis will be used to investigate the associated between various demographic, hormonal and inflammatory markers and neural plasticity on changes in muscle health and cognitive function. Potential covariates to be included in the model will include: age, sex, changes in medication and change in habitual physical activity.

The number of participants required for this study is based on power calculations for the expected changes in total body lean mass and lower limb muscle strength and cognitive function. Based on our previous study in elderly women (Daly et al. unpublished), we estimate that 55 older adults in each group will provide approximately 80% power to detect a 0.5 kg difference for the change in total body lean mass and a 18% difference for the change in muscle strength between the red meat group and control groups with an alpha level of 0.05 and estimated SD of 0.8 kg. This calculation allows for a possible 20% drop-out or loss to follow-up. 

Since this will be the first study to have examined the effects of exercise combined with increased dietary protein on cognitive function, it is difficult to determine (or estimate) the magnitude of any effect from the intervention. Based on a number of previous trials, we estimated the effect size of increased protein on cognitive function to range from 0.5 to 1.1, which is considered to be a moderate to large effect. However, for our study we have used a conservative effect size of 0.4, which would equate to a 6-8% greater improvement in cognitive function (executive function) in the resistance training plus meat versus resistance training plus carbohydrate group. Please note that a larger effect may be observed but this is based on a conservative estimate. Based on this modest effect size, we estimate that with 76 participants per group (assuming a 20% attrition rate) we will have 80% power to detect the above differences after 6-months (152 participants in total) using an alpha level of less than 0.05 (two-tailed).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Age-related muscle wasting and a decline in cognitive function have both been implicated in the development and progression of many chronic diseases, including falls and dementia. Over the next 40 years it is estimated that nearly 25% of the Australian population will be aged over 65 years, and thus there is an urgent need to identify safe and effective strategies that can simultaneously optimise muscle and cognitive health and function in the elderly. Progressive resistance training is recommended as one approach that can improve muscle health in older adults, but there is a growing body of evidence indicating that the benefits of progressive resistance training may be dependent on adequate dietary protein. It has also been suggested that certain dietary factors, including dietary protein and vitamin D, along with exercise may improve cognitive health and function. Thus, this study aims to investigate whether lean red meat consumption three days per week when combined with progressive resistance training, can enhance both muscle and cognitive health and function in the elderly. We believe that the findings from this study will form the basis for more precise nutrition and exercise guidelines for the management and prevention of age-related changes in muscle health as well as cognitive and memory function in older people. </summary>
