  <interventions>
    <interventions>As part of the routine management patients diagnosed with mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma undergo wide local excision. The surgical margins are identified and labeled by the surgeon before the biopsy specimens are sent for routine histopathological analysis. The specimens that are reported to have all the margins free of tumour are enrolled in the study for Immunohistochemical analysis. The tumour free mucosal margins undergo further immunostaining with p53 and eIF4E. This study only involves the immunohistochemistry analysis using p53 and eIF4E.
The follow up period for each participant is minimum of 12 months for disease recurrence /progression</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size- The average number of patients at Darwin and Vellore are 20 and 70 per year respectively. Most patients present late and obtaining a tumour free margin is a challenge. We anticipate performing IHC on 30 to 40 patients.
The data on the surgical margins will be analysed statistically with SPSS software. Contingency table and the X2 test will be used to evaluate the association of e IF4E and p53 in the surgical margins with race, sex, stage, lymph node status, histological grade, post-operative radiation and e IF4E and p53 expression in the tumour and margins. A univariate analysis of clinical factors will be performed using Cox model to identify those variables significantly associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis will be performed to test for simultaneous effect of two or more factors. Event time distributions for recurrence will be estimated by Kaplan- Meier method and compared by the log rank test to determine the individual and combined effect of e IF4E and p53 expression in the margins. Similar curves will be performed to determine the effect of nodal status with e IF4E and p53 levels in the margins as nodal status is a significant prognostic factor in HNSCCs.
The consistency of protocol at both the sites will be assessed and the study will be periodically reviewed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of two antibodies, eIF4E and p53, in samples of tissue from the edge of surgically removed tumours in the head and neck may correspond with cancer progression and recurrence.
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with negative surgical margins on histopathology at the Royal Darwin Hospital or the Christian Medical College, Vellore (India). 
Study details:
All participants enrolled in this study will have tests carried out on tissue samples which were taken at the time of surgery, and which have already been shown to be tumour-free. These tests will assess for the presence of the two antibodies eIF4E and p53. Participants will then be followed-up for minimum of 12 months - end of study period by review of medical records, to see if any correlation exists between presence of the antibodies and cancer recurrence. It is hoped that the findings of this study may provide information on whether these antibodies may be used as a marker for prognosis in head and neck cancer patients at the time of surgery.
