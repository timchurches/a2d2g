  <interventions>
    <interventions>Diazoxide  5mg/kg/dose 8 hourly orally.
Treatment algorithm will be used to maintain treatment fidelity, with increases and decreases in glucose and medications based on blood glucose level (BGL)
Fluids or Diazoxide will be titrated down (by 1mg/kg) if BGL is 5.0mmol/L. 
Treatment will continue until Diazoxide is no longer required; OR if BGLs not maintained at 3.5 mmol/L or more in spite of maximal therapy; OR at 48 hours; OR at discretion of clinician (with reason to be documented). After this point, further management is at the discretion of the clinician and may involve increased concentration glucose infusion or use of glucagon.
Adherence with treatment algorithm will be monitored by investigators. The case notes of all enrolled patients will be screened for adherence by research nurse/investigators.</interventions>
    <comparator>Glucagon  10microgram/kg/hr continuous intravenous infusion. For up to 48 hours.
Glucagon will be titrated up to a maximum of 20microgram/kg/hr if blood glucose level is less than 3.5mmol/L. Glucagon will be titrated down (by half each time) if BGL is 5.0mmol/L or more.
Treatment algorithm will be used to maintain treatment fidelity, with increases and decreases in glucose and medications based on blood glucose level (BGL)
Treatment will continue until Glucagon is no longer required; OR if BGLs not maintained at 3.5 mmol/L or more in spite of maximal therapy; OR at 48 hours; OR at discretion of clinician (with reason to be documented). After this point, further management is at the discretion of the clinician and may involve increased concentration glucose infusion or use of diazoxide.

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis
Continuous data will be compared by Student s t test, or the Mann Whitney U test if the data are not normally distributed and cannot be converted to near normality by simple transformation. Data with repeated points, such as blood glucose concentrations, will be compared using mixed model techniques, modelling the main effect of treatment group allocation, time and their interaction, with significant main effects and interactions tested using the method of Tukey. All tests will be two-tailed, with P &lt; 0.05 considered significant. The data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Economic evaluation
The cost-effectiveness of Diazoxide to prevent primary treatment failure will be compared with glucagon within the period to discharge. Resource utilisation will be obtained from a clinical record form identifying both length of stay (LOS) and relevant Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) code for the mother, plus any subsequent operative procedure (DRG), respiratory problem requiring treatment (DRG), and NICU admission for the baby (plus LOS). Costs will be assessed using Australian Department of Health cost weights and purchase unit prices. 

Power and sample size
Typically, 50% of term infants of mothers with diabetes (gestational or insulin dependent) will be diagnosed as hypoglycaemic in our institution. Assuming a similar 10% rate of admission to NICU for intensive treatment  this would still result in 90 nursery admissions per year. In 2015-16 42 infants were prescribed Diazoxide for the management hypoglycaemia. We predict a 25% reduction in the rate of treatment failure in the Diazoxide arm of the study. This will require 100 infants who meet the eligibility criteria and a recruitment period of 2 years.
No head to head trial has been previously undertaken and there is no data on the effectiveness of either medication for this outcome. As such, a more pragmatic approach has been taken based on both clinical experience and available trial information. The authors propose the current trial size as a representative sample, being similar to the annual experience in our centre. We will recalculate sample size after enrollment of the first 25 babies. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research project is to compare Glucagon with Diazoxide for the maintenance of normal blood sugar levels in babies of mothers with diabetes who have low blood sugar levels. The routine nursery treatment differs with each baby but includes use of high concentration sugar infusion (drip) given through an IV line placed in a large vein, intravenous Glucagon and oral Diazoxide. We aim to determine which of these medications, Glucagon or Diazoxide, is better at maintaining blood sugar and which is easier to use</summary>
