  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single session lasting 15  mins of aerobic exercise training using games of the Nintendo Wii. 

The washout period between the 2 exercise training sessions was 24 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single session lasting 15 mins of usual aerobic physiotherapy exercise program involving interval based treadmill or bicycle ergometer exercise</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular demand will be measured using physiological parameters of heart rate and oxygen saturation recorded continuously via a forehead probe with a Nellcor N-20PA Handheld Pulse oximeter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physiological parameters (heart rate and oxygen saturation) will be measured continuously during 5 mins of rest and 15 min exercise session. Averages and maximum values at rest and for the exercise session will be recorded.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy expenditure (Metabolic equivalents) will be measured using a SenseWear Pro activity monitor (Body Media, Pittsburg, PA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data willbe recorded continuously during 5 mins of rest and 15 min exercise session. Averages and total energy expended at rest and for the exercise session will be recorded.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perception of using both exercise modes will be measured using a visual analogue scale. Perception of enjoyment, levels of fatigue, workload and confidence that an appropriate level of exercise was undertaken will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Perception will be recorded at completion of each exercise session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be approached by treating physiotherapist. The study will be explained to them, opportunity will be provided to have questions answered, information sheet will be provided. If screened as suitable to participate and willing to volunteer, participants will sign the consent form. After initial baseline measures participants will be randomly allocated to either experimental or control intervention  first. Allocation sequence will be determined by investigator not involved in recruitment or delivery of interventions. Sequence will be put into concealed envelopes which will be opened following recruitement and base line measures.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer random numbers generator program will be used to determine the sequence that participants are allocated into experimental and control interventions first.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic hereditary disease affecting respiratory and endocrine systems. There is no cure for this disease but treatment advances have seen increases in life
expectancy. Adults with CF have to adhere to a strict life-long regime of self care including chest physiotherapy, antibiotics, vitamins and exercise. Exercise is now a regular treatment tool with benefits including increased respiratory function, fitness and strength. This project seeks to investigate if participating in an exercise program using the recently developed Nintendo Wii is an alternative to a regular exercise program.</summary>
