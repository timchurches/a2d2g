  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prior to receiving the Q Fever vaccine, each person is required to undergo pre-testing. Pre-testing currently entails a skin and serology testing being performed to assess if they have been previously infected with Q Fever. This study is a retrospective analysis of the pre-testing performed prior to confirmation of the requirement for the Q fever vaccination (Q VAX).
The source of this data is the Australian Q Fever Registry, which is managed by AusVet. An individual is required to give their consent for data associated with the pre-testing and vaccination procedures to be entered into this Registry, and the Registry has been in operation since 2002. All data entered in the Registry from this date will be used in the retrospective analysis (2002 till approximately 31 Jan 2016). 
Each individual is monitored by the clinic who administered the pre-testing and vaccination as required. There is no follow up period in this specific study. </interventions>
