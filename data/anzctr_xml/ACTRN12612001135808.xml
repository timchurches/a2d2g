    <studytitle>The role of resveratrol in the management of metabolic dysregulations in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a randomised placebo controlled clinical trial</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>An 8 week randomised, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial investigating the effects of 3000mg daily trans-resveratrol on peripheral insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, hepatic steatosis, abdominal adipose tissue topography, plasma metabolic markers, gene expression in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells and anthropometry in male patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, aged 18-65years.</scientifictitle>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to investigate the role of a bioactive food compound called resveratrol, found in grapes, peanuts, berries and derived food products and beverages, in the treatment of obesity related fatty liver disease. Studies in animal models of fatty liver disease have shown promising results with resveratrol treatment: improvement of insulin sensitivity, prevention of fat accumulation in the liver, reduction of inflammation and increased antioxidant activity.</summary>
