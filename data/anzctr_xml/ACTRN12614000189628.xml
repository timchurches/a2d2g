  <interventions>
    <interventions>Half the patients will take Ticagrelor 90mg twice daily, orally for 12 months. Each patient will be given enough supply until there next appointment, where by they will be asked to return the unused supply before receiving their next supply. At this point the returned bottles will be checked to confirm their self administration of medication correctly.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Within a 1:1 randomised trial, this study will compare the effect of an antiplatelet approach with Ticagrelor versus placebo on 3, 6, and 12 month high-sensitivity troponin levels. It will also explore the frequency of late cardiovascular events, and the impact of P2Y12 platelet inhibition versus placebo on late cardiovascular events,  among patients with elevations in high-sensitivity troponin not attributable to other acute clinical diagnoses. </summary>
