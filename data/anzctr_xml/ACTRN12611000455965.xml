  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will undertake the Stapled Haemorrhoidectomy operation and will then be randomized to either have Rectogesic or not post operatively.
Those that receive Glyceryl trinitrate will receive 0.2% Formulation applied three times a day topically to the anal canal with an applicator. The treatment is for 2 weeke post operatively and commences day 1 post op.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control (non Rectogesic) group will recieve standard post operative care which is defined as Paracetamol 1g four times a day orally and Tramadol 50mg three times a day orally for 2 weeks</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if Rectogesic glyceryl trinitrate is beneficial post stapled haemorrhoidectomy

The patients were interviewed within 48 hrs by a clinical nurse to assess that they have recovered satisfactorily and that they were compliant in postoperative care including medications prescribed.  Patients completed visual analogue scores on maximum pain, average pain and satisfaction, administered by an independent observer blinded to the randomization. Those with persistent problems were reviewed at 2 monthly intervals until they were symptom free. All patients agreed to a telephone interview conducted again at the closure of the study and clinical review was invited as required.
Data was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. It was estimated that 100 patients in each arm would provide a 0.8 power to detect a 10% difference in pain scoring. Patients who failed to complete the program were treated as missing.  Numerical data are presented as mean and range, or median and interquartile range (IQR), depending on the distribution. Comparisons between characteristics were calculated using 2 tests and 2 tests for trend, the nonparametric Wilcoxon tests, and t tests. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows version 18 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A significance level of 0.05 was adopted a priori.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to determine if the ointment called Glyceryl Trinitrate or Rectogesic by trade name is beneficial in reducing pain after stapled haemorrhoidectomy. Patients will be assigned to either one of two groups and will receive either Rectogesic or standard post op Analgesia.</summary>
