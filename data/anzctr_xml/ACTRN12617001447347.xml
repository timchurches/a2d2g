- Who will deliver the intervention? How will be delivered? The intervention will be delivered individually and on an online basis.

- The number of times the intervention will be delivered and over what period of time? The intervention is accessible any day, any time. The intervention is self-paced, thus, time will vary for each participant. Each module should take approximately 1 hour to complete.

- The intervention will be personalised depending on participants relationship status, side effects profile and baseline treatment goals. These elements will be identified through the baseline questionnaires. According to the participants responses (partnered or not), the intervention will show a few different content/resources in the corresponding modules. This is important because the experience of testicular cancer survivors and its impact on social and sexual relationships can be different based on relationship status. The side-effects profile and baseline treatment goals are different for each participant, so the intervention needs to provide them with relevant specific resources accordingly. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility will be determined by the proportion of men who complete at least two-thirds of e-TC as well as website usage data, which will be obtained via Google analytics. Google analytics reports will provide us page views, average time spent on page, entrances, bounce rate and percentage of exit. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Proportion of men who complete at least two-thirds of e-TC will be assessed on a monthly basis to monitor participants' progress. Website usage data will be analysed on a monthly basis as well.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability will be assessed via quantitative and qualitative feedback. Participants are invited to rate various aspects of each module and the intervention as a whole (e.g., usefulness, helpfulness, ease of use, length). A subset of men will be invited to take part in a qualitative interview to provide further information on their experiences of using e-TC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Acceptability will be assessed after completion of each module (time-point will vary for each participant as they complete it at their own pace) and after completion of the whole intervention (time-point will vary as well).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distress will be measured by a thermometer where men indicate their level of distress in the previous week from 0 (no distress) to 10 (high distress) (Roth et al., 1998),

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Distress will be measured at baseline, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of e-TC completion (time will vary according to participant's self-paced progress).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Impact that the distress has had on their life will be measured by using a thermometer that ranges from 0 (no impact) to 10 (high impact) (Akizuki et al., 2005).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Impact that the distress has had will be measured at baseline, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of e-TC completion (time will vary according to participant's self-paced progress).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). Subscale scores range from 0-21.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Anxiety will be measured at baseline, once 50% of e-TC has been completed, post-intervention (immediately after e-TC completion) and at 3-month follow-up after e-TC completion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fear of cancer recurrence will be assessed using the 9-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) Severity Subscale (Simard &amp; Savard, 2015).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fear of cancer recurrence will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Unmet needs will be assessed by a modified version of the Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs measure (CaSUN). A number of items were omitted, based on the consensus of the expert advisory group as they related to specific needs of a cancer patient currently undergoing treatment (e.g., I need more accessible hospital parking , I need to know that all my doctors talk to each other to coordinate my care). Thus in the present study the CaSUN presented 28 needs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Unmet needs will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Testicular Cancer-specific quality of life will be assessed by the 26-item Quality of Life Questionnaire  Testicular Cancer (QLQ-TC26) (Holzner et al., 2013).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Testicular Cancer-specific quality of life will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983). Subscale scores range from 0-21.</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>	Men who are still undergoing treatment for testicular cancer and men experiencing recurrent disease are not eligible to participate as we are interested in addressing post-treatment concerns of men previously treated for TC.
	Men who are not proficient in reading and writing English are excluded from participating. The website and associated assessments are largely text-based and we only had sufficient resources to develop the website in English.
	Males aged under 18. It has been found that children and adolescents under the age of 18 affected by testicular cancer face different issues (e.g. disruption to school) to affected adults (Carpentier et al., 2011). We did not have sufficient resources to develop a website that catered for both children/adolescents and adults affected by TC, so initially we plan to evaluate e-TC 2.0 in adults, which is the largest group affected.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to pilot test an online psychological intervention aimed at reducing anxiety, depression and fear of cancer recurrence in testicular cancer survivors. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have completed active treatment for testicular cancer and are currently disease-free. 

Study details
All study participants will receive a 12 week access to an interactive web-based intervention designed to reduce anxiety, depression and Fear of Cancer Recurrence (e-TC 2.0). e-TC 2.0 is comprised of six interactive modules, including psycho-educational material, short survivor and educational videos, and offline exercises. Modules were designed to take approximately an hour to complete, depending on level of engagement. The whole intervention is self-administered according to participants needs and interests, at their own pace. Participants can revisit the website at any time and use its resources. Eligible men will complete baseline questionnaires, engage with e-TC 2.0 over a period of 12 weeks and complete immediate and 3-month post-intervention questionnaires. A series of acceptability/satisfaction surveys are embedded within the website and the immediate post-intervention questionnaire. 

If shown to be feasible and acceptable, e-TC could be an innovative approach to delivering supportive care and could be widely disseminated for further evaluation (or as part of routine care) at little additional cost for testicular cancer survivors who are struggling to adjust and would otherwise not seek/receive help.</summary>
