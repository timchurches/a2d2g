  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the advent of newer biologic therapies such as infliximab for Crohn's disease, a form
      of autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease, a proportion of patients are refractory to such
      therapy and require surgery. The hypothesis is that mesenchymal stromal cell therapy using
      third party human cultured cells will be safe and effective</summary>
