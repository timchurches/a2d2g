  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1
Patients of Arm 1 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 24 cycles of TP regimen (1st day: paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 by intravenous 3-h infusion with pre-medication; 2nd day: cisplatin 75-100 mg/m^2 by intravenous &gt;= 1-h infusion with hyper-hydration) or TC regimen (1st day: paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 by intravenous 3-h infusion with pre-medication; 2nd day: carboplatin AUC 5 by intravenous &gt;= 1-h infusion), every 21 days. Surgical treatment (panhysterectomy with subtotal resection of the greater omentum and the maximum removal of disseminated tumor foci) was carried out 24 days after the last cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 14 days after surgery patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 5-6 cycles of TP regimen or TC regimen every 21 days. Maintenance therapy with oral administration of Indinol Forto (Registered Trademark) (200 mg of I3C 2 times a day continuously) was started 14 days before the primary neoadjuvant therapy and continued after completion of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for 5 years of the study.
The number of cycles of chemotherapy depends on time of achieved CA-125 level =&lt;35 U/mL and general declining profile of CA-125; the number of cycles of chemotherapy also varied depending on set of clinical and laboratory data, including physical condition.

Arm 2

Surgical treatment (panhysterectomy with subtotal resection of the greater omentum and the maximum removal of disseminated tumor foci) was carried out 24 days after the last cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 14 days after surgery patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 5-6 cycles of TP regimen or TC regimen every 21 days. Maintenance therapy with oral administration of Promisan (Registered Trademark) (200 mg of I3C + 100 mg of EGCG 2 times a day continuously) was started 14 days before the primary neoadjuvant therapy and continued after completion of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for 5 years of the study.

Arm 3
Patients of Arm 3 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 24 cycles of TP regimen (1st day: paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 by intravenous 3-h infusion with pre-medication; 2nd day: cisplatin 75-100 mg/m^2 by intravenous &gt;= 1-h infusion with hyper-hydration) or TC regimen (1st day: paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2 by intravenous 3-h infusion with pre-medication; 2nd day: carboplatin AUC 5 by intravenous &gt;= 1-h infusion), every 21 days. Surgical treatment (panhysterectomy with subtotal resection of the greater omentum and the maximum removal of disseminated tumor foci) was carried out 24 days after the last cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 14 days after surgery patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 5-6 cycles of TP regimen or TC regimen every 21 days. Patients also received long-term chemotherapy TP regimen or TC regimen after the last cycle of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy every 2-3 months for 5 years of the study. Maintenance therapy with oral administration of Promisan (Registered Trademark) (200 mg of I3C + 100 mg of EGCG 2 times a day continuously) was started 14 days before the primary neoadjuvant therapy and continued after completion of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for 5 years of the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An open randomized controlled clinical trial in five arms. The purpose of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a maintenance therapy with supplements containing indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and epigallocatechine-3-gallate (EGCG) in ovarian cancer patients.
284 patients &gt;= 39 years with histologically confirmed International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III serous ovarian cancer who met the study criteria were randomized into five arms. 
Active therapy was conducted for 5 years of the study with control visits at the beginning of the study and then every month.
The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), defined as the interval between date of diagnosis to the date of death. Timepoint: 5 years post standard treatment commencement. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and rate of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer with ascite formation. PFS was defined as the interval between date of the start of treatment to first documentation of disease progression or death resulting from any cause, including toxic complications. A PFS event defined as the earliest disease progression per clinical progression, RECIST, CA-125 progression, or death.  CA-125 determination and ultrasonography (US) were conducted every month. Tomographic studies were conducted every 3-4 months. 
Detection of ascite formation has been defined by US, tomographic studies, and intraoperative findings.
Timepoints of secondary endpoints: 5 years post standard treatment commencement.

5-year survival rate has been increased in the active groups of patients who took the combination of standard chemotherapy, surgery and maintenance therapy with I3C and EGCG (or only I3C).  Ovarian cancer patients should be advised the long-term maintenance therapy with indole-3-carbinol and epigallocatechin-3-gallate to reduce the relapse rate and improve tumor susceptibility to standard chemotherapy.
