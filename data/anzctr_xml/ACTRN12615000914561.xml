    <interventions>Online behavioural family intervention: Online based behavioural family intervention using the Integrated Family Intervention for Child Conduct Problems (Dadds &amp; Hawes, 2006). 

This program focuses on managing child aggression, non-compliance and disruptive behaviour. Parents are
taught to encourage good behaviour by giving positive reinforcement and rewards, and discourage bad behaviour through the provision of consistent, emotionally neutral punishment. This program has been adapted to an online based program whereby the information is presented in a modules accessed through a virtual clinic with guidance provided on a weekly basis by a clinical psychologist. Each module consists of a short video of a therapist outlining the strategies and techniques from the program.

Parents after completing pre-assessment will be given logins to access a virtual clinic. After they have logged in to the clinic parents will be able to access the modules.  After watching the module, parents will be encouraged to implement the techniques discussed, they will also then receive a phone call from a clinical psychologist who will review the material from the module and also answer any questions and problem
solve difficulties. After this phone call, the next module in the program will be unlocked for them to view. There is a total of 6 modules in the program. Each module contains video content and also supplemented with written materials.

Duration: Each module goes for between 10-20 minutes and the phone call with the clinician will vary between 45-60 minutes. Each subsequent module in the program is unlocked and able to view after the parents speak to the clinician to review the information presented in the current module. Parents will be required to login to the program on a weekly
basis and at the end of the same week they will receive the phone call with the clinician. The program goes in total for 8 weeks (6 modules plus 2 review sessions). The first review session is a conducted over the phone with the parent (approximately 20-30 minutes).  The second review session is also conducted over the phone with the parent (approximately 45-60 minutes).  There are no modules for the review sessions. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard behaviour family intervention treatment: Parents will receive the behavioural family intervention using the Integrated Family Intervention program. This program focuses on managing child aggression, non-compliance and disruptive behaviour. Parents are taught to encourage good behaviour by giving positive reinforcement and rewards, and discourage bad behaviour through the provision of consistent, emotionally neutral punishment.

This program will be provided by clinical psychologist face to face in weekly sessions.

Duration: There is a total of 8 weekly sessions over 8 weeks.
Each session will go between 60-90 minutes and content and duration of sessions will match the intervention condition.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Levels of disruptive behavior.
Levels of disruptive behavior will be assessed in three ways:

1. DSM-IV-TR diagnostic status for Oppositional Defiant Disorder or
Conduct Disorder as determined by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Adolescents and Parents (DISCAP; Johnson, Barrett, Dadds, Fox, &amp; Shortt, 1999).

2. Oppositional and conduct symptom severity, also assessed with the
DISCAP.

3. Independent observations of disruptive behavior from video recordings of a ten minute free play procedure with parents and child. Videos will be coded using the FOS-VII coding schedule (Pasalich &amp; Dadds, 2009). Videos will be coded for child non-compliance, criticisms, oppositionality, complaints and withdrawal. Both the consistency and intensity of variables are coded, along a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (no occurrence of the behaviour) to 4 (behaviour occurred a lot of the time and/or was of very high intensity).

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint:

1. Pre-treatment assessment

2. Immediate post treatment assessment (e.g., within a week of completing treatment)

3. Three month follow up assessment
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental Stress levels:

Level of parental stress will be assessed based on scores on the
Parenting Stress Index (Abidin), this scale is designed to measure parental stress and dysfunctional parenting. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint:

1. Pre-treatment assessment

2. Immediate post treatment assessment (e.g., within a week of completing treatment)

3. Three month follow up assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parenting Behaviour:

Parenting Behaviour will be assessed using the Alabama Parenting
Questionnaire (APQ; Shelton, Frick &amp; Wooton, 1196), which has been
designed to look at parenting behaviour related to conduct problems</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint:

1. Pre-treatment assessment
2. Immediate post treatment assessment (e.g., within a week of
completing treatment)
3. Six month follow-up assessment </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental Knowledge of Behaviour Management Principles.

Parent's knowledge of Behaviour Management Principles will be
assessed using a questionnaires adapted from O' Dell, Tarler-Benlolo,
and Flynn (1979) measure and is designed to assess parental
knowledge of behaviour management principles as they complete the program.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint:

After viewing each module or session (control condition) parents will complete a set of 10 questions. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an online based behavioural family interaction program. Behavioural family interaction programs are the treatment of choice for conduct problems in children.

However due to issues of 'reach' (i.e geographical) and time restrictions not all families are able to access this treatment. Online based interventions have the potential to overcome these barriers and provide families with better access to treatments that would otherwise be unavailable. The aim of this current research is to evaluate whether a online based behavioural family interaction can lead to an increase in prosocial behaviour and effectively reduce aggression and anti-social behaviour comparable to standard behavioural family interaction programs which are usually delivered face to face in a clinic setting.

This online based behaviour family interaction program aims to teach parents to modify unhealthy parenting practices by targeting negative reinforcement contingencies operating in the family. Parents through accessing modules in a virtual clinic and via follow-up phone calls with a clinical psychologist are taught to encourage good behaviour by giving positive reinforcement and rewards, and discourage bad behaviour through the provision of consistent, emotionally neutral punishment.
It is hypothesised that families receiving the online based program will show comparable improvements in levels of disruptive behaviour, decrease in parental stress and improvements in parenting behaviour to those receiving face to face therapy.
