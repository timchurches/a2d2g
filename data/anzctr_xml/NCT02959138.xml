  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-9876 in
      participants with impaired renal function relative to matched healthy controls. Participants
      in this study will be enrolled using an adaptive design that includes up to 3 enrolled
      cohorts. Based on safety and/or PK data in Cohort 1, participants will be enrolled in
      adaptive Cohorts 2 and/or 3.</summary>
