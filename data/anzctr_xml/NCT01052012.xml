  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research study testing SABER-Bupivacaine (an experimental pain-relieving
      medication). SABER-Bupivacaine is designed to continuously deliver bupivacaine, a common
      local anesthetic, for a few days in order to treat local post-surgical pain.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate safety (side effects) associated with the use of
      SABER-Bupivacaine and how well it works in reducing pain and opioid-related side effects
      following various kinds of abdominal surgeries.</summary>
