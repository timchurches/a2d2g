  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Baseline and End of Period 1 - FVC was measured at baseline and at the end of Period 1. The same equipment and tester were used during the course of the study. The equipment was calibrated and the calibration documented prior to each patient's measurement. The person responsible for conducting the pulmonary function tests was required to comply with the study guidelines and the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society joint criteria on lung function testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Patients at Risk of Event of Disease Worsening or Death up to the End of Study - Disease worsening was indicated by pulmonary function test/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis worsening (PFT/IPF) or acute respiratory decompensation of IPF.
PFT/IPF worsening was indicated by the occurrence of both of the following: confirmed by two tests at least 4 weeks apart, as defined by the occurrence of both of the following: decrease from baseline = 10% in forced vital capacity and decrease from baseline = 15% in corrected diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide.
Acute respiratory decompensation of IPF was defined as an unexplained rapid deterioration (over a period of less than 4 weeks) of the patient's condition with increasing shortness of breath requiring oxygen supplementation = 5 L/min to maintain a resting oxygen saturation = 90% or arterial oxygen pressure = 55 mmHg (sea level) or 50 mmHg (high altitude).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The AC-055B201/MUSIC study is a Phase II study, comparing one dose of ACT-064922 (macitentan)
      10 mg with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The main study
      objective is to demonstrate that macitentan positively affects the forced vital capacity
      (FVC) in comparison with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of macitentan on the time to disease
      worsening or death in patients with IPF, and to evaluate the benefit/risk profile of
      macitentan in the treatment of patients with IPF.</summary>
