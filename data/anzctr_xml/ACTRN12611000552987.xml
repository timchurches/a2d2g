  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the pharmacokinetics of herbal medicine T89 in healthy western adults. Based on the similar study in Chinese people, it is hypothesised that following an oral administration, T89 will be detectable in the circulation at ~15 minutes, peaked at 60 minutes to 2 hours, significantly reduced at 6 to 8 hours, and undetectable after 12 hours. It is removed from the body through the urine, which starts at ~2 hours and completes within 24 hours following the administration.</summary>
