  <interventions>
    <interventions>Targin (controlled-release oxycodone hydrochloride / controlled-release naloxone hydrochloride) (Trade names:Targinact, Targiniq and Oxynal)  is an oral medication that  combines Oxycodone (opioid) and Naloxone (opioid antagonist). The action of Naloxone blocks the opioid receptors around the gastrointestinal tract, BUT does not reduce the efficacy of the oxycodone. 
This prospective study is to determine if Targin provides excellent analgesia and reduces opioid complications such as ileus on patients undergoing colorectal or upper gastrointestinal surgery.
Targin dosage will depend on opioid requirement from their Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump or from their Epidural infusion. Commencement of Targin will be at 0800 on day two post-operatively and the PCA or epidural will be discontinued two hours post Targin administration. 
We expect the dosage will be variable between Targin 10/5 (oxycodone 10mg + naloxone 5mg) twice daily and Targin 20/10 (oxycodone 20mg + naloxone 10mg ) twice daily. The patient will be on Targin for three days post-operatively

</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a single site prospective cohort study on 45 participants, but with the belief that we will go onto a blinded study in the future. We currently have the first 50 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) (1) patients with detailed side-effects and pain scores, who have either had Oxycontin or Fentanyl Patches.
These first 50 ERAS patients time span was from 03 September 2012 to 21 February 2013. All 50 ERAS patients notes, recordings, side-effects, complications and pain relief were reviewed and recorded by the surgical team from the Department of Surgery, Bay of Plenty District health Board, who are responsible for the ERAS project and then reviewed again by the Clinical Pain Service. 
Therefore, we will be doing a initial comparison for this study to add strength of the research and provide proof that Targin does or does not provide effective analgesia while reducing ileus.

      <outcome>Reducing post-operative ileus with oral opioid analgesia

Clinical Pain Service visit twice a day from post-operative day one to day 5 and the following questions asked and
Pain Scores at rest and on movement
Bowel sounds, Passed flatus,bowel movement, nausea, vomiting and other adverse effects.
All analgesics and anti-emetics recorded.
All Vital signs recorded.
Patient will also have a five day diary to complete. These are the same questions that the CPS ask but we believe it is important to to reduce placebo effect. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Shorter hospital stays and early return to work are the hallmarks of modern day post-operative  care of the surgical patient. Using Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol, hospital stays can be reduced. Early mobilisation, enteral nutrition and good pain control are the components to improve recovery following surgery. Unfortunatley pain control, especially oral opioids can inhibit bowel function that can cause ileus resulting in reduced mobility, nutrition and increased length of stay in hospital.
Targin is a combination of Oxycodone (opioid) and Naloxone (opioid antagonist). The action of Naloxone blocks the opioid receptors around the gastrointestinal tract, BUT does not reduce the efficacy of the oxycodone. This prospective study is to determine if Targin provides excellent analgesia and reduces opioid complications such as ileus on patients undergoing colorectal or upper gastrointestinal surgery.
