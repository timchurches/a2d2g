  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study was a Phase 1, prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, two-way crossover, dose escalation with one-week washout. It was planned that up to four cohorts, with six subjects per cohort, were to be enrolled. PX811019 (TETA.Dis) or triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride (TETA.2HCl) doses were to be administered to subjects within each cohort in a single dose, at approximately molar equivalent doses of triethylenetetramine free base (approximately 166 to 167 mg free base per capsule in both treatments) in 1-, 3-, 5- or 7-capsule doses.

Cohort  TETA.2HCl (mg) TETA.Dis (mg) No. Capsules

4	1750	     3045	             7

Each subject had 3 visits to the clinic, a screening visit, and two treatment visits. Following an overnight fast, subjects were randomised to receive a single oral dose of TETA Dihydrochloride or Disuccinate on Day 1, and the alternate treatment on Day 8.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The pharmacokinetic profiles of PX811019 and triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride were evaluated by analysis of plasma concentrations of triethylenetetramine and its metabolites, MAT (N1-acetyltriethylenetetramine) and DAT (N1,N10-diacetyltriethylenetetramine), following single oral doses of both formulations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for determination of plasma TETA (triethylenetetramine), MAT and DAT levels were collected on Day 1 and Day 8 at Time 0 (within 30 min prior to dosing), 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min and thereafter at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48 h post-dose on Days 2-3 and Days 9-10.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacodynamic parameters were evaluated by determination of urine copper excretion following single oral doses of both formulations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Urinary copper excretion was measured in urine collected on Day 1 and Day 8 at the following intervals: from -2-0 h pre-dose, and 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10, 10-12, 12-16, 16-20, 20-24, 24-30, 30-36, 36-42, 42-48 h post-dose on Days 2-3 and Days 9-10.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety evaluations included adverse event (AE) assessments, physical examinations, clinical laboratory blood tests and vital sign (blood pressure and pulse rate) assessments. Adverse events were classified as any untoward medical occurrence that emerges or worsens relative to pre-treatment baseline during drug administration or follow-up periods. AE's were assessed by the Principal Investigator who reviewed blood and urine analyses. No AE's were expected prior to treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluations were made during 48 hours following each dose (until the morning of Day 3 or Day 10).</timepoint>
