    <statisticalmethods>The rate of post-surgical pain following knee joint replacement surgery is estimated to range between 7-20%. One hundred participants will be recruited for this pilot study as 7-20 events will allow for assessment of the univariate relationships between baseline predictors and presence of post-surgical pain (eg, it is recommended that 10 'events' are needed for every predictor in the analysis). Univariate logistic regression (pain/no pain) and linear regression (intensity of pain) will be used to determine the relationship between a priori chosen variables and the presence of pain post-arthroplasty.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most common treatments for severe osteoarthritis is to undergo surgery and receive a total joint
replacement (the painful joint is removed and a plastic or metal joint is put in its place). Many people have a good
response to this treatment and their pain is reduced. However, there is a group of people who have a poor
response to this treatment and continue to have pain in the joint, despite the joint being replaced. We do not know
what causes this pain. This study aims to see how common it is in people with osteoarthritis to have pain in the knee following surgery to replace the knee joint. We are also interested in determining what type of pain this might be. One theory is that it may be a type of pain called neuropathic pain, or in other words, pain due to problems with the nerves supplying the leg. Another theory is that the pain might occur because of specific changes in brain function. Finding out how common it is to have persistent pain after joint replacement and what type of pain it is, is important because it will allow us to better predict who will do well and who will not, and to
prevent and treat the problem. </summary>
