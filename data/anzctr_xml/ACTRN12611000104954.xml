  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard 14-day methotrexate chemotherapy cycle (1mg/kg IM methotrexate on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 with alternate day rescue folinic acid 5mg PO on days 2, 4, 6 and 8) with addition of oral 250mg gefitinib in the following dose escalation protocol: the first 3 participants will take gefitinib on day 1 of chemotherapy only. If this is well tolerated, the next 3 participants will take gefitinib on days 1, 2 and 3 of chemotherapy, and the last 6 participants will take it on days 1-7. Concomitant gefitinib treatment will only occur in the first methotrexate chemotherapy cycle.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group in the study design as this is a phase IB toxicity trial. Data obtained from this study will be compared to standard methotrexate/leucovorin treatment outcomes for patients treated but not recruited during the conduct of the study, as logged in the RWH GTD registry. </comparator>

      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of combination treatment to patients.
Subjectively - self-reporting of any side-effects. Main side effects of methotrexate: nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, lethargy, mouth ulcers. Main side effects of gefitinib: diarrhoea, rash.
Objectively - history taking (systems review) and clinical examination esp. respiratory, abdominal and dermatological examination, as well as review of blood tests as markers for organ/systems function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Second-daily patient review to day 7 and on day 15, and biochemical markers on days 5 and 12.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified at a highly specialised clinic at the Royal Women's Hospital, where the state registry of gestational trophoblastic disease patients is kept. They will be allocated to treatment length based on order of recruitment i.e. the first three women recruited will receive 1 day of 250mg oral gefitinib, the next three women (4-6) 3 days of treatment, and the final six women recruited (7-12) will receive the full week's course of once daily oral 250mg gefitinib.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Dose-escalation protocol; based on order of recruitment, participants will be allocated to increasing length of treatment with once-daily gefitinib. Dose-escalation will occur after the first three participants are treated, then again after the next three participants are treated, provided the previous dose has been well-tolerated. Doses will start at one tablet of 250mg gefitinib orally on day 1, then three days of once daily oral gefitinib 250mg and in the final six women recruited, 7 days of once daily oral gefitinib 250mg.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a chemotherapy treatment regime for the treatment of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD).

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18-45 years and have been diagnosed with persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. 

Trial details
Participants in this trial will undergo a standard 14 day methotrexate chemotherapy cycle. In addition they will also take gefitinib tablets. The first 3 participants will take gefitinib on day 1 of chemotherapy only. If this is well tolerated, the next 3 participants will take gefitinib on days 1, 2 and 3 of chemotherapy, and the last 6 participants will take it on days 1-7. Gefitinib is a drug which is already used in the treatment of lung cancer, but has never previously been used to treat GTD.

Participants will be accessed regularly during treatment to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of treatment.</summary>
