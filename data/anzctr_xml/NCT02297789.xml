  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare (FPH) is developing a new full face mask. The objective
      of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the usability and acceptance of the
      investigative mask, the effectiveness of the seal and headgear.

      The participant will be randomised to use either full face mask prototype 1 or 2 as according
      to the randomization log for 7 ± 3 days in home. The participant will then crossover to the
      other full face mask prototype to use in home for 7 ± 3 days. Neither the investigators or
      the participants will be blinded to the study.</summary>
