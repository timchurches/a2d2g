  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive training and a psychoeducational program covering healthy brain ageing. This consists of a two hour session every week for 10 weeks. The first hour delivers information pertinent to healthy ageing including use of cognitive strategies, and information on diet and exercise, vascular risk factors, depression, and sleep. The second hour is a computer-based cognitive training program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual. This includes standard clinical care by usual health care professionals. There is no prescribed intervention administered by the trial. The control arm is a waitlist control arm. It also runs for 10-weeks, and then participants are re-assessed, and offered the opportunity to participate in the cognitive training groups.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will assess the effects of a 'healthy brain ageing program' for older adults at risk of cognitive decline and/or dementia. It incorporates both cognitive training as well as information that will equip participants with knowledge regarding preventative risks for depression and cognitive decline. It is expected that those who participate in the treatment will improve in terms of memory functioning.</summary>
