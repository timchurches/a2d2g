  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interventions:
Scaling &amp; root planing with Azithromycin - 500mg, once a day, 4 days
Scaling &amp; root planing with Amoxycillin (500mg) &amp; Metronidazole (400mg) both 3 times a day for 8 days
Scaling &amp; root planing with Placebo 
A patient questionnaire will be given to check for compliance and record any adverse effects


Scaling and root planing 
- removal of hard and soft deposits on the tooth and root surfaces that contribute to infection under local anaesthesia
- divided into 2 sessions (right hand side followed by left hand side of mouth) from 24 hours - 1 week apart

Drug administration
- oral tablet
- begins the morning of the first session of scaling and root planing</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolment:
Patients will be recruited from those referred to the Periodontics Department at Sydney Dental Hospital, Sydney, NSW.  If a patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be given an opportunity to participate in the study.  Appropriate information (including patient information brochure) will be given.  If a patient chooses to participate, written consent will be gained.  If a patient declines participation, it will have no negative impact on their treatment at the department.
Allocation:
A clinician, outside the project team, will be carrying out non-surgical mechanical periodontal therapy.  They will be dispensing the antibiotics or placebos in numbered containers.  The patient, the investigators, and the treating clinician will not know which patient was allocated to which group.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare the clinical and microbial changes occurring in chronic periodontitis patients receiving non-surgical treatment alone or with systemically administered azithromycin or with amoxicyllin and metronidazole.

The hypothesis is that non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with systemically administered azithromycin will have superior effects on treatment outcomes (clinical and microbial parameters) than non-surgical periodontal therapy alone or in combination with systemically adminstered amoxicillin and metronidazole.</summary>
