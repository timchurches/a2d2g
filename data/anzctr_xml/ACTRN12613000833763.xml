  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention app includes compulsory information (participants cannot move to the next step before confirming if they have read the provided information and they will be asked if they read all the information, read some of the information, havent read anything)  about quitting methods and optional information about smoking consequences, multiple compulsory advanced notifications at different stages of the quitting process e.g. at the selected quitting date and daily motivational notifications. In addition, the app will motivate participants to write quitting diaries (e.g. craving triggers). After reviewing the interventions user will be asked if they are willing to quit in and what of the provided options they are willing to use, and then follow how they act on their decision at 4 time-points (10 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months). The participants in both groups will be advised to complete reading the provided information in the first 3 days and setup a quit date within the next 7 days. Participants in the intervention group will be advised to use the app regularly after quitting benefit from the self-help functions. The app will be available for the participants in the intervention group for 6 months, after this period the app will automatically stop the data collection and participants can use it as long as they want.  The app will monitor the daily usage data including, number of times the participant open the app, and record the number of times the participants looked at or used any function.

    <comparator>Standard smoking cessation information (including information about smoking consequences, quitting options, and benefit of quitting) will be provided via smartphone app and then follow them up at 4 time-points (10 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months). The participants will be advised to complete reading the provided information in the first 3 days and setup a quit date within the next 7 days.  The app will be available for participants in the control group for 6 months, after this period the app will automatically stop the data collection and participants can use it as long as they want. In addition, after the end of data collection period participants in the control group will have access to the intervention app. The app will monitor the daily usage data including, number of times the participant open the app, and record the number of times the participants looked at or used any function.</comparator>

      <outcome>Making informed choice on our multidimensional measure of Informed Choice for smoking (MMICS). At the first follow up (10 days) after collecting the quitting and abstinence data, all participants in both groups will be asked to fill the MMICS questionnaire. The MMICS assess if the participant had made an informed choice of quitting or not. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>All outcome analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis (with all non-respondents classified as continuing smokers). Logistic regression modelling will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention before and after adjustment for the baseline characteristics of the participants.

Sample Size:  Based on (4.9%) weighted event rates of 17 trials using standard self-help materials in control group and (13.1%) average abstinence rate in web- and computer-based intervention trials, and assuming at least similar effect for smartphone the study will require 230 participants in each group, at confidence level of 95%,  power of 80%, and 20% compliance adjustment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In 2012, we conducted a review of free smoking cessation apps in the Apple store and Android market and found that all 130 apps lacked the informational content about smoking which is necessary to help quit. For instance, none of the identified apps provided information about evidence-based treatment (Not published). In phase 1 of this study, we found that of 394 participants, 43% have used smoking cessation apps before, and of them 55% have made a quit attempt using an app. Given that most of the available apps are not of a high quality, our aim is to develop an evidence-based decision aid smartphone app, to help smoker decide on the best available quitting method suitable for them, and follow up their quitting process. The intervention and control apps  will be compared  in terms of helping participants making quitting attempts and abstinence rate at 4 time-points (10 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months).
