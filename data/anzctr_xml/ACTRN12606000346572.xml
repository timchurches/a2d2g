  <interventions>
    <interventions>Outpatients participated in either a telerehabilitation once a week for a period of six weeks. The telerehabilitation program involved participants receiving their rehabilitation program via a videoconference established across an internet link using a custom built telerehabilitation system. As no physical contact between therapist and patient was possible across the link, the rehabilitation program consisted of self-applied techniques under the supervision of the remote therapist and a customised exercise program to adress the participants specific rehabilitation needs. </interventions>
    <comparator>Outpatients participated in a traditional face-to-face therapy program once a week for a period of six weeks.  Face-to-face therapy consisted of tradational one-on-one rehabilitation in the hospital outpatients department.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Healthy subjects with no concomitant medical conditions that would prevent them from participating in a physical rehabilitation program (e.g. severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)2. Adult subjects who could provide informed consent. 3. Normal mentation with the ability to accurately follow commands4. Uni-compartmental, unilateral or bilateral total knee replacement. May have a fully constrained, semi-constrained or unconstrained prosthesis 5. Common surgical approach for total knee replacement including: medial parapatellar arthrotomy technique, subvastus arthrotomy technique or trivector-retaining arthrotomy technique6. The ability to attend physiotherapy rehabilitation for a minimum period of six weeks post operatively7. Ability to at least partially weight-bear.8. Ability to participate voluntarily and provide signed informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Concomitant medical conditions such as malignancy, which may interfere with the normal rehabilitation process2.
