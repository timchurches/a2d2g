  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will recieve a one-on-one 30 minute nutrition counselling session with a Dietitian on the ward prior to discharge to discuss eating after surgery. Basic information is covered such as small frequent meals and high energy/protein food choices. This is current practice. Then patients are randomised into a control group or intervention. The intevention group are contacted by the Dietitian by phone every 2 weeks for 6 months and face to face at 1 and 3 months. This nutrition couselling will include assessing intake, weight and  symptoms, and giving relevant nutrition advice based on this.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will already be under the care of a Dietitian while in hospital. Prior to discharge they will be invited to participate in the study. If they agree to be involved baseline data will be collected (weight, Quality Of Life, symptoms) and baseline nutrition education will be given. Patient names for those that enrol in the study will be passed on to a third party who will randomise using numbered containers. The third party will pass the details of those allocated to the intervention on to the Dietitian responsible for nutrition counselling, while the orginal Dietitian who is responsible for collecting data will see every patient in the consultant surgeons rooms at 1,3 and 6 months.</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified randomisation according to type of surgery (oesphagectomy, gastrectomy and whipples), and then a simple randomisation based on a table from a text book.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current practice is that once patients are discharged from hospital after surgery they do not have dietetic follow up. The aim of this study is to investigate whether individualised nutrition counselling improves nutritional status and quality of life in the 6 months post-discharge.</summary>
