  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study was a prospective randomized controlled blinded trial. Participating women were randomly assigned to receive either antioxidants cocktail (group I) containing 1000 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 100 micro g Selenium and 1500 IU vitamin A; or identical placebos (group II) in form of oral capsules. This supplementation was given daily from enrolment to delivery and was continued even after pre-eclampsia or hypertension was diagnosed. Participating women were seen once a month for clinical evaluation according to the standardized antenatal care protocol. The definition of pre-eclampsia was in accordance with the American College of Obstetricians. In the last visit in the first and second trimester, and immediately before delivery blood samples were drawn for laboratory investigations.</interventions>

    <summary>Abstract
Background: Oxidative stress is blamed in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. However, it is less clear what effect gestational antioxidants would have on pre-eclampsia associated coagulopathy, aim of the study: to investigate the effect of antioxidants supplementation on coagulopathy during pre-eclampsia, patients and Methods: The study was performed as a randomized, controlled, blinded trial; 251 high risk pregnant women were randomized to receive either antioxidants (1000mg vitamin C, 400IU vitamin E, 100 micro g Selenium and 1500IU vitamin A) or placebo. Primary maternal outcome was pre-eclampsia or one of its complications. . In each trimester, detailed blood chemistry lipogram, and coagulation profile were done. Antioxidants blood levels (vitamins A, C, and E) were measured immediately before delivery.
Results: Incidence of pre-eclampsia did not differ between the two groups. However, a significant reduction in disease severity was noticed. Antioxidants reduced the levels of D-dimer, von Willibrand factor, and fibrinogen significantly. Platelets activity showed a significant reduction in the supplemented group. Antioxidants were significantly higher in blood of the supplemented group. Conclusion: Supplementing high risk women with antioxidants during pregnancy may help to counteract the oxidative stress and control coagulopathy. However, it does not prevent the disease. Keywords: coagulopathy, antioxidants, pre-eclampsia, vitamins</summary>
