  <interventions>
    <interventions>Rinsing with 1:4 dilutions in distilled deionized water of: 1) a tooth creme product containing 10% weight per volume(w/w) casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) and 900 parts per million (ppm) sodium fluoride (final concentration 2% (w/v) CPP-ACP and 180 ppm fluoride); 2) an oral care product containing 5000 ppm sodium fluoride (final concentration 1000 ppm fluoride).
The subjects will each wear an upper removable custom-made denture-like appliance that will hold four pre-sterilized enamel pieces each. These enamel pieces will contain artificially-created subsurface carious lesions. The appliances with attached enamel pieces will be worn by the subjects for 40 minutes four times a day for 10 consecutive days and worn immediately before rinsing with the solution. Subjects will also rinse with the solution for 60 seconds four times a day immediately after inserting the appliance each time. After 10 days, the enamel pieces will be removed from the appliance and replaced with new enamel pieces containing the subsurface lesions for the next treatment period.
This is a cross over trial - each participant will rinse with either the intervention or control solution (randomly allocated) for the first 10 days and then crossover to rinse with the other solution for another 10 days after a four day washout period between.</interventions>
    <comparator>Mouthrinse made from 1:4 dilution in distilled deionized water of a commercially-available oral care product containing 5000 ppm fluoride (mouthrinse therefore contains 1000 ppm fluoride).
Subjects will rinse with this solution four times a day, for 60 seconds each time, over 10 consecutive days.
Subjects will wear the appliances holding pre-sterilized enamel pieces containing artificially-created subsurface carious lesions as per the intervention group.</comparator>

    <concealment>The institution will be provided with the products in packets as they are marketed. Participants will be enrolled after they have fulfilled inclusion criiteria and do not have any of the medical or dental conditions that would exclude them from the study. They will sign a written consent form before participating. Allocation of products to participants will be random. Each participant will be given a coded plastic tube each day containing freshly prepared solution allocated to them. The code will only be known to researchers preparing the solutions from these products to give to the participants. Therefore, the sequence of treatments for each subject will only be known to the researchers preparing the solutions and not the participants or the researchers measuring mineral content in the enamel lesions or analyzing the remineralization data collected. In the case of a medical emergency, the code can be accessed for a single participant without breaking the blinding for other participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare the  repair of early tooth decay and penetration of fluoride into the repaired decay after mouthrinsing four times a day for 10 days with a solution of: 1) a tooth creme product containing fluoride and a major component of milk called casein; 2) an oral care product containing fluoride alone.
Subjects will wear a custom-made removable plastic denture-like appliance  that will each hold four pieces of pre-sterilized human tooth enamel containing early decay that has been artificially-created in the laboratory. Subjects will insert their appliance, rinse with 5 mL of one of the two solutions for one minute, spit out the solution, then continue wearing the appliance for a total of 40 minutes. After 10 days' rinsing with one of the solutions, subjects will rest from the study for four days before repeating the exercise with the other solution as before. 
The research team will prepare the solutions by diluting the products in distilled filtered water. Solutions will be freshly prepared for use at the start of each weekday and enough solution for subjects to use on the weekends will be prepared on the Friday beforehand.
Subjects will brush their teeth with a fluoride toothpaste at least one hour before first inserting their appliance that day and rinse their mouths with tap water and their appliance with distilled filtered water immediately prior to inserting their appliance each time. They will also rinse their appliance with distilled filtered water after removing it each time and store their appliance in a humid container at room temperature. Subjects will also be instructed to clean their appliance, avoiding the enamel pieces, with a fluoride-free denture paste once daily. The solutions will be stored at room temperature at all times. Subjects will not eat or drink anything except rinse with their allocated solution when wearing their appliance. Otherwise, subjects will maintain their normal oral hygiene and dietary habits throughout the study.
The hypotheses for this study are: 
1) there will be significantly greater repair of decay after rinsing with the solution containing casein and fluoride than after rinsing with the solution containing fluoride only.
2) penetration of fluoride into the repaired decay will be significantly greater after rinsing with the solution containing casein and fluoride than the solution containing fluoride alone.</summary>
