    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Fulvestrant
Treatment: drugs - GDC-0810

Active Comparator: Fulvestrant - Participants will receive 500 milligrams (mg) of fulvestrant as two intramuscular injections (250 mg each) on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, exhaustion of GDC-0810 drug supply, or termination of study by the Sponsor.

Experimental: GDC-0810 - Participants will receive three 200 mg tablets (total dose = 600 mg) of GDC-0810 orally once daily until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, exhaustion of GDC-0810 drug supply, or termination of study by the Sponsor.


Treatment: drugs: Fulvestrant
Fulvestrant at a dose of 500 mg as two intramuscular injections will be administered on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle.

Treatment: drugs: GDC-0810
GDC-0810 will be administered as tablets at a dose of 600 mg orally once daily.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      GDC-0810 compared with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic
      estrogen receptor positive (ER+)/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-)
      breast cancer resistant to AI therapy. The development of GDC-0810 has been halted by the
      Sponsor and the enrollment in this study has been discontinued. Participants currently
      enrolled in the study who are experiencing clinical benefit may continue receiving GDC-0810
      as a single agent or fulvestrant until disease progression (PD), unmanageable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, exhaustion of GDC-0810 drug supply, or termination of the study by the
      Sponsor.</summary>
