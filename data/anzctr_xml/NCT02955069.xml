  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - PDR001

Experimental: PDR001 - 110 patients will be administered PDR001 infusion.


Treatment: drugs: PDR001
PDR001 is a high-affinity, ligand-blocking, humanized IgG4 antibody directed against Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) receptor that blocks the binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2. PDR001 dose is 400 mg infusion every 4 weeks.
