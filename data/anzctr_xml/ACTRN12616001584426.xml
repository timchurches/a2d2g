    <comparator>Doxycycline (100mg, oral tablet, twice daily for 7 days).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome will be "sexual intercourse in the last 24 hours- yes/no" with sexual intercourse defined as "penile/vaginal insertion".

Although the definition for sexual intercourse is very broad, the study will be limited to urogenital infection among heterosexuals.

Starting 24 hours since starting treatment, participants will be sent daily short message service (SMS) that ask the following question: "In the last 24 hours, did you have any sexual intercourse? Yes/No" for 1 week at 24 hour intervals.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days (168 hours) after start of treatment therapy.

By the primary timepoint, we will have a total of 7 daily measures of the primary outcome representing total sexual activity over a 1 week period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first report "sexual intercourse in the last 24 hours -yes".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary timepoint will measure time elapse from start of treatment to first sexual activity.

This is a measure of how soon participants re-engage in sexual activity following start of treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Azithromycin and doxycycline are antibiotics that are widely used in the management of sexually transmissible infections (STIs).  STI management guidelines in Australia, the UK and US all recommend the use of azithromycin (1g single dose, orally) or doxycycline (100mg, orally, twice daily for 7 days) for uncomplicated urogenital chlamydia with the former preferred for its ease of dose and minimalisation of non-adherence. 
The most recent meta-analysis shows that the regimens are comparable with only a marginal increase (3%) in efficacy in favour of doxycycline over azithromycin.

However, it has been hypothesised that treatment regimen may influence patients sexual behavior, placing them at increased risk of early re-infection. Patients on doxycycline  a 7-day daily regimen, may be more mindful of their infection status because they need to take a daily dose and may not re-engage in unprotected sex until dosage is completed.

On the other hand, those on single dose regimens may feel more confident that their condition has been treated or may forget about their infection and may re-engage in sexual activity earlier than those taking doxycycline, potentially making them more at risk of re-infection.
To our knowledge, this has never been formally studied and represents a knowledge gap in the literature, necessitating this study.</summary>
