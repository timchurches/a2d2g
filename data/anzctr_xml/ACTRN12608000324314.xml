  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three beverages that differ in gylcaemic load (GL) and dairy composition.  
Beverage 1 (High GL/No dairy)- Glucose 65g, water, flavouring 
Beverage 2 (Medium GL, medium dairy) - Whole milk 200ml, water, sweetener, flavouring
Beverage 3  (Low GL/High dairy) - Whole milk 400ml, non-nutritive sweetener, flavouring.  
The participants will consume each of the three beverages over 3 consecutive days - i.e. Beverage 1 on day 1, Beverage 2 on day 2 and Beverage 3 on day 3 (randomised).  Frequency of intake is once per day (consumed at 0900), for 3 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>No control - crossover design.  Each participant will have all 3 beverages (as described above) over 3 consecutive days.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Simple Reaction Time - computerised task Danthiir (2005, unpublished thesis).  A known stimulus (e.g. the number 1) is presented in a known location (e.g. middle of computer screen), at variable time intervals.  The participant responds by pressing a specific key (e.g. the space bar).  The dependent variable is the time take (msec) to respond after presentation.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Choice Reaction Time - computerised task
Danthiir (2005, unpublished thesis).  One of two known stimuli (e.g. the numbers 1 or 2) are presented in a known location (e.g. middle of computer screen).  The participant is required to respond by pressing a specific key for each stimulus.  The dependent variable is the time taken (msec) to respond after presentation.</outcome>

      <outcome>Blood Glucose.  Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS).  (Medtronic, 2005).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuously from 0800h to 1330h for three consecutive days.  The beverage is consumed at 0900, so glucose will be measured for 1 hour prior to beverage consumption (baseline) and for 4.5 hours post beverage consumption.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine the effect of dairy consumption on satiety and certain aspects of cognition in a sample of primary school children aged 10-12  years.  It is hypothesized that beverages with a lower glycaemic load and higher dairy composition will be associated with improvements in measures of cognitive function and satiety compared to beverages high in gylcaemic load and containing no dairy food.</summary>
