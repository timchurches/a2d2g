Experimental: active - Full active tDCS treatment

Treatment: devices: Transcranial direct current stimulation
tDCS will be given every weekday. For each session, tDCS will be given continuously for 20 minutes at 2 mA. Conductive rubber electrodes (7 x 5 cm, 35 cm2) covered by sponges soaked in saline will be used, held in place by a head band. The current will be gradually increased to the level of 2 mA over 30 seconds (to avoid the sensation of a flash as described in the safety section above). For sham stimulation, the current will be left on for another 30s, then gradually reduced to zero over another 30 seconds, so that the initial tingling sensation experienced by subjects will be identical for the two groups. The stimulator will be placed behind the subject's head so any adjustments to the current by the operator are not evident. This sham procedure resulted in successful blinding in our pilot study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a common illness with an approximate lifetime prevalence of 17 %, conferring a
      large burden of disease in the community, often due to inadequate treatment. Thus there is
      interest in the therapeutic potential of non invasive, novel forms of brain stimulation, such
      as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Two small studies have been published in
      the last two years indicating that 20 minutes of either 1 or 2mA tDCS over 5 or 10 sessions
      is safe, painless and well tolerated. The investigators' own pilot data (N=30) also suggests
      the technique has antidepressant effects and is safe (5-10 sessions of tDCS at 1 mA).

      This study will extend previous findings, testing a more definitive tDCS approach (also left
      prefrontal anodal stimulation) with a longer treatment course (15 sessions), at 2 mA (which
      has been found to be safe and more effective than 1 mA in cognitive studies), and in a larger
      sample (N=68), using a placebo-controlled design.

      It is hypothesised that active tDCS (15 sessions) will have greater efficacy than sham
      treatment (15 sessions) in reducing the severity of depressive symptoms in patients in an
      episode of major depression. A second hypothesis is that 15 sessions of tDCS will not cause
      any significant adverse effects or cause decline in neuropsychological functioning in
      comparison to a sham control.</summary>
