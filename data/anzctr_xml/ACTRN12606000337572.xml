  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administered 5 meals.   Meal A, dehydrated potato (40 g); Meal B,  dehydrated potato (40 g) plus saturated fat (1.6 g cream/kg body weight); Meal C, dehydrated potato (40 g) plus canola oil (0.6 g/kg body weight), Meal D, dehydrated potato (40 g) plus olive oil (0.6 g/kg body weight); Meal E, wheat bran (44 g) plus 40 ml trim milk.  The meals all contained 2 cooked eggs. The potato was hydrated by addition of hot water. The meals were administered to an individual at the rate of one per week for 5 weeks.  The subjects consumed the meals in the early morning (0800-0830 h). The total study period for an individual was 5 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Meals rich in saturated fat increase postprandial levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in subjects with type 2 diabetes and to a lesser degree in healthy subjects.  In the present study we aimed to compare the effect of meals rich in saturated fat and monounsaturated fat and meals rich in bran and potato on pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukin-8 in obese and nonobese subjects.  Frequent acute increases in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as a result of regularly eating meals rich in saturated fat may increase the risk of developing diabetes particularly in obese subjects.  The principal investigators, data analyst and laboratory staff were blinded to the meal allocation.</summary>
