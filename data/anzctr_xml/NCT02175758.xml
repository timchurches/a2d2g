    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - SOF (oral tablets)
Treatment: drugs - RBV
Treatment: drugs - SOF (oral granules)

Experimental: SOF+RBV 7 days (PK Lead-in, Cohort 1) - Participants between and including the ages of 12 and 17 years old weighing = 45 kg will receive SOF tablets (400 mg: 1 x 400 mg, or 4 x 100 mg) + RBV for 7 days. If participants are unable to swallow SOF tablets, they will receive SOF oral granules (400 mg: 8 x 50mg). Participants will receive RBV up to 1400 mg per day based on weight in a divided daily dose.

Experimental: SOF+RBV 7 days (PK Lead-in, Cohort 2) - Following completion of study treatment in Cohort 1 and pending PK and safety results, participants between and including the ages of 6 and 11 years old weighing = 17 kg and &lt; 45 kg will receive SOF tablets (200 mg: 2 x 100 mg) + RBV for 7 days. If participants are unable to swallow SOF tablets, they will receive SOF oral granules (200 mg: 4 x 50mg). Participants will receive RBV up to 1400 mg per day based on weight in a divided daily dose.

Experimental: SOF+RBV 7 days (PK Lead-in, Cohort 3) - Following completion of study treatment in Cohort 2 and pending PK and safety results, participants between and including the ages of 3 and 5 years will receive SOF based on their weight. Participants weighing = 17 kg will receive 200 mg SOF (4 x 50 mg capsules containing granules) + RBV for 7 days and those weighing &lt;17 kg will receive 150 mg SOF (3 X 50 mg capsules containing granules) + RBV for 7 days. Participants will receive RBV up to 1400 mg per day based on weight in a divided daily dose.

Experimental: SOF+RBV 12 weeks (Genotype 2, Group 1) - During the Treatment Phase, participants between and including the ages of 12 and 17 years old with genotype 2 HCV infection will receive SOF (400 mg: 1 x 400 mg, or 4 x 100 mg) + RBV for 12 weeks. If participants are unable to swallow SOF tablets, they will receive SOF oral granules (400 mg: 8 x 50 mg). Participants will receive RBV up to 1400 mg per day based on weight in a divided daily dose.

Experimental: SOF+RBV 12 weeks (Genotype 2, Group 2) - During the Treatment Phase, participants between and including the ages of 6 and 11 years old with genotype 2 HCV infection will receive SOF (200 mg: 2 x 100 mg) + RBV for 12 weeks. If participants are unable to swallow SOF tablets, they will receive SOF oral granules (200 mg: 4 x 50 mg). Participants between and including the ages of 3 and 5 will receive SOF based based on their weight. Participants weighing = 17kg will receive 200 mg SOF (4 x 50 mg capsules containing granules) + RBV for 7 days and those weighing &lt; 17kg will receive 150 mg SOF (3 x 50 mg capsules containing granules) + RBV for 7 days. Participants will receive RBV up to 1400 mg per day based on weight in a divided daily dose.

Experimental: SOF+RBV 24 weeks (Genotype 3, Group 1) - During the Treatment Phase, participants between and including the ages of 12 and 17 years old with genotype 3 HCV infection will receive SOF tablets (400 mg: 4 x 100 mg) + RBV for 24 weeks. If participants are unable to swallow SOF tablets, they will receive SOF oral granules (400 mg: 8 x 50 mg). Participants will receive RBV up to 1400 mg per day based on weight in a divided daily dose.

Experimental: SOF+RBV 24 weeks (Genotype 3, Group 2) - During the Treatment Phase, participants between and including the ages of 6 and 11 years old with genotype 3 HCV infection will receive SOF (200 mg: 2 x 100 mg) + RBV for 24 weeks. If participants are unable to swallow SOF tablets, they will receive SOF oral granules (200 mg: 4 x 50 mg). Participants between and including the ages of 3 and 5 will receive SOF based based on their weight. Participants weighing = 17kg will receive 200 mg SOF (4 x 50 mg capsules containing granules) and those weighing &lt; 17 kg will receive 150 mg SOF.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will have two parts as follows:

      The PK Lead-in Phase of the study will evaluate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      confirm the dose of sofosbuvir (SOF) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected pediatric
      participants. The PK Lead-in Phase will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of 7 days
      of dosing of SOF+ribavirin (RBV) in HCV-infected pediatric participants.

      The Treatment Phase will be initiated by age cohort after confirmation of age-appropriate SOF
      dosage levels. Participants from the PK Lead-in Phase will immediately rollover into the
      Treatment Phase with no interruption of study drug administration. The Treatment Phase will
      evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SOF+RBV for 12 or 24 weeks in
      pediatric participants with genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection, respectively.</summary>
