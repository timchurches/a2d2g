  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PI-88
      may stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It may
      also help docetaxel work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving
      docetaxel together with PI-88 may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving
      docetaxel together with PI-88 is more effective than docetaxel alone in treating non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying docetaxel and PI-88 to see how well they
      work when given together compared to docetaxel alone in treating patients with stage IIIB or
      stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.</summary>
