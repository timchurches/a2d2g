    <interventions>This study will investigate the possible interaction between a commonly used CAM and standard anti-cancer therapies (namely hormonal agents &amp; chemotherapy) for breast cancer. Patients with active malignancy who have been taking once daily oral doses of either letrozole (2.5mg) or tamoxifen (20mg) for a minimum of four weeks prior to the study, to ensure steady-state had been achieved, with at least three weeks of therapy remaining in their treatment course, are to be included. Patients will take oral fucoidan (derived from seaweed), given in the form of Maritech ('Registered Trademark') extract, for a three-week period (500mg twice daily). Adherence will be monitored by pill count. </interventions>

      <outcome>Adverse reactions possibly due to fucoidan or cancer therapy.
At baseline, patients underwent a physical examination and demographics were collected. Blood samples were also collected for toxicity and pharmacokinetic analysis. At the end of the dosing interval, patients underwent the same physical examination and blood samples were collected for toxicity and pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood tests were urea, electrolytes and creatinine (UEC), liver function tests (LFTs) and full blood count (FBC).
Adverse drug reactions of letrozole and tamoxifen were graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 for haematological and non-haematological toxicities. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background. Although the use of complementary and alternative medicines is widespread in cancer patients, clinical evidence of their benefits is sparse. Furthermore, while they are often assumed to be safe with regards to concurrent use of anti-cancer therapies, few studies have been carried out to investigate possible interactions. Fucoidans are a group of sulfated carbohydrates, derived from marine brown algae, which have long been used as dietary supplements due to their reported medicinal properties, including anti-cancer activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of co-administration of fucoidan, derived from Undaria pinnatifida, on the pharmacokinetics of two commonly used hormonal therapies, letrozole and tamoxifen, in patients with breast cancer. 
Methods. This was an open label non-crossover study in patients with active malignancy taking letrozole or tamoxifen (n = 10 for each group). Patients took oral fucoidan, given in the form of Maritech ('Registered Trademark') extract, for a three-week period (500mg twice daily). Trough plasma concentrations of letrozole, tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen were measured using HPLC-CAD, at baseline and after concomitant administration with fucoidan. 
Results. No significant changes in steady-state plasma concentrations of letrozole, tamoxifen or tamoxifen metabolites were detected after co-administration with fucoidan. In addition, no adverse effects of fucoidan were reported and toxicity monitoring showed no significant differences in all parameters measured over the study period.
Conclusions. Administration of Undaria pinnatifida fucoidan had no significant effect on the steady-state trough concentrations of letrozole or tamoxifen, and was well tolerated. These results suggest that fucoidan in the studied form and dosage could be taken concomitantly with letrozole and tamoxifen without the risk of clinically significant interactions.
