  <interventions>
    <interventions>Blood samples collected for CTC and CtDNA isolation before patients start treatment with EGFR inhibitor (Gefitinib 250mg orally once daily or Erlotinib 150mg orally once daily), blood samples were also collected at month 1, 3, 6, 12 and at disease progression. 
CTC will be enumerated and individually picked for mutational analyses. CtDNA will be extracted from plasma at all the timepoints for mutational analyses.
Treatment with EGFR inhibitor will be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Response rate to EGFR inhibitor
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response (CR + PR) based on iRECIST criteria. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months into treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS)
PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of gefitinib/erlotinib to the date of the first documented disease progression (based on investigator-defined progression) or death due to any cause. A patient who stops treatment with study drug and goes on to receive alternative therapy for NSCLC, prior to documentation of disease progression, will be censored on the date alternative therapy began. If a patient has not progressed or received alternative therapy, PFS will be censored on the date of the last disease assessment. All patients will be included in the analysis of PFS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year after the recruitment of the final patient to the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS)
OS defined as the time from the first dose of gefitinib/erlotinib to the date of death due to any cause. Patients who are alive at the time of the final analysis or who have become lost to follow-up will be censored at their last known alive date. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be included in the analysis of OS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one year after the recruitment of the final patient to the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Concordance rate
The concordance between blood based testing with tissue biopsy will be evaluated by comparing mutation detection in CTC/ctDNA in the blood with pre treatment tissue biopsy. An activating mutation will be considered concordant if this is detected both in the blood and in the tissue biopsy.

    <statisticalmethods>Diagnostic accuracy of blood based testing with CTC and ctDNA will be compared with tissue biopsies in terms of concordance rate, sensitivity and specificity.
Descriptive statistics will be used for patient demographics, disease and treatment information. 
Survival data will be analysed using Kaplan Meier analysis.
Non-parametric statistics will be utilized. A Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-
Wallis test will be used for testing the difference between two and greater than two independent continuous variables respectively. A Spearman correlation will be performed when testing the strength of association between two continuous variables. Lastly, to test the strength of the association between two categorical variables, a Chi-Square was utilized. If the sample size is small, a Fishers Exact test will be used. A p-value &lt;0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the utility of blood based testing ('liquid biopsy') in the management of patients with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutated (EGFR+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 

 Who is it for?
 You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have metastatic EGFR+ NSCLC and will be starting treatment with EGFR inhibitors.

 Study details
 We will perform a prospective follow up study to investigate if liquid biopsy could be used to monitor the treatment response and detect treatment resistance in EGFR+ NSCLC patients. Participants will be required to have blood collected (3 tubes of 9ml blood sample each time) before they start treatment, 1 month into treatment, 3 months into treatment and 6 months into treatment. We will be analysing cancer cells and cancer DNA which may be found in the blood (ie. circulating cancer cells/CTC and circulating tumour DNA/ctDNA).

 It is hoped that this study will add to the currently limited knowledge on whether we could use CTC/ctDNA to predict the effectiveness of a treatment, as well as clinical outcomes for patients. This study will also hopefully answer the question of whether common mutations and novel mutations causing treatment resistance could be detected in liquid biopsy, and therefore could replace the more invasive tissue biopsy in the future to diagnose and monitor treatment response for patients with EGFR+ lung cancer.
