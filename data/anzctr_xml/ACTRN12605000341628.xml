    <concealment>All children were randomized to the intervention or control group at one time. A text file containing the names of the consented children, a school code, their sex, and age, were sent to the project statistician in New Zealand. The statistician had no involvement with the recruitment of the children. A random number was generated for each child using the statistical package STATA. Children within each stratum, defined by school, age (&lt; 108 months, Â³ 108 months) and sex, were sorted by random number. Children in the first half were assigned to receive intervention A, while those in the second half were assigned to intervention B.</concealment>
    <sequence>The sequence was generated using the uniform() function in the statistical package STATA (StataCorp. 2001. Stata Statistical Software: Release 7.0. College Station, TX: Stata Corporation). Stratification was used, with the strata being school, age (&lt; 108 months, Â³ 108 months), and sex.</sequence>
