  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: oral nutritional supplement in a liquid form (i.e. a drink) providing 19g protein and 1.1 kJ of energy.
Arm 2: oral nutritional supplement in a solid form (i.e. a snack bar) providing 19g protein and 1.1 kJ of energy.

Each supplement will be consumed once per day (i.e one drink or one bar) for 8 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group. This is a within subject cross-over trial and results will be compared to the pre-supplementation period (i.e looking at  a change from baseline). Each participant will move from arm 1 to arm 2, and vice versa, thus having both forms of the supplement. There will be no washout between the cross over. This is because the aims of the project are to assess nutritional supplementation for 16 weeks (independent of supplement type) and to also assess participant preference for each supplement type, which does not require a washout period.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutritional status will be measured using the Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool. This tool widely used in standard dietetic practice and has been shown to have favorable clinometric properties when used in the renal population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutritional biochemical indices: serum albumin, transthyretin, urea and CRP will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 8 and week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant preference of supplement type.

Acceptance of the supplement will be measured using an unstructured line scale. The unstructured line scale is 100 mm in length, and is anchored with 'dislike extremely' and 'like extremely' on opposing ends of the scale.

At the completion of the study participants will be asked to choose their preferred supplement (drink or snack bar) using a questionnaire that includes an option to select a tied category.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related quality of life. Two quality of life indices will be used, a disease specific (KDHRQOL) and a generic instrument (EQ-5D)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malnutrition is a significant and highly prevalent problem in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. PD patients often experience gastrointestinal symptoms and together with a fluid restricted diet can limit the tolerance to nutritional supplements. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of provision of a nutritional supplement, given as a liquid (drink) or a food (snack bar) for improving the health outcomes of PD patients who are malnourished.</summary>
