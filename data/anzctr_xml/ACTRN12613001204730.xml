  <interventions>
    <interventions>Testing a deprescribing intervention (medication withdrawal algorithm) in which some/all of a the study participant's medications are targeted for withdrawal. One of the two (2) intervention groups will have their medicines over-encapsulated (this will be the BLINDED INTERVENTION group). The other intervention group will have their medicines withdrawn over time without over-encapsulation - ie they will not be blinded (this will be the OPEN INTERVENTION group). Each participant will be enrolled in the study for 12 months and clinical care for all participants will continue under their usual GP/specialists.

Both the BLINDED INTERVENTION and OPEN INTERVENTION groups will be treated in the same manner with respect to medication withdrawal.  The Medication withdrawal algorithm will be applied by research pharmacists to develop a Medication Withdrawal Plan (MWP) for each participant prior to their allocation to a study group.  The MWP is unique for each participant (because of the unique mix of medications each person is taking at baseline). The method used to determine each participants MWP will be consistent.  Medicines least likely to be of benefit to the participant and least likely to cause adverse drug withdrawal events (ADWE) will be ceased first and those most likely to cause ADWE and/or most likely to provide symptomatic benefit will be tapered slowly and withdrawn last. Up to three medications will be withdrawn simultaneously if unlikely to cause ADWE or if withdrawal effects would be clearly ascribable to the individual drugs.  When tapering is required, doses will generally be halved at fortnightly intervals until a dose of half the lowest dose form is reached, following which the medication will be ceased.  Some medications with longer half-lives may be tapered to every second and/or every third day dosing until ceased. The total duration of medication withdrawal will depend on the complexity of the participants medication regimen and the number of target medicines that are identified.

Encapsulation:
In the BLINDED INTERVENTION group, we will cease target medications according to the consensus withdrawal plan, as for the OPEN INTERVENTION group.  However, medications that can be stopped without dose reduction (e.g. statins, aspirin, vitamins, mineral supplements, bisphosphonates) will be replaced with an (empty) inert placebo capsule.  Medications that need to be tapered (e.g., antidepressants, anti-hypertensives, anti-reflux agents) will be encapsulated to maintain blinding.  Once the dose has been tapered to zero, an empty inert capsule will continue to be supplied to the participant so that blinding is not compromised. 

In the BLINDED CONTROL group, the usual dose forms that have been identified as target medicines will be encapsulated at the intervals indicated in the medication withdrawal plan.

As this is a residential care population the majority of participants will have their medicines administered by a staff member, promoting adherence to intervention protocols. 

Adherence and compliance:
Contemporaneous, and previous, medication charts will be copied at each participant review to provide a complete medication administration record.  

Upon trial completion, community pharmacies and RACF will be asked to return any remaining trial medication to the pharmacy supplier.  
Adherence, compliance, and effectiveness of blinding will be measured by
i)	counting of unused medicines
ii)	reconciliation of withdrawal plans with administration records
iii)	asking cognitively intact participants which group they believe they were allocated to at the conclusion of the twelve month follow up 
iv)	asking RACF nursing staff, the usual treating doctor and blinded research staff which group they believe participants were allocated at the time of the 12 month follow-up.

Monitoring of Encapsulation Process and Supply of Study Medications:
The research staff will closely monitor for any errors in the supply of usual or study medications at each regular review, and for any errors in medication administration by visual inspection of the administration record to detect omitted or delayed medicines.  The DMC will review these at prescribed intervals (the exact intervals will be determined by the DMC once it convenes and ratifies its charter).

    <comparator>Participants in the CONTROL group will not have the medicines which were targeted for withdrawal actually withdrawn, but will be blinded to this through over-encapsulation of their usual medicines (this will be the BLINDED CONTROL group).  Normal clinical care of participants will continue under their usual GP/specialists.</comparator>

      <outcome>Survival of participants at 12 months post-randomisation

As well as the 3,6,12 month assessments, regular visits to monitor participants will occur as part of the MWP monitoring and safety measures.

Participants will be reviewed by research staff for potential drug withdrawal adverse effects (ADWE) one week after each medication adjustment.  Information will be obtained in systematic way from the following sources: i) the participant, ii) the RACF staff, iii) participants RACF notes and iv) NOK/person responsible (when consent has been given).  The research staff will ask about possible ADWE (e.g., bowels not open in participants tapering aperients, increased agitation or insomnia in participants tapering antidepressants or analgesics, etc) and/or ask nursing staff about any specific suspected ADWE.  They will also visit the participant, ask about possible ADWE and check for any withdrawal-related symptoms (e.g. elevated blood pressure after cessation of an antihypertensive agent, increased shortness of breath and/or elevated JVP and/or ankle oedema after cessation of a diuretic).  

If the participant has died since last visited by the research team, the date, place and cause of death will be recorded, as well as autopsy results (if performed and available).  Information will be collated from the Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) &amp; hospital records, and the treating General Practitioner (GP).  Permission for this access, including after the 12 month study period, is included in the pre-enrolment consent/assent process which is completed with participants/NOK, GPs and RACFs.

Ongoing monitoring of mortality for up to 5 years (subject to adequate resourcing) is envisaged.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>- residential aged care facilities in two Australian states (WA &amp; NSW)
- if meet eligibility criteria, approached with study information
- participant and/or next of kin (NOK) or "person responsible" provide written consent/assent to participate
- GP/treating doctor also provides written assent for patient's participation
- application of a structured deprescribing protocol to generate and implement a Medication Withdrawal Plan (MWP) is done by 2 study pharmacists who then reach consensus on final(MWP) prior to randomisation
- GP reviews MWP &amp; has right of 'veto' on any/all medications proposed for withdrawal
- after MWP confirmed, randomisation is carried out 
- blinding (except in OPEN INTERVENTION group) is maintained by over-encapsulation of medications

Because randomisation of Opti-Med participants is carried out AFTER recruitment to the study and AFTER all consents/assents have been completed and the MWP generated and signed-off by the attending GP, the research personnel will not know which group a participant will be allocated to at the time at which they are recruiting participants and will therefore remain unbiased in their treatment of each participant.  This blinding will continue through the 12 months of a participant's enrolment.

Randomisation/allocation will be carried by pharmacy, using computer generated tables made available by the OM study biostatistician, who has no involvement in the recruitment process, and no contact with the participants at any time during the study.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation stratified by number of regular medications (&gt;10), gender &amp; frailty index (&gt;10). 

Our bio-statistician will create computer-generated randomisation tables.  The randomisation will be carried out by the study pharmacist or community pharmacists who have been authorised to do this. </sequence>

Sample size rationale 

We have chosen to power the study for mortality to establish that the intervention is safe (i.e. no significant reduction in survival).  A sample size of 954 (3 groups of 318) has been chosen to balance feasibility of recruitment with power to detect any clinically important treatment effect.   In the primary analysis we will seek to confirm mortality is not significantly increased in the intervention groups (compared to the control group) and will have 80% power at the 0.05 level of significance to exclude an increase in one-year mortality of greater than or equal to 9%. 

We anticipate needing to screen ~4000 residents to enrol our target of ~1000 participants

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Frail older people living in residential care are often prescribed unnecessary medications.  We want to test whether stopping some of their drugs will improve their life expectancy, quality of life &amp; independence &amp; reduce their risk of falling.  We will stop medications thought to cause harm in older people and medications that may not provide any overall benefit.  The primary aim is to determine whether deprescribing is safe among older people living in residential aged care facilities (RACF). The secondary aims are to determine whether medication reduction improves physical health, cognitive function, and quality of life.
