    <interventions>This trial will test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Internet-based Professional Learning to help teachers support Activity in Youth (iPLAY) intervention. The aim of this project is to modify, scale-up and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention previously shown to be efficacious in improving childrens physical activity, fundamental movement skills and cardiorespiratory fitness. iPLAY will include six components to promote physical activity participation and fundamental movement skill competency. These components are 1) quality physical education and school sport; 2) classroom movement breaks; 3) physically active homework; 4) active playgrounds; 5) community physical activity links; 6) parent and caregiver engagement. Teachers will be trained in the components using a mixture of face-to-face workshops, online learning, and individualised observation and feedback.

iPLAY Mentors (employed by the project) will deliver the intervention to teachers. Mentors will be current and retired teachers with NSW Board of Studies Teaching and Educational Standards (BOSTES) specialist accreditation in Health and PE. Mentors will complete two days face-to-face training from the project team to deliver the intervention. Workshops will include: (i) familiarisation with the intervention components and procedures, (ii) review of answers to pre-determined frequently asked questions, (iii) discussion regarding methods to establish mentors credibility, relatability and likeability, (iv) problem solving exercises regarding likely challenging scenarios and (v) role-playing exercises.

The iPLAY Mentors will deliver a 2 hour face-to-face professional learning workshop to classroom teachers within each primary schools. Materials for the workshops include professional learning videos, presentation slides, and discussion questions, which will all be provided to mentors by the project team. For each teacher, mentors will observe one PE or school sport lesson teacher and use a structured template to provide individualised feedback to the teacher during a 30-minute meeting. The observation will occur once per teacher during the 3 terms following the workshop (i.e., 1 observation per teacher total).

In the 3 school terms following the face-to-face workshop, teachers will complete 8 x 30-minute online learning modules (i.e., 4 hours). Each module will consist of short (i.e., 3-5min) videos describing strategies and good and poor practice examples. Teachers are requested to complete the modules within the 3 terms following the workshop. Teachers will be prompted to reflect on the strategies learnt, and set action plans to assist them in implementing the learnt strategies. Teachers are also asked to reflect on their implementation at the beginning of each online module. The face-to-face workshop and 8 online modules are designed to assist all classroom teachers to implement three of the six iPLAY components  1) quality PE and school sport; 2) classroom movement breaks; and 3) physically active homework. To support implementation, teachers will also have access to the following resources: 1) the resource section of the iPLAY website, which includes suggested games, activities, classroom breaks, and example physically active homework tasks; 2) the iPLAY smartphone app, which will provide reminders to implement teaching strategies from their action plan with customisable frequency; 3) a physical activity monitoring system (one per school) consisting of a smartphone with software and 25 digital pedometers, which provides teachers with information on their student physical activity levels during a PE or sport lesson. Teachers are continuously able to access resources on iPLAY, including after the main intervention delivery period (i.e., 12-months after baseline).

Within each school, up to three classroom teachers will be identified as iPLAY Leaders. Leaders will deliver the remaining three iPLAY components - 1) active playgrounds; 2) community physical activity links; 3) parent and caregiver engagement. Additionally, iPLAY leaders will support other teachers with their implementation of the iPLAY components. The iPLAY leaders will complete an additional 3 hours online learning (6 x 30min modules) over a period of 4-5 weeks, and and will have 4 face-to-face meetings with their iPLAY mentor (approximately once per term).

Teachers will be expected to deliver the intervention across the entire duration of the trial (i.e., 24 months).</interventions>
    <comparator>Attention control. 
Teachers in the 10 schools allocated to the attention control arm will be offered teacher professional learning designed to improve their delivery of the NSW Kindergarten-Year 6 Science and Technology curriculum. This program, known as My Science, has been shown to increase teacher confidence and student engagement in science; however, it is not expected to influence the outcomes of the trial. Schools allocated to the attention control will be eligible to receive iPLAY after the study has been completed (i.e., 24-month post-baseline).</comparator>

Costs will largely relate to the time costs of specialist mentors, leaders, classroom teachers, and school principals (using opportunity cost principles). Any administrative resources used at the program management level also will be identified and included, although research-driven activities will be separated from the activities that would be carried out should the program be adopted by primary schools; 

*Measurement of the resources consumed in natural units (number of hours spent by specialist mentors/leaders within school/principals to deliver the intervention, number and length of school visits, etc.);

    <sequence>Two cohorts (10 schools per cohort) will be recruited into the cluster RCT. A four step approach will be used.
1. Stratification - all schools that express interest and are among the 90 selected to participate in each cohort will be stratified according to socioeconomic status (SES) and geographic location. This process will produce four strata: (i) urban-rich, (ii) urban-poor, (iii) provincial-rich, and (iv) provincial-poor.
2. Match-pairing - We will employ a Euclidian distance minimisation strategy to create pairs of similar schools from within strata. The variables used in this minimization process will be: (i) school-level SES, (ii) school size (number of students enrolled), (iii) average scores on National standardized test of numeracy and literacy that are completed by all NSW children (see outcomes section for further details), and (iv) schools participation (or not) in a state-wide physical activity and nutrition program, known as Live Life Well at School, that took place from 2008-2015. 
3. Pair Selection - Once schools have been matched using the minimisation procedure, we will select the 2-3 most similar pairs of schools from within each strata to participate in the cluster RCT.
4. Randomisation: Following baseline data collection, schools will be randomly assigned from within each pair to the experimental or control arm of the cluster RCT. An experienced statistician who is not part of the research team will conduct the randomisation procedure using a computer-generated algorithm.

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>We will test for between arm differences in changes in outcomes using linear mixed model with standard errors corrected for clustering. We will analyse data according to intention to treat principles (main analyses) and per-protocol principles (sensitivity analyses).  We conducted a power analysis using procedures appropriate for complex nested designs [1]. In this analysis the effect size for between-arm differences in cardiorespiratory fitness (primary outcome) was conservatively set to .35 (note: effect in our efficacy trial was .54) with ICCs based on our efficacy trial [14] (class = .09, school = .01). Analysis indicated that 1080 students from 60 classes in 20 schools (i.e., 3 classes per school) would provide power of .91.

We will explore potential moderators of intervention effects including childrens age, gender, ethnicity, weight status and SES, as well as baseline levels of cardio-respiratory fitness, physical activity and fundamental movement skill competence. As with the main analyses, we will employ mixed modeling approach to explore moderation hypotheses by including appropriate interaction terms in the regression models. The trial is not powered to detect interactions; thus, we will employ a significance level of p &lt; 0.1 to explore potential   moderators. We will explore significant interaction terms by testing sub-groups differences on the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes.

Per protocol analyses will investigate the influence of iPLAY leaders and other teachers  adoption   of  the  intervention,  as  indicated  by the  proportion of  intervention  components  completed (e.g., workshops   attended  and  online tasks completed),  on student  outcomes.  

Linear mixed models will be also used to examine potential mediating processes. For example, in our efficacy study we found that changes in fundamental movement skills mediated the effect of the intervention on childrens physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness. Mediating effects will be estimated using a cluster-bootstrapped based  product- of-coefficients  test  that  is  appropriate  for  cluster  randomized  controlled  trials. 

An economic evaluation will be conducted to determine if iPLAY represents value-for-money measured incrementally against the attention control arm. This allocative efficiency focus will determine whether the cost of the intervention is justified by the benefits derived from it, measured against usual practice. Costs in each arm of the trial will be estimated from a societal perspective using detailed pathway analysis to identify resource use and measurement processes for the reference year 2016. The incremental differences in costs will be combined with the behavioural and biomarker outcomes observed in the trial to produce a range of incremental cost effectiveness ratios.  In addition to a trial-based evaluation (costs and outcomes exactly as per the trial), depending on the outcomes, a modelled economic evaluation with the extended time horizon may be undertaken to further translate the benefits observed in the trial into final health benefits, assessed as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The modelled economic evaluation will simulate the impact of increased physical activity and the competency of movement skills on the overall well-being of the lifetime of the cohort compared with usual practice. A Markov model consisting of health states associated with different levels of physical activities/competency of movement skills will be used to accrue costs and benefits over the time horizon. The long-term improved outcome may translate into the cost savings which offset the increased cost associated with the implementation of iPLAY project. Simulation-modelling using the @RISK software package will calculate 95% uncertainty intervals around the epidemiological probabilities and cost estimates.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the health benefits of regular participation in physical activity, the vast majority of Australian children are insufficiently active. Schools are ideally placed to promote physical activity to children; however, recent reports suggest many Australian schools do not provide children with sufficient in-school activity or ensure they have the skills and motivation to be active beyond the school setting. Additionally, there is a need for interventions that can be effectively disseminated. The aim of this project is to modify, scale-up and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention previously shown to be efficacious in improving childrens physical activity, fundamental movement skills and cardiorespiratory fitness. The Internet-based Professional Learning to help teachers support Activity in Youth (iPLAY) study, will focus largely on online delivery to enhance translational capacity. This project will provide the evidence and framework for government to guide physical activity promotion throughout NSW primary schools and a potential model for adoption in other states and countries.</summary>
