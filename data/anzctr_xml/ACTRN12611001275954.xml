  <interventions>
    <interventions>Human milk fortifier is given as standard clinical practice to preterm infants, increasing the protein content by 1g/100ml breast milk. This intervention will add an additional 0.8g protein/100ml breast milk, thus intervention infants will receive 1.8g protein/100ml breast milk and 25 cal/30 ml. 
The intervention will begin when the attending clinician prescribes the infant fortifier. Fortifier is given with all expressed breast milk feeds and this will be the case for this study. The study will cease at discharge or estimated delivery date, whichever occurs first.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control infants receive standard protein fortification, ie they will receive 1g protein/100ml breast milk.  The human milk fortifier will be made isocaloric.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Upon consent, infants will be randomised to either treatment (high protein) or control (standard protein) and assigned a unique study ID.  Each dietary treatment (high protein group, standard protein group) will be split into two coded groups (hence a total of four coded groups). Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is at central administration site.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated randomisation schedule using variable block design will be generated by statisticians independent of study conduct.  Stratification will occur for sex and gestational age &lt;30 weeks and 30 to 32 weeks.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based on the results from our PiPIN trial (REC 1774/12/08, ACTRN12606000525583) - where increasing the protein content of human milk fortifier resulted in a borderline significant increase in length gain (P=0.08) but a significant reduction in SGA for length in preterm infants  we hypothesise a higher level of protein is required to meet the growth needs of preterm infants.  In this study we wish to increase the protein fortification to 1.8g protein/100ml breast milk compared with standard fortification 1g/100ml.  

A novel aspect of this study is that we will deliver an entr√©e of fortifier directly through the naso-gastric tube rather than mix the fortifier in expressed breast milk as is current practice. Our novel approach allows direct breast feeds to be fortified.  Currently when babies feed directly from the breast their feeds are not fortified contributing to the growth deficits seen in breast fed preterm infants.

This study will therefore test the effect of increasing the protein content of human milk fortifier on growth and the feasibility of delivering a fortifier solution directly to the infant.</summary>
