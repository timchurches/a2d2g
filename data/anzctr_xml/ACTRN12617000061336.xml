  <interventions>
    <interventions>This research explores MiCBT in a group intervention format comprising weekly two-hour sessions for 8 weeks. The program is based on the published protocol described in "Mindfulness-Integrated CBT, Principles and  Practice", Cayoun, 2011 and is  delivered by one psychologist to groups of 10-15 participants. The intervention is administered in a psychology clinic. Attendance of participants at each session will be recorded and non-attenders will be followed up.  MiCBT  integrates aspects of cognitive behaviour therapy with the teaching of mindfulness skills. The mindfulness exercises in the program focus strongly on body scanning techniques requiring daily practice exercises throughout the program.  Stage 1 of the program develops self-awareness, attention regulation, metacognitive and interoceptive awareness and response inhibition. Stages 2, 3, and 4, focus on exposure techniques, the application of skills to external and interpersonal contexts and managing avoidance. The impact of ethical and  compassionate behaviour is addressed in stage 4. The development of interoceptive awareness with equanimity is considered to be a key aspect of the therapeutic process. </interventions>

    <sequence>Randomisation to treatment conditions will be done by an independent researcher using a minimisation routine balancing numbers in groups as randomisation proceeds. To guard against confounding by major differences in baseline severity, other treatment exposures and to support subgroup analyses, randomisation will be stratified by K10 scores (mild-moderate K10 score of less than or equal to 30 vs, severe K10 score greater than or equal to 30), levels of psychological distress), antidepressant or mood stabilizer medication (yes/no) and gender.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated using G-power 3.1. Based on a sample size of 102 completers (51 participants in each group) and a recruitment target of 120 (assuming a 15% drop-out rate), the trial is powered to detect a medium effect (Cohens d = .5), using the conventional significance level, (.05), and power of .08.

Statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS statistical software package. The dependent variables are scores on the DASS-21, K10, SWLS and the FS. Mediation variables include the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ), the Mindfulness-based self-efficacy scale (MSES-R), Multi-dimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and the Non-attachment Scale (NAS). It is expected that the MiCBT group will show significantly improved scores as compared to the treatment as usual control group across the DASS-21 (lower scores), the K10 (lower scores) the MSES-R (higher scores), the MAIA (higher scores), the EQ (higher scores), the SWLS (higher scores), FS (higher scores) and the NAS (higher scores). 

The differential changes in the MiCBT group compared to the control group is the primary focus of the analysis. Analysis will use mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) the method recommended for clinical trial data. Evidence for the efficacy of MiCBT will be demonstrated by a significant two-way interaction demonstrating greater change in the outcome measures in the MiCBT group from the control group pre to post intervention. Baseline to follow-up interactions for the MiCBT group will also be examined and changes compared with post intervention data.

Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used because this approach uses all available information. Subjects with incomplete data are not discarded and missing data are not replaced with estimated values. This is consistent with the CONSORT standard (Turner et al, 2011). If data are grossly non-normal and cannot be successfully transformed, then it will be analysed using non-parametric methods.

The mediational impact of pre to post MAIA, MSES, EQ and NAS will be assessed using the Sobel test, a powerful method for measuring indirect effects (Sobel, 1982). The test assesses the significance of the product of the coefficients for treatment-mediator and mediator-outcome effects. A bootstrapped multivariate extension of the Sobel test will be used to examine both the total indirect effect and the individual effect of each mediator.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of MiCBT group interventions to improve psychological  symptoms such as depression and anxiety for patients with a range of common mental health conditions. It is hypothesised that MiCBT delivered in a private practice setting will lead to clinical symptom improvement in depression, anxiety and stress compared to a wait-list control group at post-intervention and maintained at 6 months follow up.  Improvements are also expected in psychological well-being. The mediators of clinical change are expected to be reflected by changes in awareness (metacognitive and interoceptive), non-reactivity, and interpersonal skill.  </summary>
