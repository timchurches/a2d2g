    <statisticalmethods>This is a feasibility study to look at recruitment and estimate SD in a real population.
1. Basic descriptive statistics of this cohort sample of COPD Pulmonary rehabilitation patients. 
2. Longitudinal data analysis of each individual looking at significant change in Lung function, HADscore and health care utilisation compared with baseline3. For patient interviews and focus group discussion:
Qualitative content analysis of transcribed interviews using QDA miner. 
Analysis will be iterative allowing emerging themes to be explored in later interviews.
Themes will be coded and categorised for analysis..</statisticalmethods>
