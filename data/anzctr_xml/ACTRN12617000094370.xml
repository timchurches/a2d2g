  <interventions>
    <interventions>To evaluate the kinematic and spatio-temporal parameters of gait, and the effectiveness of the programmed motor improvement was used the three-dimensional motion analysis system VICON. Patients were treated in hospital 3-week motor improvement program, which consists of fifteen 90-minute individual sessions (one-on-one) conducted daily, except Saturdays and Sundays with physiotherapist. During each session the treating physiotherapist applied all the main techniques and principles of facilitation (e.g. slow approximation, timing for emphasis, bilateral reciprocal patterns) used mainly the closed kinematic chains. Each session was 90 minutes long and consisted of three parts:
- introductory part (10 min) which included: warm-up, education of a correct body awareness and
respiratory pattern,
- main part (70 min) which included: improvement of balance reactions, mat activities (rolling/prone
on elbows/bridging/side sitting/quadruped/kneeling/half-kneeling/standing), exercises in a sitting
position (rocking/scooting), gait training (weight shifting/one leg standing/walking forward,
backward, sideways/braiding),
- end part (10 min) which included relaxation techniques.
Patients attendance at session was registred.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiotherapy plays a pivotal role in Huntington disease (HD) therapy in its early and moderately advanced stage. Physiotherapy procedures influence patients independence and physical disability. In the scientific literature there are only a few papers on rehabilitation programs in HD. The efficacy of physiotherapy has not been evaluated using unbiased, instrumental methods.
	Physiotherapy techniques constitute the primary treatment approach in the management of motor control and balance disturbances irrespectively of the cause. One of physiotherapeutic techniques is Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) which is one of widely used methods of physiotherapy e.g. in Parkinsons disease or hemiplegia 
	We believe the present study enables development of a specific physiotherapy program for HD patients and understand better mechanisms of physiotherapy in HD.
