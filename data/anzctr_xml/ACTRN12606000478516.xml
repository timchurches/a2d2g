    <interventions>Providing mothers in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with an audiotape of the conversation with the neonatologist.
After consent the first conversations (and subsequent of note as judged by the neonatologists: eg grade four intraventricular haemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus and necrotising enterocolitis needing treatment, epilepsy) between mothers and neonatologist are audiotaped.

The mothers listened to the audiorecordings whenever they want to. The duration of the audiorecording average 25 minutes. The parents in the treatment arm of the study were given the audiotape to take home so that they can listen to it anytime and anywhere until the end of the study. The duration of the intervention was for 1 year.
Intervention groups. Mothers received a copy of the audiorecording and a portable "walkman" tape recorder for the mothers' use during the stay of the baby.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Mothers did not receive the audiotapes but were offered to have the audiotapes after the 1 year followup.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The mothers' recall of information were assessed after intervention by an interview conducted by the research nurse using a standard information recall proforma to assess the recall of information of the babies' diagnosis, tests, treatment and likely outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Interviews were done at day 10, 4 months and 12 months. All recordings were transcribed within a week from the recordings by the research nurses.  After completion of the trial all recordings were scored (by a neonatologist blinded to randomisation) for the information given (by the neonatologists during the conversations) on diagnosis, tests, treatments and likely outcome.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Psychological well being of mothers (post natal depression, anxiety state, general health and parenting stress).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Postnatal depression, anxiety score and general health were assessed at day 10, 4 months and 1 year follow up. Parenting stress at 1 year follow up.</timepoint>

    <summary>Abstract
Objective  To determine whether giving mothers in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) audiorecordings of their conversations with neonatologists improved maternal recall of information and psychological wellbeing.

Design:  Randomised, clinician - blinded trial with mothers in a NICU either receiving or not receiving audiotapes of their conversations with neonatologists.

Participants  200 mothers of babies in a tertiary NICU in North Queensland, Australia

Null hypothesis:  Providing mothers with an audiotaping of their conversation with neonatologists does not improvetheir recall of infromation about their babies nor the parental well being.

Outcome measures:  Outcomes (at ten days, four months and 12 months) included recall of information, attitudes towards and use of the audiotape, satisfaction with conversations, post natal depression, parental anxiety, general health and parenting stress. The information conveyed by the neonatologists was coded from transcripts of the audiotapes and matched against the mothers recall of the information as measured by interview.  All analyses were by intention to treat.</summary>
