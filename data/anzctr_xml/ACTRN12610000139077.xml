  <interventions>
    <interventions>After randomization to a fractional inspired oxygen concentration of either 0.3, 0.5 or 0.8, the fractional inspired oxygen concentration is altered accordingly from 0.3 at the time of reperfusion. This is achieved by altering oxygen concentration on the ventilator. This is a one off treatment started 10 minutes before tourniquet release and continued until 24 hours after tourniquet release.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evidence exists that surgery conducted with the use of a tourniquet results in blood being more prone to clotting. This phenomena starts whilst the tourniquet is inflated and increases when the tourniquet is deflated. Platelets are thought to be central to this process. Activation of the platelets may in part be due to products produced by the oxygen deprived tissue secondary to the use of the tourniquet. Some evidence exists that these products can be modified by altering the concentration of inspired oxygen at the time of reperfusion. However, whether altering the inspired concentration of oxygen influences platelet function remains unexplored. We plan to investigate whether changes in the inspired oxygen concentration alter platelet function in a model of ischaemic reperfusion injury. This is of clinical interest because ischaemic reperfusion injuries are encountered commonly in surgical practice. Examples include revascularisation of limbs in vascular surgery, organ transplantation, crush injuries etc. Maintenance of normal blood clotting is vital to clinical outcome.</summary>
