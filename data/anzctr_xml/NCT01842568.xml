  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Worldwide over 2 million adults (&gt;30,000 Canadians) undergo heart surgery annually. Although
      heart surgery provides important survival benefits, it is associated with potential major
      complications such as death, stroke, and heart attack. There is promising evidence that
      measurement of heart injury markers after surgery will identify patients at risk of death or
      major complications.

      This study will determine the current incidence of major complications in a representative
      sample of 15,000 contemporary adult patients undergoing heart surgery. Knowing the current
      burden of complications will inform clinicians, administrators, government and granting
      agencies about resources required to address the problem. This study will also establish the
      role of measuring heart injury markers to identify important heart injury after heart surgery
      and the proportion that would go undetected without routine heart injury marker monitoring.
      This information will facilitate further studies of timely interventions. In summary, the
      VISION Cardiac Surgery Study addresses fundamental questions that will have profound public
      health implications given the millions of adults worldwide who undergo heart surgery
      annually.</summary>
