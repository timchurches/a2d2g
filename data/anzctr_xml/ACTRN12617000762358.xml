    <interventions>Intervention: Cambridge Diabetes Education Program ( CDEP) is an online  competency based diabetes education for health professionals developed by expert  diabetes clinicians from Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge,UK. It is endorsed by Diabetes UK, The Dietitian's Association of United Kingdom  and Cambridge University Health Partners. There will be five topics available- time taken is determined by the student.  The topics , modified to the Australian clinical and cultural context include: What is Diabetes, Hypoglycaemia, Oral Therapies, Injectable Therapies and Managing Diabetes in Hospital. Three  hours of protected work  time will be offered.
CDEP is a competency based diabetes online program underpinned by the UKs national inter-professional diabetes competency frameworks. It is not a traditional online education program. CDEP takes the  approach that enables health professionals to assess and demonstrate their knowledge and know how in diabetes management. A series of quizzes are provided- when questions are answered correctly the participant progresses through the program. When questions are answered  incorrectly, credible resource links are provided to assist in answering the question. Progress through the program requires 100% mastery.
  AusCDEP is the Australian version of CDEP . Online access will be available on the ward or from outside the ward.

One hour of face to face education: will also be offered : Role of Nursing in the Continuum of  Inpatient Diabetes Care.  This power  point presentation was developed by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and will be presented by Credentialed Diabetes Educators on the ward for one hour only. The powerpoint slides will be made available to staff unable to attend the face to face sessions . This  session has  also been modified to the Australian context in relation to clinical ranges  according to Australian Clinical Practice Guidelines. 
Staff are asked to complete AusCDEP within 13 weeks, but will have ongoing access to program. 

Comparator: Three hours of sessions developed by the National Association of Diabetes Centres( NADC) : What is Diabetes , Hypoglycemia and Medicines (Oral and Injectable therapies) will be presented to staff on the ward by a Credentialed Diabetes Educators. A further one hour :The  Role of Nursing in the Continuum of Inpatient Diabetes Care ppt developed by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists will also be presented by Credentialed Diabetes Educators to the randomised ward receiving face to face education. All face to face presentations will be presented once

Control: Ward education as usual. This involves all educational activities scheduled on the ward. Diabetes related educational activities are provided by credentialed diabetes educators. These are provided  on an ad hoc basis following a request from the ward or following an incident/event concerning diabetes safety and/or quality of care.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The analysis will be by intention to treat (ITT) approach and with supplementary per protocol analysis. The reduction of lengths of stay (LOS) in in-patient with diabetes between intervention and control groups will be assessed using two independent samples t-test and regression analysis, adjusted for clustering. We will report the results for 2-sided 5% tests for the primary trial outcome. Since multiple observations per participant are obtained correlation between measurements in the same participant is expected and not independent of each other. For regression analysis of such multilevel data, random cluster and/or subject effects can be added into the regression model to account for the correlation of the data. The model will be able to test the relationship between in-patient with diabetes and reduction of LOS, accounting for baseline characteristics and other variables. Model assumptions will be checked and appropriate adjustments to the analysis will be made where necessary. STAT(Registered Trademark) software version 14 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA)  will be used for all analyses, with xtmixed command to fit linear mixed models and xtmelogit command to fit mixed-effects models for binary outcomes/responses. All tests will be two-sided, and p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Furthermore, because this is a pilot study with small number of clusters and double check our findings, second analysis will be conducted using two independent samples t-test and regression analysis by ignoring the effect of clustering. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Background 
The Cambridge Diabetes Education Program (CDEP) is an online inter-professional competency based Continuing Professional Development (CDP) programme underpinned by the UKs national diabetes competencies frameworks and has been  adapted to the Australian context as AusCDEP. 

Objectives
We aim to pilot a trial comparing the effect of AusCDEP, face to face diabetes education, and usual staff education on length of stay and management of inpatients with diabetes..

Study Plan
This is a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial(CRCT) conducted in Campbelltown Hospital over 22 weeks. The unit of randomisation is the medical ward.

Patient length of stay is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include glycaemic control, medication errors, patient experience, and appropriate referrals to hospital based diabetes specialist services
 This pilot  CRCT will also evaluate the feasibility, adherence and fidelity of undertaking in the future a larger CRCT .
Three wards will be randomized to either 1) three hours of protected time to undertake AusCDEP (and ongoing external access) with one hour of face to face education sessions 2)four hours  face to face sessions or 3) professional education as usual.  

A daily census of all the patients on the three wards with pre-existing diabetes will be conducted and length of stay calculated post-discharge.

The charts of all patients identified as having pre-existing diabetes in the previous week will be reviewed using the Diabetes Inpatient Audit Form.

As a pilot, no power calculations have been undertaken. Data will inform a larger RCT.  We predict 400 patients (130 per group) in this pilot within this time limit.  The time limit has been chosen to allow run in, implementation of the whole educational programme and sufficient time to test all components of the trial.
