  <interventions>
    <interventions>A standard whole body PET/CT scan will be performed first.  This involves a patient lying on a scanning table for around 20 mins while breathing normally.  The patient will recieve CT and a PET scan from the base of the brain to thighs.
Then at the conclusion of the whole body PET/CT scan the patient will be administered with IV contrast and asked to hold their breath while a high quality CT scan of the liver is acquired taking about 30 seconds.  Once the contrast CT scan has concluded the patient will be instructed to breath normally again and a 10 minute gated PET scan of the liver will be acquired.</interventions>
    <comparator>In this trial we are measuring the incremental benefit of the additional scan over whole body scanning alone.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the number of positive liver metastases on contrast enhanced respiratory gated 4D PET/CT scanning compared to conventional ungated whole body PET/CT without contrast-enhanced CT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of PET/CT scan</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of mid-expiration contrast-enhanced CT of the liver and reasons for any failures.  Any patients who are unable to perform a expiration breath hold will be deemed a failure and be recorded by the prinicipal investigator.  The percentage of failures will be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of PET/CT scan</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the impact of contrast enhanced respiratory gated PET/CT on treatment decision compared to un-gated whole body PET/CT scanning or contrast enhanced CT scanning alone.  
The reporting physician will be shown the whole body PET/CT scan and will be asked to report on the extent of liver disease and anticipated managment.  The same physician will then be presented with the contrast enhanced 4D-PET scan.  They will be asked if there is any additional disease present and if it would change the anticipated management of the patient using the following criteria:

*High impact: Change in Treatment intention (curative to palliative)
*Medium impact: Change in Treatment type (Surgical to non-surgical)
*Low impact: Plan confirmed
*No impact: Additional scan ignored</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of PET/CT scan</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the difference in functional quantification of liver metastases on a contrast enhanced 4D PET scan compared to the un-gated PET scan.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of PET/CT scan</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis of this study is that an enhanced PET/CT scanning protocol using new technology to monitor patient's breathing will detect disease that was not seen by any other scanning technique.  The intervention being tested is the new respiratory scanning technology.  This technology is able to create a video of a patient breathing rather that a snap shot to correct any blurring caused by normal breathing.</summary>
