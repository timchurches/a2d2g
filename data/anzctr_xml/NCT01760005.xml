    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, biomarker and cognitive
      efficacy of investigational products in subjects who are known to have an Alzheimer's
      disease-causing mutation by determining if treatment with the study drug slows the rate of
      progression of cognitive impairment and improves disease-related biomarkers.</summary>
