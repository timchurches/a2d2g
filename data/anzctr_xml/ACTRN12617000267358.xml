  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive radiotherapy (40Gy/ 15 fractions, weekdays over 21 days) concurrently with temozolomide (TMZ) tablets 75mg/m2 daily for 21 days.
After a 4 week break the experimental group will receive nivolumab intravenous infusions (240 mg days 1 and 15 every 28 days for cycles 1-4; then 480 mg day 1 every 28 days for cycles 5-6) with concurrent adjuvant temozolomide tablets days 1-5, every 28 days) for 6 cycles. TMZ will be dosed at 150mg/m2 for the first cycle. If well tolerated TMZ is then given at 200mg/m2 for cycles 2 - 6. 

 The intervention will not be personalised.

The elderly population involved in this trial may be vulnerable to increased toxicity. Therefore the study will have a lead in phase wherein safety data of the first 10 evaluable patients on the experimental arm will be reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring committee (IDSMC) and thereafter as required by the IDSMC. The IDSMC will also examine recruitment and treatment adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients will receive RT (40Gy/ 15 fractions) concurrently with temozolomide (TMZ) 75mg/m2.
Patients assigned to the control group will receive the standard treatment of adjuvant temozolomide (150-200mg/m2 days 1-5 every 28 days) for 6 cycles.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate effect of Nivolumab and Temozolomide vs Temozolomide alone on overall survival in newly diagnosed elderly patients with glioblastoma.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 65 years or above, with newly diagnosed histologically confirmed GBM (WHO grade IV glioma including gliosarcoma) following surgery. 

Study details
Participants will be allocated to either experimental or control group in a 2:1 ratio by chance (randomly). Patients assigned to the experimental group will receive a course of nivolumab via intravenous infusion (240 mg on days 1 and 15 every 28 days for cycles 1-4; then 480 mg day 1 every 28 days for cycles 5-6) in addition to the standard regimen of Temozolomide (TMZ) tablets and radiotherapy. Patients assigned to the control group will receive the standard treatment of adjuvant temozolomide (150-200mg/m2 days 1-5 every 28 days) for 6 cycles and standard radiotherapy treatment (40 Gy administered in 15 fractions).

The study aims to evaluate whether the combination of adjuvant nivolumab with temozolomide improves overall survival outcomes for this patient population. The outcome of the study will help determine the most effective treatment for patients with glioblastoma in the future.</summary>
