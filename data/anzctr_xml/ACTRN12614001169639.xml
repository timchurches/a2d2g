  <interventions>
    <interventions>Forty two healthy volunteers with unilateral latent TrPs within the upper trapezius muscle will be recruited to the study. Each of the participants will be re-diagnosed towards unilateral TrPs confirmation within the upper trapezius muscle. Additionally, the presence of confirmatory signs, namely referred pain and twitch response, will be examined. Then, the localization of TrPs defined by Travell and Simons as x1 and x2 will be marked and the same will be done for the area corresponding to the region common for TrPs (control). Then, the examiner will look for 4 pain-free points on each side (not tender; without any features of TrPs) in the closest area to the previously marked crosses. When the four points will be found, they will be marked and named norm. Next, the skin resistance measurement will be performed.
The participants will be evaluated towards skin resistance in the marked area by an expert without any knowledge about TrPs examination results. During tests, a Keithley electrometer 610B will be used for measuring skin resistance (Ag/AgCl self-adhesive, disposable ground electrode; 30 mm diameter). The electrodes will be placed on the specific points of the skin. Two electrodes will be put on the points defined as x1 and x2 within the upper trapezius (TrPs-positive and control), four  on other points which will show no evidence of pathology (norm). One of the norm points (positioned centrally in relation to the other) will function as a reference point. Skin resistance (in ohms) will be measured once in every marked point. The electrometer will be rezeroed before every measurement. Input parameters will be turned off, and the electrometer will be corrected for internal noise to recalibrate as the participants change. All test will be completed in a climate controlled room. The duration of the procedure for each participant will be around 30 minutes and it will be conducted on a single occasion only.
Data analysis
Previously obtained resistance values from each of the marked points (TrPs-positive, control and norm) will be used to calculate the resistivity using the formula:
resistivity =RS/x ; 
 resistivity [Ohm*m]; R  resistance [Ohm]; S  electrode surface [m2]; x  distance between electrodes (reference and others) [m].
The mean value obtained from the calculations made for three norm points will be determined in order to calculate the so-called personal norm for the pain-free area (without any TrPs features). 
Additionally, TrPs skin resistivity value will be analyzed as regards the gender and the presence of confirmatory signs (referred pain and twitch response).

    <statisticalmethods>According to William Cochrans assumption for x2 test, to conduct the test the quantity of n=5 is required. It is assumed that in the examined group the following types of points will be present:
TrPs within the upper trapezius muscle without confirmatory signs
TrPs within the upper trapezius with referred pain
TrPs within the upper trapezius with twitch response
non-TrPs 
Additionally, the data will be analyzed based on the gender. As a result, the information about the minimal size of the sample will be obtained (4 features* 2 gender categories* the quantity of n=5 per subgroup; n=40). 
For the strong evidence of data presented, the significance level will be set based on exact tests, not on the default asymptotic method. Exact t-tests will be performed in order to ensure that data are representative of the whole population of possible data values. Tests will be applied to compare the differences in skin resistivity values for TrPs as compared to non-TrPs area corresponding to the common region of TrPs presence and to non-TrPs in the nearest vicinity of TrPs.
All of the above dependencies as regards gender division will be tested by an exact t-test.
The difference in skin resistivity of TrPs-positive regarding referred pain and twitch response occurrence will be tested by an exact t-test.
Values in the text, figures and tables are expressed as mean + standard mean error (SEs). All levels of probability were set at a significance level of 0.05. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20.
