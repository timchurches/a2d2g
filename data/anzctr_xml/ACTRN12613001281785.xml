  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of two, 2-hour group discussion sessions, Positive Parenting for Healthy Living, designed to target the direct and indirect pathways of parenting impact on child outcomes i.e. parenting practices, and parenting confidence and stress. The content of the sessions draws on the theoretical principles that form the basis of Triple P, and is designed to be interactive and provide opportunities for discussion. 

The first session focuses on providing parents with strategies that empower them to prevent and manage problem behaviours and ensure their children are implementing their illness prevention and management plan appropriately (e.g. monitoring their condition appropriately, taking medication as prescribed). The second session is designed as an introduction to the principles of positive parenting in the context of child chronic illness management, to promote positive parenting practices, assist parents to develop effective disciplinary methods, and help create environments conducive to caring relationships between parents and their children. It begins with a discussion of why children with diabetes may be at risk of behaviour problems, before examining common parenting traps from the perspective of parenting a child with diabetes, followed by assertive discipline strategies.

Parents are encouraged to take their child to regular, ongoing visits with their usual diabetes team.</interventions>
    <comparator>Families in the control group (Care As Usual) will be assessed on entry to the trial, 6 weeks later, and then again at 6 months. During this time, families will continue to receive regular medical management from their usual diabetes team, as appropriate. After the 6-month follow-up assessment families will be offered participation in the intervention.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The updated sample size for the study was calculated to assure 80% power to detect an effect size of .5 for a mean difference in rates of change in the variables of interest between the groups. The power analyses conducted using G Power software indicated that a sample size of 50 is sufficient to detect an ES of .5 at the significance level of .05 (two-tailed). Assuming 16% attrition rate, an available sample of 60 families will be sufficient to detect medium sized effects.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 diabetes is a serious condition affecting thousands of Australian children. It can lead to severe consequences for children including negative health outcomes, and elevated rates of behavioural and emotional problems, which can persist into adulthood. Parents of children with diabetes experience considerable difficulties, lack confidence, are unsure about what is appropriate for their child, and struggle with incorporating tasks into their day-to-day routines. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a brief, group-based parenting intervention for parents of children with type 1 diabetes. It is expected that participating in a group based parenting intervention has the potential to reduce ineffective and coercive parenting practices, and lead to improved child behavioural and emotional adjustment, better family wellbeing, and healthier children.</summary>
