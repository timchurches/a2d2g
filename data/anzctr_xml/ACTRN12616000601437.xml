    <interventions>Feasibility Testing of PrECEPt  learning materials by carers

Carers supporting someone with nutrition/hydration and pain management issues will be invited to test PrECEPt, to determine proof of concept for this novel approach to carer education. 

PrECEPt is an innovative distance learning package. The package uses blended learning to present two modules (pain, and nutrition/hydration). Written materials including information, reflections and hints/tips are combined with video vignettes which illustrate care-giving scenarios, offering practical illustrations of problems and potential solutions.
The package embeds three levels of information: basic, moderate and advanced. Caregivers decide themselves how much they wish to engage and at what level with the materials. 

Carers will be mailed the package and, in the covering letter, encouraged to engage with the materials over a six week period. Data will be gathered on their engagement, to document dose, intensity and amount of engagement.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy will be measured using the Ugalde tool (Ugalde et al. 2013). This is a 21 item, four factor, self-report questionniare which has been validated in cancer carers.  The four factors are: resilience, self-maintenance, emotional connectivity and instrumental caregiving. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency were excellent (0.73-0.85, and 0.81-0.94 respectively). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately after intervention completion </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cancer Caregiving Tasks, Consequences and Needs Questionnaire (CaTCoN). This is a 41 item scale to measure the extent of cancer caregiving tasks and consequences, and the caregivers' needs (mainly concerning information from and communication and contact with the health care professionals) (Lund et al. 2012).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately after intervention completion </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Preparedness for Caregiving Scale (Archbold et al. 1990). This is an eight item questionnaire that assesses how ready caregivers perceive they are for their role. Reliability was acceptable with Cronbachs alphas ranging from 0.86 to 0.92 (Archbold and Stewart 1993). Caregiver competence refers to the perceived adequacy of an individuals performance as a caregiver.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately after intervention completion </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A further bespoke questionnaire has been designed to capture core data on use and feedback on the educational materials. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately after intervention completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-intervention interviews will be conducted with key informant healthcare professionals (n = 4), and carers who completed the educational materials (n=16)
Interviews will elicit views on the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention; for example, eligibility criteria, method of recruitment, timing of offering the intervention in relation to the patients trajectory, duration of intervention. Four staff at the recruiting site will also be interviewed to gain feedback on recruitment processes, and the impact of the trial on interactions with the staff team (for example capturing information on whether more/different informational queries were received).

(iv)	First language is English 
(v)	Patients life expectancy &gt;12 weeks
(vi)	Resident at home (not in residential aged care or receiving end-of-life care as an inpatient).

    <exclusivecriteria>We will exclude children and/or young people (i.e.&lt;18) people who do not have the capacity to provide informed consent to take part in the research. Advice from the recruiting clinicians will be taken on individuals. We will also exclude people who do not have a good command of the English language, since this is a small proof of concept trial without resource to have the materials translated. </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Data from the primary and subsidiary outcome measures will be analysed using descriptive statistics. If adequate data is generated, then basic inferential statistics (t-tests) will be used to identify statistically significant changes in outcomes.

Analysis of the adherence checklist data will proceed using frequency counts to identify those areas addressed most and least frequently. 

Qualitative interview data will be analysed thematically (Braun and Clarke 2006). Interviews will be digitally recorded, transcribed and managed using NVivo (version 10) software. 

All data will be used to inform the refinement of the educational materials, and methodological parameters for a later scaled-up trial, including assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of the approach. Analysis of eligibility, and recruitment rates, will allow for national estimates to be calculated on number of potentially eligible carers across Australia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Families are viewed as a unit of care in palliative services, meaning that carers needs are identified and addressed in order to further support the welfare of the patient. Practical educational interventions for carers are needed (Bee et al).; however it is not known which educational methods are acceptable and how high-quality information can be delivered at a national level, with limited cost implications.

A significant gap in supporting carers is determining how high-quality relevant information can be delivered at a national level, with limited cost implications, using educational methods which are acceptable to carers. 

This study involves intervention development and an embedded proof of concept study. 

In this study we aim to:
1.	Design an innovative distance-learning educational package (PrECEPt: PalliativE Carers Education Package). Two modules, identified as priorities in the literature (pain and nutrition/hydration), will be developed. 
2.	Determine ideal content, learning style preferences (e.g. balance of videos/ vignettes/ quizzes), mode of delivery (online/printed), level of detail/complexity.
3.	Determine the acceptability and feasibility of the educational package to carer and healthcare professionals
4.	To understand the processes involved in delivery of the key components of PrECEPt including: recruitment processes for a full-scale study; data collection procedures/completion rates; queries directed to the hospice from carers involved in the feasibility work.
5.	Determine sample size, recruitment and randomisation processes for a definitive trial. 

We theorise that carer self-efficacy will increase through providing greater information, skills and confidence.  We anticipate the education will benefit patients through more competent and supported carers.
