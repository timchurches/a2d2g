  <interventions>
    <interventions>The overall duration of the intervention is 16 weeks. Increased dietary protein. Subjects will be supplied with lean red meat to enable them to consume 1.3g/kg/day of protein. This equates to 160g of cooked meat per day, which they will be asked to consume for at least 6 days per week for 16 weeks. Subjects will receive a Vitamin D supplement (1000 IU/day) and will be asked to take this oral tablet daily for 16 weeks. Subjects will be asked to participate in an individually tailored resistance and balance/agility training program administered by a quaified personal trainer twice per week (45-60 minute sessions, 32 sessions in total), as well as participate in one additional unsupervised exercise session (30-60 minutes) per week for 16 weeks, such as walking, cycling or swimming.</interventions>
    <comparator>Dietary protein intake equivalent to the current estimated average requirement (EAR). Subjects will be supplied with pasta and rice and will be advised to focus on having larger servings of bread, cereals, rice and vegetables and small serves of protein foods: meat, fish to enable them to consume the EAR for protein of 0.75 g/kg/d. Subjects will receive a Vitamin D supplement (1000 International Units (IU)/day) and will be asked to take this oral tablet daily for 16 weeks. Subjects will be asked to participate in an individually tailored resistance and balance/agility training program administered by a quaified personal trainer twice per week (45-60 minute sessions, 32 sessions in total), as well as participate in one additional unsupervised exercise session (30-60 minutes) per week, such as walking, cycling or swimming. The total duration of the control treatment will be 16 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research program will test the hypothesis that increasing dietary protein to at least 1.3 g/kg/d through the consumption of lean red meat on most days of the week, when combined with regular exercise (progressive resistance training), in a vitamin D replete state, can reduce markers of inflammation and enhance muscle mass, strength, power and functional performance in elderly women compared to resistance training alone.</summary>
