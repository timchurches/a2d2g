  <interventions>
    <interventions>The same anaesthesia machine (Drager Fabius GS, Luback, Germany) will be used in all children with the same circuit volume. The circuit will be emptied and then filled with sevoflurane (8%) and nitrous-oxygen (50:50) for 30 seconds at a high fresh gas flow (6 litre/minute). The timer will be started when the face mask is placed on the childs face for inhalational induction. 

The exhaled gas concentrations will be measured continuously. After the loss of eyelash reflex, fresh gas flow will be reduced to 3 litre/minute, the sevoflurane will be reduced to 5% and the timer will be restarted. Spontaneous respiration will be allowed until intravenous cannulation and ventilation will be gently assisted as required. 

For the first child, the gas flow settings will be maintained for 4 minutes from the loss of eyelash reflex before intravenous cannulation is attempted. All intravenous cannulation will be performed on the dorsum of the hand by an experienced anaesthesiologist, using a 22-gauge stainless steel guide cannula (length 19 mm). 

At the time of intravenous cannulation attempt, an independent observer, who will be blinded about the predetermined cannulation time, will rate the movement according to a scale (0= no movement, 1= slight extremity tension, 2= extremity withdrawal, 3= generalized movement).
The intravenous cannulation will be considered unsuccessful if there is any movement, cough, or laryngospasm (defined as sudden, partial, or complete loss of air exchange with simultaneous loss of capnographic wave, which require positive pressure ventilation), and the procedure will be considered successful in the absence of any reaction. 

The time for the subsequent childs intravenous cannulation will be adjusted accordingly using Dixons up-down sequential method (starting at 4 minutes with 15 second as the step size). The time for cannulation will be increased by 15 seconds if the time is inadequate in the previous child, and conversely, the time for cannulation will be decreased by 15 seconds if the time is adequate in the previous child.

During normal inhalational induction of general anaesthesia the following parameters will be observed-
1. Facemask acceptance grade during induction of general anaesthesia.
2. Time required for the loss of eyelash reflex from the start of general anaesthesia.
3. Exhaled sevoflurane concentration at the time of intravenous cannulation.
4. Patient movement at the time of intravenous cannulation.
5. Presence of cought at the time of intravenous cannulation.
6. Presence of laryngospasm at the time of intravenous cannulation. 

Duration: 
From the start of induction of general anaesthesia to the time of intravenous cannulation.

Frequency: All these observation will be made only once for each patient. </interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the optimum time for intravenous canulation after the induction of general anaesthesia with sevoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide in children without any premedication.

The criteria for optimum time for intravenous cannulation will be no movement at the time of intravenous cannulation. This iwill be observed by an independent observer and graded according to a 4 point scale. This scale was used in study by Kilicaslan A et al. published in Pediatric Anesthesia 2014; 24: 620-624. This scale was not specifically designed for this study.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation is based on Dixons up-down method, which requires at least six pairs of failure-success. Hence, the sample size can not be predetermined prior to start of the study due to the criteria of 6 pairs of success and failure. The time for the subsequent childs intravenous cannulation will be adjusted accordingly using Dixons up-down sequential method (starting at 4 minutes with 15 second as the step size). The time for cannulation will be increased by 15 seconds if the time is inadequate in the previous child, and conversely, the time for cannulation will be decreased by 15 seconds if the time is adequate in the previous child. 

The data will be evaluated using the SPSS (statistical Package for the Social Sciences Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical program. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inhalational mask induction of general anaesthesia with sevoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide is a widely practiced technique in children to avoid pain, discomfort and fear of the needle for intravenous cannulation.  Early cannulation during inhalational induction of general anaesthesia may result in movement, precipitation of cough, breath holding and even laryngospasm. Undue delay in cannulation may hinder the safe management of bradycardia, hypotension and apnea. There is limited evidence on the optimal timing for venous cannulation. 

Schwartz et al. concluded that early placement of intravenous cannulation is associated with more movement and respiratory complications. They compared venous cannulation at 30 seconds vs 120 seconds after loss of eyelid reflex during induction of general anaesthesia with sevoflurane and oxygen. Joshi et al. recommended an optimal time of 3.5 minutes for attempting intravenous cannulation after the loss of eyelash reflex with general anaesthesia induction with sevoflurane and oxygen. A recent study by Kilicaslan et al. suggested to wait for 2 minutes before attempting intravenous cannulation following the loss of eyelash reflex in children sedated with midazolam and receiving an inhalation induction of general anaesthesia with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide. 

The current practice in our institution is inhalational mask induction of general anaesthesia with oxygen, nitrous oxide and sevoflurane without premedication for children undergoing elective surgery. However, it is not known if the addition of premedication affects the time for intravenous cannulation following general anaesthesia induction with sevoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide. 
We propose to conduct a study to determine the optimum time for intravenous cannulation in children induced with sevoflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide during general anaesthesia without any premedication.
