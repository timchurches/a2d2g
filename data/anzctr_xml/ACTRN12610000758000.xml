  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will examine the effectiveness reduction in the size of lymphedematous arms of patients after breast cancer with a difference in volume of 200 mL between arm compared with the normal arm, diagnostic criterion(clinical) for lymphedema ,utilizing a facilitating exercising device associated with a compression arm sleeve. The compression used is made national material -polyester and cotton, low elasticity (&gt;15mmHg) involving whole member (arm and forearm), put immediately prior to activity.  The patients will submitted to a single one-hour session of active exercises, while sitting with the spinal column erect, of four 12-minute stints with intervals of three minutes to rest. Evaluation was achieved by water volumetry before and immediately after the session. The active exercising device is similar to the pedaling system of a bicycle that utilizes both upper limbs. This apparatus is fixed on a table at a height of 30 cm with the table at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's body.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: The aim of this study will to evaluate the reduction in the size of lymphedematous arms of patients utilizing a facilitating exercising device associated with a compression arm sleeve. Methods: Thirty subjects, suffering from arm lymphedema after surgical, chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer. The criterion for starting the assessments will be by finishing order of subjects in a rehabilitation group. The patients were submitted to a one-hour session of active exercises, while sitting with the spinal column erect, of four 12-minute stints with intervals of three minutes to rest. Evaluation will achieved by water volumetry before and immediately after the session. The active exercising device is similar to the pedaling system of a bicycle. The paired t-test will employed for statistical analysis with an alpha error of 5% (p-value &lt; 0.05) being considered acceptable.</summary>
