  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a randomized controlled trial where participants will be randomly allocated either to write in a gratitude journal for eight weeks (treatment group) or standard care (control group).. The participants in the treatment group will be asked to list three things they are grateful for in their journal on a daily basis. Intervention fidelity will be assessed by asking the participants in the treatment group after the 8-weeks how often they wrote in their journal.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will continue to receive standard care at the diabetes clinic which includes support from a diabetes team including doctors and diabetes nurses.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Qualitative questions asking about experience with the gratitude journal for both adolescents in the intervention condition and their parents: assessed by asking:
Questions for adolescents:
What was your experience writing in the gratitude journal?
What was it about this experience that you liked or disliked?
Now that you know about a gratitude journal, are you likely to use a gratitude journal in the future?
Questions for parents:
Do you have any general comments about your childs experience writing in the gratitude journal?
What was it about this experience that you think your child liked or disliked?
Now that you and your child know about a gratitude journal, do you think your child is likely to continue using one in the future?

    <statisticalmethods>Pearsons correlations will be used to explore the relationship between the different outcome measures, demographic characteristics, disease characteristics, and current insulin regimen. Independent samples t-tests will be employed to assess group differences at follow-up on all the measures. A mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess group differences as well as within-group differences in the outcome measures. Multiple linear regression will be used to examine which measures are associated with adolescent and parental stress levels as well as adolescent glycaemic control. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adolescents with type 1 diabetes are at an increased risk for psychiatric disorders, in part due to the challenges and stress involved with managing a complex chronic illness. We would like to examine the effects of an 8-week gratitude intervention on levels of stress, depression, quality of life, gratitude, self-care behaviours and glycaemic control in 80 youth aged 10-16 with type 1 diabetes. We will also measure parental stress to examine whether the intervention has an indirect effect on parents' wellbeing (parents n=80). Participants will be recruited from the the diabetes outpatient clinic at Greenlane Clinical Centre, Auckland. Once participants have consented/assented to participate and completed baseline questionnaires, they will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. If they are in the intervention group they will be given a gratitude journal to fill out every day for 8 weeks. This contains a heading of "List 3 things you are thankful for" on every page. At the time of recruitment, participants will be asked to complete the baseline questionnaires and then again eight weeks later to examine change from baseline to follow-up. Glycaemic control (HbA1c) is collected as part of standard care and we will examine changes from baseline to three months after baseline.</summary>
