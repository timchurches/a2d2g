  <interventions>
    <interventions>Before surgery, participants will receive the following treatment simultaneously over a 12 week period:
*  Nivolumab intravenously at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 6 doses;
*  Ipilimumab intravenously at 1mg/kg every 6 weeks for 2 doses;
*  Paclitaxel intravenously at 80 mg/m^2 weekly for 12 doses.

Where administration of the study drugs happens on the same day, nivolumab is administered first, ipilimumab is administered 30 minutes after nivolumab, and paclitaxel is administered last. Study treatment is administered at clinic/study visits.

Surgery will take place within 4 weeks of the last paclitaxel dose. Surgery may be either breast conserving surgery or mastectomy as decided between the participant and surgeon.

Participants will recommence Nivolumab 2-6 weeks after surgery as determined by the investigator. Nivolumab is administered intravenously at 480 mg dose every 4 weeks for 9 doses at clinic/study visits.</interventions>

    <summary>This study aims to find out if treatment with a combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab, with weekly paclitaxel before surgery, and treatment with Nivolumab after surgery, is safe and effective in women and men diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you are 18 years or older, have been diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer, will be having neoadjuvant treatment (treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy before surgery) and your tumour is &gt;= 15mm in size after anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Trial Details.
Participants may have commenced anthracycline based chemotherapy prior to signing consent to this study. Tumour block/sections from the initial diagnostic core biopsy must be available.

Up to 3 weeks before starting study treatment, all participants will have a breast and axillary ultrasound, and provide research core biopsies and research blood tests. The tumour must be biopsied prior to the start of neoadjuvant study therapy and a primary tumour size of &gt;= 15 mm on imaging (mammogram or ultrasound) is required for eligibility.

Participants will have clinic visits every 2 weeks during pre-surgery treatment (nivolumab, ipilimumab and paclitaxel) for 12 weeks. They will receive nivolumab every 2 weeks (6 doses), ipilimumab every 6 weeks (2 doses) and paclitaxel every week (12 doses).

Participants will have a breast and axilla ultrasound repeated before surgery. If tumour is available at surgery, research biopsies will be collected.

Nivolumab will re-start when safe to do so 3-6 weeks post-surgery. All participants will have clinic visits with the first dose of nivolumab after surgery, and then every 4 weeks for 9 visits (36 weeks). Nivolumab is dosed every 4 weeks post-surgery for up to 9 doses.

The total duration of study treatment is 1 year.

Participants will be followed as per local investigator standard of care (SOC) at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 36 months following start of study treatment by phone or SOC visits. </summary>
