  <interventions>
    <interventions>All subjects were randomised to receive either placebo or Acipimox capsules each week (two 250 mg capsules of the acute-bolus Aci therapy or placebo; 500 mg total - 5- Methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid 4-oxide, Olbetam capsules, Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Italy) 500 mg orally 1 hour before a single exercise bout, once a week over a total of 2 weeks. A low- to moderate-intensity exercise bout on an electromagnetically braked bicycle ergometer (Cateye EC 1600, Japan) was performed for 45 min at power output 2 W/kg of lean body mass (LBM). All subjects during 45-min exercise were connected personally with their nurses and attending physicians.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo was matched to the study drug for taste, color, and size, and contained microcrystalline cellulose, identical in appearance but without the active ingredient.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A higher overall response of plasma neuropeptide Y, growth hormone and leptin  levels to anti-lipolytic drug Acipimox during the exercise in bulimic patients when compared with healthy women. A blood sample was collected at the beginning and in the course (after 45-minute exercise) of the experiment to estimate plasma neuropeptide Y, growth hormone and leptin concentrations. Blood samples were collected into chilled tubes containing Na2EDTA and antilysin. Plasma was separated immediately by centrifugation and stored until being assayed. Plasma neuropeptide Y concentrations were determined by a commercial radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St. Charles, Missouri, USA). Plasma growth hormone concentrations were measured by a commercial RIA kit (Immunotech, Prague, Czech Republic). Plasma leptin concentrations were determined by a commercial RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, Missouri, USA).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A higher local response of extracellular glycerol in subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue to Acipimox during the exercise in bulimic patients as well as a higher plasma glycerol turnover as the index systemic lipolysis to Acipimox during the exercise in bulimic patients when compared with healthy women. The in situ and in vivo microdialysis technique (CMA Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to examine the exercise-stimulated lipolysis (by measurement of dialysate glycerol). A blood sample was collected at the beginning and in the course (after 45-minute exercise) of the experiment to estimate plasma glycerol concentrations. Blood samples was collected into chilled tubes containing Na2EDTA. Plasma was separated immediatelly by centrifugation and stored until being assayed. Glycerol in the dialysate and in plasma was analyzed with a radiometric kit (Randox Laboratories, GY 105, Montpellier, France).</outcome>
