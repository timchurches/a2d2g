    <interventions>Condition and exposure:
This is an observational study conducted on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) population. 
Participants were classified according to methotrexate (MTX) exposure into: currently taking MTX, and not taking MTX for at least 1 year (non-MTX) but they were on other anti-rheumatic medications. A third cohort of RA patient was those who were neither on MTX nor on any other medications. This group included those RA patients who were MTX naive (never treated) as well as those who had been exposed to MTX at some stage of their illness. Those started on MTX were considered on therapy until follow-up visit.
Duration of observation:
The study was taken place between April 2014 and December 2015. All participants were examined at baseline and then followed after 8 months. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size:
A sample size of 114 individuals was calculated to have 80% power (pÂ­value of 0.05) to detect a significant difference of 10 mm Hg in SBP between MTX and non- MTX groups. This assumes a within group SBP SD of 20 mmHg. The following cohorts were formed based on their use of MTX i.e. approximately distributed:
1.	Taking MTX drug (N=85 patients)
2.	Not taking MTX drug (N= 26 patients)
3.	Newly diagnosed with RA and not on MTX (N= 3)
Statistical analyses:
The STATA software version (13) was used. Statistical significance was defined as p-value&lt; 0.05. Continues variables was tested for normal distribution and then presented as the mean +/- SD. On the other hand, non-continues variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. Since all outcomes were liner continues variables, liner regression was used to assess the effect of MTX exposure on the outcomes. Modelling was adjusted for wide range of potential confounders. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess effects of MTX dose and/or concentration over time. For the repeated measures, linear mixed models were used to model the individual variability in changes in BP with MTX treatment over time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling autoimmune condition characterized by local and systemic inflammation, joint pain, stiffness and fatigue. RA patients also suffer from so-called extra-articular manifestations, affecting several organs and systems such as the skin, eye, lung, heart, kidney, blood vessels, and bone marrow. Patients with RA and cardiovascular risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes are known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Since cardiovascular disease is known to be an inflammatory condition, RA patients without cardiovascular risk factors may have an additional increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, some evidence suggests that the use of methotrexate (MTX) drug, a traditional anti-inflammatory drug for use in RA patients, may lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. In order to establish whether MTX lowers specific risk factors for CVD in RA patients, any comparison of risk factors such as blood pressure and arterial function between patients receiving and not receiving MTX must take into account other factors that might influence these risk factors and which may be different between groups of patients receiving and not receiving MTX. These factors include the dose and concentration of MTX, levels of exercise, dietary nutrient intake, alcohol intake, and clinical and biological characteristics. 
The main aim of our study is to examine whether taking MTX drug can improve blood pressure and arterial function in the RA. The novelty of our results will likely translate into a) substantial changes in clinical practice, in particular cardiovascular risk management in RA patients and, possibly, in the general population; b) high-impact research outputs in leading  journals in rheumatology, cardiovascular medicine, pharmacology, molecular biology and chemistry; c) invitations to present data at key national and international meetings; and d) ongoing collaborations with the pharmacological industry in relation to the synthesis and further development of MTX analogues.</summary>
