  <interventions>
    <interventions>The organisational plus technology support intervention lasts for 12 weeks and consists of the following components: (1) A participant information session (30-45 mins) delivered by UQ research staff on the background of the study, and details of the assessment and participation process. (2) An electronic information booklet with details about: the study rationale (i.e. evidence on prolonged sitting and detrimental health outcomes) and purpose; general guidelines on optimal workplace activity; specific behaviour change strategies related to the key intervention messages; and, general information about the study procedure and timeline. (3) Fortnightly emails created with and distributed by the wellness manager to participants about the benefits of standing up, sitting less and moving more.  (4) PLUS Technology support: participants will wear a LUMOback posture sensor device around their waist for 12 weeks.  The LUMOback sensor (8.5mm thin) gently vibrates when the individual sits or stands in a poor posture (i.e. slouches). It tracks movements wirelessly and sends this information via Bluetooth connection to a mobile device, which provides real-time feedback, and long-term monitoring of sitting, standing, walking (including number of steps), and running behaviours, as well as sleep time.</interventions>
    <comparator>The organisational support only intervention consists of the same elements as above minus the wearing of the LUMOback (component 4). </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excessive sitting time has now been detrimentally linked to several health outcomes. For many full-time employed adults, the bulk of this sedentary time occurs at work. The office workplace, in particular, has been identified as a key setting for strategies to reduce prolonged sitting time.

This study will evaluate two interventions to reduce sitting time in the workplace: 
-	organisational support only (group 1) 
-	organisational support plus the use of a monitoring device that provides real time feedback (the LUMOback posture sensor, group 2).

We expect both groups will reduce their sitting time in the workplace and across the whole day. We expect that the addition of the LUMOback posture sensor will result in group 2 reducing their sitting time more than group 1.
