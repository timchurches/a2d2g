  <interventions>
    <interventions>Obstetric fistula is due to prolonged obstructed labour causing pressure necrosis in the maternal genital tract and surrounding organs, in particular the lower urinary tract and anorectum. Women with fistulas have an abnormal communication between the vagina and urethra/bladder and/or anorectum. These women leak urine continuously and/or faeces through the vagina.

The height measurement is a once of at time of hospital admission. This is routine done on admission for all patients.
Measurement of height in women on admission to hospital - for women to birth suite who had normal deliveries and women attending the hospital with gynaecological conditions and have had normal deliveries.
Measurement of height in women with obstetric fistulas.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group is the women who have had normal vaginal deliveries without obstruction - during data collection period; or women with previous normal deliveries and attending the hospital for other gynaecological conditions.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is height of woman a risk factor for obstructed labour fistula.
Obstructed labour is determined by history given by patient e.g. number of days in labour, stillborn baby and evidenced by maternal injuries such as genitourinary fistula. (most women deliver in villages with no health care professional - so there is no medical records).

Height is measured by the admission nurse on the ward with a stadiometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On admission to the hospital ward</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Is height of woman related to perineal tears.
These women deliver in remote villages with not health attendants and so the perineal tears are not sutured at time of delivery. The tears will be evident on examination at time of admission to hospital.

Height is measured on admission to the ward by the nurse using a stadiometer.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vesico-vaginal fistula secondary to obstructed labour is very prevalent in resource-poor settings where obstetric care is unavailable. In Uganda it is estimated that 2.6% of reproductive age women have symptoms of fistula (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2002). The identification of risk factors for the development of vesico-vaginal fistula in pregnant women is critical. If a woman could be identified as high risk prior to labour, then her health care workers could initiate appropriate management plans for her labour and potentially avoid the development of a fistula. 

While previously published studies have documented that short women are at a higher risk of developing vesico-vaginal fistula in labour, these studies have all compared the fistula women who are usually from regional areas, with the average height of women nationwide which is usually obtained from cohorts of city women. These cohorts are likely to have better nutrition and living conditions and may not represent the average height of women living in more regional and remote areas. There are no comparisons of the heights of fistula women with women living in the same regions who have delivered without fistula.

This study proposes to measure the heights of women undergoing fistula surgery at Kagando hospital, Uganda, and comparing the heights with women at Kagando hospital and St Pauls Health Centre who have delivered without fistula. This non-fistula cohort will include women who present for prolapse repair and women who have a normal delivery in the hospital obstetric unit.

The heights of all the fistula women and cohort women are measured routinely at the hospital and are readily available without any additional imposition on these women.
