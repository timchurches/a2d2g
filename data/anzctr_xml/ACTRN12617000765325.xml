  <interventions>
    <interventions>Screen all patients aged over 70 years admitted to medical service or orthogeriatric service at Royal North Shore Hospital over a period of 7 months (time period study research pharmacist hired full time) and calculate Drug Burden Index (DBI) (exposure to medicines with anticholinergic and sedative effects). 

The DBI will be calculated online using a DBI calculator (www.drugburdenindex.com) that was developed by Professor Hilmer and Lisa Kouladjian. This has been shown to be a reliable and validated computerised clinical decision support system to report DBI of older patients taking multiple medications. This website is designed for 400 subjects and involves, under a unique code, entering the patient's medications, automatically calculating their DBI score, and the option to generate a PDF report. This PDF will then modified by the pharmacist to add in their recommendations. The pharmacist formulated these recommendations based on algorithms for withdrawing medications published on www.deprescribing.org, and a combination of resources that outline withdrawal sedative medications including Therapeutic Guidelines, Australian Medicines Handbook and the National Prescribing Service. Where the pharmacist was unsure of a recommendation, the advice of a geriatrician/clinical pharmacologist (Professor Hilmer) was sought. 

Those with DBI&gt;0 who are likely to remain in hospital for a further 48 hours are eligible to participate. 

Obtain consent from patient/caregiver.  

Obtain baseline data on demographics, current medicines, diagnoses, functional status, falls, frailty, hospitalisations in previous year and self-reported health status.  

Randomise to control (usual care) or intervention

Intervention: Pharmacist generates a report on DBI at baseline, highlighting contributing medicines and impact on function. DBI is calculated as soon as possible after admission i.e. after consent is obtained. Where possible, DBI should be calculated and the report generated within 48 hours of the patient's admission. Pharmacist will then discuss this report with the patient's treating teams registrar and/or consultant, who will decide whether to make any changes to medicines (at their own discretion). They can choose to agree/disagree with the recommendations. The report is designed in such a way that one column has "pharmacists recommendations" and the adjacent column has "medical officer comments." This discussion should take place within 48 hours to allow time for the treating team to accept any recommendations and for these changes to take place whilst the patient is in hospital. After discussion, the pharmacist will document in the "medical officer comments" section whether they agreed or disagreed with the recommendation. If the recommendations are not viewed as a priority to the treating team on admission, where appropriate the pharmacist can discuss these recommendations again on discharge. 
Intervention adherence and fidelity are recorded by the research pharmacist through the DBI calculator software and the data collection sheets.  

Follow up data at 3 and 6 months from discharge date by phone call to patient/carer and/or GP and medical records. Information on medicines, physical function, falls, readmission, institutionalisation and mortality to be collected.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in prescribing outcomes: proportion of patients in whom DBI is decreased, unchanged and increased at discharge will be calculated and compared between intervention and control groups using chi-square tests.

This will be assessed by comparing the DBI score calculated on admission and discharge (using the online DBI calculator tool). The pharmacist will obtain a best possible medication history on admission which will be used to calculate the DBI score on admission. On discharge, the list of medications in the patient's hospital discharge referral will be used to calculate DBI score on discharge. 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>At hospital admission and discharge</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in prescribing outcomes at follow-up: proportion of patients in whom DBI is decreased, unchanged and increased at 3 and 6 months after discharge compared to DBI on admission to hospital will be calculated and compared between intervention and control groups using chi-square tests.

This will be assessed by comparing the DBI score calculated on admission and at 3 and 6 months after dischange (using the online DBI calculator tool). The pharmacist will obtain a best possible medication history on admission which will be used to calculate the DBI score on admission. 

During the 3 and 6 month (post discharge) follow up phone calls, the patient will be asked what medications they are currently taking and where appropriate, confirmed with a second source (e.g. GP, pharmacist, nursing home records).  This list of medications will be used to calculate their DBI score (using the online DBI calculator tool) at follow up.  This will be compared with their DBI calculated on admission to hospital.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months and 6 months post discharge</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean frailty scores will be compared between intervention and control groups at baseline, 3 and 6 months.  

Mean frailty scores will be calculated after administration of the Reported Edmonton Frail Scale (REFS) (out of a total of 18 points) at baseline. This same questionnaire will be repeated over the phone as part of the 3 and 6 month (post discharge) follow up phone calls (which will be out of 16 points since the clock drawing exercise cannot be completed over the phone). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at follow up at 3 months and 6 months (post discharge from the hospital admission during which they were recruited)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of adverse drug reactions (clinical outcome). This will be compared between intervention and control groups using chi-square tests.

Prevalence of adverse drug reactions will be extracted from review of routinely collected data in the medical records on discharge.  Adverse drug events will also be assessed by a second, blinded, independent reviewer of the medical records and classified using Naranjo criteria. During the 3 and 6 month (post discharge) follow up phone calls, the patient will be asked if they have had experienced an adverse drug reaction since hospital discharge. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Discharge, and 3 and 6 month (post discharge) follow up phone calls</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence and number of falls. On hospital admission, the patient will be asked if they have experienced a fall in the preceding 6 months, Any falls during hospital (inpatient falls)  will be extracted from review of the patient's medical records. During the 3 and 6 month (post discharge) follow up phone calls, the patient will be asked if they have had a fall since discharge. This will be compared between intervention and control groups using chi-square tests (prevalence) and independent t tests. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, hospital discharge and 3 and 6 months after discharge from hospital admission during which they were recruited.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility: descriptive statistics of staff time required and cost analysis

The pharmacist will record the time taken to enter the medications in the DBI online calculator, time taken to generate the DBI report (using a stopwatch) as well as estimate the time taken to discuss the report with the registrar/consultant. 

A cost analysis will be undertaken which will consider the time and cost involved (e.g. hourly rate of pharmacist) to calculate the patient's DBI score and time taken to generate the report, 

Descriptive statistics including mean, median and range will be used to analyse this outcome.

      <outcome>Patient  evaluation of the intervention.

At discharge, patients will be asked two questions to rank their satisfaction with their medication management in hospital on a likert scale from 1 to 10. These questions were designed specifically for this study. The first question is How satisfied are you with your medication management in hospital overall? and if their medication(s) have been changed, How satisfied are you with your medication changes in hospital overall?

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise this. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Hospital discharge</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hospital staff evaluation of the intervention. 

Hospital staff will be emailed 5 questions about their satisfaction with the DBI reports provided by the pharmacist. These questions were designed specifically for this study. Questions were tailored to gauge hospital doctros thoughts of the format of the DBI report, the information provided on the DBI report and incorporation of DBI report into electronic medication management hospital systems. 

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise this.

      <outcome>GP evaluation of the intervention.

At discharge, General Practitioners (GPs) will be asked 3 questions on their thoughts of the DBI report (that will be faxed to them on discharge). The questions were slightly modified from a previously developed questionnaire, which was used as part of a feasibility study of a previous version of the DBI calculator for accredited pharmacists in the community.

    <statisticalmethods>The study is powered to detect a clinically significant change in the Drug Burden Index.  A reduction of 0.5 points is associated with clinically significant differences in physical function and falls.  
Based on previous studies in medical inpatients we estimate 30-40% of patients will have DBI &gt;0.5 on admission and that DBI is not reduced in the usual care group. We estimate that the DBI report will result in 25-50% of eligible patients reducing DBI by 0.5.  Therefore, we need 100-180 in each study group to be powered at 80% to detect a clinically relevant reduction in DBI in the intervention group.  Allowing for loss to follow-up, we aim to recruit 200 to each study group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people in hospital are commonly prescribed multiple medicines, some that may cause side effects such as drowsiness, confusion, dry eyes. dry mouth, constipation and falls. The Drug Burden Index (DBI) is used to find out if the medications being prescribed might impact on a person's day-to-day activities. It takes into account all the medications that someone is using; in particular the medicines that cause sleepiness and side effects like dry mouth and confusion. If someone has a high score on the DBI, there is a higher risk of falls, frailty, hospitalisation, more visits to their local doctor, and overall poorer outcomes. 

We hypothesise that there is a missed opportunity in hospital to identify and reduce the  burden of medications in older people which can be addressed using the DBI.

The primary purpose of this study is to find out what happens in hospital when the pharmacist provides a report on the DBI to a patient's treating doctors, mainly to see if the report changes the medicines that the doctors prescribe. We will also look at patients' outcomes, like falls and repeat hospital visits, as well as ask staff and patients for their opinions of the report.
