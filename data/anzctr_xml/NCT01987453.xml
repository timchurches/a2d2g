Treatment: drugs - RBV

Experimental: LDV/SOF+RBV 12 weeks (Group 1) - Participants who failed a prior SOF+RBV ± pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) regimen will receive LDV/SOF FDC plus RBV for 12 weeks.

Experimental: LDV/SOF 24 weeks (Group 2) - Participants who failed a prior LDV/SOF ± RBV regimen will receive LDV/SOF FDC for 24 weeks.

Experimental: LDV/SOF+RBV 24 weeks (Group 3) - Participants with advanced compensated or decompensated cirrhosis who failed a prior SOF+RBV regimen will receive LDV/SOF FDC plus RBV for 24 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: LDV/SOF
Tablet(s) administered orally once daily

Treatment: drugs: RBV
Tablets administered orally in a divided daily dose according to package insert weight-based dosing recommendations (&lt; 75 kg = 1000 mg and = 75 kg = 1200 mg)
Participants in the LDV/SOF+RBV 24 weeks group will dose adjust RBV according to hemoglobin and renal status as stated in the RBV package insert.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) with or without ribavirin
      (RBV) in participants with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have
      participated in a prior Gilead-sponsored HCV treatment study, and who did not achieve
      sustained virologic response (SVR24), defined as HCV RNA &lt; lower limit of quantification
      (LLOQ) 24 weeks after last dose of study drug (SVR24).</summary>
