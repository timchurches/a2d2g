  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The National Register of Antipsychotic Medication in Pregnancy (NRAMP)is an observational,
      nationwide study involving women of child-bearing age who take antipsychotic medication
      during pregnancy. It follows the pathway of mother and baby during pregnancy and for the
      first 12 months of the baby's life, in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for the
      best use and effect of antipsychotic medication during pregnancy, thereby informing clinical
      treating teams with regard to the management of their patients in this vulnerable population
      group.

      The investigators hypothesize that the provision of such evidence-based guidelines will
      improve the management and outcomes for mother and baby during pregnancy, birth and the
      postnatal phase, providing a positive impact on maternal and child health and wellbeing for
      present and future generations.</summary>
