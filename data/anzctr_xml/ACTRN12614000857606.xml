  <interventions>
    <interventions>Direct electrical cardioversion. The cardioversion will be performed under sedation. Remote patches will be attached in Anterior-posterior or anterior-lateral position and 200 Joule synchronized shock will be delivered. A maximum of three shocks will be delivered to restore sinus rhythm. Cardioversion will be performed on a single occasion, lasting approximately 30 minutes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>To examine the predictors of change in exercise capacity following cardioversion, we will use a multivariable mixed-effects model with the change in exercise capacity (VO2max) as the dependent variable. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be used to assess the change of haematological, morphological and QoL parameters following cardioversion. A P value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

Using the mean VO2max value of 20.7+/- 6.3 ml/kg/min reported in persistent AF (Fiala et al., 2013) and a 50% attrition rate accounting for those not remaining in sinus rhythm, a recruitment target of 35 patients per group will give 80% power to detect a 3.5 ml/kg/min change in VO2max.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, occurring in 1-2% of the population. Many patients remain asymptomatic, likely leading to an underestimation of the true prevalence of AF. Of particular importance is the similar risk of stroke and adverse health outcomes in the asymptomatic cohort. Catheter ablation has emerged as an effective treatment for symptomatic AF. However, the risk to benefit ratio of an ablation procedure in asymptomatic AF is less established. 

(i)	Examine whether the restoration of sinus rhythm by cardioversion in asymptomatic patients improves exercise capacity to a similar degree as patients with symptomatic AF.
(ii)	Compare baseline and post-exercise parameters of the prothrombotic state between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients both before after cardioversion

(1)	We hypothesize that exercise capacity will be similarly impaired in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and improve following restoration of sinus rhythm following cardioversion. 
(2)	We further hypothesise that:
a.	acute exercise will elevate the prothrombotic state in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and;
b.	inflammation and endothelial dysfunction will be observed in both patient cohorts and similarly improved following the return of sinus rhythm.
