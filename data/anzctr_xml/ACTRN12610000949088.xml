  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will assess habitual physical activity participation in adults with Cystic Fibrosis over a 12 month period.  Physical activity will be assessed using a bi-axial accelerometer (Sensewear Armband [Bodymedia]).  Participants will be assessed at baseline and 12 months.  Measures of respiratory function, quality of life, intention to exercise and exercise capacity will be performed prior to the wearing of the activity monitor for a period of 5 to 7 days.

By measuring physical activity in this way we will be able to  objectively quantify physical activity participation in adults with CF over a prolonged period.  Additionally, we hope to identify the presence of clinical or demographic characteristics which determine long-term participation in physical activity; To examine the effect of a respiratory exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics on physical activity participation, as compared to baseline, in adults with CF; and, to ascertain what relationship exists between change in respiratory function and change in physical activity participation over time.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Regular physical activity has many health benefits.  More specifically, physical inactivity is an identified risk factor for global mortality, and can contribute to the incidence of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and heart disease.  In generally healthy adults at least 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity each week is required to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, bone health and reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases and depression.  In individuals with CF there are no established targets for physical activity participation.  Consequently, physical activity interventions are shaped around guidelines for healthy adults.

Improving and maintaining physical activity is a cornerstone of therapy for CF patients.  Aerobic fitness is associated with improved survival and those with better physical fitness have better quality of life.  Despite this, participation in exercise decreases with increasing perception of disease severity, with patients ascribing decreased importance and increased burden to exercise over other therapies.   In previous studies of physical activity in CF, both children and adults have been found to undertake less moderate-vigorous physical activity than their healthy peers.

It is hypothesised that:

1.	Physical activity decreases over time in CF and is more marked in particular sub-groups such as females and those with repeated need for intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
2.	Factors such as higher baseline respiratory function, fulltime employment/study, higher fitness levels, younger age and male gender will all be associated with better long-term participation in physical activity.
3.	Physical activity is decreased after respiratory exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics, and does not return to baseline after 4 weeks.
4.	Decline in physical activity is associated with a more rapid decline in respiratory function over 12 months.</summary>
