    <interventions>Each Cycle will be 21 days and includes the following combination:
Capecitabine (oral) 1000 mg/m2 twice a day, day 1 to 14 every 21 days
Cisplatin at 80 mg/m2 day (IV), day 1 every 21 days
Intraperitoneal paclitaxel will be given by chemotherapy trained nursing staff on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 day cycle. The dose of paclitaxel will vary depending on the cohort 


Cohort 1 10mg/m2
Cohort 2 20mg/m2
Cohort 3 30mg/m2

Patients will receive 6 cycles of chemotherapy unless unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease occurs.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal paclitaxel, this will be assessed based on the number of patients who have experienced dose limiting toxicity
If no dose limiting toxicity is seen after 3 patients have completed treatment in Cohort 1, patients will commence enrolment into Cohort 2. 

If no dose limiting toxicity is seen after 3 patients have completed treatment in Cohort 2, patients will commence enrolment into Cohort 3. 

If no dose limiting toxicity is seen after 3 patients have completed treatment in Cohort 3, this cohort will be expanded to 6 patients if maximum tolerated does (MTD) has not been reached. There will be no further dose escalation after Cohort 3.

    <exclusivecriteria>1.	Contraindications to investigational chemotherapy regimen including allergies to any of the chemotherapy medications 
2.	Specific comorbidities or conditions 
3.	Other, for example those compromising the ability to assess key outcomes
4.	Life expectancy of less than 3 months.
5.	History of another malignancy within 5 years prior to registration. Patients with a past history of adequately treated cervical carcinoma-in-situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are eligible. Patients with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for at least 5 years after definitive primary treatment.
6. 	Significant intercurrent illness that will interfere with the chemotherapy during the trial such as:
a. 	Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection
b. 	Active infection
c. 	Myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months or significant cardiac disease resulting in an inability to tolerate the intravenous fluid load as required for administration of cisplatin

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase I trial to determine safety and tolerability of paclitaxel in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine in patients with advanced gastric cancer and peritoneal metastases. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with gastric cancer and peritoneal metastases, and have not had previous chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer. Study details All participants will be given the combined treatment of paclitaxel, given through an intraperitoneal catheter (a thin tube surgically inserted through the stomach cavity), cisplatin, given intravenously (through a tube inserted into the vein), and capecitabine, given orally. Different doses will be tested to determine the maximum tolerated dose for paclitaxel. Participants will be follow-up for up to 6 cycles, or 18 weeks, during treatment and then for a further two years post treatment in order to determine safety and tolerability of paclitaxel, response rate, survival and effect of treatment on quality of life.
