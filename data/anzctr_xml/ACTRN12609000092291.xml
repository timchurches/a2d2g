    <concealment>Subjects will be divided into two groups, randomly matched through their initial blood lipid levels and other baseline characteristics. A PhD student will be invited as the third party to label the treatment and placebo powder (both of them will be packed in similar-looking containers), and to assign those treatment or placebo powder (marked as A or B) to match the participantsâ€™ codes and groups in which they are assigned. Only the "third party"will know the information of labels and codes, and will be asked not to reveal relevant information to either researchers or participants.</concealment>
