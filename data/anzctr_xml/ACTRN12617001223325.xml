    <interventions>AKP-11 is a Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist and 0.5 g of study gel will be topically applied 4 times a day (total daily application of 2 g).The study consists of 2 parts:
PART A investigates two doses of AKP-11 (daily dose 3% (60 mg) and 6% (120 mg) over 7 days in 20 participants (2 cohorts of 10 participants each) with osteoarthritis. Each cohort will have 8 participants on AKP-11 and 2 participants on placebo. 
PART B will select the dose identified in PART A and will be conducted with treatment over 21 days in 80 participants with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gout. The dose of AKP-11 will be selected after the safety profile and efficacy of AKP-11 has been determined (dose selected will be in the range of 3 to 6%). The participants will be randomized to receive AKP-11 or Placebo in a ratio of 1:1.
PART A: 20 osteoarthritis participants
PART B: 80 arthritis participants 
The participants will return all used and unused sachets to the study staff for accountability purposes.</interventions>
    <comparator>A  0.5 g of placebo gel, containing  ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, propylene glycol, water and hydroxyethyl cellulose, will be topically applied 4 times a day (total daily application of 2 g).  4 Participants will be treated with placebo for 7 days in Part A and 40 participants will be treated for 21 days in Part B.</comparator>

The joint swelling will be assessed on site visits using a 4-point severity scale, where 0 is no swelling and 3 is severe swelling. The joint tenderness will be assessed on site visits using a 4-point severity scale, where 0 is no pain and 3 is severe pain, when touched.</outcome>

The AUSCAN questionnaire consists of 15 items of daily activity and will be completed by participants who have arthritis on their hands, as a treatment area.

    <summary>A primary purpose of this study is to evaluate  Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Topical AKP-11 Administration to Participants with Arthritis. AKP-11 is a Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) agonist developed to treat multiple pathological events common in arthritis. The study consists of 2 parts: PART A investigates two doses of AKP-11  over 7 days in 20 participants (2 cohorts of 10 participants each) with arthritis. Each cohort will have 8 participants on AKP-11 and 2 participants on placebo. PART B will select the dose identified in PART A and will be conducted with treatment over 21 days in 80 participants with arthritis, The dose of AKP-11 will be selected after the safety profile and efficacy of AKP-11 has been determined. The participants will be randomized to receive AKP-11 or Placebo in a ratio of 1:1.
