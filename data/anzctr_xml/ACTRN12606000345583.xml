  <interventions>
    <interventions>NV-196  capsules -oral dosage formulation
There is no dose increments. We have acute dosing and chronic dosing.
Acute dosing  on day 1- 100 mg once a day
Chronic dosing starts on day 3 up to day 8 in the morning. On days 3 to 7 - patients will have 100 mg three times per day  and on day 8 the last dose - 100 mg only in the morning.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients meeting all of the following criteria will be considered for admission to the study:a)Patients must have a solid malignancy that has become stable on current treatment. For the purposes of this study, stable disease is defined as no change of anti-cancer therapy within the last 28 days (hormone therapy or on observation), not including supportive therapies. Patients just completing chemotherapy or radiotherapy are eligible, provided these treatments were last administered more than 28 days prior to NV-196 administration.b) Patients must be able to understand the risks and benefits of the study and give written informed consent to participation. c)Patients must have an estimated life-expectancy of at least 3 months. d)Patients must have: acceptable renal and hepatic function evidenced by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl and serum transaminase levels less than or equal to 3 x the upper limit of normal for the reference laboratory bilirubin &lt; 20 micro mol/L,adequate haematological function. e)Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of at least 60%. f)Patients of childbearing potential must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception. g)Patients have no evidence of central nervous system malignancy.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study represents the second stage in the clinical development of NV-196.
 
The purpose of this study is to deliver the drug over a longer period of time in order (a) to identify a dosage regimen that will deliver a steady state  level of drug in the blood, and (b) to characterise the safety profile of the drug.</summary>
