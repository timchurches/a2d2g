  <interventions>
    <interventions>Five manual ventilations administered by anaesthetist at the end of the intra-abdominal phase of laparoscopic gastric band surgery. The anaesthetist will switch the circuit over from ventilator mode to manual mode and administer manual ventilations via the standard 3L bag in the circuit. The intrapulmonary pressure will be monitored via the manometer in the circuit. The five ventilations will be administered sequentially over a 30 second period. The lungs will deflate passively between  the administered breaths. We expect this manoeuvre to aid in expulsion of the insufflating carbon dioxide in the peritoneal cavity at the end of surgery before skin closure. A reduced volume of this carbon dioxide may result in less shoulder pain post-operatively.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard intra-operative and post-operative analgesia. Patients recieve 200 micrograms fentanyl divided between induction and pre-emergence. Parecoxib 40 milligrams intravenous injection (ivi) and paracetamol 1000 milligrams intravenous infusion (ivi) are administered during the maintenance phase of anesthesia. Post operatively in the Post Operative Care Unit a fentanyl pain protocol is employed - 20 micrograms boluses every three  minutes (q3min) until pain control or to a maximum of 200 micrograms at which point the anaesthetist is contacted for review and further orders. Once the patient is deemed suitably controlled from their pain, they are released to the Post Operative Surgical ward where a regimen of oral paracetamol, oral non-steroidals and 
'as required' oral oxycodone is charted.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The process of laparoscopy can result in shoulder pain post-operatively, apart from what is performed surgically. This pain is thought to be from the gas used to inflate the abdomen. We propose to test a manoeuvre, recently reported to be successful for reducing this pain in another patient group, in our obesity surgery patients. The manoeuvre is a series of five manual "breaths" near the end of surgery which may help to expel the inflating gas from the abdomen, and leave less of the gas to irritate the abdominal lining post operatively, which is felt as shoulder pain.</summary>
