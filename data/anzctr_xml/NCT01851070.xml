    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of the safety of a single IV infusion of allogeneic MPCs compared to placebo at 12 weeks post-infusion - To evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) compared to placebo at 12 weeks post-infusion in the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have received methotrexate +/- other oral DMARDs for at least 6 months and who have had an incomplete response to at least one course of a TNFa inhibitor.
Overall safety will be based on the overall assessment of AE/SAEs, Vital Signs, Physical Examination, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, pulmonary function tests and Chest x-ray.</outcome>
