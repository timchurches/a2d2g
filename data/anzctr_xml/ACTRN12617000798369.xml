The sessions will be conducted in the ED conference room between the hours of 2pm and 3pm two afternoons per week. This time has been selected as it should minimise impact on clinical care and will also allow for completion of the program as part of work hours rather than in addition to current work schedule of already busy staff.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stress is very common in nursing and has a number of adverse consequences. The aim of this study is to pilot the feasibility of a brief workplace wellness intervention to emphasize the development of behaviours to strengthen the physical and mental health of emergency nurses.

In this randomised controlled trial participants will be allocated to either control or intervention. The intervention group will receive a 5 week series of 1 hour classes guided by a Clinical Psychologist which teaches strategies to enhance resilience. Participants will be surveyed prior to starting the program, at the completion of the program and again 3 months later to assess the effect of the intervention on stress, professional quality of life, workplace engagement and resilience.</summary>
