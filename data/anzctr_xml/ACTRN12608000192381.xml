    <interventions>A randomized trial of the Shyness Program, a six lesson Internet-based treatment program for people with social phobia, that includes therapist support, vs the Shyness Program, but without therapist support.  All participants will meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual - 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for social phobia.  The Shyness Treatment program is an effective Internet-based treatment program for social phobia (Titov et al, 2008a, 2008b).  This program involves four components: 6 on-line lessons ; homework assignments; participation in an on-line discussion forum, and regular email contact with a therapist.  Once the two treatment groups have completed the Shyness Program (8 - 10 weeks) the Waitlist Control group will begin the program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment using the Shyness Program vs the Shyness Program but without therapist support.  The Control Group will complete the study measures at the same time points as the treatment groups (about 10 weeks apart).  Once the treatment groups have completed the program the control group will begin the full Shyness program.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our previous research indicates that the Shyness Program, an Internet-based treatment program for people with social phobia, is effective at helping people to learn to manage their symptoms of social phobia.  

The study described here aims to find out whether therapist support is required for people to successfully complete the Shyness Program.

We expect that people completing the Shyness Program without therapist support will still benefit, but not as much as those receiving the usual levels of therapist support.</summary>
