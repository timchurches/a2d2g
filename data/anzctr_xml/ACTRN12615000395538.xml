    <interventions>Human monoclonal antibody (IgG1), m102.4 
Subjects will be dosed with four IV concentrations of monoclonal antibody m102.4 across five cohorts (8 participants in each cohort). The first four cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 4) will receive a single, IV infusion of mAb m102.4 at a concentration of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg over a period of 1 hour.  The fifth cohort (Cohort 5) will receive two IV infusions of mAb m102.4 at a concentration of 20 mg/kg given over the period of 1 hour, with 72 hours between each infusion

      <timepoint>Safety assessments (pathology, vital signs &amp; ECG) for Cohort 1-4 will be conducted upon admission to the CRU, at baseline (Day 1) and during the clinical stay.  Subjects will return to the CRU on Days 4, 6, 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 85 and 113 for PK and immunogenicity sampling and/or safety assessments.

Safety assessments for Cohort 5 will be conducted upon admission to the CRU, at baseline (Day 1) and during the clinical stay.  Subjects will return to the CRU on Days 7, 9, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39, 53, 67, 95 and 123 for PK and immunogenicity sampling and/or safety assessments.
The final safety assessment is scheduled for a maximum of 16 weeks after the last dose of IP.  This is based on a mAb m102.4 tÂ½ of 21-23 days.

    <concealment>Subjects will be assigned a sequential screening number at their Screening visit.  Eligible subjects be randomized on the morning of Day 1 and will be allocated a randomization number.  Each subject will have a corresponding IP or placebo allocated on the randomization list.  The two sentinel subjects in each cohort will be dosed first.  In accordance with the randomization list one subject from the sentinel pair will receive IP and the other will receive placebo.  The remaining six subjects per cohort will be randomized to receive either IP or placebo in a 5:1 ratio. For each cohort, a set of sealed, opaque, tamper-evident Individual Codebreak Envelopes will be prepared and provided to the Site. In order to maintain the study blind the randomization list will only be available to the un-blinded pharmacist and will be held in a secure location with restricted access</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be allocated their treatment according to a computer generated randomisation schedule. The generation of the Randomisation List for each cohort will be performed using SAS Registered Trademark v9.4 or later</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hendra Virus Monoclonal Antibody (mAb m102.4) is an experimental drug product which is administered through a drip (infusion) into a vein in the forearm. It is a human monoclonal antibody which has been man-made and is being developed as a potential treatment for Hendra virus infection. This product is not a vaccine against Hendra virus infection.

The purpose of this study is to test the safety of monoclonal antibodies designed to act against Hendra virus.
Our aim is to find out more about mAb m102.4 when it is administered to healthy individuals.

The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mAb m102.4. That is to find out how it makes people feel and whether there are any side effects or changes to laboratory results. We will also determine the amount of mAb m102.4 in your blood at various times during the study, its effect on your immune system as well as the extent of its anti-virus activity.</summary>
