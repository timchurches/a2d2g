  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness and safety of the combination of the
      study drugs cetuximab and erlotinib in patients with advanced (metastatic) refractory
      colorectal (bowel) cancer. If bowel cancer has spread to other organs (metastatic colorectal
      cancer), it is usually incurable and life-expectancy without treatment is less then 6 months
      on average. Currently, chemotherapy has been shown to have a significant impact in advanced
      colorectal cancer in terms of maintenance of quality of life and extension of survival.
      However, ultimately tumours will develop resistance to chemotherapy. Treatment options and
      subsequent survival at that stage are very limited. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are
      urgently needed.

      It is common for colorectal cancer cells to contain growth receptors, like antennae, on their
      surface which regulate their growth. The drugs used in this trial have been shown to be
      effective in targeting one of these growth receptors; the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR). Cetuximab is an antibody (protein produced by the immune system involved in the
      defense of the body against infections) against EGFR. Cetuximab has been shown to improve the
      survival of patients with chemotherapy refractory advanced colorectal cancer. Erlotinib is a
      protein that prevents activation and hence signaling by EGFR. Erlotinib improves survival in
      patients with advanced lung cancer. Although, each of these drugs are known to be effective
      at inhibiting EGFR when they are given alone, at least in some cases, it is hoped that using
      two drugs that target the same receptor pathway in different ways will provide a more
      effective treatment.

      50 patients from four hospitals in Australia will participate in this trial, with
      approximately 25 patients being enrolled at Austin Health. All participants will receive the
      same treatment.

      Neither of the study drugs are chemotherapy, and hence it is expected that the treatment
      would be well tolerated. The most frequent side effect associated with EGFR inhibitors is
      skin rash. Other possible side effects are diarrhea and low magnesium levels.</summary>
