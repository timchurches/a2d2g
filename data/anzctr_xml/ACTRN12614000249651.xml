  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be instructed to self-administer Electrostimulation Therapy using a small portable device four times daily for 20 minute sessions, over a period of 8 weeks. The device will be pre-set to a single, non-adjustable specific low frequency found between 1-2 Hertz, a current that specifically targets smooth muscle to promote stimulation of arterial, venous and lymphatic systems. Adherence will be monitored using a self-report participant treatment log.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both control and active intervention groups will continue the standard treatment they are currently using: no compression or low compression therapy (&lt;18mmHg; light or extra light compression).
Participants allocated to the control group will use the Electrostimulation Therapy as recommended for the same duration and mode of administration as the intervention group. Participants in the control group will however be provided with placebo devices that although they appear to be operational, the circuit to deliver the Electrostimulation will be non-operational.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was not drawn from a power analysis rather it is an indicative sample to enable determination of an effect size.
Data collected will be entered directly into SPSS database. A 10 per cent validation of all data will be undertaken.  Generation of effect sizes will be based on two-way repeated measures analysis of variance tests for wound healing rate.  Analysis will be in accordance with intention to treat with additional consideration of a complete case analysis. A modified intention-to-treat analysis will also be conducted to indicate of the effects associated with the treatment.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Leg ulcers have a big impact on the lives of those affected. Compression therapy is recommended to help heal an ulcer but many people find it difficult to wear high or moderate compression therapy products. Electric stimulation therapy has been used by physiotherapists to improve circulation in the legsthe goal of compression therapy. This study has been developed as a small clinical trial that will see if electric stimulation therapy can help heal ulcers and will help determine if further large clinical trials are worthwhile.</summary>
