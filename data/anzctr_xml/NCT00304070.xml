  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - doxorubicin hydrochloride
Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - mitotane
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Other interventions - filgrastim

Experimental: Stratum I (surgery, observation) - Patients undergo conventional surgery (primary tumor resection and retroperitoneal lymph node sampling) followed by observation. Patients who have undergone prior surgery without nodal sampling undergo observation only.

Experimental: Stratum II (exploratory surgery, observation) - Patients undergo conventional surgery (primary tumor resection and extended regional lymph node dissection) followed by observation. Patients who have undergone prior surgery with simple resection of the primary tumor undergo exploratory surgery with extended regional lymph node dissection followed by observation.

Experimental: Stratum III (chemotherapy, surgery) - Patients receive combination chemotherapy with a total of 8 cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin, etoposide and doxorubicin hydrochloride, filgrastim (G-CSF). The first 2 to 4 cycles are called the induction phase, followed by mitotane alone for an additional 2 months. Some patients undergo conventional surgery after chemotherapy course 2 or 4. Some patients undergo additional conventional surgery after finishing all chemotherapy.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Five Year Event-free Survival (EFS) - The model used for comparison will be an exponential model with a constant failure rate of 0.053 (stratum I), 0.347 (stratum II), 0.602 (stratum III and IV) per year for the first two years and 0 after that. The one-sample one-sided log-rank test comparing the observed data with the hypothesized model (Woolson, 1981) of size 0.05 will be used to assess whether the data are consistent with the target models. Since this test has independent increments, the method of Lan and DeMets will be used to derive the p-values for testing procedure.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III clinical trial is studying how well cisplatin-based chemotherapy and/or
      surgery works in treating young patients with stage I, stage II, stage III or stage IV
      adrenocortical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal
      tissue that needs to be removed. Giving it after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain
      after surgery.</summary>
