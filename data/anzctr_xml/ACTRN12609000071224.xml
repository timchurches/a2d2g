  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of primary motor cortex using a saline-soaked pair of surface sponge electrodes at constant current intensity of 2 milliamps for 20 minutes administered daily during 2 x 5 day periods separated by 4 weeks without treatment. The site of electrode placement will be determined using a standard Electroencephalography (EEG) head cap used to position EEG recording electrodes. The anode electrode will be placed over C3 or C4 (using EEG 10/20 system) and the cathode electrode over the contralateral supraorbital area (i.e. above the opposite eye socket).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre- and post-treatment to investigate brain alterations associated with reduction in pain intensity using tDCS. Functional MRI (fMRI) and structural imaging performed prior to and immediately following each treatment week and at 10 weeks and 6 months follow-up after study commencement.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control (sham) stimulation in which transcranial direct current stimulation will be delivered for 30 seconds using surface sponge electrodes placed in the same positions as for active stimulation and then discontinued for the remainder of the 20 minute treatment session. All subjects will receive both real and sham stimulation, each comprising 5 daily sessions with a "washout" period of 4 weeks between them (i.e. all subjects will receive the active treatment in one 5 day treatment period and the placebo treatment in the other 5 day treatment period).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain, particularly neuropathic pain, is a common and debilitating consequence of spinal cord injury. Despite the high prevalence and severity of pain, there are currently no available treatments that provide consistent or satisfactory relief. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe non-invasive brain stimulation technique that may be helpful in reducing pain following spinal cord injury. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS as a treatment for spinal cord injury neuropathic pain. Subjects will undergo 10 tDCS treatment sessions over a period of 5 weeks as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans prior to and immediately following each treatment week, and at 10 weeks and 6 months after study commencement. The technique is not painful and no serious side effects have been reported. Our hypothesis is that tDCS will provide relief of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. If proven effective, tDCS may provide a much needed non-invasive alternative treatment for patients with persistent spinal cord injury neuropathic pain.</summary>
