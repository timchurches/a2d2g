  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 week, 24 session mixed modality exercise program.
Aerobic exercise conducted on treadmills and cycle ergometers; strength training on fixed weight machines.
Aerobic exercise intensity: 60% heart rate reserve.
Duration: 30 minutes per session, one-on-one supervision with a clinical exercise physiologist.
A log of adherence outside of the sessions was not kept.
The clinical exercise physiologist asked questions about general adherence at each session.  
Exercise outside of the supervised sessions will be encouraged. The type, duration and frequency will be individualised based on each participant's fitness level and level of disability.
The general recommendation is 30 minutes of aerobic exercise e.g., walking or swimming on days when not attending the clinic.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise as a management tool for people with osteoarthritis has been mainly studied using randomized clinical trial designs where exercise is delivered in a similar dose, intensity, and type to all participants. The hypothesis we tested was that people with osteoarthritis of the knee improve their aerobic fitness and quality of life as a result of an individualised exercise program. We prescribed aerobic and strength training that was appropriate for each persons capability, and measured changes in aerobic fitness, pain and quality of life factors. The study outcomes supported the hypothesis.</summary>
