  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial aims primarily to assess the value of two different policies for control of influenza outbreaks in aged-care facilities using the licensed antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu). The study will be carried out for three years (three influenza seasons). Early case detection and early use of treatment will apply to both trial arms. The main comparison will be between using oseltamivir for treating influenza-infected people only, compared with using oseltamivir for treating the sick and also offering it for influenza prophylaxis during an influenza outbreak.

The participating ACFs will be randomly allocated to either one of the two arms before the influenza season: 

Arm 2: The treatment plus prophylaxis arm  oral Oseltamivir will be offered to staff and residents for treatment as above, and for prophylaxis of influenza to well staff and residents for 10 days (75mg daily) who have consented to participate and may have been exposed to the sick persons in the ACF where the influenza outbreak occurs.

Dosage interval will be doubled if the participant has severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10-30ml/min). Oseltamivir will not be used if the participant has end-stage renal failure or creatinine clearance is &lt;10ml/min.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 1: The treatment only arm  oral Oseltamivir treatment for 5 days (75mg b.d.) will be offered to staff and residents who have consented to participate and are diagnosed with influenza within 48 hours from onset of symptoms.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Influenza (the flu) may cause mild to severe illness, and some people, including older people, are at a higher risk for death and serious complications. Flu is easier to catch where people live in communities like aged-care facilities (ACFs). This trial aims primarily to assess the value of two different policies for control of influenza outbreaks (when several people get infected at the same time) in ACFs using the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu). It is licensed for treating and preventing flu. This research will help to find out the benefits of starting the drug treatment early for people who have flu, compared with starting the drug treatment early for people who have flu, and also giving the drug to well people in the aged care facility who have been exposed to the sick people. The study will be carried out for three years (three influenza seasons) commencing in 2006.</summary>
