  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following an 8-week waiting period, participants will undergo an 8-week exercise and balance training intervention consisting of three weekly 45-60 minute exercise sessions. For the first 4 weeks of the intervention, 2 weekly sessions will be conducted under 1 on 1 supervision by Accredited Exercise Physiologists, with 1 weekly session conducted at a time and place of the participants choosing. The final 4 weeks will consist of 1 supervised and 2 unsupervised weekly exercise sessions. Exercise intensity will be individually suited to each participant and progressively increased over the course of the intervention. Each exercise session will consist of approximately 10-20 minutes of cardiovascular exercise (cycle ergometer or treadmill), 20 minutes of strength training (leg press, squat, step-ups, and targeted lower leg exercises using weight machines, dumbbells, or therabands for resistance), and 15-20 minutes of balance training exercise (walking with narrow base of support and single leg standing on stable and labile surfaces, with and without visual feedback). Adherence will be monitored through an attendance log for supervised sessions and a self-report participant exercise diary for unsupervised sessions.</interventions>

A priori covariates including chemotherapy dose, chemotherapy drug, and time from cessation of treatment to baseline time-point will be included in the analysis. Changes in functional (gait &amp; balance), neurophysiologic, and quality of life outcomes will be compared across the three time-points of the study to assess effects of the 8-week exercise intervention vs. the naturally occurring adaptive improvements of the 8-week inactive control period. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of an exercise and balance training intervention in patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) on functional, neurophysiological, and quality of life outcomes. 

Who is it for? 
Cancer survivors at least 3 months-post treatment, aged 18 or over, and with grade 2 or 3 CIPN.

Study details 
All participants in this study will first complete an 8 week wait period to assess the rate of adaptive improvements occurring 'naturally' (e.g. without an exercise intervention). Participants will then complete an 8 week exercise program involving a combination of supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions, totaling three 45-60 minutes sessions per week. Sessions will include a combination of cardiovascular training, strength training and balance training. Participants will be asked to complete a number of assessments and questionnaires at enrolment, after the 8 week wait period and again after the 8 week exercise program. Assessments will include physical function tests, nerve testing, and quality of life questionnaires. This pilot study is being conducted to provide insight regarding the efficacy of exercise and balance training for the treatment of CIPN.</summary>
