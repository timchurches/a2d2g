  <interventions>
    <interventions>Determine the effect of Mycophenolate Sodium  (MPS)on clinical improvement in patients with Lupus Nephritis  by measuring drug levels.
Drug levels measured: Mycophenolic acid(MPA) , derivative of MPS.
Partipants in this arm will receive MPS according to drug levels .
Oral MPS dose will be modified according to Area Under Curve(AUC 0-12). MPS dosage will be adjusted to AUC 40mg/L.h to 60mg/L h. The dosage will be reduced if the AUC is above 60 mg/L h. The dosage will be reduced once there is complete remission to maintain an AUC to 30 to 50 mg/L h.
MPS will be adminstered orally twice daliy  to achieve this levels. 
MPS will be continued for a total period of 12 months.
Sixteen partipants will be receiving MPS dosage based on drug levels to acheive remission of Lupus Nephritis .

Drug Level measurement: Blood samples will be collected at 15 time points for 8 hourly sampling, and where patients consent, 17 samples for 12 hours sampling (including time points from previously described Limited sample strategy  (LSS)data for mycophenolate sodium at 0, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours post-dose - as suggested by He et al in their  unpublished data,  that an AUC from 0-8 hours can be calculated with four blood samples and correlates favourably with an AUC0-12 
 
Samples for the 8 hour sample collected will be collected at 0 (pre-dose fasted), 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7 and 8 hours.
Samples for the 12 hour sample collected will be collected at 0 (pre-dose fasted), 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7 and 8, 10 and 12 hours.

Samples will be kept on ice until centrifugation (3000rpm for 10-minutes) and will then be analysed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography at Pathology Queensland (Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital, Herston, Australia).</interventions>
    <comparator>Sixteen participants will be enrolled in this arm. MPA drug levels will be measured but the participants will receive a fixed dose of the MPS

Dose: Oral MPS 30mg/kg body weight /day.MPS will be adminstered orally twice daliy in equal doses.
MPS dosage will be reduced by 180 mg bd on achieving complete remission  or if there are side effects such as diarrhea, leucopenia ( total white cell count &lt;3500/mm3 or opportunistic infections.

MPS will be continued only on a fixed dosage to acheive remission for a total period of 12 months. 

These patients also will have MPA drug levels measured but the treating doctor will be blinded to the levels.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The drug Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was introduced into routine clinical practice in 1995 to prevent the rejection of kidney transplants in the USA and in Europe in 1996. A second formulation of its active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), became available as an enteric-coated tablet called mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS). and clinical trials showed that EC-MPS was as effective and safe as MMF. Equipotent doses of EC-MPS and MMF result in equivalent amounts of active metabolite ie MPA in the blood. On this basis MMF was trialled in patients with autoimmune and several immunologically mediated renal diseases. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that MMF was not only better at gaining control of severe lupus nephritis (LN), an immunologically mediated kidney disease,, but also caused fewer side effects than the historically best treatment of pulsed cyclophosphamide.
Up to 2 g of MMF each day were initially used to treat LN. Subsequent dosing regimens started with 2g MMF/day but subsequently titrated up to a maximum of 3 g/day . In one study a median dosage of 42mg/kg body weight MMF was used for 20-24 weeks and most patients (91.3%) tolerated MMF doses of up to 2.5-3.0 g/day.  MMF 1000mg equates to about 720mg of MPS . 
However the amount of MPA in the blood varies from patient to patient. The factors causing these differences have been studied in transplant patients but not in LN patients. Nor has the relationship between MPA concentration and its effect on the kidney disease been described in LN patients. We propose using therpeutic drug monitoring of MPS to
1) describe any interpatient variability in MPA blood concentrations among LN patients treated with MPS
2) correlate dose used with its efficacy and safety and 
3) explore the relationship between treatment failures and underdosing of MPS in patients with LN. 
The results of these studies will tell us whether we ought to change our clinical practice, specifically whether therapeutic drug monitoring, not currently done, and consequent personalisation of MPS doses ought to become part of how we manage LN.</summary>
