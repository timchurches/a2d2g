    <concealment>Potential participants will be sent an information sheet about the study and informed consent will be obtained prior to treatment on the day of the first study visit. All participants will receive the control treatment first, and then the remote ischaemic preconditioning one week later, therefore there are no procedures in place for allocation of patients to treatment groups or concealment of treatment.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The study is similar in design to a crossover trial; however, because the effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning have been reported to persist for several weeks, the trial has been designed such that all subjects receive the control treatment first, and the preconditioning seven days later.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is evidence that remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) protects organs from the effects of decreased blood supply during procedures such as heart surgery. Currently it is not known how this protection occurs, but it appears that RIPC may affect inflammation. This study will investigate the effects of RIPC on the immune system in healthy volunteers. The RIPC takes 30 minutes in total and involves inflation of a blood-pressure cuff on the upper arm for five minutes, temporarily preventing blood flow, followed by deflation for five minutes. This process is repeated three times. Participants will undergo a control session where a blood pressure cuff will be placed on the upper arm for 30 minutes without inflation. Seven days later a treatment session will take place where the blood pressure cuff is placed on the same arm and RIPC is performed. At each of these sessions samples of blood will be collected prior to placement of the blood pressure cuff, and at 20 minutes, 1 hour and 4 hours following. Blood will be analysed by looking for changes in immune cells and markers of inflammation.</summary>
