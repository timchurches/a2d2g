  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group will be taught the orthodontic toothbrushing technique, which is designed by combining the horizontal strokes and a bite and wiggle motion behind arch wires. 
Briefly, the toothbrush was firstly placed gingival to the brackets and angled 45 degrees towards the occlusal surface. The same motion was repeated with the bristles perpendicular to the labial surface of the brackets. Lastly, with the toothbrush perpendicular to the occlusal area of the brackets, the individual was asked to bite and wiggle. By biting on the toothbrush head, bristles entered into the space behind the arch wires and between the brackets.

An orthodontist will teach the toothbrushing techniques to participants during individual consultation at baseline. Each participants will be required to brush their teeth for 2 minutes and twice daily (in the morning and before sleeping) for 3 months. Patient's compliance will be assessed and monitored by checking the wear of their toothbrushes.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using SPSS (version 22.0. for Macintosh; IBM Corp.; Armonk, NY). An intention-to-treat analysis will be carried out, with aerror set to 0.05, using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare Plaque Index and Gingival Index at the baseline; and the Wilcoxon test will be used to assess Plaque Index and Gingival Index reduction at different time points. 

The calculation of sample size is based on previous estimates of plaque index variability (standard deviation = 0.4), of a similar population group requiring orthodontic treatment. With a-error set to 0.05 and ÃŸ error set to 0.20 (80% power), a total of 29 participants were required for each group to detect a plaque index reduction of 0.25. We aim to recruit a total of 60 participants based on these parameters and accounting for the possible dropouts during the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traditional tooth brushing techniques, such as the Modified Bass technique, are designed and aimed at the general population without orthodontic appliances. An effective tooth brushing technique for patients wearing orthodontic fixed appliances is still lacking.

We will design an Orthodontic tooth brushing technique to enhance the oral hygiene of patients with fixed orthodontic appliances, and compare its efficacy with that of the traditional Modified Bass technique.

This study will be conducted as a single blind randomised controlled clinical trial with two parallel arms. We will aim to recruit 60 patients. Plaque index (PI) and Gingival index (GI) will be used to assess the oral hygiene of participants. Outcome measurements will be taken at baseline (T0) and one-month (T1), two-month (T2), and three-month (T3) after the intervention.</summary>
