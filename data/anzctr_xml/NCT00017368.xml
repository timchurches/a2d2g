  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Transplant-related mortality - The endpoint used for early stopping rule 9.51 will be transplant-related mortality (TRM). A TRM is defined as any death occurring within 30 days after either the first or second HDC/SCR. The acceptable TRM rate is 7.5%. This rate is based on TRM rates previously observed in the prior CCG study 594, CCG study 3891, and POG study 9640 of 7%, 6%, and 0%, respectively.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of symptomatic CMV, disseminated adenovirus infection, or EBV-LPD - The endpoint to be used in assessing early stopping rule 9.52 will be the incidence of symptomatic CMV, disseminated adenovirus infection, or EBV-LPD. Patients with positive CMV antigenemia or CMV urine culture only (without symptoms of CMV infection), or patients who have a positive culture for adenovirus without evidence of dissemination, or patients with a positive EBV PCR who do not exhibit significant clinical signs (such as adenopathy) or symptoms will not trigger the stopping rule.</outcome>
      <timepoint />
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free Survival - Assessment of feasibility and toxicity at the end of the study is time to event. Time to event is defined as the time from registration on the study until the first of the following events occurs: relapse, progression, secondary malignancy, or death, including toxic death. If none of those events occurs, then the time of last contact with the patient is used. Time to event will be used to calculate the one-year Event-free Survival (EFS) rate.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. Peripheral
      stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating children who have newly diagnosed
      neuroblastoma.</summary>
