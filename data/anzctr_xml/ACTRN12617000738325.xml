  <interventions>
    <interventions>IDA1 Arm: 
- ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole Day 0, 
- permethrin Day 0 if excluded from ivermectin
IDA2 Arm: 
- ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole Day 0, ivermectin Day 8
- permethrin Day 0 and Day 8 if excluded from ivermectin

Details of dosing:
- ivermectin: 200 mcg/kg oral
- diethylcarbazine: 6mg/kg oral
- albendazole 400mg oral
- permethrin 5% cream topical: apply to whole body and wash off after 4hrs when less than 2 months; apply to whole body and wash off after 8hrs when 2 months and older.

Directly observed therapy (DOT) will be used for ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole. 
Instructions will be provided for application of permethrin cream when distributed but application will not be observed, since this is normally done at night to avoid inadvertent washing/rubbing off during daytime activities. Assistance by another person (household member/support person) will be required for application to ensure coverage of whole body.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the frequency, type, and severity of adverse events following triple drug therapy (IDA) compared to standard two drug therapy (DA) in LF infected and uninfected individuals in a community.

Participants will be interviewed and asked to report their general health status at baseline before receiving treatment and daily for the 2 days following treatment (Active Adverse Event Monitoring phase). For 3 to 7 days following treatment, anyone unwell the preceding day will be actively followed, other participants will be interviewed only if they feel unwell and present to the study team (Passive Adverse Event Monitoring phase). 
At any stage if they describe being unwell, further questions to determine type and severity of symptom(s) experienced will be asked and recorded according to pre-defined adverse event table. If moderate to severe symptoms they will have further medical assessments as required. 
The majority of adverse events expected are related to effective action of the medications on the parasites. Possible side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, painful glands groin/neck/armpits, itch, swelling, headache, joint pain, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting, racing heart or an allergic reaction (itchy rash, difficulty breathing, chest tightness and/or swelling face/tongue).

Methods of assessment:
LF infection status will be determined by Filiarial Test Strip (FTS) and microfilariae (mf) smears.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), scabies and soil transmitted helminths (STH) are common neglected tropical diseases affecting the people of Fiji. There is a dedicated LF eradication program supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), however scabies and STH are currently managed on an individual level with symptomatic treatment as required.
In an attempt to reduce the prevalence of LF globally, research is being undertaken into alternative, more effective treatment options. A recent study in Papua New Guinea demonstrated a new triple drug therapy (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole) is superior to the currently recommended two drug therapy (diethylcarbamazine and albendazole) used by WHO LF programs in the Pacific. However, adverse events were more frequent. Despite no serious adverse events being observed, it is necessary to conduct further studies to review the safety of this new triple therapy before it can be endorsed as an effective mass drug administration (MDA) regimen for LF in endemic countries. Fijis burden of LF, that has been recalcitrant to previous MDA with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole, make it an ideal site to obtain further efficacy and safety data of the triple therapy.
Ivermectin given to communities as MDA has been proven to be effective in reducing the community prevalence of scabies. What is not known is the effects of one dose versus two doses of ivermectin as MDA. This question will be reviewed within the design of the community randomised study. The prevalence of impetigo in a community is linked to scabies and this will also be reviewed.
Ivermectin and albendazole are both effective individually against STH. The effectiveness of this combination of treatment as MDA in Fiji for STH has not been studied. The effectiveness for the individual in the short-term and the community in the longer-term will be reviewed.
In addition, the acceptability and feasibility of the new therapy in communities at risk of these three diseases will be reviewed.</summary>
