  <interventions>
    <interventions>Descriptions of intervention(s) / exposure: The intervention group receive a self-directed illness self-management and coping skills training intervention, Coping-Together that aims to provide couples with the resources they need to confront the challenges posed by a cancer diagnosis. A holistic foundation underpins Coping-Together, including strategies to manage physical, social, psychological and existential cancer-related challenges. The core component of Coping-Together is a series of 6 booklets, each addressing one of the following challenges: 1) communicating with health care professionals, 2) making treatment-related decisions, 3) managing symptoms and side effects of treatment, 4) managing worries and emotions, 5) supporting your partner, and 6) accessing community support services. The Coping-Together booklets are complemented by multi-media resources, including a DVD, Relaxation CD and a website. The duration of the trial is 6 months, during which time participants (regardless of group allocation) will be asked to use the information resources they have been sent, complete follow-up surveys and participate in an orientation phone call/interview (duration approximately 5-10 minutes) to discuss their intended use of the resource material. 
The Coping-Together group also receives the Minimal Ethical Care control materials. In regards to resource use, couples are asked to use the resources as much as they can, however it is acknowledged that not all content will apply to every participant. It is therefore expected that the time spent using the intervention materials will vary from participant to participant. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Minimal Ethical Care: Couples randomly assigned to this group will receive their standard medical care, as well as a booklet from the Cancer Council NSW 'Understanding Cancer' series, the Caring for Someone with Cancer booklet, and a flyer for the Cancer Council helpline. Participants in this group also receive the orientation call as per the Coping-Together groups. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test the efficacy of Coping-Together  a couple-based self-directed, coping skills training intervention. It is anticipated that using the proposed Coping-Together skills will be associated with couples experiencing less anxiety. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible for the study if you have recently been diagnosed with Stage I, II or III breast, prostate or colorectal (bowel) cancer, or melanoma and are currently receiving or planning to receive treatment. Your partner must also be willing to participate and you must both be able to understand and complete surveys.

Trial details: 
You will be randomised to one of two treatment conditions, either the Coping-Together intervention or to the Minimal Ethical Care condition. The purpose of the study is to test the suitability of the information resources and assess which condition enhances illness adjustment and coping with cancer. All groups will be supplied with cancer and coping information, which participants work through at their own pace. 

What are you being asked to do? 
To participate in this study you will need to complete 4 surveys and receive an orientation call from research staff over a 6 month period. You are also asked to use the information resources provided as much as possible. </summary>
