  <interventions>
    <interventions>Posterior Group
The needle will be inserted at a point posteriorly and advanced anteriorly in the plane of the ultrasound (US) beam until the needle tip is visualised just lateral to the 2 most superficial elements of the brachial plexus.
In both groups, dextrose 5% 5-10 mL will be injected down the needle to observe for appropriate fluid spread adjacent to the brachial plexus trunks, and a non-stimulating catheter advanced 1-2 cm past the needle tip. If US imaging proves difficult, a brief appropriate muscle twitch will be sought with a nerve stimulator set to 0.8 mA to confirm brachial plexus position.</interventions>
    <comparator>Anterior Group

The needle will be inserted at a point approximately 3 cm cephalad to the level of sixth cervical vertebra (C6) at the posterior border of sternomastoid muscle. The bevel of the needle will be orientated laterally throughout. A 10-5 MHz linear US probe (Sonosite L38, Bothell, WA) will then be placed in the axial plane at the level of C6 (Sonosite Micromaxx, Bothell, WA). The needle will be advanced superficially in a caudal and peripheral direction until tissue displacement is observed just lateral to the 2 most superficial elements of the brachial plexus. 

Skin preparation and interscalene catheter (ISC) dressing management will be the same as for the 'posterior' group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this current study is to compare the 'in-plane' with 'out-of-plane' methods of ultrasound guided interscalene brachial plexus catheter placement for analgesia in patients having elective shoulder surgery.   We plan to assess the effectiveness of analgesia, side effects and patient satisfaction. There is controversy surrounding the best approach for placing these catheters, hence the reasons for doing the study.</summary>
