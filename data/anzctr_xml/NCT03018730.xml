  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open label switch over study to assess the safety and efficacy of PRX-102.
      Patients treated with agalsidase alfa for at least 2 years and on a stable dose (&gt;80%
      labelled dose/kg) for at least 6 months. Patients will be screened and evaluated over 3
      months while continuing on agalsidase alfa. Following the screening period, the patient will
      be enrolled and switched from their agalsidase alfa treatment to receive intravenous (IV)
      infusions of PRX-102 1 mg/kg every two weeks for 12 months. No more than 25% of treated
      patients will be female.</summary>
