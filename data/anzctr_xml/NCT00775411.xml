  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness as Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) at Week 4 - Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a laser based non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina, was performed on the study eye after pupil dilation at baseline and Week 4.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at Week 26 - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 26</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Fluorescein Leakage Improved, Unchanged and Worsened From Baseline as Assessed by Fluorescein Angiography at Week 26 - Fluorescein angiography (FA) is a technique for examining the circulation of the retina (and detecting any leakage) using a dye-tracing method. Photographs are taken with a specialized low-power microscope with an attached camera designed to photograph the interior of the eye, including the retina and optic disc. FA at Week 26 was compared to FA at Baseline. The percentage of participants in each of the following categories is reported: Improved (Leakage area decreased &gt;=10%), Unchanged (Leakage area changed &lt; 10%) and Worsened (Leakage area increased &gt;=10%).</outcome>

    <summary>The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the intravitreal dexamethasone implant as
      adjunctive therapy to Anti-VEGF treatment in the study eye of treatment naïve subjects with
      choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Subjects will be
      followed for 26 weeks.</summary>
