  <interventions>
    <interventions>Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor is a registered drug that is already widely used. The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of G-CSF in septic shock. The brand of G-CSF used for this trial is Lenogastrim produced by Merck Sharp and Dome. The participants in this study are randomised to receive either G-CSF (lenogastrim 263 mcg) or placebo (normal saline), intravenously, daily for 10 days. Study drug is discontinued if the participant is discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) before study day 10.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Study drug is prepared by the pharmacist away from ICU. Once prepared G-CSF and placebo look exactly the same. Study drug is prepared  5mls of clear fluid in a 5ml syringe. Each syringe is labeled with participants name and study number Each dose of study drug is delivered to the participants bay by the pharmacist. The syringes are transported from pharmacy to ICU in a sealed plastic box. On delivering study drug to the patients bay the pharmacist confirms participants details. The patients details are then reconfirmed by the nurse administrating the study drug.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation design with equal numbers allocated to each group at predetermined intervals. The random allocation is generated by computer software ie STATA version 7. No restrictions apply.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of adjunctive G-CSF therapy decreases mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients with septic shock. Patients are screened for eligibility to participate in the study. If all inclusion criteria are met and there are no exclusion criteria consent is obtained from the patients or next of kin. Once consent is obtained the ICU pharmacist is contacted and the patient is randomised to receive either G-CSF or placebo once a day for 10 days or until discharge from ICU if that is sooner. 
Data is collected on a daily basis whilst the patient is in ICU and following discharge from ICU the date of hospital discharge or death is obtained from the hospital patient records database.</summary>
