  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) is the most common major gynaecological
      operation in women in developed countries. In Queensland, 6000 women require a hysterectomy
      for irregular periods, benign tumours or pelvic pain every year. Surgical approaches to
      surgical removal of the uterus (womb) include Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (LH), Vaginal
      Hysterectomy (VH) and Abdominal Hysterectomy through an abdominal incision (AH).

      It is widely accepted that LH and VH are less invasive surgical procedures, cause less
      bleeding, surgical complications and pain and are associated with quicker recovery from
      surgery than the more invasive AH. In a clinical trial comparing LH and AH we recently
      demonstrated that LH outperforms AH with regards to cost effectiveness causing less total
      health-services cost than AH.

      Implementation of LH in Queensland could save $9.8 million every year. Despite the evidence
      for LH and VH, 2600 hysterectomies (43%) are still performed through an open, abdominal
      incision. In brief, a common but outdated operation is still performed regularly causing not
      only unnecessary pain, surgical adverse events and longer hospital stay but also increased
      healthcare costs.

      This study will assess reasons why a significant number of gynaecologists and patients prefer
      AH over LH (Barriers to the uptake of laparoscopic hysterectomy). We will survey specialist
      gynaecologists as well as patients who have had a hysterectomy for different health reasons.
      Based on the information from the survey the investigators will develop an intervention to
      increase the rate of laparoscopic hysterectomies in Queensland and pilot test it.</summary>
