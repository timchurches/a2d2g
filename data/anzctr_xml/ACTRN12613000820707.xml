  <interventions>
    <interventions>Contrast enhanced CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis is acquired by using single bolus (80ml at 3 ml/sec) contrast injection with the chest segment imaged in arterial phase while the abdomen/pelvis segment is imaged in the portal venous phase. The area in the lower chest and in the upper abdomen is imaged in both segments resulting in extra unnecessary radiation dose to the patient.
This method is the standard practice of performing a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.

The aim of this study is to change the imaging protocol for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis so that the radiation dose is reduced and to assess the image quality compared to the current imaging protocol.

Our study protocol involves one continuous scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with a pause after imaging the chest as described below.
It is achieved by administering the contrast in two doses, 65 ml for the first injection and 15ml for the second injection, in total 80 ml. The first injection is for the chest and the second for the abdomen and pelvis. There is a 13 second pause between the two injections and both are injected at 2.5 ml/sec. 
The lower chest and upper abdomen is therefore not imaged twice, as in the standard practice, reducing the radiation dose to the patient.
Our study protocol takes approximately 3 minutes to acquire the images, which is about twice as long as the standard practice.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who require new staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis and who have had previous CT chest/abdomen/pelvis imaging using the standard protocol will be selected for this study. 
The previous CT needs to have been performed within 1 year of the study CT protocol for the patient to be included in the study.
The image quality of the study protocol CT will be compared to their previous imaging and determine if imaging quality is not affected.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measure of the radiation dose reduction of a single pass chest/abdomen/pelvis CT protocol in oncology patients compared to a standard two stage arterial and venous phase imaging protocol.
Effective doses are calculated by multiplying a dose-length product (DLP) and a constant called Edlp. 
DLP is provided by CT software and recorded for every CT scan performed. 
Edlp depends on the region of body scanned but constant for that region and the type of CT scanner used.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1) Referred oncology patients undergoing staging contrast enhanced CT chest/abdomen/pelvis who have had previous CT chest/abdomen/pelvis imaging performed within 1 year.
2) Only adult patients (age &gt;/= 18) will be imaged using the proposed protocol.
3) Only outpatients will be included in the study.
4) Signed informed consent form.

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Oncology patients referred for non-enhanced CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for any reason and including contrast allergy and renal failure. 
2. Severe heart failure (this can impair adequate tissue contrast enhancement).
3. Extensive progression of cancer in the period between the two scans. This could prevent direct comparison image quality of the two scans.
4. Pregnancy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to determine the way to obtain the best possible images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with Computed Tomography (CT) that delivers the lowest amount of radiation to patients. We will be comparing the standard way we take images to a new protocol (protocol means the way the images are taken). 

The standard CT protocol of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is done in two steps, the chest and abdomen is scanned followed by the lower part of the abdomen and the pelvis. This results in a part of the abdomen being scanned twice. The new protocol that we would like to test takes all the images in one step, from the chest to the pelvis with no overlap. This is why the amount of radiation used can be reduced. 
The image quality of your CT using the new protocol will be compared to the image quality of the CT which was done with the standard protocol. If the image quality of this research protocol is deemed optimal, it may be adopted as the standard way of performing CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
