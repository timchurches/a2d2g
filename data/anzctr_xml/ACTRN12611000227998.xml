  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anaesthetist performed limited transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on prior to surgery.
a)approximate duration 20 minutes (including report)
b)on the same day of surgery</interventions>
    <comparator>Controls will get standard clinical assessment of cardiovascular function by the anaesthetist without TTE.
This is a routine assessment done by all anaesthetists on every patient prior to their anaesthesia (for all types of procedures including fractured neck of femur surgery). This assessment is not defined as every anaesthetist has their own method which is tailored to each individual patient (which depends on the patients health and the planned procedure). Subjects from both groups receive a standard cardiovascular examination by the anaesthetist but the TTE group receive a TTE and the control group do not. The TTE provides more accurate diagnostic information on the cardiovascular health of the patient.</comparator>

Documented:
-TTE, stress TTE, cardiac MRI, TOE or documented cardiology consultation within the past 6 months, 
-additional surgical procedures to be performed at the same time as the neck of femur,
-if the responsible anaesthetist insists on a TTE prior to surgery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the impact of anaesthetist-performed transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on the quality of recovery of patients undergoing fractured neck of femur surgery. 
It also aims to  collect data to determine if a future trail investigating whether or not TTE reduces patient mortality after surgery.</summary>
