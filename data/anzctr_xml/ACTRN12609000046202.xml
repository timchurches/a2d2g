All patients will be treated with phlebotomy and/or HU with the goal to reach and maintain the target HCT established by randomization.
Phlebotomy should be performed initially by removing 250-500 ml of every other day or twice a week until the target HCT is obtained.
HU should be administered initially at a dose of 0.5-1.0 g daily. The patient is followed with weekly blood counts adjusting dose to achieve a platelet count &lt; 400,000/mmc. If neutropenia occurs, the dose of HU should be lowered so as not to reduce leukocyte &lt; 3,500/mmc.
Blood counts at regular intervals (monthly) will establish the frequency of future phlebotomies with the goal to maintain the target HCT. Supplemental iron therapy should not be given.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction of Cardio Vascular deaths plus thrombotic events.
Fatal events, Total mortality includes: CV death: Death occurring within 28 days after the onset of the documented diagnosis of myocardial infarction or stroke, in the absence of any other evident cause; sudden deaths; deaths from heart failure; all other deaths classified as CV (e.g., International Classification of Disease, ninth edition, Clinical Modification [ICD9] codes 390-459, 798., 557.0, 362.3; 593.8). If the patient affected by a serious non CV disease died for CV event, the latter will be considered the cause of death. Death from malignancy (e.g., ICD9 codes 140.-239.; 238.4; 238.7; 289.8). Death from hematological malignancy (e.g., ICD9 codes 200.-208., 238.4, 289.8, 238.7). Death from PV-related malignancy: Death due to myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia. (e.g., ICD9 codes 289.8, 238.7, 204-208 [with the exception of 238.4, 204.1, 205.1, 206.1, 207.1, 208.1]).  Death from other hematological malignancy. Death due to non-PV-related malignancy (e.g., myeloma, lymphoma). Death from other malignancy: Death due to any other malignancy not included above. 	Other cause of death: Known cause of death not included above. Unknown cause of death

Non-fatal cardiovascular events, Myocardial infarction: Presence of at least two of the following: a) typical ischemic chest pain, pulmonary edema, syncope or shock; b) development of pathological Q-waves and/or appearance or disappearance of localized ST-elevation followed by T-wave inversion in two or more of twelve standard electrocardiograph leads; and c) increase in the concentration of serum enzymes consistent with MI (e.g. CreatineKinasi (CK) &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normality or elevation of levels of troponin). The diagnosis can be based also on necropsy findings of Miocardial Infarction (MI) of an age corresponding to the time of onset of symptoms.
Stroke (e.g., ICD9 codes 430.-434): A diagnosis of nonfatal stroke requires unequivocal signs or symptoms of a neurologic deficit with sudden onset and a duration of more than 24 hours. The diagnosis has to be confirmed with the use of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, or other objective means or on autopsy. These criteria are also used for the diagnosis of fatal stroke. Alternatively, we use the diagnosis reported in the hospital records or on the death certificate. 
Transient ischemic attack (e.g., ICD9 code 435): A transient ischemic attack is defined as the abrupt onset of unilateral motor or sensory disturbance, speech defect, homonymous hemianopia, constructional apraxia, or transient monocular blindness (defined as the abrupt onset of a unilateral decrease in visual acuity involving a portion or the entirety of the visual field) that resolved completely in less than 24 hours.
Pulmonary embolism. (e.g., ICD9 code 415.1): Pulmonary embolism is defined by a positive pulmonary angiogram, a ventilation?perfusion scan or CT scan indicating a high probability of pulmonary embolism, or evidence of pulmonary embolism on autopsy. Deep venous thrombosis is defined by a typical clinical picture with positive results on investigation involving such techniques as phlebography, ultrasonography, impedance plethysmography, or CT. 
Deep vein thrombosis (e.g., ICD9 codes 451.1; 452,453).
