  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to assess the effectiveness of progesterone (as luteal phase support) and amoxycillin (as a cervical mucus enhancer) for pregnancy achievement, in previously anovulatory women currently ovulating on clomiphene citrate (+/- metformin).

All women will be instructed in a fertility awareness-based method (the Sympto-Thermal Method).

It is hypothesised that:
1. Progesterone given as luteal phase support increases the likelihood of pregnancy in subfertile women receiving clomiphene citrate for anovulation.
2. Amoxycillin (as cervical mucus enhancer) plus progesterone (as luteal phase support) increases the likelihood of pregnancy in subfertile women receiving clomiphene citrate for anovulation.</summary>
