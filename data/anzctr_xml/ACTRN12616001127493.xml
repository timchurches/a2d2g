  <interventions>
    <interventions>The suboccipital inhibition technique* will be administered once to each participant
The approximate duration of this technique is 12 minutes. This durantion will be monitored.
The treatment will be administered by a physiotherapist and osteopath (same person) with 6 years experience.
If any subject isn't able to finish the whole protocol, he or she will be excluded.
*Suboccipital inhibition technique (modified by Upledger).
The patient lies on his/her back and the therapist sits behind his/her head.
1. Holding the patient head with both hands and touching the suboccipital tissues with fingertips 2 to 5. Gently, apply intentional force towards atlas posterior arc. Wait while the fingers get deep into the tissues and find the hard bone restriction of atlas.
2. Holding the same finger contacts, flex metacarpo-phalangical joints and straighten interphalangical joints to sustain the head that holds on the fingertips. Apply an intentional force towards glabela to ensure the work is on occipital-atlas space. Wait until head slides and settles on therapist hands.
3. Relax finger contacts and move second fingers to atlas transverse processes projection. Apply a very gentle mechanical distraction between occipital bone and atlas. Wait until tissue is relaxed.
4. Move second finger to join the others. Apply a very gentle transverse mechanical distraction until tissue is relaxed.
5. Apply an intentional cranial traction until viscolasticity is felt.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of this study is to assess postural changes produced after suboccipital inhibition technique in water polo players.
Good postural control in core, spine, scapula and shoulder is needed for water polo playing and training to avoid the most common shoulder injury. Muscles that are strongly recruited also take effect over cranio-cervical joints.
Incorrect posture observed in some sports men and women can induce certain injuries (mainly on shoulder in water polo players) because of bad mechanics. It may have an effect on sports performance.
Furthermore, the relationship between suboccipital muscles, propioceptive system and special sensory organs located in the head will have influence over posture and perception-action function (very important during play).
The main aim of this study is to assess postural changes produced after suboccipital inhibition technique in water polo players.
