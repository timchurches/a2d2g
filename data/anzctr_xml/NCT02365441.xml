    <summary>An open label randomised trial for adults with histologically confirmed measurable metastatic
      GIST who have received no other treatment for metastatic disease. The study aims to determine
      if an alternating regimen of imatinib and regorafenib has sufficient activity and safety in
      comparison to imatinib alone to warrant further evaluation as a first line treatment for
      metastatic GIST.</summary>
