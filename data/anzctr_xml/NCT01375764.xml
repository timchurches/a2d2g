    <summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of subcutaneous evolocumab (AMG
      145), compared with ezetimibe, on percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with hypercholesterolemia unable to tolerate an effective
      dose of a statin.</summary>
