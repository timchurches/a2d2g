  <interventions>
    <interventions>We are doing a retrospective study of the patients who have developed Q fever within last 10 years. We are looking at patients demographic profile, their previous medical conditions/surgeries/medication, their exposure risk factors (such as their property size, their occupation, their fence size, their exposure to animals), social history (drinking/smoking habits), and treatment they received for infection. This will be answered via a simple questionnaire, hopefully over the next few months. Patients complete questionnaire only once, and information provided within their answers should only be before or at time of diagnosis.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A validated questionnaire is being used to study the exposure risks. The name of the questionnaire is Q fever questionnaire which have both been approved by Townsville Human Research Ethics committee and Communicable Disease Unit in Townsville (see questionnaire which is attached to this registration record on the ANZCTR). This questionnaire was made by our own research group. These include their property size and fencing, their previous medical and surgical conditions, their medication, their occupation and exposure to any animals, and their drinking/smoking habits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>We have been granted approval by communicable disease unit and Townsville Human Research Ethics committee to have access to all patients who have developed Q fever within the last 10 years. Thus outcomes for each patient are assessed when they contracted the disease. Usually there a few cases annually. This information will be collected retrospectively via the questionnaire.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Study any underlying predisposing conditions for developing Q fever. These include diabetes, respiratory conditions such chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac conditions such as ischaemic heart disease or cardiac failure, immunocomprimised patients, pregnancy, liver disease, bone marrow diseases etc. We have created a data collection tool appropriate for our questionnaire, which is made via excel spreadsheet. From this data tool we will be able to graph, tabulate or use statistics to help us understand the epidemiological profile of the patients who have contracted Q fever within Mackay Health District, which may lead to understand any trends in developing the disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint> It depends on when the patient contracted the infection (which is released by the communicable disease unit), and the patient will write this in on their questionnaire. Data will be collected retrospectively via the questionnaire that will be sent out to participants.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the highly infectious agent Coxiella Burnetti. This agent is transmitted via animals urine, faeces and bodily fluids in which they dry up and become contaminated dust in air. Humans contract this intracellular bacterium via the respiratory route, as they breathe the contaminated air. Literature provides some ideas on the exposure risks for developing Q fever such as; being a farmer, sheep and dairy workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers, and many more. However not much has been shown on specific animals transmitting Q fever, especially the comparison of the well-established risk of exposure to cattle verse the native mammals such as macropods. In addition acute Q fever can develop into chronic Q fever within some patients, thus creating an array of complications such as endocarditis, pneumonia, hepatitis, pregnancy related problems, and meningitis. These complications delineate the importance of identifying the exposure risks in order to develop possible preventative regimes against Q fever.

In the setting of a regional and rural population consisting of approximately 160,000 people which is mainly known for its mining, farming, cane-farming industry as well as its diverse native fauna, it is interesting in analysing the different exposure risks for developing Q fever. This exposure ranges from contact with different animals (such as sheep, cattle, macropods), living in different climates (such as wet and dry season) and those within different professions (such as farming, cane-farming, meat workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers). In addition, the study will hopefully illustrate any underlying medical conditions which may predispose patients to contracting Q fever. Researching both of these outcomes will help create a risk profile for humans in developing Q fever.
