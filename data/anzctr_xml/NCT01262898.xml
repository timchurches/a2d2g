    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastric Half Emptying Time (GEt1/2) - Gastric half emptying time is the time taken for half the contents of the stomach to empty. Gastric emptying was measured using the 13C-oral breath test, which is a tracer method that utilizes 13C, a non-radioactive isotope. Basal breath samples were obtained after an overnight fast or otherwise after 4 hours of fasting following a light meal. On Day 1 and Day 28, participants were then dosed with GSK962040 and additional breath test samples were taken prior to administration of a 13C-labelled test meal. The test meal was consumed approximately 80 minutes(min) later. After consumption of the test meal, breath samples were collected at pre-specified time points over an approximately 4 hour period following the test meal. For the duration of the breath test, no food or drink were allowed. The 13C breath content was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. GE t1/2 was determined by using the cumulative percentage of the administered dose of 13C excreted in breath over 4 hours.</outcome>

Each subscale was scored on a severity scale of 0 (none) to 5 (very severe), with lower scores representing less symptom severity. The change from Baseline to each study week in average score was derived and if it improved by 1 point or more, that participant was defined as "responder" for that symptom and on that particular week.

The WMC was ingested immediately following the standard test meal for the oral breath test. Data was collected on a data logger, which was worn on a belt clip. The WMC passed naturally in the participant's stools between 2 and 5 days after ingestion.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GSK962040 is a novel small molecule motilin agonist. The Phase I studies (MOT107043 and
      MOT109681) demonstrated that single doses of GSK962040 up to 150 mg and repeat dosing of up
      to 125 mg/day for 14 days were well tolerated with adverse events not occurring in greater
      prevalence than placebo, and no significant abnormal vital sign, ECG, or clinical laboratory
      findings. Pharmacokinetic parameters were linear and approximately dose proportional over the
      range of doses administered. Single doses of 50 mg - 150 mg GSK962040 significantly increased
      the rate of gastric emptying up to 40% as measured by the 13C octanoic acid stable isotope
      breath test. A similar effect of 50 mg and 125 mg on gastric emptying was observed throughout
      repeated dosing to healthy volunteers for 14-days.

      The aims of the present investigation (MOT114479) are to assess the pharmacodynamic effects
      (gastric emptying and symptoms), safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GSK962040
      after 28 days of once-daily dosing in Type I and Type II diabetic subjects with
      gastroparesis. An additional aim is to characterize the dose/exposure - pharmacodynamic
      effect relationship.</summary>
