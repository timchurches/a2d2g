    <interventions>Other interventions - Early enteral feeding

No Intervention: Fasting with intravenous fluids - The child will be kept fasted. Intravenous fluids will be at a rate and type as directed by the treating clinician. A low fat oral diet will be commenced once abdominal pain resolves and serum amylase/lipase levels decrease from the peak levels as per treating clinician. In the event that the patient is unable to tolerate oral feeding, tube feeding or parenteral nutrition may be commenced based on the clinical decision of the treating clinician(s). This will be recorded as an adverse event. Patients will be re-trialed on oral feeds once initial limiting symptoms or factors have improved or settled as per treating clinician's discretion

Experimental: Early enteral feeding - Patients will commence on an unrestricted oral diet within 24 hours of presentation, meeting 50% of EER with a regular diet and no fat restriction for the first 24 hours of enteral feeding. A 75-100% EER is targeted = 24 hours of enteral feeding.If the targeted EER is not met orally, a nasogastric tube will be inserted to provide bolus feeds of a standard formula with standard fat content. If the patient fails to tolerate both oral and bolus nasogastric tube feeding, continuous nasogastric tube feeding will be provided. If all fails, enteral nutrition by nasojejunal tube feeding or parenteral nutrition may be commenced based on the clinical decision. Patients will be re-trialed on oral feeds once initial limiting symptoms or factors have improved or settled.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute pancreatitis (AP) in children has an increasing incidence and is at times associated
      with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite this, there is no high-quality
      evidence-based treatment for childhood AP and current practice is based entirely on
      historical approach and extrapolation from adult studies.

      In this study, we evaluate the use of early enteral feeding in children with AP. The
      traditional approach to treating AP relies on fasting and intravenous fluids (or occasionally
      parenteral nutrition) assuming that this minimizes stimulation of an already inflamed
      pancreas. Contrary to this, evidence exists that early feeding of patients with AP may be
      beneficial. Randomized controlled trials of fasting vs. early oral diet in adult patients
      with mild AP, showed no differences in pain, serum amylase and CRP levels, but also shorter
      hospital stay in those fed earlier. Further data in adults with severe AP demonstrated that
      early enteral nutrition was associated with decreased mortality, infections and multiorgan
      failure. These benefits were lost if enteral nutrition was commenced 48 hour after admission.
      Suggested explanations for these findings include the possibility that enteral nutrition may
      maintain integrity and function of intestinal mucosa and reduce gut-origin sepsis.

      Historically, nasojejunal (NJ) feeds were felt to be safer than oral or nasogastric feeds in
      the setting of AP by avoiding cephalic and gastric pancreatic stimulation. NJ feeds require
      moderately invasive tube insertion under radiographic or endoscopic guidance. Recent data
      suggest that oral feeding with a low fat diet was as safe as NJ feeding.

      Several animal models of AP demonstrate that the exocrine pancreas is resistant to
      cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulation after the onset of AP, suggesting a mechanism for the lack
      of concern of exacerbating pancreatitis with enteral feeds.

      Considering this data it is less certain that diet and fat restriction contribute to
      treatment of AP. To further challenge the prior conceptions of AP management it is necessary
      to explore the use of unrestricted diet (full fat) in mild-moderate pediatric AP, a
      population with recognized low complication risk.

      Despite the mounting evidence to the contrary, it is still standard clinical practice to fast
      children with AP, and only slowly reintroduce feeds depending on the clinical improvement.
      This is largely due to the lack of clinical interventional studies in children with AP.</summary>
