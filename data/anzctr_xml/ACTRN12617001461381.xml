  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intravenous 4% succinylated gelatine fluid at a dose of at least 500mL, to be delivered over less than 60 minutes, Exact dose will be determined by treating physician. The study fluid will also be used for any further fluid boluses required within the next 24-hour period, up to a maximum of 50mL/kg or 3000mL. Any fluid required for blood volume expansion beyond 24 hours is open-label; however, the use of gelatine will be not allowed for 7 days post-enrolment. Other crystalloid fluids or blood products may be used for purposes other than blood volume expansion, such as maintenance requirements or transfusion. Use of albumin solution is also permitted, if specifically indicated. Volume and type of all fluids delivered with 7 days of enrolment, or until ICU discharge, will be recorded. </interventions>
    <comparator>Intravenous compound sodium lactate at a dose of at least 500mL, to be delivered over less than 60 minutes, Exact dose will be determined by treating physician. The study fluid will also be used for any further fluid boluses required within the next 24-hour period, up to a maximum of 50mL/kg or 3000mL. </comparator>

For biomarkers with skewed distributions that are resistant to successful transformation, quantile regression will be employed to compare differences over time. Ordinal logistic regression methods will be used for testing differences in maximum AKI stage, and logistic regression for differences in binary clinical outcomes.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Synthetic colloid fluids are frequently used for blood volume expansion in critically ill patients. Starch-based synthetic colloid fluids have been associated with increased risk of acute kidney injury. There is some evidence that gelatine-based colloid fluids may also pose a similar risk. This randomised open-label controlled pilot trial will assess the effects of 4% succinylated gelatine fluid on urinary biomarkers of acute kidney injury in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. This study will also assess clinical outcomes, as secondary endpoints, including change in AKI stage, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), ICU length of stay and mortality. </summary>
