    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Tak, Ratchaburi, Ranong and Yala provinces in Thailand 
Background: Current first-line treatment for P. falciparum in Thailand is a 3-day artesunate-mefloquine combination. The second-line treatment is 7-day quinine-doxycycline combination. Study conducted in 2008 in 5 sentinel sites revealed high efficacy of the 3-day artesunate-mefloquine combination (96.8-100%). In 2009, the efficacy of the artesunate-mefloquine combination declined to 87-92.7% in 4 sentinel sites. The monitoring the efficacy of the first line treatment to generate valuable information for updating the national treatment policy is critical. 
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Tak, Ratchaburi, Ranong and Yala provinces in Thailand
Methods: Antimalarial drug efficacy trials will be conducted in 4 sites for uncomplicated falciparum infection. The participants will be febrile patients aged 6 months and above with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Falciparum malaria patients will be treated with artesunate (4 mg/kg over 3 days) co-administered with mefloquine (15 mg/kg on day 1 and 10 mg/kg on day 2). Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy for falciparum malaria. The study will be conducted from July to December, 2010. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.</summary>
