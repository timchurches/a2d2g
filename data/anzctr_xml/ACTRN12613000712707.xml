  <interventions>
    <interventions>CPAP devices with modifications designed to increase patient comfort - to be trialled by subjects for comfort and preference only. 1. Two different devices will be trialled, each offering a different pressure control method (how stable the pressure is when breathing in and out). Device 1 will keep the pressure in the mask as low as possible. Device 2 will provide some pressure relief on expiration (in the region of 1-2cmH2O). 2.a) Subjects will breathe on the device while awake for short periods of time (minimum of 2 minutes and &lt; 30 minutes) b) Patients will be tested on a sub-therapeutic pressure (as they are awake and don't require treatment). This pressure is determined by the minimum pressure the device can produce whilst safely flushing CO2. c) All participants will try all devices. The wash-out period between devices will be at least half as long as the time spent breathing on the device (between one minute and 15 minutes).</interventions>
    <comparator>CPAP at a fixed pressure of 4cmH2O (awake pressure in devices that are currently available). CPAP will also be administered for &lt; 30 minutes, while the subject is awake. Although CPAP pressure is fixed, there are normally small fluctuations in pressure at the patient interface (mask) as the patient inspires and expires. </comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects will be enrolled as healthy volunteers, diagnosed with OSA or suspicion of having OSA (before their diagnosing sleep study). 

Allocation is concealed as it is completed by computer prior to enrolment of the subject (i.e. the randomisdation order is set by subject number, prior to subjects being enrolled and being given their subject number. Subject numbers are given in ascending order by enrolment time and date.)</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be randomised (all subjects will receive the same test devices) but the devices will be randomised into different order to prevent order bias. This randomisation order is calculated using computerised sequence generation. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CPAP Therapy is the gold standard treatment for OSA, which has been proven to be extremely effective over the last 30 years. Adherence to therapy remains sub-optimal, and as such technological improvements to improve patient comfort and adherence, are continually being developed. The technological improvements need to be evaluated for comfort by the treatment population, in order to inform product development. These evaluations are to gauge acceptance and preference of one solution over another, before investing further development for a final product and assessing treatment efficacy. </summary>
