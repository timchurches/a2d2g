    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      and pharmacodynamics following single and multiple ascending oral doses of BMS-986195 in
      healthy subjects, and to assess the relative bioavailability of two formulations of
      BMS-986195 with or without food.</summary>
