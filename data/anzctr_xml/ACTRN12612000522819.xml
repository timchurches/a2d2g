  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the effect of combining standard chemotherapy with the drug, BNC105P, for the treatment of partially platinum sensitive ovarian cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18years or above and have a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer, for which you have undergone first or second line platinum based chemotherapy. Your cancer should not have progressed for at least 4 months following this chemotherapy. Trial details There are two parts to this study. Each participant will be involved in one part only. In part 1 of the study, participants will undergo chemotherapy with carboplatin, gemcitabine, and BNC105P for up to 6 cycles (each cycle is 21 days). Subsequent patients will receive escalating doses of these drugs in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Participants will then undergo a further 6 cycles of maintenance therapy with BNC105P only. Participants enrolled in part 2 of this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Both groups will undergo standard chemotherapy with Carboplatin and Gemcitabine for 6 cycles (each cycle is 21 days). However, one group will also receive the maximum tolerated dose (determined in part 1 of the study) of BNC105P during these cycles. Both groups will then undergo a maximum of 6 cycles of maintenance therapy with BNC105P. Participants in both parts of the study will be assessed at regular intervals in order to evaluate the safety of treatment, response rate, and quality of life.</summary>
