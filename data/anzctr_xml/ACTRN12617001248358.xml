  <interventions>
    <interventions>SupportanTM group
Two x 200 ml Supportan daily (200ml contains: 300 kcal, 20 g protein and 1.42 g EPA/DHA). This is a liquid product supplied between meal times. If participants are unable to meet their nutrition needs with oral intake and 400ml of Supportan per day they will also be offered Fortisip/Ensure powder in order to meet their nutrition requirements. The nutritional adequacy will be determined by the oncologists and oncology dietitians who are part of the research team.
Standard of care nutritional group (control)
	If supplementation is required Ensure powder or Fortisip powder will be prescribed, as determined by the Dietitian. Instructions will be given to mix the formula to a 1.5kcal/ml solution. Quantity will be determined based on need (as described above).
The intervention is seven weeks long. Diet recalls and twice weekly compliance survey will determine who is following the intervention

    <statisticalmethods>Weight loss for head and neck cancer patients undergoing 7 weeks chemo-radiotherapy during 2016 at Auckland City Hospital was 6.2 kg (SD 3.9 kg). We hypothesise that Supportan supplementation will reduce this weight loss by 50%. To detect this difference in weight loss (at the 5% level) and allowing for a 10% patient withdrawal rate will require 40 patients per group (at 90% power). 

The results will be analysed as the mean difference between intervention and control groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>HNC patients attending Auckland Hospital for concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy will be randomised to an EPA and DHA-containing nutritional supplement (SupportanTM) for seven weeks or to standard care. Follow-up will occur weekly. Baseline and post intervention measures will be taken, and include body weight (taken weekly), circulating CRP, TNFa, IL-6, albumin, blood cell EPA/DHA, differential gene expression (TNFa, IL6 and IL1), SNP genotyping (e.g. TNF a 308 A rs1800629, TNF a 857 T rs1799724, TNF a 863 A rs1800630, 1031 C rs1799964, IL 6 rs2069837), malnutrition screening, body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), grip strength, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30, C35), food diaries and adherence to nutritional supplement (documented weekly throughout the trial). The primary outcome (weight at 7 weeks) will be compared between groups using an analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline weight and sex.</summary>
