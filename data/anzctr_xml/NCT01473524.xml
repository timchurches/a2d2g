  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigational drug, Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a modified bile acid and FXR agonist. FXR
      is a key regulator of bile acid synthesis and transport. Bile acids are used by the body to
      help with digestion. It is hypothesized that regular treatment with OCA will improve liver
      function in persons with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC).</summary>
