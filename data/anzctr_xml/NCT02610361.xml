          4. Any radiotherapy within 14 days prior to enrollment, providing the subject has
             recovered from all toxicities to NCI-CTCAE = Grade 1.

          5. Use of any investigational anti cancer drug within 28 days before the first
             investigational product administration.

             metastasis that are asymptomatic, off steroids for longer than 28 days are permitted.

         10. Any unstable, pre-existing major medical condition that in the opinion of the
             Investigator contra indicates the use of an investigational product, including active

             Hepatitis B or C.

         11. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that do not permit
             compliance with the protocol.
