    <interventions>MYOFASCIAL INDUCTION PROTOCOL

The protocol began with an induction technique in the deep fascia of the temporal region. The subject was placed supine and the therapist sat at the head of the table. The therapist places one of her hands on the temporal muscle and the other one at the zygomatic arch. Maintaining this position, the cranial hand exerts a slight pressure in cranial direction and the caudal hand does the same in caudal direction. After reaching the relaxation of the tissue (about 4 minutes of time), the caudal hand moves toward the chest respecting any soft tissue restrictions during this advance. The technique was applied bilaterally (first in the dominant side and then in the non-dominant side of the body). Then, it was performed a myofascial technique in the masseter muscle. Remaining at the therapist-patient position, the therapist places one hand at the zygomatic arch and the other one just below, performing a cranial traction with her cranial hand and a caudal traction with the other hand. The technique lasts approximately 4 minutes.
Having performed this maneuver in both sides, the protocol was completed with the masster muscle induction in a  transverse direction. For this, the therapist places three fingers on the insertion of the muscle in both zygomatic arches and sustained pressure is applied to the midline of the face. 

The whole protocol lasted approximately 20 minutes and involved only a single session</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo manouvre consisted in the therapist placing her hands in the patient's skull keeping the same contacts that have been described for the intervention group, without any kind of pressure or therapeutic intention. The aim was to provide a manual stimulus as similar as possible to the myofascial induction protocol. The subject will be asked to keep his eyes closed as in the intervention techique. The intervention time for the placebo technique is twenty minutes and it will be performed only once.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>IMPROVEMENT OF CRANIOVERTEBRAL ANGLE IN AT LEAST 15%

The craniovertebral angle (CVA) is measured to be that between a horizontal line that crosses the body of the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and the line from the tragus of the ear to the spinal apophysis of C7. Two lateral photographs are taken of the subject seated and standing still. For the first photograph, the subjects are asked to sit with their arms on their legs, and to rest their back and buttocks on the back of the chair, with both feet on the ground. The examiner instructs them to fix their gaze on an imaginary point on the wall directly in front. For the second photograph, the subjects stand still in a posture as natural as possible, with arms resting along the body, and directing their gaze as in the previous case.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>INCREASE OF  VERTICAL MOUTH OPENING(VMO) IN AT LEAST 10%

The maximum amplitude of VMO is measured using a digital gauge (Fino Digital Caliper, Model 59112, Germany) with a sensitivity of 0.01 mm.  Measurements are made in two positions: (i) the subject supine with flexed hips and knees, and hands resting on the abdomen; and (ii) subject seated with back support and feet resting on the floor.  The instruction given to the subject is simple: "Open your mouth as much as possible without there being any sensation of pain or discomfort." The examiner then placed one end of the calliper on the middle incisor of the upper jaw incisor and the other on the central incisor of the jaw line.  Three consecutive measurements were made, with a resting period of 30 seconds between each.  The mean of the three measurements was taken as the value for the subsequent analyses.  This procedure has proven to have high intra-examiner reliability (ICC=0.90-0.98)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesized that, in decreasing muscular mechanosensitivity will have a positive impact in parameters that are strongly related to the functionality of the cranio mandibular axis. So after the intervention protocol, we will find an immediate increase in vertical mouth opening and head posture</summary>
