Antibodies and adverse reactions assessed through blood and other medical testing and observation. AEs may possibly include infusion related reactions, allergic reactions, blood related reactions and heart, musculoskeletal and skin problems.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KappaMab in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 or over with relapsed/refractory kappa restricted multiple myeloma for which you have received Received 1-3 prior lines of therapy.

Study details
Half of the participants in the study will be administered KappaMab only and half will be administered with KappaMab in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone. KappaMab will be administered weekly for the first eight weeks of study and every 28 days therafter. Lenalidomide will be taken for the first 28 days of study and the first 21 days of cycle 2. Dexamethasone will be taken weekly for the duration of the study. Participants will have blood samples taken once per month along with a medical exam in order for researchers to monitor whether the treatment is safe and whether it is effectively treating the myeloma.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will establish the benefits of a KappaMab and Lenalidomide based immune-oncology approach for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients relatively early in their disease course. </summary>
