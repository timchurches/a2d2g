  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm B: Zoladex plus Nolvadex
Nolvadex (in Arm B and only after on-treatment progression in Arm A) is administered orally, in tablet form, at a dose of 40 mg (ie two tablets) once daily.
Patients will receive study therapy until one of the following treatment endpoints is reached:
a) Severe adverse reaction,
b) Patient unwilling/unable to continue therapy,
c) Objective progression of breast cancer,
d) Death,
e) Study inclusion/exclusion criteria are violated at any time,
f) Patient receives systemic treatment for breast cancer or receives non-protocol treatment, known to effect hormonal status.
All patients will be followed up until the last patient has been followed up for at least 1 year, or has withdrawn from the study (whichever occurs first).
</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm A: Zoladex only (with Nolvadex added at progression on treatment)
Zoladex is administered (in Arm A and Arm B) as a 3.6 mg depot injected subcutaneously every 28 days.
Patients randomised to receive 'Zoladex only' will receive Nolvadex (in addition to Zoladex) at first objective progression and will continue therapy until a second endpoint is reached.
All patients will be followed up until the last patient has been followed up for at least 1 year, or has withdrawn from the study (whichever occurs first).</comparator>
