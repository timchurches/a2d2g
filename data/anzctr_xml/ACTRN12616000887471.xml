  <interventions>
    <interventions>This recovery focused group therapy will be delivered as an adjunct to existing treatment (pharmacological and/ or psychological). The intervention is informed by Acceptance Based Behavioral Therapy (AABT), motivational interviewing (MI) and consumer feedback. ABBT integrates CBT with principles and strategies from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 2012), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams &amp; Teasdale, 2002) to address processes implicated in Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD; Roemer &amp; Orsillo, 2009). According to this approach, GAD is maintained by an interplay between a) problematic ways of relating to internal experiences (e.g. restricted/ biased attention; critical, negative and fearful stance); b) rigid strategies aimed at experiential avoidance (i.e. efforts to alter the form, frequency and/ or intensity of internal events; Hayes, Wilson, Gifford, Follette &amp; Strosahl, 1996) and c) subsequent behavioral constriction (narrowing or avoidance of meaningful/ valued action; Roemer &amp; Orsillo, 2009). This model of ABBT is particularly relevant to the current trial, since as with anxiety, Bipolar Disorder and substance use are also characterized by problematic reactions to internal events (Jones &amp; Day, 2008; Jones, Mansell &amp; Waaller, 2006; Johnson et al. 2008), experiential avoidance and behavioural constriction (Aldao et al., 2010; Spinhoven et al., 2014).
The current intervention is designed to promote awareness of (i) how participants respond to experiences related to mood, anxiety and substance use, with a particular emphasis on the role of urges (to avoid, approach and/ or protect) and (ii) the relationship between these responses and valued living. The overarching focus will be on using this awareness to promote increased engagement in meaningful action. Sessions will consist of guided discovery, information provision and exercises (e.g. self-monitoring, mindfulness, awareness of thoughts, feelings and urges). Written material will be used to consolidate key concepts and allow participants to document take home points of particular relevance to their own experience. The structure and content of written material will be finalised in collaboration with consumers.

Dosage and administration
The intervention will comprise eight sessions of face-to-face group therapy, of between 1.5 to 2 hours (plus a 15-30 minute mid-session break) delivered across 8 weeks.  All sessions will be led by the same Clinical Psychologist (&gt;10 years experience in research and mental health settings) and co-facilitated by the same Registered Psychologist (&gt;5 years experience, masters level training). Sessions will be held in a community based private psychology clinic located on the Central Coast, NSW.

Treatment Integrity

Adherence to treatment protocol will be assessed via clinician ratings and separate independent objective rating of audio recorded therapy sessions. At the end of each session, the clinician will complete a rating scale specifically designed for the current study. Audio recordings will be rated using a corresponding fidelity scale specifically designed for the current study (i.e. to assess adherence to and competence in approaches to promote awareness, explore experiential avoidance, facilitate engagement in meaningful action; together with evidence based skills/ strategies for BPSD, anxiety and/ or substance use). This scale will be informed by published recommendations (e.g. Plumb &amp; Roger, 2010; McHugh et al., 2009) and existing fidelity measures applied to third wave interventions (e.g. Schimmell-Bristow, Bricker &amp; Comstock, 2012). As we are unsure of how this scale will perform, we may also utilise at least one established instrument for assessing fidelity to CBT (e.g. Cognitive Therapy Scale  revised version).

All sessions will be rated by an independent assessor masked to study protocol. To maximise masking, the independent researcher will be located off-site. A 20% sample will be re-rated by a second, independent masked-rater for inter-rater reliability.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>To help inform the development of a future trial, the assessment tools listed under secondary outcomes will be used to assess a number of clinical outcomes and process measures to explore the following parameters: The feasibility of recruiting participants with bipolar disorder who also have experience of anxiety and substance related comorbidities, as indexed by the number of participants recruited who also demonstrate comorbid anxiety and substance (mis)use; The feasibility and acceptability of data collection methods (including the number, frequency, duration, content and delivery method), as indexed by the number of assessments completed; amount of missing data and detailed participant feedback; Concurrent treatment and support services accessed by study participants (including type, amount, frequency and duration)  to allow us to comment on what treatment as usual is likely to consist of and potential similarities/ differences to the recovery focused group therapy intervention; The most appropriate primary outcome measure  informed by a combination of detailed participant feedback, feasibility data and effect size estimates; Potential mechanisms of change  to understand the processes that may underlie the impact of the intervention- including (i) mindfulness (ii) experiential avoidance (iii) meaningful action (iv) impulsivity and/ or (v) behaviours and/ or attitudes towards medication</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In light of the primary aim of exploring feasibility and acceptability, outcome data will primarily utilise descriptive statistics (summarizing recruitment, demographics, attendance, attrition and intervention adherence). We intend to use repeated-measures analysis of covariance to analyse data on clinical outcome measures across all time points (including change, effect size and variability); this will minimise the number of statistical tests and reduce the risk of inflated type I error.   This approach also provides an omnibus test, which if significant, will preserve type I error when doing post-hoc analyses of pairwise contrasts, e.g. baseline vs midpoint, baseline vs final, baseline vs post treatment values.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Improving support for people with bipolar disorder is an important priority. Worldwide, bipolar disorder causes more pain and suffering than well-known conditions like heart disease and Alzheimer's. Feedback from people with bipolar disorder tells us that recovery is a personal journey about hope, understanding, empowerment and living a meaningful, satisfying and purposeful life alongside their experience of mental health conditions. Even with the right medication, people often have symptoms that continue to affect their everyday lives.  Research is needed on an approach that improves individual recovery outcomes and that is useful and easy to access. This study will develop and test an eight session recovery focused group therapy programme for adults with bipolar disorder. An important focus of the project is combining what is currently known about what works with feedback from experts, including consumers. Being recovery focused, the group is an opportunity to learn from one another. Group discussion, activities and at-home tasks will be used to help group members a) increase their awareness of what matters to them; b) strengthen their ability to notice the things they are already doing that bring meaning to their life; c) identify the way(s) they respond when strong thoughts, feelings and/ or sensations show up (to help decide when/ whether these things are useful) and d) take steps towards changing the things that are less helpful in the long run and doing more of the things that bring meaning, purpose and direction. This initial study will involve 24 people with bipolar disorder. All participants will be offered the new group treatment alongside any other treatment they are already using. We will measure key signs (recovery, quality of life, symptoms) several times before and after treatment (baseline, post-treatment and 3 months post-treatment). We will also ask people to give feedback on their experience of participating in the study and the treatment they received. This will help to improve the treatment and inform a larger trial of its use in practice.</summary>
