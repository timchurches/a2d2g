  <interventions>
    <interventions>The independent variable is the intake of free sugar, which is definned by the WHO as all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.

Each participant completed two 24-hr recall, with at least seven days apart, using the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM) developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Informed consent was obtained from the primary caregiver or a responsible adult for children aged less than 14 years, while adolescents aged 14 years or above provided their own consent in the presence of a parent or responsible adult </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>BMI z-score. Height and weight were measured at the time of the first visit. BMI were calculated as weight (in kg) divided by height (in m) squared. The z-score was calculated by comparing the BMI with the age-and-sex specific population curves.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake. Data were translated from the dietary intake data collected from two 24-hr recalls using the 2007 AUSNUT food composition database.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies suggested dietary sugar consumption as one of the main factors of obesity, yet the findings on children were inconsistent. Notably, although the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) was found to be positively associated with body weight gain in children, the association between the consumption of free sugar, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), and weight gain on children remained inconclusive. Hence, the current analysis aimed to assess the effects of consuming free sugar on the BMI z-score of a group of Australian children and adolescents.</summary>
