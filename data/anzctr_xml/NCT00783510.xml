  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  For a patient enrolling into the HUMIRA® arm; a pediatric patient diagnosed at any
             time with moderately to severely active polyarticular or polyarticular-course JIA
             (defined as arthritis affecting &gt;= 5 joints at the time of diagnosis of polyarticular
             or polyarticular-course JIA) who has been prescribed HUMIRA® therapy according to the
             local approved HUMIRA® product labeling and meets one of the following criteria:

          -  Enrolled patients are 4 to 17 years of age as per approved HUMIRA® product label with
             the addition of JIA patients 2 to &lt; 4 years of age in countries with available local
             approval for this group of patients at the time of consent to the registry.

          -  Newly initiated (within 24 months of registry entry) on HUMIRA® therapy and has

             Interest, and dosing information since initiation of therapy;

          -  Or is entering after participation (within 24 months of registry entry or, if longer,
             continuously treated at the same site) in an AbbVie Humira sponsored study, regardless
             of age or the number of joints with symptoms of JIA, and has received continuous (no
             more than 70 consecutive days off drug) HUMIRA® therapy and the physician can provide

             information since initiation of therapy.

          -  For a patient enrolling into the MTX arm; a pediatric patient diagnosed at any time
             with moderately to severely active polyarticular or polyarticular-course JIA (defined
             as arthritis affecting &gt;= 5 joints at the time of diagnosis of polyarticular or
             polyarticular-course JIA) who is prescribed MTX therapy alone or in combination with

             into the HUMIRA® treatment arm if all ongoing AEs/SAEs have been resolved, and they
             meet inclusion criteria and can enroll within the registry enrollment period. In case
             of ongoing AEs/SAEs at the time of the treatment arm switch, the AbbVie Designated

    <summary>This is a global registry, to evaluate the long-term safety of Humira® in patients with
      moderate to severe polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), that are treated as
      recommended in the Humira® product label. Patients treated with MTX will be considered a
      reference group. Patients will be followed in both the Humira® and Methotrexate (MTX) arms
      for 10 years from the enrollment date into one of the treatment arms.</summary>
