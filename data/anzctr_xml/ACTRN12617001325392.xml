  <interventions>
    <interventions>Induction phase (Weeks 1-16):
* Tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks for 4 doses (intravenous);
* Durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks for 4 doses (intravenous);
* Trastuzumab 2mg/kg every week for 16 weeks (intravenous).

Tremelimumab will be administered first. Durvalumab infusion will start approximately 1 hour after the end of tremelimumab infusion. The duration will be approximately 1 hour for each infusion. A 1 hour observation period is required after the first infusion of durvalumab and tremelimumab. If no clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or after the first cycle, subsequent infusion observation periods can be at the Investigators discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab and tremelimumab infusion).
Trastuzumab is given after Tremelimumab and Durvalumab. 

Treatment phase (Weeks 17-52):
* Durvalumab 1120 mg every 3 weeks for 12 doses (intravenous); plus
* Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 12 doses (intravenous).

Durvalumab will be administered first, followed by trastuzumab.

All treatments will be administered by site staff trained in chemotherapy administration.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to find out if the combination of trastuzumab (anti-HER2 therapy) with durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 inhibitor) will reactivate anti-tumour immune response and improve clinical outcomes in trastuzumab-resistant, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you are 18 years or older, male or female, and have HER2-positive metastatic or incurable breast cancer that has progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment.

Trial Details.
Up to 4 weeks before starting study treatment, all participants will have either a CT Scan, MRI, or PET with dedicated CT Scan, provide a research tumour biopsy of the cancer (taken within 1 year of starting the study) and research blood tests.
 
Study treatment takes place in 2 phases:
1) Induction Phase (weeks 1-16); and
2) Treatment Phase (weeks 17-52).

Induction Phase
During the Induction Phase, participants will receive:
1) 4 doses of durvalumab (1 dose every 4 weeks), administered intravenously;
2) 4 doses of tremelimumab (1 dose every 4 weeks), administered intravenously;
3) 16 doses of trastuzumab (1 dose every week), administered intravenously.

Oestrogen-receptor-positive patients will also start or continue endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor and/or GnRH agonist).

Participants will be clinically assessed prior to each study treatment. Two core biopsies, if feasible, will be taken from the same site as the initial biopsy about 3 weeks after starting study treatment. A research blood sample will be taken before the 3rd dose of study treatment.

Treatment Phase
Participants will receive durvalumab and trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 12 doses (total 36 weeks). Tremelimumab will not be given.

Participants will be clinically assessed prior to each study treatment. . A research blood sample will be taken every 9 weeks, before each dose of study treatment.

During the study (Induction and Treatment Phases), heart function tests (ECHO or MUGA) will be performed every 3 months as per standard of care, or as clinically indicated.

The full length of treatment is 52 weeks (1 year). After completing study treatment, patients will be followed every 3 months by either clinic visits or via telephone.
