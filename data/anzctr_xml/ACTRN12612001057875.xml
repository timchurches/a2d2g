  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group one: This group will involve parents with low health literacy who will receive a fever education package designed for low health literacy people. The education package includes an eight minute DVD and brochure; both the DVD and the brochure will contain information about pharmacological and non-pharmacological fever treatments, the correct way of measuring a childs body temperature, and general knowledge about fever.

Intervention group two: this group will involve parents with functional health literacy who will also receive the same fever education package received by the first group.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group one: this group will involve parents with low health literacy who will not receive the study intervention until the completion of the trial (3 months post recruitment). The study intervention (DVD and brochure) will be sent to all control participants after the last post questionnaire has been mailed (3 months post recruitment).  They will receive at recruitment the existing hospital fever brochure that is provided to parents. The hospital brochure contains the following information: definition of fever, causes of fever, when do you need to see a doctor for a febrile? What can you do at home with a febrile child? 


Control group two: this group will involve parents with functional health literacy who will not receive the study intervention until the completion of the trial (3 months post recruitment as in control group 1). They will receive at recruitment the existing hospital fever brochure that is provided to parents.</comparator>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Initially participants will be screened by a Research Assistant (RA) for eligibility through an intranet database called FIRSTNET available in the ED at the hospital. The RA then will approach the parents and ask them if they would be interested in participating in the study. The RA will then explain the project and the aim of the study. The participant information sheet will then be provided and written consent will be obtained from interested participants. 

The RA will then  complete the health literacy assessment with the participant and then give them the pre questionnaire form to complete while they are in the ED. The participant will also be asked for their contact details in order to send them the follow up post survey in three months. 

Group allocation will be represented by serielly numbered opaque envelopes that will be generated by block randomisation stratified according to the level of health literacy (Low vs functional). Depending on the group allocation envelopes will contain either the study intervention (Low health literacy education program) or the existing hospital fever brochure that is provided to parents in the ED. Based on the health literacy assessments the RA will provide participants with the relevant envelopes. The RA will be unaware of the group allocation</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated to the groups using block randomisation stratified according to the level of health literacy. A computer generated random number sequence will be used to chose the blocks and set the allocation order of the particpants. Block randomisation will ensure the number of particpants in each arm of the trial will be evenly balanced.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fever is considered to be one of the most frequent complaints in childrens diseases, and is mostly reported to
Emergency Department and healthcare centers. Approximately 20 percent of childrens cases reported to Emergency Department are related to a febrile illness. Many education programs have been designed to improve patient fever health information; however, no education program or material was found relating to fever management for parents with low health literacy. This study will present for the first time, a unique fever management program for parents with low health literacy.

The aim of this study is to examine fever presentations in the emergency department and test a low health literacy
education intervention to reduce inappropriate primary care attendance. To achieve this aim education interventions
such as a DVD and Brochure have been developed from a comprehensive literature review, systematic reviews, and
existing guidelines. These tools are designed to be appropriate for low health literacy parents and use symbols and pictures where possible to deliver the information.

This study is being conducted in Campbelltown Hospital, Emergency Department (ED). Quantitative
research design will be the cornerstone for this project. The study will be carried out in two phases. Phase one will
include secondary data analysis of ED presentations for children with fever using FIRSTNET data. The second
phase will use a randomised control trial, where the investigator will deliver a low health literacy education program.
This design will provide the opportunity to examine the effectiveness of an education program on parents
knowledge, practice and health service use. Prepost
survey data will be collected from the intervention and control groups, including knowledge and practices relating to fever management. Study data will be analysed using
descriptive and multivariate analysis techniques.
It is envisaged that this program will potentially improve parents knowledge and reduce occasions where parents
inappropriately attend ED for fever in children. This anticipated improvement may in turn save healthcare
professionals time and effort, increase their productivity, and decrease staff and parents frustration</summary>
