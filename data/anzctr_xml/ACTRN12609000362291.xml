  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will have a nonmydriatic imaging of each retina (45 degrees one field centered between fovea and optic nerve head) following their endocrinologist exam, followed by a brief discussion by a retina specialist about the findings.  The patients will be shown their images during this discussion and the following topics will be explicitly discussed with each patient: First, a series of images comprising a spectrum starting from a normal appearing fundus to images of mild and moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (DR), active proliferative DR and tractional retinal detachment.  Second, ongoing blood glucose control will be stressed in order to delay or avoid worsening of their retinopathy and finally a brief summary of the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)  regarding HbA1C control and DR.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group would differ in that they will not have the imaging following their endocrinologist exam and will not have a discussion with the retinal specialist.  These patients will be evaluated according to their previously determined, regularly scheduled ophthalmology follow up. Diabetic eye care will be otherwise the same in both groups.</comparator>
