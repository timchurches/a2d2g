  <interventions>
    <interventions>Occupational therapist to assess individual's ability to read and write, use a computer, and operate household appliances such as doors, lights, television and music system WITH the use of alternate computer access equipment, environmental control and communication  technology.
A one-off 2 hour session will be undertaken where the participant will trial the computer access and environmental control technology. An Occupational Therapist will facilitate this trial and will set up the equipment and monitor the trial. The appropriate technology will be selected based on the in-depth interview completed and the therapists assessment outlined above. The control arm outlined below will be completed first. The intervention arm will be completed on the same day after a 15 minute break.</interventions>
