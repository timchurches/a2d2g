Other interventions - Placebo

Experimental: secukinumab 150 mg - 198 patients are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg, or placebo. Patients assigned to secukinumab 150 mg are dosed weekly for five weeks, then once every four weeks up to and including Week 128. To maintain the blinding, patients received additional placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. All doses of study treatment are administered by sub-cutaneous injections.

Experimental: secukinumab 300 mg - 198 patients are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg, or placebo. Patients assigned to secukinumab 300 mg are dosed weekly for five weeks, then once every four weeks up to and including Week 128. To maintain the blinding, patients received additional placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. All doses of study treatment are administered by sub-cutaneous injections.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 198 patients are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg, or placebo. Patients assigned to placebo were dosed weekly for five weeks, then at Week 8 and Week 12. At Week 16, placebo patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, to receive secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg and were dosed weekly for five weeks starting at Week 16, then once every four weeks up to and including Week 128. All doses of study treatment are administered by sub-cutaneous injections.


Other interventions: secukinumab 150 mg
Study treatment is provided in pre-filled 1 mL syringes containing either secukinumab 150 mg or placebo secukinumab. Dosing consists of one secukinumab s.c. injection plus one placebo s.c. injection and takes place once weekly during five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), then once every four weeks starting at Week 8 until Week 128 inclusive. In order to maintain the blinding, patients receive two placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. Patients self-administer study treatment under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur during study visits, or at home otherwise.

Other interventions: secukinumab 300 mg
Study treatment is provided in pre-filled 1 mL syringes containing either secukinumab 150 mg or placebo secukinumab. Dosing consists of two secukinumab s.c. injections and takes place once weekly during five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), then once every four weeks starting at Week 8 until Week 128 inclusive. In order to maintain the blinding, patients receive two placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. Patients self-administer study treatment under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur during study visits, or at home otherwise.

Other interventions: Placebo
Study treatment is provided in pre-filled 1 mL syringes containing either secukinumab 150 mg or placebo secukinumab. Dosing consists of two placebo s.c. injections weekly for five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), then at Weeks 8 and 12. At Week 16, placebo patients are randomly assigned to receive either secukinumab 150 mg or secukinumab 300 mg once weekly for five weeks (at Weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20), then once every four weeks, starting at Week 24 until Week 128 inclusive. Patients self-administer study treatment under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur during study visits, or at home otherwise.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: Change in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index after 16 weeks of treatment. Each treatment group will be compared to placebo - Primary endpoint is the percentage change from baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score after 16 weeks of treatment. The NAPSI score will be determined using all 10 fingers on a 0-80 point scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 16 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: Change in NAPSI over time up to Week 16 of the treatment compared to placebo and over time up to Week 132 - The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) is an instrument for the assessment of psoriatic nail involvement. All 10 fingernails will be evaluated. Treatment groups will be compared by visit in terms of percentage change in the NAPSI score (against placebo until Week 16).</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks, 132 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) and change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA mod 2011) response over time up to Week 16 of the treatment compared to placebo and over time up to Week 132 - PASI score is derived from distinct assessments of erythema, thickening and scaling in the head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. IGA mod 2011 is used to assess overall psoriatic disease. To be considered IGA responder at any point in time, the patient must have an IGA score of 0 or 1 and have achieved a reduction of at least two points on the IGA scale from baseline. The efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg will be assessed by visit in terms of PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 response (in comparison with placebo until Week 16).</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks, 132 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects in treatment groups 150 mg and 300 mg with adverse events, safety labs, ECG, and vital signs as a measure of safety and tolerability - Adverse events, safety labs, ECG and vital signs will be used to measure and evaluate the safety and tolerability of subjects who took at least one dose of study treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, up to 140 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number and percentage of subjects who develop immunogenicity against secukinumab - Overall statistics will be used to assess the immunogenicity of secukinumab. Patients who discontinue treatment after Week 80 will have the last immunogenicity test performed at Week 88, all other patients - at Week 140.</outcome>
