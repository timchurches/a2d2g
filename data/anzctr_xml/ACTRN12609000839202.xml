  <interventions>
    <interventions>For the retrospective part, the following variables will be observed:
- immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the archival tumour tissues
- micro Ribonucleic acid (miRNA) expression of the tumour tissues

For the prospective part, the following variables will be observed:
- clinical/demographic details at baseline only
- IHC staining of the tumour at baseline only
- miRNA of the tumour at baseline only
- Quality of life (QoL) data at baseline then at regular intervals depending on therapy prescribed by treating physician
- blood tests including full blood counts, electrolytes, renal function and liver function at baseline then at regular intervals depending on therapy prescribed by treating physician
- inflammatory markers + cytokines at baseline then at regular intervals depending on therapy prescribed by treating physician
- plasma proteomic at baseline then at regular intervals depending on therapy prescribed by treating physician
- nutritional assessment at baseline then at regular intervals depending on therapy prescribed by treating physician
- Computed Tomography (CT) scan at baseline, after 4 cycles of chemotherapy, at completion of chemotherapy and then at physician's discretion.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will attempt to identify potential clinical, histopathological and other novel predictors of survival outcomes in patients with malignant mesothelioma.  

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have a newly diagnosed malignant mesothelioma affecting your lung lining (pleura).

Trial details:
Participants with malignant pleural mesothelioma in all stages of disease will be recruited.  Participants will be treated with the current standard medical therapy by the treating physician without study specific intervention.  Participants will be consented for collection of their tumour tissue, blood samples and answering some questionnaires at baseline and subsequent follow ups.</summary>
