    <interventions>The superior scientific aim of the project is an objective evaluation of the influence of pelvic orientation and the tone of muscles indirectly acting on the pelvic floor (synergists PFM  SPFM) on electromyographic activity of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM). The target population in this study will be menopausal and postmenopausal women suffering from stress urinary incontinence (group A) and urinary continent women (group B). The first target action will be the evaluation of pelvic dimensions and orientation in sagittal and frontal planes in the examined population. Next, according to the assumptions of the main research hypothesis, it will be assessed whether various pelvic configurations influence the changes of the resting and functional PFM activity. Moreover, the project will include the analysis of SPFM tone influence on the pelvic orientation and bioelectrical PFM activity. 
Participants will need to attend the examination once only. The duration of the examination will be approximately one hour.

The measurements:
1. Examination of pelvic orientation,
2. Electromyographic examination of:
- pelvic floor muscles by means of intravaginal electrode
- muscles indirectly acting on the pelvic floor 
3. The position of patient during examination: 
Standing position:
- Pelvic orientation in the maximum anterior tilt,
- Pelvic orientation in the maximum posterior tilt,
 - Pelvic movements forward and backward.
Supine position:
- Supine of lower limbs - 90 degrees flexion in hip and knee joints; lower limbs placed freely on adequately profiled moulder - decreased anterior pelvic tilt;
- Position of lower limbs with a slight flexion of hip and knee joints  intermediate pelvic position;
 - Position of lower limbs without a flexion in hip and knee joints; Lower limbs resting freely on the medical exam table  increased anterior pelvic tilt.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis and evaluation of the results will be based on the comparison of intra- and intergroup results. Statistical analysis of these results will be performed by means of the Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft (licence of Medical University in Wroclaw). All analysed intergroup variables will be checked with respect to their similarity (uniformity; chi2 NW). A critical significance level a (alpha) = 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant. For measurable variables (quantitative), arithmetic mean, standard deviations, medians and range of variability (extreme values) will be calculated. For qualitative variables, the frequency of occurrence (percentage) will be calculated. Comparison of intergroup results in order to determine the significance of the achieved differences, will be performed by means of parametric (Student's t-test, Welch's t test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney`s test) tests, depending on meeting criteria for the specific test. Correlation of variables in the examined groups will also be checked. </statisticalmethods>
