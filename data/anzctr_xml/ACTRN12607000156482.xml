  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial solution (comprising aqueous 2% Lignocaine at 4mg/kg dose in total 5mls trial solution in the experimental group versus 5mls normal saline in the control group) will be administered using a face mask and a compressed gas-powered jet nebuliser (Hudson Respiratory Care Inc., Temecula, CA, USA) with an oxygen flow rate of 6L/min. over a period of 10 minutes. This will occur 10 minutes before nasogastric intubation. Nasogastric tube insertion will proceed in a standard protocolised manner for all patients. The study will last for one year or until 52 patients have been successfully recruited.</interventions>

      <outcome>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measurement of pain and distress of children undergoing nasogastric tube insertion - measured by independent analysts using video analysis. </outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be identified during clinical consultation in the emergency department. They and their parents will be given written and verbal information about the study. After suitability for inclusion in the study is checked, consent will be obtained if the family are willing.The patient will be randomised to either lignocaine or placebo by the attending clinician by the allocation of a pre-randomised numbered vial corresponding to the study mumber of that particular patient. Patient numbers will be allocated on a consecutive basis of recruitment to the study. Thus, allocation was concealed using numbered containers.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nasogastric tubes are often used in children to give them fluids or medications or to drain their stomach. This involves the insertion of a narrow tube into their nostril and then down into their stomach. We know that this is a very safe and effective way of managing a number of problems in children. However, we also know that this is a painful procedure and we are looking for a way to relieve this pain.
Lignocaine is commonly used in children to provide local anaesthetic before painful procedures. It is given in many ways, as an injection, applied to the mouth as a gel and sprayed in the mouth and nose, but it has not been licensed for administration by a nebuliser. Administering a medication in this way means that it is given through a mask so that it can be breathed in. The use of lignocaine in the manner proposed in this study is experimental. However, lignocaine has been administered by a nebuliser to children having different procedures and shown to be safe. It has also been given to adults by nebuliser before the insertion of a nasogastric tube and was shown to make this less painful. 
We will be asking families for consent for their child to participate in this study to find out whether administering nebulised lignocaine before inserting a nasogastric tube reduces the pain that the child feels. We aim to include 52 children in this study. Half of the children (26) will get the study drug (nebulised lignocaine) while the other half will get a placebo (nebulised salt water).</summary>
