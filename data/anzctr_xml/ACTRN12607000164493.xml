  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients receive a Helicobacter Pylori (H.Pylori) Breath test. If this is positive, they undergo H.Pylori eradication. Then all pateints receive Radiotherapy 24-30Gy. Daily fractions of 1.5 -2.0 Gy, 5 days per week with a duration of 4 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freedom from locoregional progression (FFLRP) rate - will be estimated as the cumulative incidence of locoregional progression as obtained as part of a competing risks analysis in which the competing events are distant progression and death without prior progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six to eight weeks after completion of radiotherapy, all patients require interim follow up. After the first follow-up, regular follow-up visits will then occur as follows: 3-monthly intervals for 2 years following restaging; then 6-monthly until 5 years. The analysis of this outcome will be done at 5 years. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete response rate - Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumour. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Six to eight weeks after completion of radiotherapy, all patients require interim follow up. After the first follow-up, regular follow-up visits will then occur as follows: 3-monthly intervals for 2 years following restaging; then 6-monthly until 5 years. The analysis of this outcome will be done at 5 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival </outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival (OS) will be measured as the time from treatment start to date of death from any cause. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression free survival</outcome>
      <timepoint>Period from the date of treatment start to 1st progression of disease or death from any cause. </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freedom from progression - Freedom from progression (FFP) will be estimated as the cumulative incidence of progression obtained as part of a competing risks analysis in which the competing event is death without prior progression. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Six to eight weeks after completion of radiotherapy, all patients require interim follow up. After the first follow-up, regular follow-up visits will then occur as follows: 3-monthly intervals for 2 years following restaging; then 6-monthly until 5 years; then annually thereafter until death.</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patients of at least 18 years of age with histologically documented non-gastric marginal zone lymphoma. 2.  Disease limited to stages I and II after adequate staging, patients with stage IV with extranodal disease confined to paired organs (e.g. salivary glands) and including any local extension of this disease into adjacent tissues. Patients with involved lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm in addition to paired organ involvement are also eligible, provided all involved tumour sites, nodal and extranodal, can be irradiated to 30Gy within tolerance of the relevent normal tissues. If paired organ involvement was regarded as a single extranodal site (rather than 2 seperate sites and hencs stage IV), eligible patients would then be regarded as having stage IE or IIE disease. Patients with wider dissemination (bone Marrow, liver etc) are ineligible. 3. Anticipated life expectancy &gt; 2 years 4. Given written informed consent 5. Been assessed by a radiation oncologist 6. Agree to undergo breath testing for H. pylori and/or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to exclude active infection with helicobacter pylori 7. Must be available for long-term follow up.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Splenic marginal zone lymphoma 2. Received previous locoregional radiotherapy 3. A medical contraindication to radiotherapy 4. Any previous or concurrent malignancy other than curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer, level 1 malignant melanoma, or in situ cervical cancer, unless disease and treatment-free for 5 years. 5. Such extensive involvement of the thorax that treatment with radiotherapy alone would be hazardous because of excessive lung irradiation, even if a shrinking field technique were employed 6. Suspected or confirmed pregnancy. 7. Transformation to large cell lymphoma or other aggressive histology. 8. Disease that is widely disseminated (bone marrow, liver etc)</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective study will test the following hypotheses in patients with stage I-II low grade marginal zone (MZ) lymphoma:
1. Involved Field Radiotherapy will produce a complete response rate of &gt; 90% 
2. Radiotherapy will be associated with a locoregional progression of &lt; 20% after 10 years 
3. Death from MZ lymphoma will occur in &lt; 40% of patients within 10 years of radiotherapy 

This study secondary objectives are:
1. To collect information on the prevalence of H. pylori in non-gastric MALT lymphoma 
2. To estimate rates of acute and late toxicity of radiotherapy</summary>
