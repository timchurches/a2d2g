    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Moderate or Severe On-treatment COPD Exacerbation - A Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbation was defined as an increase or new onset of =2 lower respiratory symptoms related to COPD, with =1 symptom lasting =3 days, requiring a change in treatment. Lower respiratory symptoms included shortness of breath, sputum production (volume), sputum purulence, cough, wheezing and chest tightness. A change in treatment included: hospitalisation/treatment in an urgent care unit, prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids or a significant change of prescribed respiratory medication such as theophyllines, long-acting beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids. Exacerbations were considered severe if the patient was held and treated for an acute respiratory condition in an urgent care department or an observation unit for &gt;6 hours, the patient was treated at home by a mobile urgent care team or the patient was admitted to hospital.The "measure type" displays the 25th percentile and its 95% confidence interval.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Moderate or Severe On-treatment COPD Exacerbations - Number of moderate or severe on-treatment COPD exacerbations, based on a 7-day gap rule: exacerbations where the onset date of the second exacerbation event was =7 days after the end date of the first exacerbation event were combined and counted as moderate or severe if =1 of the contributing exacerbation events was moderate or severe. Exacerbations were considered severe if the patient was held and treated for an acute respiratory condition in an urgent care department or an observation unit for &gt;6 hours, the patient was treated at home by a mobile urgent care team or the patient was admitted to hospital. Exacerbations were considered moderate if they required prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids.

    <summary>This is a randomised study to be conducted in patients with severe to very severe Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to establish whether there is a need for these patients
      to be continuously treated with an inhaled corticosteroid on top of two potent long-acting
      bronchodilators. The study also aims to identify the type of patients who are likely to
      benefit from inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy.</summary>
