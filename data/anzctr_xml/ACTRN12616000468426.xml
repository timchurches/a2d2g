  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nurses in medical wards will complete a simulation-based training program on recognition and management of patient  deterioration, either via face-to-face simulation (FIRST2ACT) or via a web-based training program (FIRST2ACTWeb).  Nurses will be allocated to an intervention program according to the site of their employment. 

The training for both groups takes between 1.5 to 2 hours to complete and both include five key components: developing core knowledge; assessment (learning stimulus); simulation; reflective review; and performance feedback. Members of the research team who are senior nurse clinicians will administer and support both forms of training on site at the participating hospitals, assisted by local clinical nurse specialists/educators. 

Group 1: Web-based training is completed individually on a personal computer or in a ward training room. The web-hosted e-simulation version FIRST2ACTWeb (see http://first2actweb.com/) incorporates three interactive scenarios (myocardial infarction, shock ,and respiratory cases) where patient actors deteriorate (over eight minutes) with participants required to click on various potential actions  such as measuring blood pressure or inserting an intravenous line - resulting in further pop-up videos of each action. Detailed performance feedback is then provided to a participant on completion and an explanatory Course Manual is downloadable for reflection and review . 

Group 2: The face-to-face version of the program mirrors the web based program. After an introductory  briefing,  participants work in teams of three with a patient actor and research support staff member, in a ward setting to assess and manage the 'patient' who role-plays three clinical deterioration episodes, as described for Group 1.. At the conclusion, a debriefing is conducted by a clinical researcher and nurse participants  complete evaluation surveys. An explanatory Course Manual is made available for each participant's reflection and review. 
For both groups, prospective program evaluation is conducted through pretest and post-test surveys of nurses' clinical knowledge, performance evaluation using a structured checklist, and post-test satisfaction and feedback.. The web-based version collects evaluation data via a remote server, including which screen-based buttons were clicked and when (to enable scoring of performance), self-completed survey data and analytical data from the website.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is quality of nursing assessment, measured via the proportion of patients showing late clinical signs of deterioration, as determined from medical record review.  We will use a data extraction tool including early and late signs of clinical deterioration adapted from Harrison, et al, 2005 (The prevalence of recordings of the signs of critical conditions and emergency response in hospital  wards  the SOCCER study. Resuscitation 2005;65:149-57). 
In addition, appropriate frequency of vital signs documentation and evidence-based responses to deterioration will be collected as proxies for the quality of nursing care. A valid MR audit tool published as McConnell-Henry et al, 2015 (Designing a medical records review tool: An instructional guide. Contemporary Nurse 2015; 50:1-8.) was revised to enable data to be extracted and then recorded electronically (online).

    <statisticalmethods>(i) Sample size 
Nurse participants: While a population sample of all nurses in prescribed medical wards is desirable, based on pilot hospital-based studies which achieved a participation rate of 82%, we anticipate a similar participation rate for this study (n = &gt;200). This proportion was sufficient to demonstrate significant improvements to nursing practices in an earlier intervention study.    
Patient sample size: Pilot data from an earlier rural study indicated that early signs of deterioration were present in 28% of patients while late signs were present in 10%, and that the total sample size required to detect a 5% reduction in late signs of deterioration with a level of significance of 5% and a power of 0.8 is 434 patients (217 before and 217 after the intervention) at each site.
(ii) Analysis: In the simulation training intervention, knowledge and skill performance ratings: participant demographics, questionnaire, and simulation performance will be described with the use of descriptive and inferential statistics. There will be a range of nominal, ordinal and interval data (paired and unpaired) requiring tests such as Chi-square, McNemar, Mann Whitney U, and t-tests. Multivariate analysis (linear and logistic regression) will be used to identify predictors of performance.  Stakeholder focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed to enable thematic analysis and to help identify the perceived impact of the program. 
Patient notes review - A pre-post intervention analysis conducted through time series analyses will identify the primary outcome. The success of the training intervention will be identified by a statistically significant increase in applicable actions; reduction in the proportion of late signs of deterioration, lower in-hospital mortality and decrease in admissions to ICU. 
(iii) An economic analysis will assess costs associated with both educational interventions versus benefits. To determine program savings, we will perform a decision analysis, from the hospitals perspective with respect to costs such as program development, time, educator commitment and staff release costs relating to both educational interventions. We will measure length of stay, hospital costs (per day, per unit), number of procedures performed, (e.g. x-rays, pathology or lab tests) for each patient.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we aim to address patient safety in relation to first responders failure to rescue deteriorating patients with a focus on enhancing the assessment and management of clinical deterioration.  Over the last 7 years we have developed a face-to-face and web based educational program known as First2Act(Web) http://first2actweb.com/ which has had a demonstrated impact on educational outcomes  and in a preliminary study a significant impact on clinical performance.  The objectives of this study are to measure and compare the cost- effectiveness and clinical impact of in-situ face-to-face and web-based simulation programs in the management of patient deterioration and related patient outcomes.
Based on these programs our intentions are to train nurse participants in primary responses to emergencies (the first 8 minutes) in medical wards at Monash Health and St John of God Health Care and other hospitals, using either in-situ face-to-face or web based version of First2Act. The impact of these interventions will be determined through quantitative and qualitative approaches; economic analyses and patient notes review (time series analyses) to measure quality of care and patient outcomes.  This will enable us to determine the clinical impact of the intervention programs in relation to resource implications. 
It is anticipated that this program will reduce the number of in-hospital adverse events, length of stay and hospital costs whilst adding to our understanding of the barriers and enablers to effective decision-making in clinical deterioration and the utility of simulation in the preparation of first responders. Subsequent recommendations and final programs will be made available to the Victorian and International communities
