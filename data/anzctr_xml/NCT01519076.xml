Treatment: devices: Pulse Therapeutics (PTI) Magnetically-Enhanced Diffusion (MED)
The PTI MED System is a magnetic-controlled infusion system which uses external energy (magnetic energy) to drive an agent (tPA) to the desired target (blood clot).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: incidence and evaluation of any adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure compared with historical controls treated with tPA alone. - The primary measures of safety will be mortality at 3 months and symptomatic ICH within the first 24 hours post-treatment. All intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) will be classified radiographically using the ECASS criteria. The proportion of subjects with Type II parenchymal intracerebral hematomas within the first 24 hours post-treatment and the incidence of any asymptomatic hemorrhage within the first 24 hours will also be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Brain Recanalization and perfusion - The degree of recanalization (partial and complete) and reperfusion will be assessed at 2-4 hours post-treatment using CT angiography, and at 24 +/- 6 hours post-treatment using MRI. TIMI Grade Flow of 2 or 3 will be considered "responsive to treatment".</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a prospective trial wherein each included subject will receive the experimental
      magnetically enhanced diffusion therapy. It will be conducted on a maximum of ten adult male
      or female patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and informed consent has
      been obtained. Subjects presenting in the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke and
      are eligible for tPA therapy may be considered for inclusion in the study.</summary>
