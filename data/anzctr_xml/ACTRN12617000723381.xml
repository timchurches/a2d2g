  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS) (R) is a commercially available manualised intervention that uses a small group format of 8-10 teenagers. It comprises didactic instruction, parent-assistance (social coaching), role-playing and modeling, perspective taking questions, behavioural rehearsal, social coaching and in vivo homework assignments. The program comprises once per week 90 minute sessions for 14 weeks.  The structure of each 90 minute teen session includes homework review (30 mins), didactic lesson using role play/exercise (30 mins), socialization activity (20 mins); reunification with parents (10 mins).   Concurrent 90 minute parent sessions consist of homework review (60 mins), review of adolescent didactic lesson (10 mins); homework assignment (10 mins); reunification with teens (10 mins).  The parent program covers the same topics as the teenage group.
The program content includes: 
Session 1: Introduction and conversational skills I  Trading Information
Session 2: Conversational Skills II  two way conversations
Session 3: Conversational Skills III  electronic communication (voicemail, email, text messaging, social networking, online safety); 
Session 4: Choosing appropriate friends (identifying a peer group/crowd, identifying extracurricular activities)
Session 5: Appropriate use of humour (e.g. paying attention to humour feedback)
Session 6: Peer Entry I  entering a conversation (starting and entering conversations with potential friends);
Session 7: Peer Entry II  exiting a conversation
Session 8: Get togethers
Session 9 : Good sportsmanship (being a good host or guest during get-togethers);
Session 10: Rejection 1  teasing and embarrassing feedback (handling teasing, physical bullying, managing rumours and gossip, minimizing cyber bullying, changing a bad reputation);
Session 11: Rejection II  Bullying and bad reputations
Session 12: Handling disagreements
Session 13: Rumours and gossip
Session 14: Graduation and termination (final review, graduation party and ceremony).
Weekly homework tasks will take approximately 30 minutes for teenagers and parents to arrange and carry out, depending on the week of the program.  An example is for a teenager to identify someone from the group to call outside of group time and practise conversation skills with them.  The parent would be expected to support the teenager in identifying the person, arranging, monitoring success of the call and troubleshooting difficulties.  Another example is to have a get together with a friend and practise being a good sport during board games or computer games.  In this week, the teen also needs to practise handling teasing if the opportunity comes up at school.  This weeks homework can take up to two hours considering that it involves a social get together which could be also viewed as a regular adolescent activity for a weekend.
The teen and parent sessions will be run by experienced occupational therapists, speech pathologists and psychologists. Sessions will be run at a community therapy centre or research centre depending on the site.
Fidelity monitoring: Fidelity monitoring will be conducted at each site by the research assistant who will be trained by the therapists to complete weekly fidelity checks, alternating between parent and teen groups. The checklist was developed specifically for the PEERS program to ensure that the main content points in the manual are delivered for each session and has been used in previous studies.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will follow standard principles for RCTs, using two group comparisons on all participants on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary comparison H1 immediately post the intervention at 14 weeks will be based on the SSIS caregiver and child self-report on the domains of Social Skills, and Problem Behaviour and will be between treatment groups using generalized linear models. Secondary analyses will use similar methods to compare the outcomes between groups for secondary outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This parent-assisted social skills program (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills: PEERS) aims to help teenagers develop the social skills needed to make and maintain friends. The program reduces the complexity of social behaviour and teaches simple rules, using modelling and practice. Parents participate in separate concurrent sessions to help them support their teenager with real world practice. The program has not been tested with teenagers with acquired brain injuries (ABI) and cerebral palsy (CP) . This study aims to pilot test PEERS for 40 youth with ABI and CP in a randomised waitlist controlled trial across two sites in Australia to improve social competence and friendships. Secondly, we will explore caregiver's and youth's experiences of participating in the PEERS program.</summary>
