  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention requires eligible participants attend two, 150-minute group psychoeducation sessions spaced one week apart. Participants will be provided with educational information about bipolar disorder, its treatment and coping strategies for themselves as a caregiver of someone with bipolar disorder.

Sessions will be audiorecorded and adherence to protocol by the facilitators will be assessed by independent raters.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist control. Waitlist participants will receive assessments at the same timepoints as the immediate intervention group.

Waitlist participants will receive the intervention after the 1-month follow-up assessment.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants who express an interest in the study will be contacted by the associate investigator (Miller) who will complete the initial screening interview over the phone. Participants who meet inclusion criteria will then be sent the information sheet, consent form and baseline measures. The coordinating principal investigator (McEvoy) who is off-site will generate a randomisation schedule and allocate participants to waitlist control or immediate intervention. Participants will be informed via telephone which condition they are in.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis using G*Power software was conducted assuming a low to medium effect size (f = .20), an alpha of .05, power of .80, an autocorrelation of .5, and three measurement occasions. This analysis suggested that a minimum of 42 (21 per group) participants be recruited.

Five hypotheses are proposed

H1: 	Participants will report significantly greater pre-post reductions in burden (as measured by the BAS) compared to controls.

H2: 	Participants will report significantly greater pre-post reductions in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (as measured by the DASS) compared to controls.

H3: 	Participants will report significantly greater pre-post improvements in knowledge of bipolar disorder, support and self-care strategies (as measured by the Knowledge of Bipolar Disorder Scale), compared to controls
  
H4: 	Participants will report significantly greater pre-post improvements in bipolar disorder coping self-efficacy (as measured by a scale adapted from the Managing Bipolar Disorder Scale) compared to controls

H5: 	The effects hypothesised in H1  H4 will be maintained at one-month follow-up.


The five hypotheses will be tested with a series of Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs)  one for each outcome measure. For the GLMMs, there is one nominal random effect (participant), one fixed nominal effect of group (intervention, waitlist), and one ordinal fixed effect (time: baseline for those in the waitlist condition, pre, post, follow-up for all participants). All hypotheses predict a significant Group by Time interaction effect.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psychoeducation provided to individuals with bipolar disorder and their caregiver has strong research support but to date no studies have investigated the impact of providing psychoeducation to caregivers alone. This study aims to contribute towards filling this gap by evaluating a two-session group intervention for caregivers of individuals with bipolar disorder focussing on improving knowledge of the disorder and the development of self-care strategies. Participants will be randomised to either a waitlist control condition or intervention condition. Repeated measures of stress, depression, anxiety, self-efficacy, knowledge and burden will be taken at pre, post, and follow-up intervals. It is hypothesised that participants will report reduced symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety and burden at post intervention and follow-up, as well as improved knowledge and self efficacy, relative to controls. Those in the control condition will be offered the intervention immediately after the waitlist period.</summary>
