  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit for patients implanted with the
      Nucleus® CI532 cochlear implant and to demonstrate the atraumatic nature of the electrode
      design.

      Nucleus® CI532 has a pre-curved, perimodiolar array, the EA32, which is introduced into the
      cochlea through a straightening sheath.</summary>
