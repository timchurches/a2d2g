  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their companion are randomized to participate in a 12-week program of cognitive activity/stimulation.   The sessions focus on different aspects of cognition, learning how these domains are altered in AD and incorporating pencil and paper tasks to demonstrate ways to enhance these areas of thinking.  Seven weeks of the program (1x 90-minute session per week) are completed in a group setting with a facilitator.  The additional sessions are completed at home, with participants provided with materials to complete the set material.  Telephone contact is made during the week to address any concerns/questions participants may have.  Dyads (participants with AD and their companion) randomized to Arm 1 will attend the sessions together.</interventions>
    <comparator>In Arm 2, only the companion will attend all of the cognitive activity/stimulation group sessions.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomisation was undertaken in random
blocks of 6 to 10, with three to five dyads allocated
to each group. The allocation list was handled by an independent investigator who had no contact with
study participants and was not involved in the supervision
of staff responsible for the collection of data. The allocation
table was then passed on to the investigator running
the intervention, who invited eligible participants to
join the relevant groups. Research assistants undertaking
the follow-up assessments remained blinded to group
allocation</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a cognitive activity program, specifically designed for people with mild AD and their companions can reduce or slow further cognitive decline and improve quality of life for people with AD.  It will also investigate the benefits of this type of program to the companion.</summary>
