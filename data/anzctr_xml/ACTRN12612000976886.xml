  <interventions>
    <interventions>At 5 - 11 days age each infant was studied for one daytime sleep period (30 min to 3 hours duration) with polysomnogram recording, whilst seated in a standard car seat fitted with the foam plastic car seat insert device (fabric covered 2.5 cm thick foam 'H' shaped device with a slot cut in the top, the seat belt straps brought through the top slot and through a slim slot in the base)
Further to the sleep study the parents of infants were then asked to complete a 6 week diary of car seat use. They were required to state whether an insert was used during this time period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean oxygen saturation in insert group vs controls over sleep period  in car seat. This is assessed by recording sleep parameters using a Sandman Pocket 2008 device fitted with Nellcor pulse oximeter. Sleep was analyzed using Sandman Elite V software to enable mean oxygenation determination for each sleep.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 min- 3 hours of sleep</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean low oxygen saturation in insert group vs controls. Oxygen saturation  is assessed by recording sleep parameters using a Sandman Pocket 2008 device fitted with Nellcor pulse oximeter. Sleep was analyzed using Sandman Elite V software to enable haemoglobin oxygen desaturation events to be identified analyzed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 min-3 hours sleep</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of haemoglobin oxygen desaturation events ( &gt; 4 % drop blood oxygen saturation for &gt; or = to 10 seconds) in insert group vs controls. Desaturation events assessed by recording sleep parameters using a Sandman Pocket 2008 device fitted with Nellcor pulse oximeter. Sleep was analyzed using Sandman Elite V software to enable haemoglobin oxygen desaturation events to be identified analyzed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30min - 3 hours sleep</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events in car seats over a 6 week period recorded in a diary insert use vs no insert use. Examples of possible adverse events would be poor fit of the insert device in the car seat, apnea, cyanosis episodes in the car seat.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Periods of use of the car seat for infant travel vs a place of sleep or containment outside of the car over 6 weeks</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infants are at risk of low oxygen levels and apparent life threatening events and even death whilst sleeping in infant car seats. A foam plastic insert was developed to improve the position of infants in car seats. Hypothesis: that the foam insert can prevent episodes of reduced oxygenation in infants in car seats. This study also quantified car seat use in the study group over a 6 week period.</summary>
