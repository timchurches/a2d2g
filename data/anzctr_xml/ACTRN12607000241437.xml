  <interventions>
    <interventions>The comparator is laparoscopic guided minilaparotomy.

Cyst will be removed by minilaparotomy after laparoscopic evaluation in the comparator group. A 3 to 7 cm transverse skin incision 1 to 2 cm below the pubic hair line and 2 to 4 cm above the pubic symphisis is carried out after diagnostic  laparoscopy. Excision of the ovarian cyst is performed in the standard fashion and the ovarian edges approximated with a suture stitch avoiding the ovarian cortex. 
Duration of the treatment is strictly limited to surgery.
Follow up duration is limited to 1 month after discharge in order to verify short term complications and patient satisfaction.</interventions>
