  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial has three arms. Arms 1. and 2. will each receive a different intervention as follows:
1. Micronutrient supplement (elemental iron 60mg, folic acid 1.5mg) taken orally twice weekly for the duration of pregnancy and three months postpartum.
and
2. Micronutrient supplement (multiple micronutrients - modified 2xUNIMAPP) taken orally twice weekly for the duration of pregnancy and three months postpartum.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3 will receive the control treatment as follows:
3. Micronutrient supplement (elemental iron 60mg, folic acid 0.4mg) taken orally once daily for the duration of pregnancy and three months postpartum.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we will compare the effects of three different methods of iron supplementation in 1250 pregnant Vietnamese women on maternal haemoglobin and iron stores, infant birth weight, and infant anaemia, infant height, weight and developmental screening during the first 12 months of life. We will also assess the influence of maternal depression on infant growth parameters.</summary>
