    <interventions>Intensive psychosocial intervention minus antipsychotic medication. Participants randomised to this intervention will be administered placebo tablets. The psychosocial intervention consists of four modules: intensive case management (engagement, problem solving, advocacy and support); close monitoring and crisis response; cognitive-behaviour therapy for symptoms; family support and education. The intensive psychosocial intervention will consist of twice-weekly contact with the treating team during the first 2 months of the study, and weekly contact after the first 2 months. In total, the treatment will be provided for 6 months. Placebo medication will be titrated in 1mg increments at the discretion of the treating clinician over a four-week period, until a maximum maintenance dose of 6mg/day is reached, if required. Dose will be held at 2mg/day if adequate response is observed within 4 weeks. The medication will be packaged to allow flexible dosing. </interventions>

    <sequence>A stratified randomisation design will be used to allocate subjects to either one of the treatment groups.  It has been established that duration of untreated psychosis and gender are associated with functional outcome, the key outcome measure in this study.  Hence, we will be using characteristics as stratifying factors in the randomisation, since any chance imbalances on these prognostic variables may bias the analysis.  Duration of untreated psychosis will be included as a three-level factor; &lt;  1 month;  1 month to &lt; 3 months, 3 months to 6 months.  Along with gender, this will result in six separate randomisation lists from which subjects will be drawn.  Subjects will be allocated to either one of the treatment groups using randomly permuted blocks within each stratum, to ensure that subject allocation to the treatment groups is approximately equal.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background Over the last decade, there has been a significant shift in psychiatric services towards a greater focus on early intervention for psychotic illnesses. This has raised the question of what the most appropriate form of treatment is for people (very) early in the course of a first psychotic episode. It is also possible that due to the efforts of early detection programs, the composition of first episode psychosis (FEP) cohorts may have changed towards including those who may have a more benign course of psychotic symptoms and thus may respond to more benign treatments. Aims The purpose of this project is to investigate whether a sub-group of young people can recover from FEP with intensive psychosocial intervention but without taking antipsychotic medication. Although we know that antipsychotic medication is usually helpful in assisting recovery from psychosis, medication may not be essential for effective treatment in all cases. Furthermore, there is also evidence that psychological treatment is helpful and may be sufficient and more acceptable to young people who are experiencing FEP. The design of the project will also shed light on the issue of whether a longer duration of psychotic symptoms before treatment with antipsychotic medication is commenced (duration of untreated psychosis) results in worse outcome than a shorter duration of symptoms. Design Participants will be young people, aged 15 - 25 receiving treatment from the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) of ORYGEN Youth Health. Approximately 95 young people will be randomised to two treatment groups: 1. Medication (risperidone) plus intensive psychosocial treatment (MIPT) 2. Placebo plus intensive psychosocial treatment (PIPT) The trial will be of 6 months duration. Intensive contact with participants will be maintained by case managers and psychiatrists throughout this time. Clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures will be taken at baseline and at various follow-up points (3, 6, 12, 24 months). Outcomes The primary outcome of interest is functional and symptomatic outcome (at 6, 12 and 24 months) in each treatment group. Specifically, it is of interest whether participants in the PIPT group achieve similar levels of functional and symptomatic improvement compared to the MIPT group at short- and long-term follow-up. Another outcome of interest is the proportion of the PIPT group who are not placed on antipsychotic medication during the 6-month period. These participants will have achieved satisfactory remission without antipsychotic medication. This sub-group will be compared on functioning and symptom scales to those randomised to the medication group and to those for whom antipsychotic medication was commenced due to worsening mental state and/or risk. Characteristics of this group will be analysed to determine the sub-group of FEP patients who may achieve remission from symptoms without antipsychotic medication.</summary>
