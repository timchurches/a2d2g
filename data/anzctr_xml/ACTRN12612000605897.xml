    <interventions>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare outcomes of patients where repair of transphincteric anal
fistula was performed using LIFT and BioLIFT techniques.

This is a retrospective review of patient who had undergone the LIFT and BioLIFT procedure. Data will be collected from the hospital medical records. Followup details will be obtained from surgeon's private rooms.

The 'intervention' group would be patient who had the BioLIFT procedure for treatment of transphincteric anal fistula, from 2011 to current, by a single surgeon. The BioLIFT procedure involves the use of a bioprosthetic device to augment the LIFT (Ligation of Intersphincteric Fistula Tract) procedure.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The surgical management of anal fistulas remains in an evolutionary phase. A new sphinctersaving technique known as the LIFT (ligation of intersphincteric tract) procedure has gained growing interest. Early results together with reports from other authors have been promising with 57-94% success and minimal complications. The use of a bioprosthetic device has been suggested to augment the LIFT procedure (BioLIFT).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare outcomes of patients where repair of transphincteric anal
fistula was performed using LIFT and BioLIFT techniques.

Patients who have undergone LIFT or BioLIFT procedure from 2011-current, by a single surgeon will be
retrospectively reviewed. Case notes will be retrieved and data entry performed. Statistical analysis of outcomes will
be assessed. Outcomes measures of complications, recurrence, physiology studies performed pre and post
operative, will be evaluated.</summary>
