    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - daunorubicin hydrochloride
Treatment: drugs - prednisolone
Treatment: drugs - prednisone
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Other interventions - pharmacological study

Obese - Pts are stratified according to body mass index (BMI) (= 95th percentile [obese]. Pts receive anticancer therapy and prednisone/prednisolone orally 2x on either day 1 or day 8. Pts receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and vincristine sulfate IV once on the same day.
Blood samples are obtained on either day 1 or day 8 of induction therapy for pharmacokinetic analysis of prednisone, daunorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine activity levels.
Blood samples are analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultrafiltration, a Nessler reaction, ELISA, and liquid chromatography using reverse-phase chromatography, fluorescent detection, and solid-phase extraction.
Demographic information, including ethnicity, is also collected. Weight and height is recorded at diagnosis and on the day the pharmacological study of vincristine sulfate, prednisone, and daunorubicin hydrochloride begins.

Normal - Pts are stratified according to body mass index (BMI) 10th to 95th percentile [normal or at risk for overweight].
Blood samples are obtained on either day 1 or day 8 of induction therapy for pharmacokinetic analysis of prednisone, daunorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine sulfate activity levels.
Blood samples are analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultrafiltration, a Nessler reaction, ELISA, and liquid chromatography using reverse-phase chromatography, fluorescent detection, and solid-phase extraction.
Demographic information, including ethnicity, is also collected. Weight and height is recorded at diagnosis and on the day the pharmacological study of vincristine sulfate, prednisone, and daunorubicin hydrochloride begins

Underweight - Patients are stratified according to body mass index (BMI) = 10th percentile [underweight]).
Blood samples are obtained on either day 1 or day 8 of induction therapy for pharmacokinetic analysis of prednisone, daunorubicin hydrochloride, and vincristine sulfate activity levels.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about the affect of body mass index on the way anticancer drugs work in
      the body. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying body mass index in younger patients receiving
      prednisone/prednisolone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and pegaspargase for high-risk acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.</summary>
