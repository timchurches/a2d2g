  <interventions>
    <interventions>Hourly titrated oral misoprostol for induction of labor. Solution Preparation 
Dissolve 200 mcg of misoprostol in 200 ml of water. The solution now has a misoprostol concentration of 1 mcg/ml.

Dosing 
20 mcg (20 ml) of the solution to be given to the patient orally every hour until active labor was achieved or 4 doses given. 

If uterine activity is present, but the patient is not in active labor, give the same dose and reassess in one hour. 

If no uterine activity is present after 4 doses, increase the misoprostol dose to 40 mcg (40 ml)  every hour until active labor was achieved or 4 doses given.  

If uterine activity is present, but the patient is not in active labor, give the same dose and reassess in one hour. 
If no uterine activity is present after 4 doses of 40 mcg or 40 ml (8 hours from the start), increase the misoprostol dose to 60 mcg (60 ml)  every hour until active labor was achieved or 16 doses of 60 mcg given. Maximal total dose is 1200 mcg in 24 hours.

Once active labor is established at any dose, discontinue the misoprostol.   
</interventions>
    <comparator>Two hourly oral misoprostol for induction of labor. Solution Preparation 
Dissolve 200 mcg of misoprostol in 200 ml of water. The solution now has a misoprostol concentration of 1 mcg/ml.

Dosing 
25 mcg (25 ml) of the solution to be given to the patient orally every 2 hours until active labor was achieved or 12 doses (300 mcg) given. 

If uterine activity is present, but the patient is not in active labor, give the same dose and reassess in two hour. 

Once active labor is established at any dose, discontinue the misoprostol.

    <summary>The research hypothesis is that more women for whom induction of labor is indicated will undergo vaginal delivery within 24 hours with hourly treatment with oral misoprostol compared with 2 hourly treatment.The primary objective is to compare the achievement of vaginal delivery within 24 hours following induction with hourly or 2 hourly oral misoprostol.</summary>
