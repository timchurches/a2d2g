  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Active intervention group will receive a Jawbone Up smartphone application and wristband to use for the duration of the study. A Medical student will fit the Jawbone to the patient and assist in setting up the Smartphone application. They will be encouraged to use the application on a 24 hour basis but they will be free to choose how much they use it over the period of the study. 
The Jawbone UP wristband and application for a smartphone tracks the wearers steps, distance, calories burned and time spent active versus idle. This information is sent to the smartphone via bluetooth and recorded. The smartphone application can also be used to log the users calorie consumption. Participants will be encouraged to wear the wristband throughout the 50 week period to record their exercise and calorie consumption. Adherence will be assessed when the patient returns to remeasure their personal data (weight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure) at weeks 12, 26, 38 and 50. </interventions>

    <concealment>General Practices from Inner West Sydney Medicare Local will be recruited to participate in the study. Each practice will then be asked to screen patients in their waiting room &gt; 35 years old, with the AusDrisk tool. All those who score over 12 will be invited to participate in the research study by their GP. 
Participants will then be provided with information regarding the recommended daily calorie consumption and exercise requirements for their age and gender to decrease their risk of developing type 2 Diabetes.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation method: Participants will be randomised by a computer generated system that will be allocated externally to the practice. The GP completes recruitment by entering participant details into a web page which then allocates which patients will be entered into the intervention group.

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study, therefore only a small number of participants are required to achieve the objectives of our research. We calculated a convenience sample size of 30 participants will give an indication to the effectiveness of the intervention. Due to the small sample size we do not anticipate to generate a meaningful effect size estimate, however, the results will inform us of the feasibility and potential modifications for future studies. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Smartphone application technology as a brief primary care intervention to increase sustained physical activity levels and decrease the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 
30 participants over the age of 35 who are at high risk of developing diabetes will be selected. Participants diabetes risk will be calculated using the AusDrisk tool.  
The participants will be divided into two randomised groups. The active intervention group will be introduced to the Smartphone application while the Control intervention group will not. The participants weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and AusDrisk score will be measured in both groups at weeks 12, 26, 38 and 50. 
The anticipated outcome for the project is a measurable increase in the physical activity and decease in AusDrisk score in the active intervention group compared to the control intervention group. </summary>
