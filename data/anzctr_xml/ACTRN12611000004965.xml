  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sydney Children's Hospital is doing a study to see whether haemangiomas of infancy (strawberry marks) which are no longer flat or which have continued to grow in spite of oral corticosteroids (cortisone), or present when the baby is too old for steroid treatment, will stop growing and /or shrink when treated with propranolol. A recent report of 11 cases suggests that propranolol may be helpful in shrinking haemangiomas of infancy.</summary>
