      <outcome>Mean Regional Wall Motion Score Index at Week 12 - Wall motion score index is a semi-quantitative analysis of regional systolic function. Each segment is analyzed individually and scored on the basis of its motion and systolic thickening.

Wall motion score index is derived as a sum of all scores divided by the number of segments visualized. Larger score index indicates higher degree of abnormalities. Cardiac MRIs were performed at qualified sites on participants who agree to participate in the MRI sub-study.
