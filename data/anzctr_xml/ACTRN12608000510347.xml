  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial investigating the acute effects of skim milk on post-meal satiety and energy intake.  Each participant will undertake 2 visits in random order, 1 week apart on the same day at the same time of day.  Participants will be fasting at each visit.  They will consume either 600 mL of skim milk (1122 kJ; 27 g protein), or 600 mL of a sugar-based fruit juice beverage (1122 kJ; &lt;1 g protein) with a fixed energy breakfast (1000 kJ). Participants will consume the beverage over a 15 minute period. Four hours after breakfast, they will be provided with an ad libitum lunch consisting of previously selected sandwiches. They will be asked to eat the sandwiches, which will be available in excess, until they are comfortably full. They will be permitted to consume one cup of coffee, tea, or a glass of water 2 h after breakfast and with the lunch meal. 45 minutes will be allowed for lunch. At the completion of lunch, energy intake will be assessed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight and obesity impact on the risk of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggest that nutrient composition of the diet is an important factor controlling satiety and energy intake, and that dietary protein is the most satiating nutrient. Skim milk is an excellent source of protein. Sweetened drinks rich in sucrose and/or glucose and fructose have become increasingly popular, and evidence suggests they may contribute to positive energy balance and the development of obesity. Skim milk has similar energy density to many sweetened drinks, but almost half the energy is present as protein. Indirect evidence suggests that skim milk (high in protein) relative to a sugar beverage, should reduce energy intake acutely.
The study aims to investigate the effects of drinking skim milk in comparison to a fruit juice beverage, at breakfast on self-reported post-meal satiety and energy intake at lunch, in overweight individuals.</summary>
