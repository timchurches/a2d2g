  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with advanced liver disease and ascites (intra-abdominal fluid) are at high risk of bacterial infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Once daily antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is considered standard treatment to prevent bacterial infections in this setting. However, breakthrough infections are still common. The study hypothesis is that a higher dose of antibiotics may be more effective in preventing bacterial infections in advanced liver disease. The purpose is therefore to conduct a trial to examine whether twice daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more effective than the standard once daily dose at reducing bacterial infections and admissions to hospital in these high risk patients.</summary>
