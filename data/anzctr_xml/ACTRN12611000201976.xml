  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A decrease in the number of cold events.

To assess a decrease in the number of cold events we enrol participants who self admit to suffering at least one cold event per month. At baseline, a case report which includes data collection and questionnaires will be completed. Over the 90 day trial, participants are required to record any cold or associated symptoms they may suffer, subsequent medications adminstered, record date and total intervention capsules taken each day in addition to any adverse events in a diary provided to them. Analysis of data at the end of the trial will compare cold events and severity recorded by those in the treatment group and those in the placebo group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90 days.

The 90 day time point will occur 90 days from the baseline interview and randomisation process which will be the first day they start to take the capsules (active or placebo).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A decrease in time to symptom resolution in the event of a cold</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in Quality of life (QOL).

The outcomes for the changes in QOL will be assessed through three questionnaires:

* the SF-12 short questionnaire,

* a 3-day diet recall questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90 days.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants contact us in response to an advertisement, during which we assess their suitability. If suitable they are asked to attend the Princess Alexandra Hospital for their first visit.
Treatment is allocated according to their arrival.
Allocation concealment is performed by prepacked, numbered coded, opaque containers. As we see participants they are allocated the next available number on entry into the study which corresponds to a coded treatment. The randomisation of the numbers are computer-generated.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation is determined by a computer program. As each participant attends their first appointment they are allocated either A or B according to which letter is next on the list. A referring to product code LF20077 and B referring to LF20078.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Whey proteins are normally found in milk.  Supplementation appears to strengthen the immune system by promoting anti-bacterial activity.  Lactoferrin is a protein isolated from whey proteins in milk with documented anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, and immune function strengthening effects. Studies have shown lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that is present in body secretions such as tears, nasal exudates, saliva, and bronchial mucus. A high concentration is also found in breast milk to help the infant fight infection.  Lactoferrin is also a major component of circulating white blood cells known as neutrophils and is released by these cells in infected areas.  Further, lactoferrin has also been shown in laboratory experiments to bind to viral receptor sites and inhibit the growth of several viruses that include HIV, Herpes simplex 1 and 2, hepatitis C, and human cytomegalovirus.
 To date, there are no clinical trials that have specifically investigated the effect of lactoferrin to prevent or treat the common cold.  However, because of its scientifically demonstrated antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties, lactoferrin may be of benefit in alleviating the symptoms or complications of these viral infections and a clinical trial could introduce significant merit to clinical claims.</summary>
