  <interventions>
    <interventions>Liver resection was carried out by a clamp crushing method with Pringle maneuver. The clamp crushing method is a fracture or crushing technique during the parechymatous transection of the liver tissue by using a clamp.Pringle maneuver  is a method of inflow hepatic vascular occlusion in liver resection.Thrombectomy was performed if necessary depending on the location and extent of the portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).The surgery lasts 2-3 hours  which was decided by the time of liver resection.</interventions>
    <comparator>In control groups,patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to the tumor and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) for a total radiation dose which ranged from 30 to 52 Gy (median 40 Gy).The radiation was given at a daily dose of 3.0-4.0 Gy per fraction, five times per week over 2 weeks.
 Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed using a catheter  selectively inserted into the proper, right or left hepatic artery. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 1.0g, mitomycin C (MMC) 20mg, Cisplatin 5 mg and Lipiodol 10 to 30 ml (at 1 to 2 ml/cm of the diameter of the tumor) were given by intravenous (IV) injections.TACE was performed 3 to 4 weeks after the radiotherapy and repeated once every 4 to 6 weeks as long as the patient could tolerate the treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rate in surgery therapy (experimental group) versus radiology group(control group) for HCC.All patients were followed-up by one team of doctors to get the information of their survival.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once a year from 1-3 years postoperation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications including postoperative hemmorrhage,bile leak ,wound infection ,etc.
Postoperative complications were monitored, assessed and treated by one team of doctors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after surgery in one month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum alpha fetoprotein(AFP) assay will be assessed by blood test. If the AFP&gt;=400ug/L, it would be recorded as the sign of recurrence or metastases, further examination such as abdominal contrast CT or chest X-ray should be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 1 month postoperation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Contrast CT scan and chest X-ray
Abdominal contrast CT scan was performed for surveillance of tumor recurrence.
Chest X-ray was performed for surveillance of lung metastases.</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 3 month postoperation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Abdominal ultrasound was performed for surveillance of tumor recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>every 1 month postoperation</timepoint>
