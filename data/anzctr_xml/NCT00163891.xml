  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chest infection is a common complication following lung transplant (LTx). Chest physiotherapy
      is widely accepted as an integral part of the management of chest infections, however there
      is no evidence available regarding the effectiveness of chest physiotherapy regimes for LTx
      recipients.

      There is no consensus regarding whether LTx recipients should be instructed to perform
      regular daily chest physiotherapy routines regardless of the presence of lung secretions (ie
      prophylatically) because of the changes in mucus clearance bought about by lung transplant,
      or only when they have a chest infection. Some clinicians believe that a prophylactic regimen
      may be beneficial.

      This research will compare two chest physiotherapy treatment regimens - our current practice
      of chest physiotherapy during chest infections only (Treatment A) with an independently
      performed daily chest physiotherapy regimen regardless of the presence of a chest infection
      (Treatment B). From this research, we aim to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.</summary>
