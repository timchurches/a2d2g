  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to this group will recieve a Restoris MCK Mulitcompartmental Knee implant. 

The components of the RESTORIS 'Registered Trademark' MCK system are used to individually treat the components of the knee when showing osteoarthritis.  The medial unicondylar and patellofemoral components may be combined to perform a bicompartmental knee arthroplasty.

The robotic-arm assisted system utilizes tactile robotic arm technology with integrated intelligent surgical instruments and navigation visualization system to pre-plan and treat each patient uniquely. The end effector of the robotic arm is controlled by the surgeon as shown while the system provides the surgeon with real-time visual, tactile and auditory feedback.

Duration of surgery is approximately 1.5hours

The follow up period for the study is 24 months. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised to this group will recieve a Triathlon Primary Total Knee implant. The Stryker Triathlon Primary Total Knee System is made up of various individual implants of different designs, sizes and thicknesses. The study devices include the;
* CR Femoral Cementless Component  Beaded with Peri-Apatite
* Primary Tibial Baseplate  Cemented
* CR Tibial Insert  X3
* CS Tibial Insert  X3
* Triathlon X3 Patella (cemented asymmetric/symmetric)

Stryker's robotic-arm assisted surgery system Mako will not be used for surgery on this group. 

Duration of surgery is approximately 1.5hours

The follow up period for the study is 24 months.</comparator>
