  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incomplete resection rate of diminutive polyps - biopsies of the margin are analysed histologically and if any adenoma is found on biopsy, this means the resection with the cold snare was incomplete</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of protrusions - cold snare polypectomy can leave a protrusion in the defect, which has previously been shown to be bunched up submucosa. We will record after every polypectomy if a protrusion was visible and if it depends on the snare whether a protrusion occurs or not</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurement of the need for second excision in case of endoscopically visual residual adenoma - If there is visible adenoma left after excision, then it is in the patient's best interest that this is resected at the time of the colonoscopy. We record in which cases this was necessary and if it occurred more often with 1 snare type than the other</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post polypectomy bleeding requiring intervention - We will record if there is any rectal bleeding after the colonoscopy and if this required re-intervention to stop the bleeding. We will record if this was more prevalent with 1 snare type.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cold snare polypectomy (CSP) is now common practice and has proven to be a safe and effective
      technique for removal of diminutive polyps. Both thick and thin wire snares are now commonly
      used for CSP. However, because of their physical characteristics, thick wire snares might
      leave a higher percentage of residual adenoma at the resection site. Since this may result in
      a higher risk of recurrence, the technique needs to be optimized. Experts have suggested that
      a thin wire snare might be more efficient, with a lower risk of residual adenoma at the
      resection site and consequently a lower risk of recurrence and interval cancer.</summary>
