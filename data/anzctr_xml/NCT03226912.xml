  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As mortality from critical illness has reduced, the importance of measuring disabilities
      (cognitive, functional and psychological) in surviving critically ill patients has become
      more important. Currently, the causes, long-term effects and frequency of disabilities in
      patients surviving ICU in Australia are unknown. In the US and UK, studies have been
      undertaken to assess the effects of specific long-term outcomes, such as functional
      disability and depression, which found long-term disabilities were much higher than baselines
      (pre-illness function) and ongoing at five years after ICU discharge. In order to improve
      quality of life of ICU survivors and ensure that medical specialists apply appropriate
      interventions to reduce the cost of these surviving patients on the community, the PREDICT
      management committee proposes the introduction of a patient-reported outcomes registry.</summary>
