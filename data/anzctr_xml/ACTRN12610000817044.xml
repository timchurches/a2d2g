  <interventions>
    <interventions>The periodontal intervention involves periodontal therapy ie scaling and root planing of a participant's teeth and gums. It occurs at baseline and takes around half an hour to an hour. A registered dental hygienest provides the care.</interventions>
    <comparator>The usual course of care, which in this case is no care. Periodontal services are not provided in the general course of care remit of publicly funded dental services who provide dental care to Aboriginal populations.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular surrogate endpoints, both of which are high among the Indigenous Australian population, is established. This study seeks to explore the prevalence of cardiovascular surrogate endpoints among this population with periodontal disease, and to determine if implementation of a periodontal intervention leads to improved cardiovascular risk outcomes. There may be benefit in applying this model to other areas of Indigenous health research.</summary>
