  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dose cohorts may be dosed with one of up to 4 possible total weekly doses (0.3 mg, 1 mg, 2
      mg, 4 mg). Dose escalation or repetition will be governed by pre-specified safety and
      activity rules. Subjects will be confined on either days 1-3 or days 1-3 and 8-10. Follow-up
      visits are also required periodically through day 43, and potential viral load follow-up
      visits at weeks 3 and 6 months post last dose. Study procedures involve blood draws for
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, virologic, and safety assessments</summary>
