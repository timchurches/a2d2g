  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the intervention will receive:
*A computer tablet preloaded with the ASICA skin checker App loaded. The ASICA App combines instructional videos, guided total skin self-examination and electronic reporting,
*A dermatoscope device to attach to the computer tablet. A dermatoscope is a device that allows magnified images of skin lesions to be taken under polarized light for electronic transmission to a specialist. This store and forward process is called mobile teledermoscopy.  
*Detailed written instructions on how to use these.
*Email and SMS text reminders every 2 months to perform self-examination during the 1 year trial duration. 
*If a participant identifies any lesion that concerns them on self-examination they are encouraged to enter a text description through the ASICA App and take a dermoscopic digital image through the Dermatoscope App. These will be sent securely to the project coordinator, who will then contact them with advice to seek urgent clinical review at their regular clinic (or outside of clinic if attendance at the regular clinic not possible). These will be classified as unscheduled visits. All participants who identify a lesion that concerns them will be recommended for clinical review; we will not use teledermatology to triage in the pilot RCT. We will keep a log of use stored in ASICA skin checker App to monitor participants' adherence to the intervention.
*The freely available educational booklet Your guide to early melanoma developed by the Melanoma Institute Australia. The booklet can be viewd here https://issuu.com/melanomainstituteaustralia/docs/your_guide_to_early_melanoma_melano/1
*Decreased scheduled follow-up: annual review for in-situ/stage I; six monthly review for stage II
*Unscheduled visits as needed in addition to those prompted through the ASICA App.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control arm will receive:
*An educational booklet Your guide to early melanoma;
*Scheduled follow-up in line with current guidelines,  at least: annual review for in-situ; six monthly review for stage I; four monthly review for stage II
*Unscheduled visits as needed

    <statisticalmethods>Primary outcomes:
The proportion of patients who are randomised into the trial will be estimated using the number of contacted patients as the denominator. The Wilson (score) method will be used to estimate the confidence interval for this proportion to assess the best and worst case scenarios supported by the pilot study data. We will investigate and describe any groups that had low participation rates in our pilot study.
Secondary outcomes:
We will use a chi-squared test to investigate the difference in proportion undertaking regular skin self-examination between the intervention arm and the usual care arm. A t-test will be used to compare fear of new or recurrent melanoma severity at 12 months between the intervention and usual care group. We will report any estimated differences (either proportions or means) with appropriate confidence intervals as the power for these comparisons will be limited.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate digitally supported skin self-examination compared to usual care in people treated for localised melanoma.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been treated for stage 0/I/II melanoma between 1-3 years ago who are attending regular melanoma follow-ups at the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) and the Newcastle Skin Check .

Study details
People who are found to be eligible and who consent to participate will be randomised (allocated by chance) to the intervention or usual care in a 3:2 ration. Usual care group will receive an educational booklet on early melanoma and the usual number of routine clinic visits. In addition to usual care, participants allocated to intervention group will be provided with a computer tablet a skin checker App loaded and a mobile dermatoscope which they will use to perform total self-examinations every 2 months for 12 months in total. Email and SMS reminders will also be sent every two months to participants in the intervention group. We will document how well participants are able to perform self-examination, their levels of melanoma-related anxiety, the number of skin lesions biopsied or removed, and the costs of follow-up to the participant and to the healthcare system.
Frequent follow-up of localised melanoma is time and resource intensive, and has not shown improved outcomes. This pilot study will provide evidence on which model is best for follow-up care after treatment for localised melanoma</summary>
