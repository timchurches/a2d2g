  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are conducting a Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Laparoscopic or Robotic Radical Hysterectomy versus Abdominal Radical Hysterectomy in Patients with Early Stage Cervical Cancer.

The primary objective of this study is to compare disease-free survival amongst patients who undergo a total laparoscopic or robotic radical hysterectomy (TLRH/TRRH) versus those who undergo a total abdominal radical hysterectomy (TARH) for early stage cervical cancer.

Method 1 is the standard approach worldwide and consists of a laparotomy where the abdomen is opened through a vertical incision or a lower transverse incision and the uterus, the upper one to two centimetres of the vagina and soft tissue around the cervix are removed. Method 2 is a relatively new method where the operation is performed laparoscopically. 

The rationale for the study design is that Total abdominal radical hysterectomy (TARH) and pelvic lymph node dissection (Â± aortic lymph node dissection Â± postoperative [chemo-] radiotherapy) is the current standard treatment for early cervical cancer. While this is an accepted effective treatment, a laparotomy is highly invasive, visibly scarring and is associated with tissue trauma, blood loss and a significant risk of wound and infectious adverse events. Additionally, radical hysterectomy by laparotomy is associated with an average hospital stay of approximately 5 to 7 days and an average recovery period (from surgery) of 5 to 6 weeks.

Laparoscopic/Robotic techniques have been demonstrated to be feasible and safe with previous retrospective studies on Total Laparoscopic/Robotic Hysterectomies showing encouraging results. In a number of retrospective and prospective, non-controlled series the incidence of treatment-related morbidity was less in patients who had a laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy compared to patients who underwent a Total Abdominal Hysterectomy. Retrospective data suggest that the recurrence rate and patterns of recurrence are similar in patients who had a laparoscopic/robotic or an open approach.

Treatment recommendations ideally are based on prospective, randomized trials comparing the current standard technique (TARH) with the proposed better technique (TLRH/TRRH). However, there are currently no prospective studies available which directly compare Total Laparoscopic/Robotic Radical Hysterectomy against the standard treatment of Total Abdominal Radical Hysterectomy in regards to disease-free or overall survival.</summary>
