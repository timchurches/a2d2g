  <interventions>
    <interventions>Medicinal cannabis imported from overseas. 
NB: CBD is cannabidiol, THC is Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol 

Arm 1: Oral medicinal cannabis oil: CBD:THC (1:1) plus standard treatment for 12 weeks
Starting dose will be 0.25mL of whole extract oil which is equivalent to 1.75 mg/mL of THC; and 2.25 mg/mL of CBD 

Arm 2: Oral medicinal cannabis oil: CBD:THC (1:4) plus standard treatment for 12 weeks
Starting dose will be 0.25mL of whole extract oil which is equivalent to 7 mg/mL of THC; and 3.75 mg/mL of CBD

Dosing for this trial will start at 0.25 ml (of either arm 1 or 2 of the combined THC:CBD whole plant extract oil) of the oral medicinal cannabis oil per day and titrated up according to participants weight and symptoms. As oral ingestion has to be processed by the liver, effects will be slower than smoking or vaporizing of cannabis.  It can take anywhere from 1-1.5 hours for effects to be noticed and can take 2-4 hours to reach its peak effect.

Dose will start at 0.25mL at night. If the person is able to function normally the next day, the dose will be increased 0.3mL, if they were not able to function as normal, the dose will be decreased to 0.2mL next night. Each night, the dose will either go up or down by 0.05mL depending on how the participant feels. The research nurse/assistant will be phoning the participant each morning to assess how the person is feeling to determine if they should titrate up or down or stay at that dose. 

Previous trials on oral administration of medicinal cannabis have shown that dose escalation or titration is best choice for the participants. Previous trials, although not on patients with cancer have documented the first dose as 2.7mg THC:2.5mg CBD. These trials increased a dose every 2-3 hours over 24 to 48 hour period till the person felt they were affected by the dose. The dose is then stabilized at that amount for that person and the dose documented. The maximum dose documented in this trial was 48 administrations over 24 hour period. 

Adherence or fidelity will be assessed by blood pathology tests for THC and CBD levels in the blood at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. The blood pathology results will be assessed by the primary investigator and the research team. If there is poor adherence or fidelity, the research team will contact the participant to inquire about taking the dose. If they are having difficulty taking the drug, different strategies will be suggested such as putting it in a capsule (which we would supply) or apply it rectally. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants on consent will be asked if they would like to be in the control group or randomised to a medicinal cannabis group. The comparator for each of the medicinal cannabis arms will be the control group receiving standard treatment.  Standard care is defined as surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation and/or medication.

    <sequence>Randomisation will be conducted the PI of the trial. All other researchers will be blinded to the allocation.

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All available data will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The statistical program utilized will be STATA. For the primary outcome measure, a difference between two proportions will be used to determine if the intervention groups significantly differ from the control group. The difference in change between groups, for the secondary outcome measures, will be tested using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). Groups will be compared at baseline ie. Age, tumour size, other comorbidities, gender etc and if difference(s) is/are ascertained, the variable(s) will be entered into the regression model to appropriately adjust the analyses.

Specifically, the statistical analysis will incorporate the following:

1.	Comparison of toxicity results between participants: Medicinal cannabis groups versus control. This will be analysed using the test of proportions of people experiencing each toxicity between treatment groups. 

2.	Comparison of adverse events between participants (severe and minor): Medicinal cannabis groups versus control. Independent samples t-test (or Mann-Whitney U test if data is non-normal) will be used to compare severity of adverse events between groups. 

3.	Comparison of Progression free survival between participants: Medicinal cannabis groups versus control. This will be analysed using the test of proportions of participants experiencing longer progression free survival between treatment groups at each time point. Changes in SPD (from baseline to 12 weeks) will be categorised into two possible outcomes:  Greater than or equal to 25% or less than 25%.  Logistic regression will be conducted on the change of scores if there are differences noted from baseline.  (Scores will be based on the measurement scores from the RANO criteria - SPD)

4.	Scores of QoL measures between participants: The QLQ-BN20 and FACT-Br scores will be obtained at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.  Either an Independent Samples t-test (or Mann-Whitney U test if data is non-normal) will be utilised for analysis on the general QoL scores. For changes in the scores, repeated measures ANOVA may be used.

5.	Scores of blood pathology markers: Full blood count, electrolyte and liver function test results will be measured at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Repeated measures ANOVA will be utilized for analysis. 

6.	Scores of response rate of progression free survival, QoL between participants will be compared: All scores of progression free survival and QoL scores between groups at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks will be analysed via ANCOVA and possible linear regression analysis if required. 

7.	Cost utility analysis: Health related QoL weights will be calculated. Extrapolated to QALY which will then be able to inputs from publically available health cost data. 

8.	Cost effectiveness analysis: Comparison between groups based on progression free survival rates will be used to determine incremental cost effectiveness ratios from publically available health cost data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of two strengths of oral medicinal cannabis oil in patients who have been diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with a recurrent brain malignancy (GBM): MRI revealing recurrent tumour growth. 

Study details
The patients will be given the choice to be in a control group or a medicinal cannabis intervention group. If they choose a medicinal cannabis group, they will be randomised to receive one of two different CBD:TCH strains for 12 weeks. Each participant including the control will have a MRI at baseline and at 12 weeks. Blood work will be conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Safety and toxicity will be monitored through the trial. 

How this study will contribute to research and/or Treatment
This research will assist medical doctors and patients understanding if medicinal cannabis can assist their treatment in slowing glioma tumour re-growth or growth and what dose to use. </summary>
