  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the potential of two dairy derived extracts to improve symptoms of the Metabolic Syndrome, including fatty liver, serum lipid and glucose profiles &amp; markers of inflammation, in individuals with the Metabolic Syndrome. The target population would be individuals identified as overweight with central adiposity, metabolic syndrome,  abnormal liver function and fatty liver as shown by an ultrasound scan.

Participants will be randomised to recieve one of the 2 dairy fractions or a control for a period of 3 weeks, followed by a minimum 3 weeks wash out period between active treatments or control. All participants will complete the three treatment arms. 

The dairy fractions differ from each other in that one is a high-carbohydrate fraction while the other is a high-lipid (fat) fraction. The dose of the carbohydrate fraction is 10g/day (138kJ) while the dose of the lipid fraction is 4g/day (138kJ). The doses were selected so as to match treatments for total energy (kJ). The dose of the control treatment is 6.5g/day (138kJ).

The administration vehicle for this study will be a chocolate dairy dessert. All treatments will be incorporated into 150g fresh dessert and consumed daily.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control in this study is commercial whole milk powder (WMP). The dose of the control treatment is 6.5g/day (138kJ).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Metabolic syndrome (Met Syn) is the combination of metabolic disorders that increase the risk of developing CVD and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The MetSyn cluster is characterized by central adiposity, adverse lipid and glucose profiles and hypertension (Alberti KG et al 2009). Other metabolic abnormalities that may be drivers of the events or develop in parallel include increases in pro-inflammatory profile, disordered blood clotting and lipid overspill from adipose into critical organs such as liver, heart and muscle. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are highly prevalent diseases that accompany obesity and the MetSyn (McKimmie RL et al 2008).
A  battery of in vitro investigations and preclinical rodent studies investigating the effect of bovine milk fractions on metabolic syndrome outcomes has led to the selection of 2 milk fractions to be taken forwards into clinical investigation for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic dysregulation. The in vitro and preclinical studies have been conducted by a collaborative group of researchers working within the LactoPharma NZ consortium, a joint venture between the NZ Foundation of Research Science &amp; Technology (FRST) and dairy company Fonterra Co-Operative Group.</summary>
