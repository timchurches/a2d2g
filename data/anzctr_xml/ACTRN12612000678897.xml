  <interventions>
    <interventions>Best practice respiratory care as well as standardised assessment for frailty. If found to be pre-frail or frail, refer for comprehensive geriatric assessment.

Best practice respiratory care at the study site involves 6 monthly one-on-one 30-minute consultations with a respiratory consultant. Over the study period, each participant will attend at least two consultations, (more if needed by participant). Spirometry and 6 min walk tests will be performed before each consultation to monitor respiratory function. Consultations will be tailored to the participant's needs and may include assessing new-onset symptoms, optimising medications for symptom management, referral to pulmonary rehabilitation programs or treatment of exacerbations.

Frailty assessment will be performed using two validated screening tools: the Clinical Frailty Scale (Rockwood, 2005) and the Study of Osteoporotic Frailty Scale (Ensrud, 2008). Comprehensive geriatric assessment will include multidimensional assessment of the patient's medical, psychological and social well-being, RUDAS dementia screen, and construction of a management plan.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Frailty is a condition in elderly people where there is increased vulnerability to acute illness and poor recovery. Elderly people with long-term respiratory diseases such as COPD or asthma are more likely to be frail or to become frail as compared to elderly people without respiratory disease. Frailty can be screened for, and with appropriate management, the progression of frailty may be prevented, slowed, or even reversed. This study aims to demonstrate that screening and managing frailty in elderly respiratory patients will improve their health outcomes over 12 months.</summary>
