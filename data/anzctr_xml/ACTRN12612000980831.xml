  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the active arm of each trial have been allocated to either Red Heart Pill Version 1c (40mg simvastatin, 75mg aspirin, 10mg lisinopril, 50mg atenolol) once daily for duration of trial or 
Red Heart Pill Version 2c (40mg simvastatin, 75mg aspirin, 10mg lisinopril, 12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide) once daily for duration of trial. The version prescribed is according to the physician's discretion. Each trial has an average of between 12 and 18 months follow-up. The main objective is to determine if combining 4 medications into one pill improves adherence to these medications.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An international collaboration of investigators has been established with the aim of assessing the benefits and risks of polypill-based care compared with usual care in populations at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several trials are planned, as the effectiveness and economic impact of a polypill-based strategy may vary substantially between countries, given the varying influence of the health-care system within which the intervention is delivered.  
Primary outcomes for the individual patient data meta-analysis will include self-reported current use of antiplatelet, statin, and combination (&gt;= 2) blood pressure lowering therapy at 12 months, and change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and total cholesterol from baseline to 12 months. Non-inferiority margins of 3mmHg for SBP and 0.3 mmol/L for total cholesterol have been pre-specified.
Secondary outcomes will include change in cholesterol fractions, diastolic blood pressure and creatinine from baseline to 12 months, quality of Life, new onset diabetes mellitus, mortality (cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular and all cause)  and a composite outcome of cardiovascular events (including all coronary heart disease events, heart failure events leading to death or requiring hospital admission, cerebrovascular events and peripheral arterial events).</summary>
