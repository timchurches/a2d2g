  <interventions>
    <interventions>The syringes have no identifying markers indicating group allocation. The nurse injects the contents of the 10 mL syringe intravenously over 60 s and starts the 50 mL syringe IV continuous infusion at 15 mL/h five minutes before the lumbar puncture is performed. The anaesthetist caring for the woman is blinded to group allocation.
Arm 1: ondansetron 8 mg with 0.9% saline solution (total volume 10 mL) intravenously over 60 s AND phenylephrine 10 mg with 0.9% saline solution to a total volume of 49 mL (50 mcg/min continuous infusion) at 15 mL/h, both administered 5 min prior to spinal anesthesia
Arm 2: placebo of 0.9% saline solution 10 mL (administered  intravenously over 60 s) AND phenylephrine 10 mg with 0.9% saline solution to a total volume of 49 mL (50 mcg/min continuous infusion) at 15 mL/h, both administered 5 min prior to spinal anesthesia.
Arm 3: ondansetron 8 mg with 0.9% saline solution (total volume 10 mL, administered  intravenously over 60 s), AND 0.9% saline solution 50 mL (continuous infusion) at 15 mL/h, both administered 5 min prior to spinal anesthesia.
Arm 4: placebo of 0.9% saline solution 10 mL (administered intravenously over 60 s) AND 0.9% saline solution 50 mL (continuous infusion) at 15 mL/h, both administered 5 min prior to spinal anesthesia.
The duration of the continuous infusion for all arms is until end of procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>It is very important to state that the control group (placebo) will receive all standardized cares internationally accepted for an elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. The other 3 groups, ondansetron, phenylephrine or ondansetron + phenylephrine are not an usual practice for all obstetric anesthesiologists, but the doses proposed in this study are accepted as the usual doses of these drugs for cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Our statistical Department has estimated the sample size of the study to guarantee with a significant level (alpha) of 0.05 in a two-sided test, a potency (1-beta) superior to 95% on detection of differences between means of at least 1 standardized clinical difference and has established a randomization protocol. Statistical method will study with I.B.M. SPSS software the normality of the quantitative parameters using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Comparison of means of independent samples will be performed using ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's test for post hoc testing, and repeated measures ANOVA will be used for paired data. Association between qualitative variables will be performed using the chi-square test with Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Trends will be studied with the chi-square for linear trend test. A P value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. Hemodynamic data (SBP, DBP, MAP, heart rate and oxygen saturation), will be re-plotted using a format where all values were expressed as the correspondent percentage related to the baseline value (considered as 100%) to reveal a more discrete pattern of change so that each patient served as her own control.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Spinal anesthesia for caesarean delivery is frequently associated with maternal hypotension. The sitting position for spinal anesthesia and prophylactic administrations of ondansetron or phenylephrine have been reported to provide a protective effect. We studied the effect of ondansetron or ondansetron + phenylephrine in obstetric patients. 
Methods: This prospective double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study includes healthy pregnant women scheduled for elective caesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia. Women will be randomly allocated into four groups to receive either placebo, ondansetron 8 mg intravenously before induction of spinal anesthesia, phenylephrine infusion (50 mcg/min) or ondansetron plus phenylephrine infusion (50 mcg/min). Demographic, obstetric, intraoperative timing and anaesthetic variables will be assessed at 16 time points. Anesthetic variables assessed will include blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, nausea, vomiting, electrocardiographic changes, skin flushing, discomfort or pruritus and vasopressor requirements. 
Study hypothesis: the combination of ondansetron plus phenylephrine infusion can help to reduce the incidence and severity of maternal hypotension compared with placebo, ondansetron or phenylephrine infusion.</summary>
