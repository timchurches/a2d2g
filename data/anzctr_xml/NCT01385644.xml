MSC will be derived from mothers donating their term placenta for clinical trial research purposes at Mater Mothers Hospital, Brisbane. The donation, isolation and expansion of placental-derived MSC for research purposes has been approved by the Mater Health Services (MHS) Human Research Ethics Committee (Reference No. 1292A). These volunteer donor mothers are unrelated to and will be HLA-unmatched with the IPF recipients.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to establish the feasibility and safety of infusions
      of placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) from related or unrelated HLA identical or HLA
      mismatched donors in the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

      The secondary objectives are to document changes in lung function, 6 minute walk distance
      (6MWD), gas exchange and radiological appearance following infusion of MSC over a six month
      evaluation period.</summary>
