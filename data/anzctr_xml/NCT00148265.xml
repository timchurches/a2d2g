Treatment: drugs: Triamcinolone acetate
Eyes assigned to IVTA received an intravitreal injection of 0.1 ml of Kenacort 40© [40mg/ml triamcinolone acetonide, Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals, Australia] on the day of the baseline visual acuity measurement under sterile conditions in a minor procedures area as an outpatient procedure. Eyes assigned to placebo were prepared in the same way but had the barrel of the syringe without a needle pushed firmly against the eye to simulate an injection.

      <outcome>The proportion of eyes showing an improvement of visual acuity by 10 letters on a LogMAR chart compared with the pre-injection level 24 months after treatment - At 24 months, improvement of =10 LogMAR letters was seen in 15/42 (36%) eyes treated with IVTA plus laser compared with 7/42 (17%) eyes treated with laser only (p=0.047, odds ratio 2.79, 95% CI, 1.01, 7.67).</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of laser treatments required for the treatment of macular oedema during the course of the study. - At least 1 retreatment was required in the second year of the study in 29/42 (69%) of IVTA plus laser treated eyes compared with 19/42 (45%) laser only eyes (p=0.187).</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in retinal thickness demonstrated on optical coherence tomography (OCT) - There was no difference in the mean CMT (346.8µm ± 114.9SD vs 372.6µm ± 154.2SD, comparing IVTA plus laser vs laser only, p=0.349) or mean logMAR visual acuity (56.1 ± 15.7SD vs 54.5 ± 16.1SD letters, p=0.439).</outcome>

      <outcome>The incidence of moderate or severe side effects related to the procedure of intravitreal injection or related to the drug - Cataracts were removed from 17/28 (61%) of phakic IVTA plus laser-treated eyes vs. 0/27 (0%) laser only eyes (p&lt;0.001). Treatment for elevated intraocular pressure was required in 27/42 (64%) of the IVTA plus laser eyes compared with 10/42 (24%) laser only eyes (p&lt;0.001)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is likely to identify an improved and economical treatment for diabetic macular
      oedema, one of the commonest causes of blindness both in Australia and the rest of the
      world.The specific aims of the study are to test the following hypotheses:

        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed by laser treatment results in a greater
           improvement in visual acuity than placebo followed by laser treatment of eyes with
           macular oedema secondary to diabetes;

        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed by laser treatment results in greater degree of
           resolution of macular oedema than placebo followed by laser treatment of eyes with
           macular oedema secondary to diabetes;

        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed by laser treatment results in a reduced
           requirement for further laser treatment to control diabetic macular oedema than placebo
           followed by laser treatment;

        -  That intravitreal triamcinolone followed laser has a manageable and acceptable safety
           profile in eyes with diabetic macular edema.</summary>
