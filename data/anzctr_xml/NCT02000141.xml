  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recurrence - Follow up colonoscopies as per standard of care for 6 - 60 months noting and treating any recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6-60 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cancer prediction - By properly assessing the lesion it is hoped that we will be able to provide the greater Gastroenterology community with a tool which can be used to properly identify benign and cancerous lesions to decrease the number of benign lesions being referred to surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Initial procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved Endoscopic Resection - By assessing the lesion at resection and following up with standard of care colonoscopies it is anticipated that there will be an improved endoscopic resection efficacy therefore reducing the risk of recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-60 months</timepoint>

    <summary>To enhance understanding of the risk factors for AMN, improve lesion assessment and
      prediction of submucosal invasive cancer, improve endoscopic resection efficacy, reduce
      complications of WF-EMR and improve the understanding of the progression of large lesions to
      cancer</summary>
