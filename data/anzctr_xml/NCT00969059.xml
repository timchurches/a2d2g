  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in average daily pain score from baseline to Week 4 of treatment based on the 11 point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) - The PI-NRS is an eleven point scale with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable. Participants rated the pain intensity for the neuropathic pain associated with the nerve injury and not pain from other concomitant causes. Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in average daily pain score from baseline to Weeks 1, 2 and 3 of treatment and the week before the follow-up visit - The PI-NRS is an eleven point scale with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable.

    <summary>This study will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. After enrolment
      and initial assessments, subjects will receive oral GW856553 7.5 milligram (mg) twice daily
      (BID) or matching placebo for 28 days in a 1:1 ratio. Sufficient numbers of subjects will be
      recruited to obtain 142 evaluable subjects. This is a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Subjects will undertake a screening period which
      may last up to approximately 3 weeks, followed by a baseline period of 1 week, a randomized
      treatment period of 4 weeks and a follow-up period of approximately 2 weeks. This is a
      multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in subjects who have at
      least moderate intensity of neuropathic pain resulting from peripheral nerve injury due to
      trauma or surgery. It will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of GW856553 over
      28 days of treatment. Approximately 158 subjects will be randomized to ensure 142 evaluable
      subjects. Randomization ratio will be 1:1 for placebo or GW856553 respectively. The dose of
      GW856553 will be 7.5 mg BID.</summary>
