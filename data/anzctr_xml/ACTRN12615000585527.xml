  <interventions>
    <interventions>Residents aged 60+ years from lifestyle aged care facilities will receive a dietary pork intervention for 12 weeks. Facilities rather than individuals are randomised (quasi-experimental design). Meals are prepared by a commercial kitchen that supplies the aged care facilities, before being frozen and delivered to participants at their homes once a week.  Participants are instructed to continue with their usual diets but to substitute four meals per week with the provided meals. The four meals can be consumed at any meal time on any four days within a week. 

Recipes for all provided meals were collected from the commercial caterer (Flagstaff Fine Foods). All recipes were analysed using FoodWorks dietary analysis software (Xyris Software 2009). Average nutritional content of meals provided was compared between pork and chicken groups.

Nutritional content of provided meals (mean (SD)), by diet group is as follows: 
 
Pork meals:      	               
Energy 1528 (530) kJ; Protein 28.1 (6.3)g; Fat 8.8 (6.1)g; 
Saturated fat 3.6 (3.3)g; Carbohydrate 40.3 (19.4)g; Sugars 8.5 (2.9)g; Sodium 739 (393)mg.

Chicken meals:
Energy 1661 (346) kJ; Protein 25.2 (6.2) g; Fat 14.3 (2.9)g;  Saturated fat 4.6 (1.8)g;  Carbohydrate 38.2 (17.5)g; Sugars  8.2 (5.9)g; Sodium 752 (318)mg.

Actual meal choices that were provided are shown below:
Pork meals:				
Pork in BBQ sauce
Roast pork &amp; gravy	
Ham &amp; cheese omelette
Pork and apple cranberry
Ham steak with pineapple glaze					
Chicken meals:				
Honey soy chicken
Roast chicken &amp; gravy
Chicken Schnitzel
Curry chicken	
Chicken &amp; asparagus mornay

Adherence with the intervention was assessed using a self-completed food diary for 3 consecutive days (one weekend, 2 weekdays) at baseline, week 6 and week 12. Food intake data was analysed using FoodWorks using the NUTTAB 2010, Ausfoods 2012 and Ausbrands 2012 database (Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, GLD, Australia, Version 6, 2009). Participants also completed a weekly checklist of number of provided meals that were consumed. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognition: A battery of cognitive tasks will be used to assess specific domains of mental functioning. 
a. The Geriatric Depression scale, a 15-item questionnaire, will assess changes in mood. 
b.  The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test (RAVLT) measured verbal learning and memory. It requires the participant to learn a list of words over 5 presentation-test trial sequences. 
c. The Serial ordered pointing task is a test of working memory that requires the participant to point to a picture or pattern on each page of a booklet that contains the same pictures in different arrangements. 
d. The Boston naming task assesses word-retrieval difficulty in the participants, which is related to semantic memory. The participant is asked to name a series of objects. 
e. The verbal fluency task is a sensitive measure of executive dysfunction and control processes. The task requires the participant to produce as many words starting with a particular letter as possible in one minute. 
f. Trail-making task (TMT) requires the participant to join a series of dots labelled with consecutive numbers or with alternating letters and numbers. It is a measure of executive function. 
g. Digit-span backwards task requires the participant to recall a small set of digits in reverse order and assesses short-term memory storage and executive control processes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks and 12 weeks </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Strength: 
a. Maximal upper body strength (kg) measured using a hand dynamometer (Model Jamar Plus, Sammsons Preston Rolyan, Bolingbrook, IL, USA) while the subject is seated, arm adducted and elbow at a 90 degree angle. Participants exert maximal force once using each hand. 
b. The 30-second sit-to-stand test to measure lower body strength. Participants perform as many full chair stands in a 30-second period as they are able to, with folded arms across their chest. 
c. A timed get up and go task to measure dynamic balance performing three common functional activities such as standing up from a chair and walking and turning through the evaluation of mobility. Participants are required to stand up from the chair, walk 3m at a comfortable speed, turn around and walk back to the chair and sit down. The time taken to complete this task is recorded.
d. The Six Minute Walk Test as a measure of functional exercise performance. This test required the participants to walk a 10m course at a comfortable speed for 6 minutes using walking frames or aids normally used for daily life if required. The numbers of laps completed during the 6 minutes is tallied to calculate the total distance in meters walked.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary intake, measured by asking participants to keep a food diary for 3 consecutive days (one weekend, 2 weekdays) at baseline, week 6 and week 12 of the intervention. Food intake data will be analysed with the FoodWorks programme, using the NUTTAB 2010, Ausfoods 2012 and Ausbrands 2012 database (Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, GLD, Australia, Version 6, 2009). </outcome>

      <outcome> Nutritional status: Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) is a validated 18-item questionnaire designed for use in persons aged 65y+that includes four domains, including anthropometric status, dietary patterns, mobility, living conditions and global self-view of health. A score &gt;23.5 of a possible 30 indicates that the individual has no risk of malnutrition; a score between 17- 23.5 indicates that the individual is at risk of malnutrition, and &lt; 17 indicates overt malnutrition.</outcome>
