  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently there is no proven effective medication to combat fatty liver disease. The aim of this study is to determine whether sympathetic nervous system (SNS) function is linked to liver disease. The study will help to investigate how overly-active your SNS in the presence of liver disease and whether there is an association between liver fat quantity and the SNSs degree of overactivity. Finally, we would like to see if an SNS-blocking agent which could reduce your SNS activity could have a favourable impact on your liver and general metabolism. The SNS-blocking agent that we will use in this research project is called moxonidine .</summary>
