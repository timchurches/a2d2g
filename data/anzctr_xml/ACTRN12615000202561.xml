  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients presenting to the NIIM clinic with Lyme-like symptoms, including those with joint pain, chronic fatigue, and neurological conditions will be invited to undertake the Pathogen Blood test. The first part of the test involves a Pathogen screen by filtration of 10 ml of blood and microscopy.The second part of the test involves DNA extraction out of whole blood and PCR-DNA analysis of infectious agents, specifically Borrelia bacteria, Rickettsia, Babesia and fungal pathogens. To further identify the nature of the fungal infection, the PCR products are sequenced.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard diagnostic test for Borrelia, including culturing of blood of the same patient and subsequent PCR analysis, using standardised methods by a pathology service.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lyme Borreliosis or Lyme disease, caused by the tick-borne bacteria pathogen (Borrelia species), is a serious and often chronic condition causing pain, fatigue and loss of quality of life. Diagnosis of Lyme disease is often complicated by the fact that Borrelia bacteria develop into different forms, including cysts and spores, which become more difficult to identify with time. Current diagnosis is undertaken by PCR-DNA analysis and serology, however, the more chronic the condition usually the more difficult to diagnose. At NIIM we have been able to isolate and identify Borrelia bacteria in a patient with chronic Lyme Disease using the ISET-filtration technology (Rarecells, France, www.rarecells.com) combined with subsequent PCR-DNA analysis.

Prior filtration and enrichment of bacteria on the ISET filters circumvents laborious culturing of Borrelia bacteria, which usually takes 3-6 weeks requiring a specific broth, available only in specialised laboratories. In addition, the ISET buffer lyses the red blood cells and therefore releases Borrelia bacteria, further facilitating identification by PCR-DNA analysis.  

This project seeks to establish whether the combined isolation &amp; identification method may help improve diagnosis in patients presenting with chronic symptoms, thought to be caused by Borrelia infection. Better diagnosis of underlying causes would improve patient treatment and recovery. </summary>
