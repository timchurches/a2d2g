  <interventions>
    <interventions>Despite early detection of congenital Unilateral Hearing Loss (UHL) via universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS), there is a lack of evidence on the efficacy of early intervention (in the form of device fitting) for improving outcomes, and the benefit vs harms of early detection and treatment is uncertain. This study will follow children from diagnosis to 3 years of age to investigate the impact of UHL, and examine the benefit (if any) of device fitting.

By agreeing to participate, a child with a unilateral hearing impairment would be allocated to one of two groups, 1) a device fitting group , or 2) a no fitting group. By participating in the study, all families and their children will be offered a study-specific program of support commensurate with best practice. Parents will be asked to complete a consent form before being informed as to which group their child has been allocated. 

For children assigned to the fitting group, each childs Australian Hearing (AH) clinician will choose a device in consultation with the childs parents, and fit the device in accordance with standard procedures.

All families in both groups will be offered a support program that involves intensive monitoring through tympanometry every 3 months.  If a child consistently exhibits middle ear disorders in the good ear for longer than 6 months, the child will be referred to AH for review (and potential fitting), irrespective of experimental assignment. Standard audiometry will be offered annually, around the time of outcomes assessments.  Significant changes in hearing thresholds will be referred to AH audiologists.

In addition, all parents will be provided with a starter kit that contains information on childhood unilateral hearing loss, child development, communication strategies and activities on how to help the child, and where to get further support if needed.  All families will also be offered access to information sessions to be organised by parent-support groups throughout the duration of the study.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Once consent is provided from the child's parent/guardian, he/she will be assigned by the researchers to one of two rehabilitation groups: 

Group 1. An AH audiologist will work with the family to select the most appropriate hearing device for the child. 

Group 2. Children in this group will NOT be fitted with a hearing device at the commencement of the project.  However, if audiological changes are noted (as part of the studyâ€™s monitoring program), the research team will work with AH to ensure the parent/guardian and child receive the necessary assistance. This may include fitting a device if required.

    <designfeatures>A variation to the research protocol of group assignment will be needed if a statistically and clinically significant group difference is found in the measures of early language outcomes. If this occurs, we will terminate the experimental allocation and ensure that all children in the study receive the intervention that is linked to better outcomes. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>According to the Queensland Government 2012-2013 Healthy Hearing Data Report, approximately 0.6 per thousand infants who undergo UNHS are diagnosed with UHL per year. Therefore across 3 states of NSW, QLD and VIC it is estimated there will be approximately 150 children diagnosed with UHL per year. If we assume approximately 60% of UHL infants will be recruited into the study over 2 years, this would be a total of 180 participants. The use of multiple linear regressions with 10 predictor variables with a power of 0.8 and type 1 error of .05 suggests a minimum of 118 participants be used to detect a medium effect size. Allowing for the clinical and statistical assumptions, a 10-15% attrition rate, and considerations of feasibility, we adopted a target of 200 participants for this study.

Standard multiple linear regression analysis will be used to examine the relationship between language outcome scores and potential predictor variables (including device fitting, degree of hearing loss, age of fitting, communication mode, maternal speech input (words and conversational turns), maternal education, socio-economic advantage, gender, and other disabilities). Their relation to each other will be assessed with correlation analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite early detection of congenital unilateral hearing loss (UHL) via universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS), there is a lack of evidence on the efficacy of early intervention (in the form of device fitting) for improving outcomes, and the benefit vs harms of early detection and treatment is uncertain.  Consequently, there is clinical equipoise concerning whether children should receive amplification (as well as surveillance).  

The overall goal of this project is to determine the efficacy of device intervention for improving outcomes of children diagnosed with permanent unilateral hearing loss at or shortly after birth. The aims are to: 1) investigate the impact of early detection and treatment of UHL on the child and family; 2) determine factors affecting outcomes at 3 years of age for children with congenital UHL; and 3) assess the efficacy of device fitting on improving outcomes. The results of this research will provide the much-needed evidence-based guidance for clinical practice.  </summary>
