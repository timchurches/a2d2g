             diagnosis is confirmed by a photodermatologist or photobiologist.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether the afamelanotide (CUV1647) formulation is
      effective in preventing PLE episodes or reducing the severity of PLE symptoms in patients
      with a well documented history of the disease. The study also aims to determine whether
      treatment with afamelanotide (CUV1647) can reduce the use of rescue medication in this group.</summary>
