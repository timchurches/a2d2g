  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>This is a trial investigating a methodogical issue of measuring health-related quality of life.  It will be conducted amongst subacute elderly hospital patients in the rehabilitation unit of a tertiary hosiptal.</healthcondition>
    <conditioncode>
      <conditioncode1>Public Health</conditioncode1>
      <conditioncode2>Other public health</conditioncode2>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves two interventions: 
Intervention A - providing detailed descriptors for the upper anchor point on a visual analogue scale of health-related quality of life (part of EQ-5D instrument). The duration of intervention A was the time taken to read the descriptors (less than 5 minutes).
Intervention B - providing detailed descriptors for the lower anchor point on a visual analogue scale of health-related quality of life (part of EQ-5D instrument). The duration of intervention B was the time taken to read the descriptors (less than 5 minutes).

The descriptors to be used in each intervention will be those descriptors used in another validated health-related quality of life measurement instrument, the AQoL (Assessment of Quality of Life).</interventions>
    <comparator>A crossover design will compare the effect of giving the upper anchor point descriptor (intervention A) to the lower anchor point descriptor (intervention B). Comparisons will also be made to when no anchor points descriptors were given. There will essentially be no washout period between interventions (&lt;5mins).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient self report of health-related quality of life using the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D health-related quality of life instrument.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) of health state will be taken at three timepoints. After consent (1), immediately after the first intervention (2), then immediately after the second intervention (3). These will all be conducted within a 30 minute period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients are asked whether the anchor desriptors, read to the patient as part of the intervention, described a more extreme health state than the anchor they had originally considerered (for the end of the visual analogue scale relating to the respective intervention) when completing the visual analogue scale at baseline, e.g. after Intervention A is given the participant is asked whether that description of best imaginable health was even better than they had considered to be the best imaginable health state at the top of the scale when they first rated their health on the VAS (at baseline). The patients response is recorded as binary data (y/n).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after each intervention.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The allocation sequence was generated by a blinded member of the research team and stored in a locked filing cabinet. Patients are approached by a research assistant who does not know the allocation sequence (or have access to the filing cabinet) who seeks informed consent. Consenting patients are assigned a participant number in order of recruitment. Consenting participants are then allocated to group (one or two) in order of their participant number to the next group in the random sequence by a separate research assistant who provides the intervention.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a trial investigating how providing detailed desciptors of a very good, and very bad health state affect the way people rate their own health-related quality of life. Health-related quality of life can be difficult to measure. Giving detailed description of extreme health states may help participants to "put into perspective" their current health states. This may result in reporting a different level of health than they would report if no detailed descriptors were given.</summary>
