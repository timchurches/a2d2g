  <interventions>
    <interventions>Total Hip Arthroplasty - The "Short Mini Stem" is a total hip replacement system consisting of lightweight titanium alloy inserted using a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) approach. The "Short Mini Stem" is shorter than conventional hip stems, which allows the stem to conserve more of the patient's thigh bone (femur) than other prostheses and requires a smaller skin incision. The approximate duration of the hip arthroplasty procedure is one hour.</interventions>

    <concealment>This is a prospective, consecutive series, single center clinical study of clinical outcomes following total hip arthroplasty. Patients meeting the entrance criteria specified in this protocol will be enrolled sequentially as they become available.

Process:
All patients requiring a Total Hip replacement were approached to participate in the MIS DEXA study during their pre-operative consultation. The PI discussed the clinical study and provided them with a copy of the HREC approved information sheet and consent. All patients were given the opportunity to ask questions during this discussion and in a further discussion with the study coordinator.

Patients that were interested in participating in the study, but did not want to sign the consent form on the same day, took the information sheets and consent forms home to review and were told to ring the study coordinator if they had any further questions.

Patients and their witness signed and dated the form and then posted the original consent form back to the study coordinator at the site. Patients kept the information sheet for reference.

On delivery to the site the forms were filed in the patient study file.
