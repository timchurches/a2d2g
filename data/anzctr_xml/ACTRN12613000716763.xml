  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. A transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy is a procedure that takes small samples of tissue from prostate gland with the aid of transrectal ultrasound probe. The procedure usually takes 10 to 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the PSA change ratio before and after prostate biopsy between two groups of patients. Based on the result of biopsy group A is comprised of patients with benign prostate hyperplasia while group B is comprised of patients with prostate cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>PSA is going to be measured one day before prostate biopsy and one hour after the last biopsy core. The PSA change ratio is defined as the ratio of post-biopsy total serum PSA to pre-biopsy serum PSA. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate if this change ratio could be a predictive factor of prostate cancer diagnosed in a repeat biopsy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is going to be assessed in the follow-up of patients. Due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (Positive DRE, PSA, PSA velocity and PSA doubling-time) some patients (group A) are going to undergo a repeat biopsy. The result of the repeat biopsy (if and when will be done) is going to be associated with the previous biopsy PSA change ratio.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the ratio of urethral position among 9 different positions in the transverse section of prostate during TRUS (middle center / middle up / middle down / right up / right center / right down / left up / left center / left down).  To achieve better visualization of urethral position in this section, a foley catheter is going to be used in all patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is going to be assessed during the TRUS guided prostate biopsy. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate the complications after prostate biopsy using the modified Clavien  Dindo system.</outcome>
      <timepoint> The timepoints of evaluation is during the period of one month following prostate biopsy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate LUTS (Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms) before and after prostate biopsy using IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) questionnaire and Qmax from Uroflow.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One hour before prostate biopsy and one month later</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prostate biopsy is the most useful diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer. We are going to estimate the PSA change ratio before and after prostate biopsy between two groups of patients. Based on the result of biopsy group A is comprised of patients with benign prostate hyperplasia while group B is comprised of patients with prostate cancer. According to the results we will try to find out new prognostic markers in order to predict which of our patients with negative cancer results in the biopsy are the best candidates for a repeat biopsy.</summary>
