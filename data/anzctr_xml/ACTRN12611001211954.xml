  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the conventional protocol, the residual material after foreign body is taken off and rusty ring are digged out by using a 30G injection syringe needle. 
In the new protocol, the rusty ring is removed mainly by using a micro-knot forceps which is usually used in the anterior eye segment surgery. The rim of the ringelevated slightly by the needle tip so that it could be grasped easily with the forceps. Then, the entire ring was pulled gently using the forceps. The average surgery time under the new protocol was 3.2 min.</interventions>
    <comparator>The residual material and rusty ring were removed using the needle alone. Several trials of digging were usually required to remove pieces of the ring one after another until the entire ring was removed. The average surgery timeunder conventional protocol was 5.1 min.</comparator>

      <outcome>Quicker corneal wound healing, which is indicated if  fluorescent staining against damaged corneal epithelium is negative. The staining is examined with a micro-slit lamp (Haag-Streit 900, Gartenstadtstrasse, Switzerland) 24, 48, and 72 h after the surgery, with a blue light illumination.
A larger number of subjects with healed corneal is seen in the first and second days after the surgery in subjects receiving the new surgery.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Totally 40 cornea metal foreign body injury cases were engaged to have the foreign body removal surgery. The new surgery protocol is characterized as a levering action was used to remove the foreign body from the cornea. If removal was incomplete due to the remaining of a rusty ring, removing the rim of the ring was elevated slightly by the needle tip so that it could be grasped easily with the forceps. Then, the entire ring was pulled gently using the forceps. The advantages of the new surgery include shortened surgery time, reduced pain score, and shortened corneal wound healing.</summary>
