  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised into one of three groups.
 Group 1.	Self administered intranasal fentanyl, under supervision of a midwife.

Group 2.	Fentanyl administered subcutaneously

Group 3.	Pethidine administered intramuscularly</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group will be administered intramuscular (IM) pethidine. Observations will be undertaken as for groups one and two. Results will then be compared to review efficacy and safety.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether fentanyl administered subcutaneously (s.c) or  intranasal (I/N) during childbirth will be at least as efficacious as the current practice of administering IM pethidine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Pain scores will be taken once the woman requests a narcotic. This will be undertaken utilising the Visual analogue Scale (VAS) tool. Scores will be collected immediately before injection or inhalation and 30 minutes post administration between contractions. I</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. To determine whether fentanyl administered s.c or I/N during childbirth will provide fewer adverse effects than that of IM administered pethidine for mother and neonate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maternal blood pressure, nausea and sedation levels, will be monitored both before and 30 minutes after drug administration. In addition, neonatal effects including Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, whether narcan has been administered to reverse the effect of the narcotic and the time taken for the baby to establish breathing will be examined.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. A questionaire will be utilised to explore whether any of the three treatments have an effect on  breastfeeding for women who chose to feed their babies in this manner.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Breastfeeding outcomes will be reviewed at discharge from hospital and 6 weeks postpartum.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Women will be recruited through the antenatal clinics so that consent can be obtained prior to the commencement of labour.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pethidine is currently the most widely used narcotic administered systemically for the relief of labour pain, but has been shown to have numerous side effects on both mother and neonate. An alternative narcotic, fentanyl when administered intravenously (IV) has been shown to have fewer side effects and a shorter duration of action than does pethidine. 

There is a lack of research relating to the use of fentanyl administered during labour via alternative routes.  Alternative routes have the benefit of being less invasive, requires fewer resources and provides more autonomy to the midwife providing care. This has particular benefits for rural and remote birthing communities. 

This study will examine the safety and efficacy of fentanyl administered by intranasal (IN) or subcutaneous (s.c) routes for pain relief during childbirth for both mother and neonate. It also will investigate possible maternal and neonatal side effects. Outcomes will be compared with intramuscular (IM) pethidine.</summary>
