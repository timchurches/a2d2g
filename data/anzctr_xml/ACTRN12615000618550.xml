    <interventions>Arm 1: Constraint Induced Aphasia Therapy (CIAT): 
CIAT involves participants producing nouns, verbs, and functional phrases that they have not been able to produce prior to treatment, in response to pictured object and action cards, in a small social group setting. Physical visual barriers between participants discourage the use of gesture, drawing or writing as alternative means of communication when speech fails. Communication activities include requesting picture cards from group members (e.g., Do you have 'coffee'?), responding to requests from others (e.g., Yes I have 'coffee'), and rehearsal of functional communication routines (e.g., role playing being in a shop asking for coffee). Clinicians explicitly cue and shape the verbal responses such that, as performance improves, participant responses are shaped from simple, single word requests (e.g., Coffee?) through to more elaborate sentences (e.g., John, I want a large, black coffee?). CIAT Plus developed by CI Meinzer and colleagues also includes daily home practice (monitored via written log/carer report), which we will utilize in this study. There will be 30 hrs of treatment (3hrs/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks), in a small group setting (2-3 participants per group) with one qualified speech pathologist.

Arm 2: Multi-Modality Aphasia Therapy (M-MAT): 
M-MAT involves the same communication activities in the same setting as CIAT (socially inspired card based requesting and responding), but there are no visual barriers between participants. Clinicians explicitly cue and shape the verbal responses from participants with a series of structured multi-modal prompts that participants copy: associated gesture, written word, simple drawing, and verbal repetition. Daily home practice tasks are set and monitored via written log/carer report. There will be 30hrs of treatment (3hrs/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks), in a small group setting (3 participants per group) with one qualified speech pathologist.

Optional Sub-Study for ARM 3 Usual Care
For ethical reasons, at the end of the 12 week follow up assessments participants randomised to ARM 3 Usual Care will be offered M-MAT or CIAT treatment equal in overall dose to that of the intervention participants. These participants will be re-randomised to either non-intense M-MAT or non-intense CIAT. Non-intense M-MAT and CIAT are equivalent in every respect to intense M-MAT and CIAT except that the treatment schedule is 2 hours per day, 3 days per week for 5 weeks duration (instead of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 2 weeks duration) in a small group setting (2-3 participants per group) with one qualified speech pathologist. This treatment data will be collected but not used in the primary or secondary statistical analysis of this trial. This data will be used in tertiary analyses to provide pre vs post views of treatment gains, where each participant is their own control, as well as a preliminary comparison of overall effect sizes from intense versus non-intense CIAT and M-MAT.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3: Usual Care control: 
A usual care control group will undergo aphasia therapy at the type and frequency that is available to them at the time of their recruitment and randomization. For some participants this may comprise no direct intervention, while for others it may take the form of non-intense, individual, computerised or social/support group sessions (1 to 2 hours per week). All aphasia treatment related activity will be documented by the usual care therapists, and participants (or family members) will keep a diary of therapy activity for data triangulation. The UC group is assessed at the same 3 time points as the intervention groups.

2.	Arm 2 – M-MAT
3.	Arm 3 – Usual Care Control 

 Upon completion of all screening assessments and suitability checks, a participant eligibility checklist will be completed by the Blinded Assessor. This checklist will be sent to the Trial Manager who will initiate the randomisation process. The participant and the intervention therapist will be notified of the treatment assignment. This will not be disclosed to the Blinded Assessors.

Participants in the UC group will be re-randomised following the 12 week follow up visit to either CIAT or M-MAT and will participate in the option sub-study. The randomisation procedure will be the same as for the main-study.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly assigned, stratified by WAB-AQ severity level (mild 93.7-66; moderate: 65-33; severe: 32-0) to treatment via a central allocation system. In this procedure, participants are randomly allocated, via computer-generated algorithm, to one of 3 conditions (CIAT, M-MAT, UC) and one of 3 severity levels (mild, moderate, severe).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Cohorts:
All patients who are randomised will be included in the analysis. All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Since this study is conducted on a medically stable population in a non-acute setting, loss to follow-up due to death and drop-out are expected to be minimal. However, if the loss to follow-up is found to exceed 10% at therapy completion and an additional 10% at the 12-week follow-up, the missing data will be handled through multiple imputation. In this case, a sensitivity analysis will be performed to assess differences in the estimated improvements with and without imputation.
Baseline Characteristics: 
Baseline patient characteristics will be described using means and standard deviations. One-way ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square tests will be used to examine baseline data for differences in characteristics between groups. 
Primary Outcome Analysis:
A generalised estimating equations (GEE) model will be developed to analyse between-group (CIAT vs UC and M-MAT vs UC) differences in improvement on the WAB-AQ, immediately post treatment   [HI]. Baseline aphasia severity will be controlled for, by including it as a covariate in the model.
Secondary Endpoints:
The GEE model developed to assess the primary end-point will be extended to analyse between-group differences in improvement on WAB-AQ at the 12-week follow up [H2].
Between-group differences (CIAT vs UC and M-MAT vs UC) in improvements in accuracy and efficacy of connected speech [H3] will be analysed through (separate) GEE models for the number of correct information units (CIUs) and the rate at which correct information units are produced (CIUs/minute) respectively. Baseline aphasia severity will be controlled for in both models, by including it as a covariate. In addition, the model for the number of CIUs will include time as an offset variable. 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be developed to analyse between-group differences in quality of life outcomes, as measured by the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life (SAQoL-39g) scale [H4]. 
GEE models will be developed to analyse between group differences (M-MAT vs UC and CIAT vs UC) in multimodal communication [H5] and functional communication [H6] at the 12-week follow-up.
A GEE model will be used to analyse differences in efficacy of M-MAT and CIAT for patients with mild, medium and severe aphasia at baseline; efficacy will be determined by improvement on the WAB-AQ at 12-week follow-up (compared to baseline) [H7].
A two stage process will be used to inform the targeted delivery of aphasia treatment [H8]. First, a principal components analysis (PCA) will be used to extract the components that explain at least 80% of the variance in baseline scores on semantic processing (Pyramids and Palm Trees), phonological processing (Naming Battery Phonological errors), non-verbal reasoning (Ravens Matrices), cognitive flexibility (Test of Everyday Attention: Visual Elevator), auditory verbal visual memory (Picture Span Test), and attention (Test of Everyday Attention). Second, a linear mixed model will be developed to analyse the effects of the extracted principal components on the improvement in WAB-AQ at 12 weeks. Baseline WAB-AQ will be controlled for in the model. In addition, treatment site will be included as a random effect in the model.

Tertiary Endpoints:
A generalised estimating equations (GEE) model will be developed to assess improvement on the WAB-AQ, immediately post intervention [H10]. Baseline aphasia severity and will be controlled for, by including them as covariates in the model.
A GEE model will be used to analyse differences in efficacy of non-intense M-MAT and non-intense CIAT for patients with mild, medium and severe aphasia at baseline; efficacy will be determined by improvement on the WAB-AQ immediately post treatment (compared to baseline) [H11].
A GEE model will be used to estimate differences in improvement on WAB-AQ between intense CIAT and non-intense CIAT, and intense M-MAT and non-intense MMAT [H12]. The intense and non-intense therapies will be considered equivalent if the 95% confidence interval of the estimate indicates that the estimated difference is clearly less than 5.

A standard protocol ensuring uniform data collection will be used to estimate resource use among all participants. Data collected includes operationally defined items: out-patient service use, direct therapy costs (number of therapy sessions for the duration of the trial), travel associated with accessing services, and number of associated services required due to communicative impairment, (e.g., communication devices, respite, participant and carers loss of income). Cost description analysis of each comparator group using patient level clinical, resource use and cost data will be detailed using EXCEL or STATA software. Direct and indirect costs will include the lost wages for patients and caregivers, additional use of health services, social and family support (i.e., time costs), and transportation expenses. We will identify the marginal cost of care using market prices for consumables and replacement costs of services (e.g., hourly wage of cleaners). The cost-effectiveness of chronic aphasia therapy in reducing aphasia severity will be assessed [H9] by estimating the incremental cost per WAB-AQ improvement (e.g., net costs/5-point WAB-AQ gained). Cost-effectiveness will also be assessed using several other secondary measures of outcomes including improvements in functional communication, multi-modality communication and quality of life. Chronic aphasia therapy will be deemed cost-effective for an outcome if the incremental cost per improvement is &lt; $50,000, which is the usually accepted willingness-to-pay threshold. If the outcomes are similar between each comparator group, a cost-minimization analysis will be undertaken. Probabilistic multivariable analysis will be used to account for variability in point estimates and reported as medians (95% uncertainty intervals) using @RISK software (Palisade Corporation) for these sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.

Sample Size
Sample size was estimated using GPower 3.1, assuming a longitudinal design, to assess the main effects of time and treatment, and the interaction of time and treatment. The study is powered to detect an improvement of 5 points on the WAB-AQ. Based on the literature, this is the smallest clinically meaningful difference that can be reliably detected. A sample size of 198 patients (66 per arm) will provide 90% power to detect this difference at a (two-sided) significance level of a = 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will compare different treatments for people with aphasia. Participants will randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups CIAT, M-MAT or Usual Care. Participants will attend baseline assessments, a two week treatment period, assessment immediately after treatment and further follow up assessment 12 weeks after completing the treatment. 

Participants randomised to the Usual Care group will be offered additional treatment at the end of the 12 week follow up period as part of an optional sub-study. In this sub-study participants will be re-randomised to receive either CIAT or M-MAT. They will attend treatment visits over five weeks with follow up assessments immediately after the treatment period and again at 12 weeks after completing the treatment. 

Study Hypothesis: Compared to usual care, both the study treatments (CIAT and M-MAT) will result in reduced aphasia severity . </summary>
