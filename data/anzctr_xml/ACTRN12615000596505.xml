  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) The presence of a single dose of aspirin (600mg), vitamin C (500mg), lactulose (10g) mannitol (5g) , berry extract (high osmolality and diverse chemical composition) in a set ingested volume of drink (100 ml of water). Each subject will be randomized to receive each of the five treatments [including a negative control of water (100 ml) only]. The treatments will be delivered in randomized order and administered at 1 week intervals, intervals calculated from the day the SmartPill, Registered Trademark, is voided. 2) The consumption of the SmartPill (SmartPill Corporation, Buffalo, NY, USA). The use of this wireless motility capsule as a basis for deriving segmental transit times has recently been attested in a position statement of the American and European Neurogastorenterology and Motility Societies (Neurogastroenterol Motil (2011)23:8-23). This is a study to observe transit times in normal subjects and will be deduced from SmartPill data according to changes in pH and ambient intraluminal pressure. The SmartPill will enable us to assess these transit times in ambulant human subjects. The device is in the form of a pill 11.7mm x 26.8mm which is swallowed and continuously monitors and transmits lumen pH, pressure and temperature as it traverses the GI tract. The transmitted data is captured and stored on a data logger which is worn on a belt around the waist. Hence it is possible to determine gastric residence time (rise in pH and change in pressure wave form when the capsule enters the duodenum), the small intestinal residence time (fall in pH and change in motility pattern as capsule enters the colon) and the colonic residence time (fall in temperature as capsule exits the rectum) as well as determine the contractile work and pattern within each segment.The estimated transit time for the SmartPill is over a period of 24 - 120 hours. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess gastric, small intestinal and large intestinal transit time. This is a composite primary outcome.
This will be based on the pH and pressure recordings detremined by the wireless motility capsule, the SmartPill during its passage through the GI tract. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The recording for each participant, following the ingestion of each drink, will continue until they have voided the capsule. The sensor on the wireless motility capsule records pH every 5 seconds while the pressure is recorded every half second.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess cyclic variation in the gastric pressure recording extracted from the MotiliGI software (Given Imaging Corp). </outcome>
      <timepoint>The recording for each participant, following the ingestion of each drink, will continue until they have voided the capsule. The sensor on the wireless motility capsule records pressure every half second.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Healthy female volunteers of 165-170cm; 65-70kg between the age of 20 and 40 years will be screened by questionnaire for general medical health, gut health, ongoing consumption of medication, dietary supplements, dietary peculiarities and smoking. Inclusion criteria is as follows: (1) Participants will be non smokers with no history of gastrointestinal diseases including recent gut infection evidenced by a recent history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, passage of blood and mucus in stools. (2) Participants will be taking no ongoing prescription or OTC medication or multivitamins except for contraceptive pills. (3) Not taking any medications that affect gastrointestinal motility such as pro-kinetics, narcotic analgesics, antispasmodics, or pills to treat diarrhea and constipation. (4) The number of standard alcohol drinks consumed per week will be calculated from results of alcohol consumption in the questionnaire to ensure that participants do not exceed a moderate alcohol intake.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be screened by a Health Questionnaire to determine participation in the study. Volunteers who will be excluded are those that: (1) Are of small stature (no less than 165-170cm; apprx 65-70 kg), (2) Are smokers or tobacco chewers, (3) Exceed the intake of one standard alcohol drink per day, (4) Have a history of gastrointestinal diseases including recent gut infection evidenced by a recent history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, passage of blood and mucus in stools, (5) Suffer from any inter current gastrointestinal disorder (contraindicated dysphagia, gastric bezoars, strictures, fistulas, bowel obstructions, diverticulitis, previous gastrointestinal surgery) and are likely to retain the capsule in the stomach (as has rarely been reported), (6) Have implanted electromechanical medical devices and medications that influence gastrointestinal transit time, (7) Have an earlier diagnosis of diabetes, cancer, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel disease, (8) Have undergone abdominal surgery, (9) Have a BMI &lt; 18.5 or &gt; 30kg/m2, (10) Are pregnant or lactating, (11) Have irregular menstrual cycles, (12) Have a high dietary fibre intake or on a vegetarian diet, (13) Have food allergies, (14) Have a history of or current urinary tract infections, vaginal conditions that cause discharge, (15) Have aspirin sensitivity, (16) Take ongoing prescription medication, antibiotics, OTC medication or multivitamins, (17) Take prebiotic and probiotic and fibre supplements such as lactulose.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed.Ssubjects were screened using a health screening questionnaire to exclude those with a personal or strong family history of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders or recent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, passage of blood and mucus in stools. Similarly subjects with dysphagia, gastric bezoars, strictures, fistulas, bowel obstructions, diverticulitis, or previous GI surgery(29) were excluded. Subjects with an implanted electromechanical medical device, smokers, those with an intake of alcohol in excess of one standard drink per day, those with aspirin sensitivity and those taking regular prescription or over the counter medications (OTC) were also excluded. In particular those subjects who consumed drugs that were likely to influence GI transit time. Similarly, those consuming vitamins, prebiotics or probiotic supplements such as lactulose were also excluded. All participants were reviewed by a clinician to validate their medical history and responses to the questions before admission to the study. Each participant received each of the five  treatments in a randomized sequence at weekly intervals. The order of the treatments was randomized  based on a computer generated sequence and was blinded to the subjects.  </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study; there is no data available regarding variation of gastric motility and residence time utilizing the SmartPill with the above mentioned treatments. Hence data reporting variance between normal healthy subjects which could provide a meaningful test of statistical power are not currently available. 
However previous workers have utilised similar sample size and obtained statistically significant results (Dig Dis Sci (2009) 54:2167-2174; BJN (2010) 105:1337-1342). 
 
The effects of the various solutions on segmental transit times and on intra luminal pH will be compared by doubly repeat measure ANOVA. The dominant frequencies of cyclic variation in gastric pressure recordings will be determined by fast Fourier transforms.</statisticalmethods>
