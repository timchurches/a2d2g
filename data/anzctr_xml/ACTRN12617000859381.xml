  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective:To compare the therapeutic effects of ketamine plus midazolam or ketamine plus propofol on analgesia, sedation, recovery time, side effects in premedicated children with midazolam who are prepared circumcision operation.Methods: 80 American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status I---II children, aged between 5 and 12 years, undergoing circumcision operations under sedation were recruited according to a randomize and double-blind institutional review board-approved protocol. Patients were randomized into two groups via sealed envelope assignment. Both groups were administered of midazolam 0.04 mg/kg intravenously in the presence of parents in the pre-operative holding area. Patients were induced with midazolam-ketamine in Group I or ketamine-propofol in Group II. Results: In the between-group comparisons, age, weight, no difference was observed (p &gt; 0.05). Recovery was faster in ketamine-midazolam group (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: midazolam-ketamine provided faster recovery than ketamine-propofol in pediatric circumcision operations. We did not observe significant complications during sedation in these two groups. Therefore, ketomine-midazolam appears to provide a faster recovery for circumcision operation.</summary>
