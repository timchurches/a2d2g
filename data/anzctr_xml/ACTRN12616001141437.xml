  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve general education about pain during exercise followed by explicit education about pain relieving effects of exercise. The education will be delivered face to face by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist on an individual basis but will not be personalised for each participant. The intervention education component of the experiment will last approximately 15 minutes and the entire experimental session will last approximately 60 - 90 minutes with the rest of the experimental session to consist of participants completing questionnaires relating to their health and level of physical activity (30 min), a bout of aerobic exercise (20 min), and assessments of pressure pain threshold before and after exercise (10 min). All testing will be performed at Neuroscience Research Australia. For participants in the chronic pain group, abstinence from analgesic medication(s) must begin 23 hours prior to the start of their experimental session.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment will involve the same general pain education that is delivered to the intervention group but, in place of explicit education about pain relieving effects of exercise, greater emphasis will be placed on the nature of pain during exercise and the distinction between pain intensity and pain unpleasantness. The comparator treatment will be delivered face to face by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist on an individual basis but will not be personalised to each participant. The comparator education component of the experiment will last approximately 15 minutes and the entire experimental session will last approximately 60 - 90 minutes with the rest of the experimental session to consist of participants completing questionnaires relating to their health and level of physical activity (30 min), a bout of aerobic exercise (20 min), and assessment of pressure pain threshold before and after exercise (10 min). All testing will be performed at Neuroscience Research Australia. For participants in the chronic pain group, abstinence from analgesic medication(s) must begin 23 hours prior to the start of their experimental session.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size planning: 
Sample size calculations were made on the basis of detecting a difference in the magnitude of the change in pain by exercise (measured by the change in pressure pain threshold) between the intervention and comparator education arms within each group (chronic pain and healthy). In people with chronic pain, exercise has a small-moderate effect on pain and we estimate a change in pressure pain threshold of approximately 0.4 kg/cm2 to represent a clinically meaningful difference (Naugle et al, 2012). Assuming a difference in the change in pressure pain threshold of 0.4 +/- 0.4 kg/cm2 between the intervention and comparator arms (Naugle et al, 2012; Burrows et al, 2014; Newcomb et al 2011), 17 participants are needed per arm (i.e. 34 people with chronic pain) with a power of 80%, alpha of 0.05 and an independent samples t-test. For the healthy group, exercise has a larger effect on pain than for people with chronic pain (Naugle et al, 2012), but this could potentially limit the scope for pain responses to exercise to be changed by the intervention. There is also no context to determine a 'clinically meaningful' difference in pain threshold for this population. Consequently, we have assumed a smaller difference in pressure pain threshold of 0.25 +/- 0.25 kg/cm2 to represent a meaningful change. 20 participants are needed per arm (i.e. 40 healthy participants) to detect a difference of this magnitude between the intervention and comparator arms, with a power of 80% and alpha of 0.05. Therefore, a total of 74 participants are needed for this experiment (34 with chronic pain and 40 healthy individuals).

Analysis of outcomes:
The primary outcome, which is the change in pressure pain threshold from before to after exercise compared between the intervention and comparator arms within each group (healthy and chronic pain), will be analysed using effect sizes and independent t-tests on the change scores. Differences in pressure pain threshold between the intervention and comparator arms at baseline will be determined using independent t-tests. Subsidiary analyses of the effect of exercise on pressure pain thresholds within each study arm will be done using paired t-tests. No inferential statistical tests are planned to compare the healthy and chronic pain groups for the primary or secondary outcome measures.

The secondary outcomes are the 0-10 change in pain during exercise and the assessment of knowledge and beliefs about exercise and pain. Differences between the intervention and comparator arms for the 0-10 change in pain during exercise will be analysed using independent t-tests. Descriptive statistics will be generated from the Likert scale responses to the questions regarding exercise and pain; differences between the intervention and comparator arms for these responses will be analysed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Chronic exercise has hypoalgesic effects in both fibromyalgia and knee osteoarthritis (Fransen et al, 2015; Busch et al, 2007), but the effect of acute exercise on pain in these two conditions is more variable. Subgroup analyses will be performed on differences in the effects of the education intervention, and of exercise, on the primary and secondary outcome measures between people with fibromyalgia and knee osteoarthritis. This will be done using independent sample t-tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain is multifactorial and involves both biological and psychological components. Multi-disciplinary treatment approaches incorporating drugs, cognitive-behavioural therapy and exercise interventions are the most efficacious for managing chronic pain. Single sessions of exercise and pain education are both demonstrated to have positive effects on pain in people with chronic pain such as fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis, however it is not known whether pain education delivered immediately prior to exercise can enhance the efficacy of exercise in relieving pain. Recent studies from our group have identified that the pain relieving effects of exercise involve a psychological component that influences the appraisal of pain; this would likely be augmented by a combination of exercise and education. The current project will  examine the effect of explicit pain education about the pain relieving effect of exercise, compared to more general exercise and pain education, on pain responses to exercise in people with chronic pain (fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis) and healthy individuals. The results will provide insight into: 1) the impact of pain education on the pain response to exercise; and 2) whether this differs between healthy individuals and people with chronic pain. The outcomes may have implications for how exercise and pain education are combined in clinical practice in the management of chronic pain.</summary>
