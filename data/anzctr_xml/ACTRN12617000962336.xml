  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pre-hospital point-of-care ultrasound of the lungs will be performed by Central Australian Retrieval Doctors at the clinic/remote health centre/site of retrieval prior to transport to Alice Springs Hospital.

The participants will have warmed ultrasound gel applied to four areas on the chest (2 right and 2 left) and bedside ultrasound scanning carried-out. The de-identified images will then be saved and the performing medical officer will record their findings on the study proforma.

The intervention fidelity and any difficulties encountered will be recorded by the performing doctor on the study proforma. If inadequate images are obtained, this will be recorded as such.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite primary outcome: To assess the feasibility and practicality of performing lung ultrasound, and obtaining images of adequate diagnostic value, on infants in the pre-hospital setting.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The performing Retrieval Doctor will record the findings and diagnosis on the study proforma at the time of the intervention. Any difficulties or practical issues will also be recorded.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Inter-operator variability of image interpretation and diagnosis (from those images).

This will occur by ultrasonogpraphers interpreting the saved images and recording their diagnosis. The second reading will then be compared to the initial diagnosis to demonstrate whether both parties agree.

The ultrasonographer will be blinded to the initial findings recorded by the performing Retrieval Doctor.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This should occur within 24-72 hours of the images being obtained, but could occur at any stage prior to the patient discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of pre-hospital US findings with the clinical diagnosis by the paediatric team.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On discharge of the patient as recorded in the notes</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Respiratory illness is a common presentation among the paediatric population and many will have multiple presentations during their lifetime. Bronchiolitis is one of the common viral-induced lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), particularly during Winter, and can often result in hospital admission. This project proposes to demonstrate the use of pre-hospital point-of-care lung ultrasound is practical in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis and the ultrasound images can be reliably interpreted by Retrieval Doctors.</summary>
