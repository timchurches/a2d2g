  <interventions>
    <interventions>Before the aplication of stimulation in both groups, we applied a anamnese questionnaire with inclusion criterias of the study and personal informations such age, gender, ocupation, escolarity and time of diagnostic. If the person was able to participate of the study, the Hoehn-Yahr Modified scale was applied for classify the people in different stages of Parkinson's disease. Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation on posterior cervical region, c3-c5 segments at Tens mode, small electrode of 1 cm by 0,5 cm, frequency=250 hz, pulse width=300 ms and intensity regulated at the maximum value possible, but respecting the people's perception. This procedure was a single procedure and had a half hour of duration.</interventions>
    <comparator>In control group, the Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation device was used on posterior cervical region, c3-c5 segments, but the device was on (with same parameters of intervention group) with intensity zero. Therefore, the people in control group did not receive the stimulation.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gait parameters such step lenght, stride lenght and base width was obtained through the Footprint method of gait assessment. This method consists in a paper walkway. We printed a device placed at people's heel and they walk on the paper walkway. This form, we obtained the value of the variables above (gait parameters). Beyond this, the gait velocity was evaluated through the formula velocity=distance/time. The time was obtained through a chronometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The gait parameters were evaluated before and after the Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation in a single session.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The generality motor standard of people was evaluated too by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Exam</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Exam's scores were evaluated before and after the Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation in a single session.</timepoint>

    <concealment>The people were allocated in two groups: intervention and control through a central randomization by computer (computer software). The person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. The intervention group has nine participants and the control group have eight participants.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method used for allocate the participants was simple randomization using a randomization table created by computer software.</sequence>
