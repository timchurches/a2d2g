    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility assessed by adherence, safety, attrition and participant acceptibility.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to explore the feasibility and efficacy of a rehabilitative dance intervention designed to reduce disability and to improve quality of life in a small sample of adults with Parkinsons disease. 
Twenty adults with PD will be recruited and randomly allocated to either a usual care group or an 8-week dance intervention. Gait, balance and quality of life will be measured in all participants at baseline, 8 weeks and 3 months. Additionally, the intervention will be assessed for feasibility in terms of adherence, attrition safety and participant acceptability. The results of this study are designed to inform and verify the methodology for a larger subsequent RCT and to determine the feasibility of dancing for a small group of people with PD</summary>
