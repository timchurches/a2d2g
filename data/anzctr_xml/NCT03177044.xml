  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the project is to investigate whether a behavioural training programme
      improves troublesome bowel symptoms, that people with inflammatory bowel disease continue to
      have, despite their disease being controlled by medication. The other aim is to determine if
      there are factors which influence how well the training programme works.

      People attending an Inflammatory Bowel Disease clinic in a tertiary hospital, with bothersome
      bowel symptoms despite disease control, will be asked to join the study. This involves 2 to 6
      sessions with a pelvic floor trained physiotherapist over a period of 6 months with further
      follow up at 12 months..</summary>
