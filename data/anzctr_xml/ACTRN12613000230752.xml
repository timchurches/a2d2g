  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Australian population is ageing, with a disproportionately large burden of disease incurred in older people. Retirement, as a major life transition, may offer an important opportunity for intervening on health behaviours.  The primary aim of the Life After Work study is to comprehensively measure changes in activity patterns, health and well-being across the retirement transition, using a use-of-time approach, with the view to inform further health behaviour interventions for this population.  A target sample of 120 participants aged 50 years and over who are about to retire will be recruited in two major Australian cities, Adelaide and Brisbane. Participants will undertake a battery of assessments approximately 3 months prior to retirement, and 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement. Assessments will include self-reported use of time (using the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults), objective physical activity and sedentary behaviour (using Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers), self-reported health status and well-being (using a battery of surveys, including the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) , the Australian Unity Personal Well-being Index (AUPWI), the  Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, the  Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), retirement circumstances and socio-demographic items, objective anthropometric measures (height, weight and waist circumference), and resting blood pressure. The results will allow a robust examination of the changes in use of time, health and well-being across retirement. The results will provide important new information that will inform the development of lifestyle and policy interventions to address and improve health and well-being in retirement.</summary>
