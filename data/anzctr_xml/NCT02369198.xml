  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - TargomiRs

Experimental: Single arm, open label TargomiRs - TargomiRs are IV injected.
Phase 1 Planned dose levels
Dose level 1: 5 billion once a week Dose level 2: 5 billion twice a week Dose level 3: 5 billion once a week with cardiac monitoring Dose level 4: 2.5 billion twice a week with cardiac monitoring Dose level 5: as for dose level #3 with a dexamethasone challenge
All patients begin on a micro dose of one billion and increase their dose over 2 weeks and reach their phase 1 dose level on week 3.
Schedule of assessments includes laboratory and physical assessments in the 24 hours after each treatment as well as periodic assessments such as PET and CT scans for tumour assessment.
100% of the data will be source data verified. Analysis will be simple phase 1 analysis based on a 3+3 model.


Treatment: drugs: TargomiRs
TargomiRs are targeted minicells containing a microRNA mimic. They consist of three components: 1. A miR-16-based microRNA mimic. The miR-16 family has been implicated as a tumour suppressor in a range of cancer types. The mimic is a double-stranded, 23 base pair, synthetic RNA molecule. 2. Drug delivery vehicle - EDVs. EDVs are nonliving bacterial minicells (nanoparticles). They function as leak resistant micro-reservoir carriers that allow efficient packaging of a range of different drugs, proteins or nucleic acids. 3. Targeting moiety. The EDVs are targeted to EGFR-expressing cancer cells with an anti-EGFR bispecific antibody.
TargomiRs are IV injected.

      <outcome>There is a composite primary outcome to establish maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities The MTD will be determined by the assessment of dose limiting toxicities. - There is a composite primary outcome to establish maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities.
The MTD will be determined by the assessment of dose limiting toxicities. Toxicities, in the first 2 weeks of treatment for any given patient, are assessed with physical assessments 5 times in the 24 hours starting with a pre-dose assessment, and with laboratory assessments which are assessed 3 times in the 24 hours starting with pre-dose assessment.
