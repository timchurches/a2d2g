    <interventions>From 1st October 2017 until 31st March 2018, for all cardiac surgical patients at admission to the ICU following surgery, a loading dose of 10 mmol of magnesium sulphate diluted in 100 mL of saline will be administered intravenously over the period of 1 hour. After the end of the loading dose, a continuous infusion of magnesium sulphate will be commenced at a rate of 3 mmol/h (total extrapolated dose over 24 hours of 82 mmol).

Baseline comparisons will be performed using Fishers exact tests and reported as n (%). Continuous normally distributed variables will be compared using Student t-tests and reported as means (standard deviation), while non-normally distributed data will be compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and reported as medians [interquartile range]. Changes over time will be determined using repeated measures mixed linear modeling with each patient treated as a random effect, and therapy group, time and the interaction of therapy group and time as effect fixed effects. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common complication after cardiac surgery, with an incidence ranging from 20 to 50%. It represents a potential cause of thromboembolic events, hemodynamic instability and prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. Maintaining a normal blood magnesium concentration may help prevent the onset of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.  

Previously we performed an assessment of the pharmacokinetics of magnesium administration after cardiothoracic surgery from August, 2016 to April, 2017: Assessment of Blood and Urine Magnesium Levels in Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (HREC: LNR/15/Austin/306). We included  60 patients: 30 patients in the before period who received a bolus of 20 mmol of magnesium sulphate over 1 hour; and 30 patients in the after period who received a bolus of 10 mmol of magnesium sulphate followed by a continuous infusion at 3 mmol/h over 12 hours. In the before period, we found that the loading dose of 20 mmol increased both serum and urinary magnesium concentrations, however the serum concentration returned to pre-intervention levels within 12 hours of observation and the urinary excretion remained elevated. In the after period, the intervention of a loading dose of 10 mmol of magnesium sulphate followed by a continuous infusion was associated with an increase of both the serum and urinary concentrations of magnesium over time. The after-period protocol allowed us to achieve a sustained, safe, and moderately elevated serum magnesium concentration at twice to three times the lowest total magnesium concentration in our laboratory (1.4 to 2.0 mmol/L), which might be expected to deliver a greater chance of AF prevention.  As such the management practices associated with magnesium administration in our intensive care unit has changed.  The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effect of the new protocol on the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients who undergo cardiac surgery and are admitted to the intensive care unit.  Using a medical record audit design we will evaluate patients treated with the new magnesium protocol with that of a historical control.</summary>
