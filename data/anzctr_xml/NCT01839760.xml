  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the study is virological assessment (e.g., proportion of prolonged viral
      shedding, median days to viral clearance, and viral load) in laboratory-confirmed adult
      influenza patients admitted to the general ward and/or to the ICU and to assess the
      correlation with the clinical manifestations and prognosis.</summary>
