  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will undergo a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan and then be assigned to the PET+ or PET- arm of the study.

PET scan preparation and procedure will take approximately 2 hours. Patients will also be required to fast for four hours prior to the scan. Diabetic patients should discuss fasting requirements with their doctor. Plain, unflavoured water may be consumed while fasting. 

Postinducton PET- patients: 
Rituximab 375mg/m2 by i.v or 1400mg s.c  every 3 months for 2 years.

Postinducton PET+ patients: 
Rituximab 375mg/m2 by i.v or 1400mg s.c every 3 months for 2 years, plus Lenalidomide consolidation therapy.
Lenalidomide capsules will be administered at a starting dose of 10mg orally per day for 21 days of a 28 day cycle, for 6 months. 
After this patients will be reassessed via PET scan and treatment will be adapted based on these results:
Patients remaining PET+ will continue Lenalidomide at a dose of 15mg/day for a maximum total of 2 years Lenalidomide therapy.
Patients becoming PET- will continue Lenalidomide at a dose of 10mg/day for a maximum total of 2 years Lenalidomide therapy.
If there is PET determined progression patients will discontinue Lenalidomide but continue to be followed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prognosis for patients with FL has significantly improved during the last decade with the incorporation of Rituximab into therapy. Rituximab maintenance has become a standard of care after initial rituximab-chemotherapy for remission induction.

Lenalidomide is an immune system modulating drug that has anti-lymphoma properties demonstrated in smaller studies of patients with relapsed/refractory Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 

Lenalidomide consolidation added to Rituximab maintenance therapy may convert PET+ patients to PET-, without causing unmanageable side effects.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging tool that can detect cancer in its early stages, help to monitor cancer treatment and check if the cancer is coming back. 

Lay Summary:
Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of slow growing non Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatments and outcomes have improved considerably in the last 10 years with the introduction of the drug, rituximab to standard chemotherapy treatments. However, the disease returns repeatedly in many patients. PET scanning is a type of test used by doctors to outline where the lymphoma is in the body. PET scans will light up the areas of active follicular lymphoma. Such positive PET scans after the end of treatment indicate that it is likely the lymphoma will return soon. 
This study is for patients with returned disease who have already received treatment again and so are at even
higher risk of disease returning yet again. Patients will receive rituximab and up to 24 months of another drug, lenalidomide, which is designed to help the bodys own immune system to keep the lymphoma away. The study will decide if the extra treatment with lenalidomide can change the scan result to negative and improve patient outcomes.</summary>
