The Bruder Eye Hydrating Compress is a microwave activated moist heat compress intended to stimulate the meibomian glands, in order to increase lipid secretion and slow tear evaporation to bring relief for dry eye sufferers. It is considered superior to conventional treatments using warm face cloths, as the MediBeads technology incorporated in to the design of the mask eliminates the need for repeated rinsing and wringing out of the face cloth to maintain adequate heat for the required duration.

All participants will receive both the Bruder Eye Hydrating Compress and the traditional warm compress. The 'wash out' period between treatments is 2 weeks</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dry eye symptoms associated with Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is a commonly encountered complication in optometric care. MGD refers to the abnormal functioning of the meibomian glands located at the eyelids. Meibomian glands are normally responsible for secreting oils which maintain proper hydration of the eyes. 
Management and treatment options for the relief of MGD complications such as sensations of dry eyes, grittiness, and discomfort of the eyes, have been widely investigated in the literature. The current mainstay treatment for MGD is an application of heat on to the eyelid surface by the use of a warm compress (usually a face cloth wrung under hot water) which have shown to be effective in the relief of dry eye symptoms and discomfort of the eyes. More recent studies have investigated the efficacy of different heating devices to treat MGD. 
Our study aims to evaluate the effect of the Bruder Eye Hydrating Compress on symptoms of dry eyes and discomfort, and the presentation of the eye in subjects with dry eye associated with MGD. 
The Bruder Eye Hydrating Compress is a microwave activated moist heat compress intended to stimulate the meibomian glands, in order to increase lipid secretion and slow tear evaporation to bring relief for dry eye sufferers. It is considered superior to conventional treatments using warm face cloths, as the MediBeads technology incorporated in to the design of the mask eliminates the need for repeated rinsing and wringing out of the face cloth to maintain adequate heat for the required duration. However, no studies to date have evaluated the effect of the Bruder Eye Hydrating Compress on ocular symptoms and signs.
This study will utilise questionnaires to evaluate eye symptoms, as well as traditional and advanced diagnostic tools and techniques, to evaluate eye surface characteristics after treatment with the Bruder Eye Hydrating Compress in subjects with MGD</summary>
