  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether problem solving therapy is better than usual care after someone presents to hospital with acute self-harm, (such as an overdose). The main outcome we are interested in is the repetition of self harm in the year after the first attempt. We are also interested to see whether people who receive problem solving therapy are less depressed and suicidal after a year.</summary>
