  <interventions>
    <interventions>All enrolled participants will receive the following nutrient supplements for the 20 weeks of the study:
*Compounded N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and L-theanine (LT) capsules, 500mg and 100mg per capsule respectively. Two capsules taken twice per day (2,000mg NAC and 400mg LT per day). Dose will be titrated to three capsules, twice per day in cases of non-response from Week-8 in the study (non-response defined as &lt; 35% reduction in Week-8 Y-BOCS score in comparison to baseline).  
*Zinc liquid (25 drops per day, 28.4mg elemental zinc per day)
*Selenium liquid (5 drops per day, 113mcg elemental selenium per day) 
*Magnesuim and Vitamin B6 tablets (1 tablet per day, 150 elemental magnesium, 50mg pyridoxal-5-phosphate). 

Participants will be asked to return their nutrient supplements at each follow-up visit where capsules/tablets will be counted, and liquid measured to determine compliance. New supplements will be dispensed at each visit as required.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 70 participants across three study sites are anticipated to be recruited and intention-to-treat principles will be applied to all data. Given this is a pilot, open-label study in a highly resistant to treatment population we are expecting a small effect size. Analysis of all outcome measures will be performed at each time point and intention-to-treat statistical analysis employed. Repeated measures linear mixed models analysis will be used to test the effect on rate of change on primary and secondary outcome measures over time. Tests of significance will use a level of alpha = 0.05. Data will be analysed via SPSS 24.0</statisticalmethods>
