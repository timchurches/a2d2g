  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thermiva is a TGA approved device being utilised for the management of various vulvovaginal disorders including vaginal laxity. The Thermiva is a monopolar radiofrequency device which consists of a small generator, a probe and a grounding pad. The active aspect of the probe is only thumbprint sized and constant movement of the probe allows for tissue cooling to occur. Although, the optimal temperature is 47 degrees Celsius, feedback from the patient determines the maximum temperature achieved. Automated feedback from the machine prevents the clinician from reaching an unsafe temperature range. The device can be moved faster to reduce temperature and more slowly to increase it. 

Treatment for the trial will include internal (vaginal canal) and external (labial) treatment. Internal treatment will target each quadrant of the vagina for 2 minutes and bilateral labia for 2 minutes each. The ThermiVA group and placebo group will undergo the same treatment regimens. The only difference being in the placebo group sub therapeutic temperature of maximum 30 degrees Celsius will be maintained. Generally, patients receive a new probe at each visit. However, in our pilot study we have used one probe per patient. The probe is cleaned after each treatment (it does not need sterilisation) and given to the patient to bring back at subsequent treatments.

Patients will undergo three treatments at one month intervals. 

The intervention will be delivered by an experienced Obstetrician and Gynecologist Fellow who has previous experience in delivering Thermiva treatment.

The intervention will occur at a specialised Thermiva clinic at the Townsville Hospital. 
  </interventions>
    <comparator>The Thermi Tight study will be a single blinded randomized placebo controlled trial. It will be conducted at the Townsville Hospital. The enrolled subjects will be randomised (1:1) to treatment or a sham group. The study personnel initiating the study will not be blinded. However, the physical examination at the follow-up visits will be conducted by a study doctor who will be blinded. This will help prevent bias. The analysis will be intention to treat.

The Thermiva group and the placebo group will undergo the same treatment regimes. The only significant difference being in the placebo group sub therapeutic temperature of maximum 30 degrees Celsius will be maintained. </comparator>

Data will be entered into excel sheet which would be available for access only to the supervisors. Data will be stored in a safe and secure location. Data will be analysed using SPSS 23.0. Continuous variables will be tested for normality. Based on the outcome of the test parametric students T test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test will be carried out to determine the significant differences in VLQ, FSFI scores. Categorical data will be analysed using the Chi-squared analysis. Factors contributing to vaginal laxity will be determined using multivariate binary logistic regression. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Executive Summary 
The symptom of vaginal laxity or looseness is a common problem effecting anywhere from 24% to 50% of parous women(1,2). It is frequently underreported(1,2). Till recently, the only treatment options for this condition have included physiotherapy or surgery. Both are known to have inconclusive results. Additionally, surgical treatment remains largely diverse in technique with no strong literature suggesting it is effective. Also, risks associated with surgery often dont make it an amiable choice for younger women who are more likely to be affected by this symptom and potentially considering future pregnancy. Recently, monopolar radiofrequency devices have shown some promising impact on the symptom of vaginal laxity(3, 4). More importantly, they are a low risk option in comparison to surgery.

Therefore, we propose to perform a single blinded, randomized sham controlled trial at the Townsville Hospital. The trial will compare treatment with The Thermiva to sham treatment. The study will take place over a period of 24 months. Patients in the treatment and sham group will undergo the same study protocol. There will be an enrolment visit followed by three treatments at one month apart. Follow-up will be at the third treatment and at six and twelve months post treatment. According to our sample size calculation we need to recruit 168 patients (84 in the treatment and 84 in the sham group).

We will be using the Thermiva monopolar radiofrequency device which is TGA approved and currently being used in Australia for the management of symptoms of vaginal laxity. We will be using the same Thermiva probe for the sham treatments however, will be operating it at sub therapeutic temperatures (at or below 30 degrees Celsius). The temperature suggested to optimal treatment is 47 degrees Celsius. For the Sham will be use 20 degrees Celsius. We will be obtaining HREC approval from The Townsville Hospital prior to commencement of the study.
