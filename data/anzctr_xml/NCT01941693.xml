Experimental: Integrated care - Integrated care:
Intervention for co-morbid alcohol dependence and anxiety or mood disorder. Trained therapists will deliver specific Cognitive Behavioural Therapy based upon interventions that have been supported by randomised controlled trials for alcohol use, anxiety, and depressive disorders.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a high rate of psychological comorbidity in people suffering from alcohol
      dependence. There is a need for an effective integrated treatment for alcohol dependence and
      comorbid anxiety or depression. This study will test the efficacy of a novel integrated
      intervention for comorbid alcohol dependence and anxiety or mood disorder.</summary>
