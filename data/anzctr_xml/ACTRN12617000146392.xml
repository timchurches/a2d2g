  <interventions>
    <interventions>The PROGRESS NZ Study is a prospective cohort study in individuals with pre-diabetes and early Type 2 diabetes, that has been designed to assess the relationship between body composition and glucose metabolism at baseline and in response to a dietary weight loss intervention.  All individuals in the study will proceed to a weight loss intervention.  Glucose metabolism at baseline and post the weight loss will be analysed using a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp with stable isotope dilution and an arginine insulin secretion test.  Body composition will be assessed using DXA scanning, whilst energy expenditure shall be calculated using hood calorimetry.  Statistical analysis shall be with  ANCOVA with assessment of the weight loss intervention; body composition (continuous variable) and their interaction.  

The weight loss intervention will involve undergoing an 'Optifast' very low calorie diet (VLCD) until 10% body weight is lost.  This would be anticipated to take approximately 12 weeks to achieve if compliance is met.  There is no maximum duration of diet determined.  Optifast is a meal replacement supplement in the form of a shake.  Individuals will be required to drink three Optifast shakes (meal replacements) per day as well as two cups of non-starchy vegetables and water.  Each day of three shakes would provide 600calories per day, with 58g of protein and 39-71g of carbohydrate.  An information sheet prepared by an Endocrinologist and dietician with experience in clinical research will be provided which shall detail the quantity of vegetables and type of vegetables permitted, as well as serving suggestions.
Individuals will be contacted via telephone weekly to monitor progress and will visit the clinical facility (The University of Otago, Wellington Campus) monthly for a check-up including weight and blood pressure monitoring.  
Intervention adherence will be assessed using a combination of participant self-reported compliance and urinary ketone testing during the visits.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will be ANCOVA with main effects of randomised treatment, body composition (treated as a continuous variable), and their interaction.  Similar analyses will be performed for the continuous secondary outcome variables.  The ethnicity analysis will also include a categorical term for ethnicity.  

A sample size of 20 has 80% power with Type 1 error rate of 5% to detect a baseline intervention tolerability of less than 56%, assuming tolerability of 80%.  Using this sample size, insufficient compliance with the intervention in greater than or equal to 75% of participants will indicate a 95% confidence interval upper limit for adequate compliance of 48% in future research, which would be considered inadequate, and as such, is the threshold for making changes to the study protocol.  Analysis of the recruitment rate shall also confirm the efficacy of planned recruitment measures for future studies.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 25% of the adult population of NZ have pre-diabetes, and 70% will eventually develop Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  Pacific, Maori and South Asian New Zealanders have similarly high rates of T2DM (significantly higher than European New Zealanders), yet have very different body composition.  The University of Otago, Wellington Campus has identified the need to explore whether there are fundamental physiological differences between people with different proportions of fat and lean mass at high risk of T2DM and whether they respond differently to a weight loss intervention proven to reduce T2DM.  This study will assess the impact of a dietary intervention using a very low calorie diet (VLCD) on glucose metabolism, energy expenditure and body composition in individuals with pre-diabetes or early T2DM.  This study will assess whether the effect of this intervention differs in those with different lean:fat mass ratios and explore whether these outcome measures differ by ethnicity, unrelated to baseline or change in body composition.

In order to ensure successful research, a variety of feasibility questions must also be answered prior to future research in this area - to identify recruitment strategies and barriers to recruitment; assess tolerability of the baseline investigations and assess tolerability and barriers to completion of the proposed intervention.
