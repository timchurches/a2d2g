  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary question to be addressed by this study is: compared with a functional oxygen
      saturation level (SpO2) of 91-95%, does targeting SpO2 85-89% in extremely preterm infants
      from birth or soon after, result in a difference in mortality or major disability in
      survivors by 2 years corrected age (defined as gestational age plus chronological age)?</summary>
