  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This two-part, Phase 1 protocol will be the first clinical study of ABI-H0731. Part I will be
      a Phase 1a dose-ranging assessment of ABI-H0731 in healthy adult volunteers. If the
      dose-related safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ABI-H0731 in human volunteers
      are deemed satisfactory, then the study will advance to Part II, a Phase 1b dose-ranging
      assessment of ABI-H0731 in non-cirrhotic, CHB patients.</summary>
