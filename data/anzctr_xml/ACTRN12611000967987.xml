  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a prospective follow-up of major cardiac events in patients presenting with confirmed CHF with LVEF of 45% or less and in whom NYHA classification rest in the II or III category. Patients will follow standard management plans informed by their HF classification, LVEF and global mIBG quantitation. 

The proposed project would allow prospective data to be collected with follow-up to 2 years, and provide an initial validation of our proposed novel 3-D tomographic SPECT based regional quantitation of myocardial uptake and washout of 123I-mIBG against the traditional more established global approaches using planar 2-D imaging. Our assertion is that regional quantitation should provide more accurate risk stratification than the existing global approaches. This information requires up to 24 months follow-up of cardiac events in patients presenting with heart failure. A follow-up to 5 years will be undertaken.

Hypothesis: 123I-mIBG SPECT provides stratification of CHF patients most likely to benefit from aggressive management, independently of LVEF. 
  
Primary Aims:
1. Determine whether 123I-mIBG is independently predictive of SCD or ICD discharge in CHF patients with LVEF less than or equal to 35%.
2. Determine whether 123I-mIBG is independently predictive of SCD in CHF patients with LVEF greater than 35%.</summary>
