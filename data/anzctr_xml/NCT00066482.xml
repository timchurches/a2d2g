  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - bleomycin sulfate
Other interventions - filgrastim
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery
Other interventions - MESNA

Experimental: combination chemotherapy - Induction therapy: bleomycin sulfate IV over 10-20 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-5, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. MESNA &amp; Filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 6 patients receive escalating doses of cyclophosphamide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.
Evaluated after 4 courses of therapy. Partial response or stable disease undergo second-look conventional surgery &amp; receive 2 more courses of induction therapy then re-evaluated. Those who do not achieve complete response (CR) after a total of 6 courses may undergo a third conventional surgery. Tumor that cannot be removed are removed from study therapy. Achievement of a CR at anytime are followed monthly for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.


Other interventions: bleomycin sulfate
Given IV over 10 minutes. Children = 12 months: 15 units/m2/dose Children &lt; 12 months: 0.5 units/kg/dose Day 1 (Week 1, 4, 7, 10)

Other interventions: filgrastim
Given SQ once daily 5 micrograms/kg/dose Starting on Day 6 (Week 1, 4, 7, 10) Daily until ANC &gt; 5,000/uL

Treatment: drugs: cisplatin
Children = 12 months: Given IV over one hour Dose: 20 mg/m2/dose Days 1-5 (Week 1,4,7,10) Children &lt; 12 months: Given IV over 4 hours, 0.67 mg/kg/dose Days 1-5 (Week 1,4,7,10)

Treatment: drugs: cyclophosphamide
Given IV over 1 hour. Children = 12 months: Level 1: 1.2 g/m2/dose Level 2: 1.8 g/m2/dose Level 3: 2.4 g/m2/dose Children &lt; 12 months: Level 1: 40 mg/kg/dose Level 2: 60 mg/kg/dose Level 3: 80 mg/kg/dose Day 1 (Week 1, 4, 7, 10)

Treatment: drugs: etoposide
Given IV over 1 hour. Children = 12 months: 100 mg/m2/dose Children &lt; 12 months: 3.3 mg/kg/dose Day 1-5 (Week 1, 4, 7, 10)

Treatment: surgery: conventional surgery
Stage III/IV extragonadal tumors: biopsy followed by a definitive surgical excision after maximal chemotherapy effect, likely after 4 cycles of therapy

Other interventions: MESNA
Given IV or oral. The total daily MESNA dose is equal to at least 80% of the daily CPM dose. The oral dose of MESNA is 2x the IV dose. Day 1 (Week 1,4,7,10) To be given with CPM.

    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effect on the body of combining cyclophosphamide with
      cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin in treating children who have newly diagnosed malignant
      germ cell tumors that are not in the brain and gonads.</summary>
