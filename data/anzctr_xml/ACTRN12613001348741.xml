    <interventions>The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability following the oral administration (sucking) of Manuka Honey with Cyclopower a day for 2 weeks.  Cohort 1 will take 800mg (1 chewable tablet); Cohort 2 will take 1600mgs (2 tablets); cohort 3 will take 2400mgs (3 chewable tablets); cohort 4 will take 3200mgs (4 tablets); cohort 5 will take  4000mgs (5 tablets) and cohort 6 will take 4,800mg (6 chewable tablets), each cohort takes this amount daily in single or divided doses for 2 weeks (3 tablets 1x3 times daily; 4 tablets 2x2 daily; 5 tablets 2x2 plus 1x1 daily; 6 tablets 2x3 daily) . An exploratory assessment will also be completed to assess the potential benefits on oral health via saliva pH measurement.  All unused tablets will be returned.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is a placebo arm to this trial made up largely of maltodextrin and sorbitol, which will be administered at the same time as the active treatment.</comparator>

    <concealment>The investigator must ensure that all subjects being considered for the study meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Deviation from any entry criterion excludes a subject from enrolment into the study.

Each subject in the study is uniquely identified by a subject number. When the subject has signed the informed consent form, the investigator or his/her staff will assign the subject number for the subject. Informed consent must be obtained before any testing is performed to determine a subjectâ€™s eligibility. Any subjects who are screened but do not meet the entry criteria will be allocated a 900 series number. The first screen failure subject will be assigned the number 901, the second 902 etc.
Randomisation and groups selection occurs with the use of a computer software programme and subjects and their specimens are only identifiable by the number that is then allocated to them - identifying data will be held at the head office of Manuka Health NZ Ltd by Dr Mandy Suddes who can then identify the participant should medical treatment be warranted for an adverse event.  Dr Suddes will not be involved in any part of the trial that involves contact with participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. Each subject will participate in one of 4 cohorts. Eligible subjects will receive a total daily dose (either as a single dose, twice daily or three (3) times a day) of Honey Cyclopower chewable tablets at 800mg to 4,800mg total daily dose, or the matching placebo. In each cohort, 8 subjects will receive Honey Cyclopower while 4 will receive matched placebo. 

The study will consist of a screening visit (Day -7 to -3), treatment period (Days 1 to 14) after which the final End of Study assessments will be completed. Once randomised, subjects will be given sufficient supplies for 7 days of treatment. After 7 days subjects will then return to the clinic where the subject will be assessed for safety and dosing compliance. Safety assessments will include physical examinations, vital signs, concomitant medications, adverse event and serious adverse event monitoring. If the tolerability is deemed acceptable, a second week of study treatment will be dispensed.
