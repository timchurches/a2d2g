  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Trasylol (Aprotinin, BAYA0128)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Arm 1 - 

Placebo Comparator: Arm 2 - 


Treatment: drugs: Trasylol (Aprotinin, BAYA0128)
Subjects successfully meeting all screening criteria will be randomized to receive an infusion of aprotinin (a test dose followed by a loading dose of 2 million KIU before skin incision followed by 500,000 KIU/hour until the end of surgery) or matching placebo. The aprotinin was supplied in infusion vials of 200mL solution containing 2,000,000 KIU (10,000 KIU/mL) in 0.9% sodium chloride.
Subjects will be stratified into one of the 4 following strata:
Stratum 1: complete primary pneumonectomy
Stratum II: decortication or completion pneumonectomy
Stratum III: esophagectomy by transhiatal approach
Stratum IV: esophagectomy by transthoracic approach

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo solution was supplied in identical vials and will consist of 200mL of 0.9% sodium chloride.

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects with previous exposure to aprotinin in the last 6 months or with a known or
             suspected allergy to aprotinin

          -  Subjects undergoing laparoscopic surgery

          -  Subjects with sepsis or mesothelioma
