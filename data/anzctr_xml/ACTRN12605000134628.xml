  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprised of five major elements: 1) targeting before health and/or social crisis, and while community care needs were low; 2) linking clients with a community nurse; 3) comprehensive health assessments and identification of needs; 4) introduction of basic health care and community services and referrals if required; and 5) case management by three-monthly telephone contact.  Assessments and case management were performed by experienced community care registered nurses, and case management was performed for a one year period.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group received health assessments and phone calls similar to the experimental group for data collection purposes, and to balance the risk of a Hawthorne effect due to regular contacts with participants.  However all aspects of case management were omitted from all episodes of contact with the control group.  For ethical reasons control group participants were supplied with a summary of their health assessment results to share with their GP if they wished.</comparator>

    <concealment>Concealed - clusters of participants (based on geographical location) were labelled with a geographic location name and written on small sheets of paper.  Each paper was folded so identification of the cluster group was not possible, apart from a note identifying the groups as "large" or "small" according to the number of participants the cluster contained.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each paper containing a cluster of participants was placed in one of two hats "small" or "large".  In this way, sampling was also stratified in order to more evenly balance participant numbers in the exp/cont groups.  From each hat, clusters were drawn and assigned consecutively to the experimental or control group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study followed the health outcomes of 124 Independent Living Unit residents aged 75 years or over and living alone to see if health assessments and early basic interventions had an impact on their health and well being. If required, interventions included health information, specialist referrals, and home help. Residents were linked to a community nurse, who provided low intensity case management by phone every three months. Half of the participants participated in the early intervention experimental model, while the remainder received their usual community care. At the end of the 12 month study period, those involved in the experiment had a higher level of satisfaction with community care, but more time was needed to see if there were other detectable health outcomes. We found previously unidentified needs among 66% of the experimental group, and throughout the course of the study most of those needs were resolved.  However, no other benefits from the program were detected after one year in terms of health perception, functional ability, psychosocial status, health resource utilisation and mortality. This was consistent with many other similar studies.</summary>
