        Subjects with compensated cirrhosis must also not meet the following criteria:

          -  Any current or past clinical evidence of Child-Pugh B or C Classification or clinical
             history of liver decompensation such as ascites (noted on physical exam), variceal
             bleeding or hepatic encephalopathy.
