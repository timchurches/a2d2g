  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The risk of developmental delay in the preterm population increases as gestational age decreases. As milder delays often go undetected, the challenge in premature infant follow up is early detection without over servicing.

The primary aim of this study is to determine if early clinical assessment completed by 16 weeks post term will allow robust prediction of typical development and mild developmental delay at 2 years corrected age. Earlier prediction will enable clinicians to safely plan discharge for low risk infants from follow up services and facilitate the prioritisation of resources towards infants identified as likely to have mild to moderate or more severe outcomes.

As developmental progress is dependent upon many variables, a combination of clinical tools including neurological assessment, motor assessment and parent questionnaires will be used to predict outcome at 2 years. Likewise a comprehensive selection of outcome measures will be used at 2 years to enable identification of subtle delays. Early findings will be compared to development at 2 years corrected age to determine any predictive relationship for typical outcomes and mild developmental delay. 

As families, clinicians and health services continue to want and need more immediate information regarding the short and long term outcomes of preterm infants, finding the best clinical biomarkers has the potential to streamline and effectively prioritise premature infant follow up programs.
