    <studytitle>Bevacizumab intravitreal injection in the treatment of patients with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A 12 month, phase 2, single-centre, masked, randomised, sham-controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1.25mg/0.05ml Bevacizumab intravitreal injection in the treatment of patients with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patient will receive an intravitreal injection at baseline, week 4 and week 8.  
Repeat injections will be decided on an as needed basis
The dosage for Bevacizumab is 1.25mg/0.05ml administered via a intravitreal injection into the eye.The procedure will take 5 minutes in total.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham control Injection
 Site determined using calliper at 3.5-4mm posterior to corneal limbus and then pressure on the eye to simulate an injection (sham injection).
Injection site tamponaded with sterile cotton bud for 5 seconds.
The patient will receive a sham injection at baseline, week 4 and week 8. The procedure will take 5 minutes in total.</comparator>

      <outcome>1  Central retinal thickness.Measured using Ocular Coherance Tomography and clinical assessment.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2  Neovascular complications.This assessment will be made using FFA(Fundus Fluoroscein Angiogram) and slit lamp/clinical observation.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3 Drug related adverse effects
There is a theoretical increased risk of strokes with anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor(anti-VEGF), however the actual risk of stroke with anti-VEGF is unknown.
Ranibizumab (Lucentis) a commonly used anti-VEGF agent results in a severe inflammation of eye (uveitis) in less that 1 in 500 cases.  Though not reported in bevacizumab it could be a potential side effect.
This assessement will be made by clinical observation and assessment and documentation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline then monthly for 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4 Complications related to intravitreal injection.
These include Endophthalmitis (infection of the eye): symptoms include burning sensation, eye pain, increased blurring of vision, light sensitivity and redness. Studies have shown that the chance of getting an infection is 0.1 per cent and this is why antibiotics are given prior and following treatment. 
Elevated Eye Pressure: this is usually temporary and due to an increase of fluid entering the eye. 
Retinal Detachment, Bleeding and Cataract Formation: these are unusual complications occurring in less than 1 per cent of patients in trial studies.
This assessement will be made by clinical observation and assessment and documentation.</outcome>
