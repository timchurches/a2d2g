  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Aged between 18 to 75 years
Able to provide written informed consent
Doctor diagnosis of asthma
Exacerbation of asthma, defined as one or both of the following criteria:
Use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection), or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for at least 3 days. For consistency, courses of corticosteroids separated by 1 week or more should be treated as separate severe exacerbations.
A hospitalization or Emergency Department visit because of asthma, requiring systemic corticosteroids. requiring admission to hospital 
Participants prescribed a dose of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days will be eligible for the study, though it is recognised they will not have taken systemic corticosteroids for 3 days at the point of enrolment. Participants will not be eligible if they have commenced systemic corticosteroids greater than 24 hours prior to enrolment.
Participants who have increased from their stable maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroids will only be eligible if this dose increase is confirmed to be less than 24 hours prior to enrolment.

    <statisticalmethods>34 Participants are sufficient to detect a paired difference in periostin of 0.5 standard deviation with 80% power.  The conventional interpretation of an effect size of 0.5 of a standard deviation is of a medium effect size.
The periostin levels will be plotted against time and a non-parametric scatter plot smoother will be used to determine if there is pattern of variation with time that might be usefully explored with parametric regression (eg linear, quadratic, cubic time terms).  Paired t-test and mixed linear models will be used to compare the 12 week periostin level with measurements at the other times to formally compare the change with time.
This analysis may need to be performed on the log-transformed scale</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) gene expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states, including asthma. As yet an incomplete picture is currently available on the role and effects of periostin level in the blood, however it has shown promise as a biomarker for asthma severity and a marker of inflammation levels, being easy to measure through a simple blood test. This study of the periostin levels in severe exacerbations of asthma would provide further information on the production of periostin in asthma. Until now the periostin assay has only been used to determine the relationship of periostin with eosinophilic airway inflammation in patients not responding to inhaled steroid treatment and has not been studied in patients with acute severe exacerbations of asthma.
This study is part of a programme of research being undertaken by the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand, aimed at furthering knowledge of periostin, in order to discover its clinical usefulness.
