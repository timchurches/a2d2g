  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of subjects achieving minimal disease activity - Minimal disease activity will be determined by tender and swollen joint counts, PASI or body surface area (BSA), Patient's assessment of pain visual analogue scale, Patient's global assessment of disease activity VAS, HAQ-DI, and tender entheseal points assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in PASDAS from baseline - Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Score is a weighted disease activity measure developed specifically for psoriatic arthritis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured from Day 1 to week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in DAPSA score from baseline - DAPSA is a psoriatic arthritis disease activity measure, calculated by summing swollen and tender joint counts, Patient's assessment of pain, Patients global assessment of disease activity, and CRP.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured from Day 1 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in PsAID score from baseline - PsAID is a validated patient self-reported tool to assess the impact of PsA on the patient's life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured from Day 1 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects achieving ACR 20/50/70 response - ACR 20/50/70 response rate will be determined based on 20%, 50%, and 70% or greater improvement of Tender Joint Count and Swollen Joint Counts and greater than or equal to 3 of the 5 measures of Patient's assessment of pain, Patient's global assessment of disease activity, Physician's global assessment of disease activity, HAQ-DI, and CRP.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in DAS28-CRP score from baseline - DAS28 is a weighted measure of disease activity originally developed for RA, but is also used in PsA clinical trials.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An interventional Phase 4 open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multi-country
      study in subjects with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) consisting of 2 parts: Part 1 is designed to
      compare the achievement of minimal disease activity (MDA) between subjects randomized to
      either adalimumab in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or MTX alone escalated to the
      highest recommended or tolerable dose; Part 2 is to evaluate the maintenance or achievement
      of MDA on four different treatment regimens using adalimumab and/or MTX, with subject
      allocation based on the initial randomized treatment and achievement of MDA in Part 1, and
      with rescue treatment option.</summary>
