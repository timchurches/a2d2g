    <studytitle>Comparing cotrimoxazole and/or povidone-iodine ear wash  with standard dry mopping and ciprofloxacin ear drops in Indigenous children with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Among Aboriginal children (2 months of age and up to 17 years of age) with chronic suppurative otitis media, is 4 months of povidone-iodine ear wash and/or oral cotrimoxazole in addition to standard treatment (cleaning and dry mopping with tissue spears plus topical ciprofloxacin) superior to standard treatment alone for resolving ear discharge?  A 2x2 factorial randomised controlled trial

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral Intervention: Placebo or Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (cotrimoxazole, 4mg/kg per dose of trimethoprim component) given orally twice daily for 16 weeks.

Topical Intervention: Povidone-iodine 0.5% (Betadine 'registered trademark') given twice daily as an ear wash (1:20 mixed with clean water), &gt;=20mls per discharging ear.  This treatment will be given prior to the standard recommended treatment of dry mopping with tissue spears and ciprofloxacin drops. Topical treatment regimens should continue until the ear has been without discharge for 3 days (confirmed on two clinical examinations at least 3 days apart).  

Children will be randomised into one of four treatment arms. All treatments will commence at the same time (day one at randomisation). All arms will receive standard recommended topical treatment (dry mopping with tissue spears and ciprofloxacin drops 5 drops twice a day) PLUS either:

ARM 1: Oral cotrimoxazole and topical Povidone-iodine ear washouts or,

ARM 2: Oral cotrimoxazole and NO topical Povidone-iodine ear washouts or,

ARM 3: Oral placebo and topical Povidone-iodine ear washouts or,

ARM 4: Oral placebo and NO topical Povidone-iodine ear washouts.
 
Children who respond to treatment and then develop a recurrence of ear discharge will receive their original allocated topical treatment regimen.   

Families will be shown how to perform the ear washes and given treatment packs. To measure adherence, we will ask families to return their used or unused treatment packs and ask families during follow-up phone calls and at the 16 week check-up about their treatment preferences and compliance issues.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is one control arm (standard treatment only- no oral or additional topical intervention) and 3 comparator arms. 

Oral comparator/control: A placebo medication that is identical in appearance, smell and taste as cotrimoxazole.
 
Topical comparator: no povidone-iodine wash.

Standard topical treatment (Northern Territory) for all children: Dry mopping with tissue spears and ciprofloxacin drops 5 drops twice a day. 

Treatment regimens should continue until the ear has been without discharge for 3 days (confirmed on two clinical examinations at least 3 days apart).  

Children who respond to treatment and then develop a recurrence of ear discharge will receive their original allocated topical treatment regimen.   

Families will be shown how to perform the ear washes and given treatment packs. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Failure will be defined as presence of ear discharge in either ear, assessed by a trained research nurse using video-otoscopy before cleaning the ear canal.

The primary analysis will report the absolute risk difference and 95% confidence interval for: 
(i) The difference in failure rates between children allocated to receive the povidone-iodine ear wash plus standard treatment, and children allocated to receive standard treatment alone;
(ii) The difference in failure rates between children allocated to receive twice daily oral cotrimoxazole and children allocated to receive placebo.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rates of clinical failure 12 months after randomisation will be analysed using an intention to treat analysis. Failure will be defined as presence of ear discharge in either ear, assessed by a trained research nurse using video-otoscopy before cleaning the ear canal.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Parents of children identified by their health care provider as having CSOM will be advised of the study and if agreeable will be referred to the research staff. Concealed allocation will be achieved by phone randomisation system provided by the NHMRC Clinical Trial Centre which will receive participant information then generate the randomisation number and allocation group (topical treatment code and the oral medication treatment codes).</concealment>
    <sequence>Children will be stratified according to: i) community; and ii) age group (&lt;3y; 3-10y; &gt;10y). A computer generated sequence will be managed by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre. Block size and method will be concealed from all study staff and investigators.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Participants, health care providers, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to the oral treatment/ component of this trial. 
Data analysts will also be blinded to the topical treatment/ component of this trial.
Participants, health care providers and outcome assessors will not be blinded to the topical intervention.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We estimate that with 280 children randomised, this study will have ~88% power to detect an improved outcome in an additional 20% of children for each intervention (at the 5% significance level), assuming 10% loss to follow up. A full detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed and approved by all CIs before any outcome data are analysed. </statisticalmethods>
