  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surgery to the shoulder may be performed with patients seated upright in a position known as
      the "Beach Chair Position (BCP)." This position has certain advantages compared to
      alternative surgical positions (e.g. side lying) in some situations. However, it has been
      found that surgery in the BCP can temporarily decrease the amount of oxygen in the brain as a
      result of the combined effects of gravity and anaesthesia. This can result in complications
      following surgery such as some memory loss and confusion. Rarely, more serious complications
      have been reported in the past including death and stroke.

      Due to these reported complications the use of "cerebral oximetry" during shoulder surgery in
      the BCP has become more common. Before and during surgery, a monitor placed on the patients
      forehead measures the amount of oxygen present in the brain to help control this to an
      acceptable level. A number of monitors are now commercially available. Two monitors are
      commonly discussed in the literature; the INVOS 5100 and the FORE-SIGHT® machines. However,
      the actual relationship between the supply of oxygen to the brain during surgery and the
      chance of later developing problems with memory and thinking (known as "post operative
      cognitive decline" - POCD) is not clear. It is also not known if one monitor is more accurate
      than another at predicting these complications.

      Therefore, the main aim of this study is to examine the relationship between cerebral oxygen
      levels during shoulder surgery and the incidence of POCD (i.e. problems with memory and
      thinking). A second aim is to compare the INVOS 5100 and FORE-SIGHT® monitors ability to
      measure cerebral oxygen and cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) as well as the importance of
      other key clinical variables (e.g. blood pressure, nausea, body fat etc).</summary>
