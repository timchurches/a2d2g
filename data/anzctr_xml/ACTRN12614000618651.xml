  <interventions>
    <interventions>Epidural anesthesia for pain control during labor is know to inhibit natural voiding and is high risk factor for postpartum urinary retention. There has not enough evidence to help Obstetricians and Midwives choose indwelling urinary catheter or intermittent straight urinary catheter for bladder care during labor. The aim of this study is to know does indwelling urinary catheter help to reduce the rate of postpartum urinary retention for women who have epidural anesthesia and vaginal delivery. 
Intervention group: pregnant women after performing epidural anesthesia as her own request, indwelling urinary catheter will be kept in place until the time of delivery.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Midwives will measure bladder residual volume by bladder scanner. Severe postpartum urinary retention will be diagnosed if bladder residual volume equal or more than 400mL. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(1) Postpartum urinary retention will be defined if bladder residual volume equal or more than 150 mL by midwives using bladder scanner.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(2) Urinary tract infection is identified if pregnant women have the symptoms of urinary tract infection and have positive microbiology culture result. The symptoms of UTI are complained by women or doctors ask information include one of those: fever, dysuria, voiding urgency, frequency, subrapubic tenderness, costovertebral angle pain.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome is postpartum urinary retention (PUR) have bladder residual volume (BRV) from and over 400ml. The  expected PUR rate with BRV equal or greater than 400ml is 18%. In order to detect the differences between 2 groups is 6%, and cesarean section rate is 20%, we have to rule out cesarean section cases, we need to enrol 738 pregnant women to each arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Epidural anesthesia for pain control during labor is know to inhibit natural voiding and is high risk factor for postpartum urinary retention. There has not enough evidence to help Obstetricians and Midwives choose indwelling urinary catheter or intermittent straight urinary catheter for bladder care during labor. The aim of this study is to know does indwelling urinary catheter help to reduce the rate of postpartum urinary retention for women who have epidural anesthesia and vaginal delivery. The study have 2 arms: arm1 (intervention arm) using indwelling urinary catheter after women receive epidural anesthesia, this catheter remain in place until delivery time. Arm 2 (control arm) using intermittent urinary catheter as needed during labour. The primary outcome is postpartum retention urinary with bladder residual volume equal or more than 400ml, which measure by using bladder scanner at 6 hour after giving birth. The secondary outcome are: (1) the rate of PUR with BRV is equal or more than 150ml; (2): the rate of catheter associated urinary tract infection; (3): the satisfaction of pregnant women after giving birth and the sensation of catheterization during birthing. The study expect to enrol 750 pregnant women for each arm, time expected to completed this study is 20 months. The methodology of this study is randomized control trial, planed to take place at Hung Vuong hospital, maternal hospital, located in Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam.</summary>
