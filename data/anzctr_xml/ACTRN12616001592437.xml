    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive testing 
Tests:
- Self rated mood (happy, sad, calm, tense, energetic, and sleepy, rated from 0 (Not at all) to 100 (Extremely).
- Pro assesses basic visuomotor performance (a green square appears on the left or right and subjects have to press the key on the same side as the square). Anti assesses inhibitory control (a red square appears on the left or right and subjects have to press the key on the opposite side of the square). Pro/Anti assesses switching abilities (a green or red square appears on the left or right and subjects have to press the key on the same side as green squares and on the opposite side of red squares. 
- Simon assesses the ability to ignore irrelevant spatial information (one of two possible consonants appear to the left or right of centre and subjects have to indicate the identity of the consonant by pressing the assigned left or right key; thus the position of the consonant is either congruent or incongruent with the side of the correct response).
- Flanker assesses the ability to ignore irrelevant identity-based information (one of two possible consonants appear at centre and one appears above or below centre; the two consonants are either the same (congruent) or different (incongruent) and subjects have to indicate the identity of the central consonant by pressing the assigned key, with the flanking consonant to be ignored), 
- Forward Spatial assesses short-term memory capacity (a computerized version of the Corsi block tapping task) that involves viewing nine boxes that light up in a predetermined random sequence followed by a tone signalling the subject to indicate the sequence using a mouse to click on boxes; each sequence length occurs twice; if the subject responds correctly to at least one of the two occurrences, the program increases the length of the sequence by one box up to a maximum length of nine boxes
- Backward Spatial assesses short-term memory manipulation (identical to Forward Spatial except that the sequence has to be recalled in the reverse order; i e., click the boxes in the opposite order to which they lit up). 
- The 2-back test assesses working memory (consonants, except for W, Y, and Z, appear one at a time centred on the screen in a predetermined random sequence; subjects indicate whether each consonant matches the consonant two-back in the sequence).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In 2000 the NMDA antagonist ketamine was reported to be an effective fast acting antidepressant in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), and this has subsequently been confirmed in multiple studies. In addition, single doses of ketamine, at the same dose levels, were shown to have strong effects on anxiety symptoms in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We have recently identified similar effects in patients with refractory Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Phobia (SP)  (Study 15/STH/86). In all anxiety disorders, there were rapid (within 1h) improvements in anxiety severity that were sustained for 3-7 days, not dissimilar to the responses in patients with MDD. The dose response was also similar, suggesting that the pathophysiology of diverse negative emotional disorders (anxiety, depression) may share a common neurobiology. 
We have also been studying aspects of ketamines neurobiology, in particular its effects on expression of BDNF, in rats. BDNF is a neurotrophic hormone that appears to have an important general role in the activity of all antidepressants and many anxiolytics.
Another pharmacodynamic endpoint is cognition. One of the side effects of ketamine is changes in cognition, with changes in a range of cognitive domains following lower dose ketamine administration.. These changes were only present until 2 hours post-infusion. In a more recent trial delayed recall was found to be reduced at 40 minutes but a return to baseline was not assessed.. 
It is possible that ketamines effects on cognition are associated with its concentration in blood, and a recent review suggested that levels of 20 ng/mL could affect psychomotor performance. 
There are several objectives in this randomised double blind parallel group study:
1. To evaluate the early and later effects of single doses of ketamine on BDNF concentrations in healthy volunteers, and to explore the relationship of BDNF changes with ketamine and metabolite concentrations. This research may help inform biomarker research in patient populations.
2. To evaluate the early and late effects of ketamine on EEG changes 
3. To evaluate the magnitude and duration of cognitive changes following a dose of ketamine or placebo in healthy volunteers. Blood testing will also show any associations of cognitive changes with levels of ketamine and its metabolites in the participants bloodstream. This research may help to improve the administration method for ketamine in a clinical setting.
