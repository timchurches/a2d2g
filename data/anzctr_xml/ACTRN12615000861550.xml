    <concealment>The COPS trial will adopt a Prospective, Randomised, Open label, Blinded Endpoint evaluation (PROBE) design. All ACS patients who are admitted to the hospital and undergo coronary angiography +/- angioplasty will be screened for eligibility. Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. After obtaining informed consent, participants will be registered on a web-based database of which randomisation will be performed. Allocation concealment will be performed by a computer-generated central randomisation system.

Participants will be allocated to receiving standard medical therapy (control group) or standard medical therapy plus colchicine (intervention group). </concealment>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Summary statistics including mean and standard deviation will be calculated for all baseline characteristics by treatment group. 

Statistical methods for the primary endpoint:
The primary outcome will be assessed by time-to-first event survival analysis using log-rank test on an intention-to-treat basis. If a patient has not experienced an event at the cut-off date for the statistical analysis, the outcome data will be censored at the cut-off date. If the patient has been deemed lost-to-follow-up or has withdrawn rom the study, the analysis will include the last date of patients assessment. The cut-off date or study censor date will be determined after the database has been locked for the analysis.

The treatment effect will be reported as a hazard ratio, together with a 95% confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the MACE at 1, 6 and 12 months will be displayed graphically. Cox Proportional Hazards models will be fitted to evaluate the associations between a range of covariates and treatment arms. 

A secondary on-treatment analysis will be performed on patients who are tolerant to therapy beyond the first month of randomisation. 

Statistical methods for the secondary endpoints:
The cumulative incidences and their 95% confidence intervals of secondary endpoints:
- Acute coronary syndromes
- Ischaemic-driven revascularization
- Non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke
- Death from any cause
- Death due to cardiovascular disease

... will be calculated and reported by treatment arms. Fine and Gray competing risks regression will be used to compare the treatment arms after adjusting for the strata.

Health-related quality of life will be compared between groups using baseline-adjusted linear regression.

Sample size justification:
We postulate that the control group will have a combined event rate of approximately 18% based on previous trials and large clinical registries. We anticipate at least a 40% reduction in the composite major adverse cardiovascular events with colchicine treatment. 

Using an unstratified log-rank test at the two-sided 5% significance level, a total of 104 events would allow 80% power to demonstrate an approximate 40% risk reduction. Allowing for 10% attrition in each arm, a total of 550 randomized patients would be required to obtain 104 events.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The COPS trial is a prospective multicentre randomised study to examine the effect of adding low-dose colchicine to standard medical therapy in patients who have had a heart attack. A total of 550 participants will be recruited from several hospitals across Australia over a period of 18 months. Participants will be randomised to either (a) standard medical therapy or (b) standard medical therapy plus low-dose oral colchicine. Participants will be followed up for 12 months for predefined major adverse cardiovascular outcomes via telephone interviews. 

We hypothesise that the addition of colchicine to standard medical therapy will reduce long-term major adverse cardiovascular events in patients who have had a heart attack.  </summary>
