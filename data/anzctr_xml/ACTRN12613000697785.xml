  <interventions>
    <interventions>In theatre patients will receive a standardised induction of anesthesia . For the the laryngoscopy (procedure to visualise the vocal cords and therefore entrance into the windpipe) and intubation (placement of the endotracheal tube into the windpipe) in the anaesthetised and apnoeic patient, the oxygen administration is traditionally interrupted for a short time until the breathing tube is connected to the ventilator. In this study the patients are either receiving additional oxygen (10 l/min flow) via a 3.5 mm RAE tube in the buccal space during laryngascopy or no additional oxygen. During artificially prolonged laryngoscopy the saturation will be recorded for a maximum of 10 min or until the saturation starts to drop to 95%. The patient will then be intubated and anaesthesia will be continued as per routine.

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis was performed to determine the number of subjects required for the study.
We expected a minimum of 60 seconds difference between the SpO2&gt;95% times of the two groups. Based on this assumption and Type I and Type II errors of 5% and 20%, respectively(power 80%), 15 patients per group were required to prove the hypothesis.
To account for withdrawasls and fall-outs n=20 will be recruited for each group.
All continuous data were identified as nonparameteric and the Mann Whitney U test was used to determine statistical significance between groups. Pearson's chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test will be used to show significant differences between the two groups in frequency data. Statistical analysis(SPSS15.0 for Windows Software) will be used to perform the statistical analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients having operations under general anaesthesia will be asleep for the duration of the procedure and their own breathing efforts will be reduced by the anaesthetic drugs. The anaesthetist will support the patients breathing and will place a breathing tube into his/her windpipe as soon as the patient have drifted off to sleep.  Normally, the anaesthetist discontinues the administration of oxygen during this manoeuvre as it usually takes only a short time to insert the breathing tube.

We believe that continuing the supply of oxygen through a small tube into the inside of the patients cheek at this stage will keep the body oxygen levels higher than they would be otherwise. This is especially important for patients who are overweight or pregnant and also in children as their oxygen reserves exhaust more quickly. Computer programs and our understanding of the biology of people have suggested this would be the case. However, we do not have proof of this at present.
