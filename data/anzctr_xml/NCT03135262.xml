Experimental: Dose-Escalation Cohort: FL - Induction Treatment: Participants will receive either Regimen A or Regimen B. Regimen A: Participants will receive either obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8, 15 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; idasanutlin and venetoclax on Days 1 to 5 of Cycles 1 to 6 or obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8, 15 on Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; idasanutlin on Days 1 to 5 and venetoclax on Days 1 to 10 of Cycles 1 to 6. Regimen B (in bridging cohort): Participants will receive obinutuzumab alone in Cycle 1 and obinutuzumab with idasanutlin and venetoclax (both at maximum tolerated dose [MTD] established from Regimen A) in Cycles 2 to 6. Post-Induction Treatment (Maintenance Treatment): Participants will receive obinutuzumab every 2 months for 24 months; idasanutlin and venetoclax for 6 months.

Experimental: Dose-Escalation Cohort: DLBCL - Induction Treatment: Participants will receive either obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8, 15 of Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; idasanutlin and venetoclax on Days 1 to 5 of Cycles 1 to 6 or obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8, 15 on Cycle 1 and then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6; idasanutlin on Days 1 to 5 and venetoclax on Days 1 to 10 of Cycles 1 to 6. In bridging cohort, participants will receive rituximab on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6 and idasanutlin and venetoclax (both at MTD) in Cycles 1 to 6.

Treatment: drugs: Idasanutlin
Induction Treatment: Idasanutlin tablets will be administered orally once daily at escalated doses (starting dose 100 milligrams [mg], maximum 600 mg). Post-Induction Treatment: The dose and regimen will be determined by the Sponsor after review of all relevant data. The dose for maintenance/consolidation will not exceed the dose the participant received during induction.

Treatment: drugs: Obinutuzumab
Participants will receive a fixed dose of obinutuzumab, 1000 mg by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle (Cycles 2 to 6) (each cycle = 28 days) during induction treatment, and on Day 1 of every other month during maintenance treatment (eligible participants with FL only) or during consolidation treatment (eligible participants with DLBCL only).

Treatment: drugs: Venetoclax
Induction Treatment: Venetoclax tablets will be administered orally once daily at escalated doses (starting dose 200 mg, maximum 800 mg). Post-Induction Treatment: The dose and regimen will be determined by the Sponsor after review of all relevant data. The dose for maintenance/consolidation will not exceed the dose the participant received during induction.

Treatment: drugs: Rituximab
Rituximab will be administered by IV infusion at a dose of 375 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6 during induction treatment and on Day 1 of every other month during consolidation treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-escalation study will
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab in combination with
      idasanutlin and venetoclax in participants with R/R FL and obinutuzumab or rituximab in
      combination with idasanutlin and venetoclax in participants with R/R DLBCL. The study will
      include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by an expansion phase. The dose-escalation
      phase is designed to determine the recommended phase II doses (RP2Ds) and regimen for
      idasanutlin and venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab for FL participants and in
      combination with rituximab for DLBCL participants.</summary>
