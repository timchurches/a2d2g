  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic groin pain is a frequent cause for referral to general surgeons. In some cases this
      pain may be due to the presence of a hernia. However, if on clinical examination there is no
      palpable lump or bulge, the cause of the pain may be difficult to elucidate. Some of these
      patients may have the diagnosis of sportsman's groin. Other names which have been attached to
      this condition include Gilmores groin and sportsmans hernia. These conditions are more
      commonly associated with sportsmen and women but those who do not play sport may also receive
      this diagnosis. Sportsman's groin is thought to be a syndrome of weakness of the posterior
      inguinal wall without a clinically recognisable hernia. Differing explanations for
      sportsman's groin include avulsion of the conjoint tendon from the pubic tubercle, weakening
      of the transversalis fascia, tears in the internal or external oblique, superficial inguinal
      ring dilatation and abnormalities of the rectus abdominus insertion.

      There is some evidence that pre peritoneal mesh placement in these patients may be
      beneficial. The theory being that the mesh prevents pressure transmission to the damages
      structures, allowing them to heal more rapidly.

      Aim. To assess the potential benefit of pre peritoneal mesh placement using the TAPP
      technique in patients with chronic groin pain.</summary>
