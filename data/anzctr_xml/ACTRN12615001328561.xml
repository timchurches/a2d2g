    <interventions>This is a multicentre (5 Australian sites), prospective, open label, single-arm phase II study. Overall 30 patients with non-functional GEP NETs with radiological disease progression during treatment with octreotide 30mg every 28 days will undergo therapy with increasing doses of pasireotide subject to imaging response.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dose escalating pasireotide LAR in patients with non-functional well differentiated NETs who had progressed whilst on octreotide 30mg/q28d.

There will be 2 dose levels (possibly 3) evaluated, with intra-patient dose escalation: 
Dose Level 1: Pasireotide LAR 40mg every 28 days
Dose Level 2: Pasireotide LAR 60mg every 28 days
Dose Level 3:  Subject to MTD of dose escalation phase I trial from Novartis, possibly 80-90mg.  (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01364415).

The mode of administration of Pasireotide will be via intramuscular injection and each dose  is given as a single dose every 28 days.  Patients will have there dose escalated to the next dose level only if there is evidence of disease progression.

The maximum duration of treatment with Pasireotide will be two years.  Patients will remain on treatment until disease progression.  Patients who continue on treatment and have not progressed when the study ends, will need to complete End of STudy assessments.

All doses will be given and supervised by study/hospital staff and any deviations to the study treatments will be notified to the study team.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory proof of concept study, thus 30 patients has been selected as a pragmatic sample size. With a sample size of 30 patients, the power to detect a difference of 11 months to 14.7 months in median survival is 36%, assuming 22 month accrual and 12 months follow up, one-sided test at significance level alpha=0.05. (It should be noted that a study with 80% power would require about 107 patients recruited in a similar time period  which is not feasible for this project). However, the study of 30 patients will have 80% power to detect a median survival of over 8.6 months  still of clinical interest.

Assessment of primary endpoint:  
Using Kaplan-Meier methodology, radiological PFS at 96 weeks will be estimated from the time of commencement of pasireotide 40mg LAR therapy until date of radiological progression at the maximum dose of pasireotide LAR or death from whatever cause, among all patients who began therapy. 

A close-out date will be applied. The close out date will generally be taken to be the earliest of the dates of last contact, at which the assessments relevant to the identification of the events were made, of the patients who are still alive and being followed up. Thus, with the exception of any patients who have been lost to follow-up, the status of all patients in the trial, regarding the events of interest, should be known at this date. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the percentage surviving at particular times, including 96 weeks, will be calculated using the logit transformation. Graphs will be prepared. A p-value will be reported to assess whether the median progression free survival is greater than 11 months.

Assessment of secondary endpoints:  
Descriptive statistics, (including number, percentage, exact 95% CIs, mean, median and range) will be used to summarise patient demographics (including patient demographics, medical history, physical examination, ECOG performance status), treatment compliance/dose intensity, laboratory data, toxicity reports (AEs by worst grade reported as per NCI CTCAE version 4. SAEs, changes in lab values and vital signs meeting CTCAE version 4 definitions for AEs) and response (ORR and DCR) assessed by Ga-DOTA-octreotate PET  and radiological response by the RECIST version 1.1 criteria.

Duration of response will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Change in target lesions volume and percentage change in chromogranin A from baseline will be analysed by means of descriptive statistics and graphical methods such as Box-&amp;-Whisker plots. If appropriate, a repeated measures analysis, using the method of residual maximum likelihood, will be used to compare the measures among patients separated into different groups.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of increasing doses of Pasireotide as a potential treatment after octreotide treatment has stopped working for refractory non-functional gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have been diagnosed with well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour which has shown disease progression after at least 3 months of long-acting release octreotide 30mg/28 days. 

Study details:
All participants in this study will receive an injection of Pasireotide once every 4 weeks. There are 3 dose levels: Level 1 = 40 mg, level 2 = 60 mg. The exact dose amount for Dose level 3 is currently being evaluated in another clinical trial and will be determined prior to this time. You will start on Dose level 1 (40 mg). Every 12 weeks you will have a CT/MRI scan. If your tumour is reducing or has not changed, you will stay on your current dose level as long as you are obtaining benefit and tolerating the treatment. If your GEP-NET has worsened, your dose will be increased to the next level. If the exact dose amount for Dose level 3 isnt defined in time or you are on Dose level 3 and your NET has continued to worsen, then you will stop study treatment. Researchers will measure disease progression and side effects to evaluate the efficacy of Pasireotide. It is hoped that this trial will provide information on whether Pasireotide is a safe and effective second line of treatment in patients with GEP-NET for whom the standard care therapy of Octreotide is not effective.

Pasireotide is being investigated as a potential treatment after octreotide treatment has stopped working. This study aims to learn about the effects that increasing doses of pasireotide have on your cancer.

Pasireotide is a hormonal agent that has greater ability to bind to the surface of NETs cells compared to octreotide. In other research studies, Pasireotide has been shown to slow the growth of NETs in patients previously treated with octreotide. Researchers do not yet know if increasing the dose of pasireotide allows for greater control of NET growth. 

Pasireotide is an experimental treatment. This means that it is not an approved treatment for NETs in Australia. Pasireotide is being developed by Novartis for the treatment of certain hormonal disorders, including acromegaly and functioning NETs of the pancreas or the gastrointestinal tract. </summary>
