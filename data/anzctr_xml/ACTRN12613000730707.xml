  <interventions>
    <interventions>5 hours of education, over 2 sessions with in 1 week, covering subjects including: importance of self management, psychology and pain, mindfulness, acceptance, basic neurophysiology of pain, medical perspective, energy conservation and sleep, exercise/ activity and pain. THe education will be delivered by Clinical Psychologist, Rehabilitation Consultant, Physiotherapist and Occupational Therapist. The aim of the education is to shift patients paragigm towards that of self-management rather than medical management, so that patients have more insight and control in choosing options in their management. At the end of the second session patients will be asked to indicate whether they wish to have consulation within the clinic; the next available appointment will be assigned to the patient. Measurements will be made at admission, 2 weeks following initial contact and at 3 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the research is to compare the established prectice of the Pain Clinic versus this intervention, consisiting of 5 hours of education to promote self management in persistent pain conditions. The study will be one of a randomised controlled trial pilot design; 2 care pathways; firstly usual care where patients will be assessed by a doctor and other allied health professionals. The intervention will be the education sessions followed by the option of patients attending clinic for consultations with the doctor and other health care professionals. The study will look at the research questions:
1. To see if pre-clinic education is a significant improved model of care compared with usual care,
2. To see the interaction between education sessions and medial intervention,
3. To monitor the changes in patients self management over time.</summary>
