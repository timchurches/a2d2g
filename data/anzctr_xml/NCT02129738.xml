  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate and document real life safety and satisfaction of
      re-use of urethral catheters for intermittent self catheterization. The study will collect
      re-used catheters from included patients and compare those to a control group with regard to
      bacterial contamination and mechanical properties. A four week prospective evaluation will
      follow where the patients will be given catheters intended for single-use.</summary>
