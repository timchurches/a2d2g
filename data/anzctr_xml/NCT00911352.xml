No Intervention: No frozen glove therapy - Usual care


Treatment: devices: Frozen gel glove (Elasto-Gel Mitten)
Gel glove is frozen for &gt; 3 hours at -5 to -30Â°C prior to use. Each patient wears a triple glove set (surgical glove overlaid with cotton glove, overlaid with gel glove) on their intervention hand. Gloves are worn for duration of infusion (15 mins pre, 60 minutes intratreatment and 15 mins post) to ensure the patients' peripheries are vasoconstricted on commencement of the infusion and for enough time afterwards to ensure circulating drug does not reach the target area. Because of the duration of the infusion, more than one gel glove will be used successively (for 45 minutes each) to maintain a consistently low temperature on the hand and nails.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Between 30% and 88% of chemotherapy patients receiving docetaxel experience side effects of
      the hand ranging from skin and nail disfigurement, blistering, desquamation, pain, infection,
      and impaired treatment-related quality of life and function. Preliminary data indicate that
      nurse-initiated cryotherapy during treatment may lower the incidence and severity of these
      side effects, but several issues should be addressed before this intervention is implemented
      in hospital settings. These include more rigorous study design, larger sampling frames, and
      consideration of infection control concerns. This study will address these issues, thereby
      rigorously evaluating the safety and efficacy of nurse-initiated cryotherapy at Princess
      Alexandra Hospital.</summary>
