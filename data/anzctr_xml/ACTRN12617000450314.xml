  <interventions>
    <interventions>The procedure is to cannulate internal jugular vein either with the technique of novel real time needle guidance or conventional ultrasound method. Novel real time needle guidance is based on an electromagnetic field that communicates with a transducer and an electromagnetic sensor sheathed by a vascular access needle. Needle movements and related magnetic field variation allow navigation system to compute the location of the transducer and needle. And when the probe and needle which is sheathed with the electromagnetic sensor are placed onto the patient, the target box and trajectory pathway will appear on the screen. Hence with this navigation system, the operator will be able to advance the needle into the target box (cross sectional of vein). 
In contrary to this, the conventional ultrasound technique is devoid of the navigation system. The medical officer will complete the procedure, at they will be at least one year of experience in anaesthesia. The procedure will take about 20 to 30 seconds </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>the sample size was determined by using power study. It was performed using web base sample size calculator (http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html). Considering 90% power and 1% marginal error (type error for alpha value = 0.01 ). This study gives a minimum sample size of 47 per group (based on the median and IQR values obtained from a study reference~Yunseok Jeon, Seungpyo Choi, Heechan Kim. Evaluation of a simplified augmented reality device for ultrasound-guided vascular access in a vascular phantom. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia 2014,485-489) Hence, I will use 50 per group in my study </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will be single centre, prospective, randomized controlled trial involving patient undergoing central venous line insertion in intensive care unit in UMMC from April till August 2016. Participants will be the doctors in anaesthesia with at least a year of clinical experience, and classified as more than a year, more than 2 years, more than 3 years and more than 4 years. Participants are to perform cannulating internal jugular vein access via out of plane method using either NUS or CUS for the patients. Each participant will receive a standardized 5 minute verbal introduction to the GPS technology with navigated ultrasound (NUS), testing of device using phantom blue gel is allowed before participation. Consent is taken either from the patient or the next of kin. Emergency verbal consent is obtained if the next of kin is not immediately available. The participants are randomized to either using NUS or CUS. Procedure time from needle penetration into skin to achieving vascular access was measured in seconds using a stopwatch. The time measurement begins from grasping the USG probe to successful vessel puncture as indicated by blood withdrawn into the syringe. Primary outcome measures are visualization of blood aspirate into syringe, total time to successful puncture of the vessel and the cumulative success. Any complication arise from this procedure will be assessed and documented.</summary>
