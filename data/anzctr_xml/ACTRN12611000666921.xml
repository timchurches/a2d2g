  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug called gabapentin for the treatment of acute pain syndrome associated with chemotherapy in women with breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are a woman aged 18 years or more with early stage breast cancer for which you have had surgery. You must also plan to undergo chemotherapy treatment with the drug, docetaxel. Women who have pre-existing pain prior to chemotherapy will not be eligible.

Trial details
In this study, participants will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive either the drug, gabapentin, or a placebo (sham) tablet during their second cycle of chemotherapy treatment. Gabapentin is a drug used to treat nerve pain. The dose of  Gabapentin is 300mg three times a day, orally, starting the day before chemotherapy, for 6 days in total. On the third cycle of chemotherapy treatment, participants will be given the alternate treatment (i.e. gabapentin or placebo). Participants will not know whether they are taking the active or sham treatment. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires rating their pain levels for a week after chemotherapy. They will also be monitored for safety.

It is hoped that gabapentin will reduce the aches and pains in muscles and joints which are commonly experienced by women receiving the chemotherapy drug, docetaxel.</summary>
