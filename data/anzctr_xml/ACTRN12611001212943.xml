  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each dose of RV3-BB rotavirus vaccine is 1ml sterile cell-free aqueous solution for oral administration, containing RV3-BB live naturally attenuated human rotavirus particles (at a concentration of 8.3E6 FFU/ml), in cell culture medium containing 10% sucrose.

Neonatal Schedule Arm participants will receive three 1ml doses of RV3-BB rotavirus vaccine, with the 1st dose administered at 0-5 days of age, followed by doses at approximately 9 weeks of age and approximately 15 weeks of age. To maintain blinding with the infant schedule arm, the participants in this arm will receive a 1ml dose of placebo at the end of the treatment period (approximately 23 weeks of age).

Infant Schedule Arm participants will receive three 1ml doses of RV3-BB rotavirus vaccine, with the 1st dose administered at approximately 9 weeks of age, followed by doses at approximately 15 weeks of age and approximately 23 weeks of age. To maintain blinding with the neonatal schedule arm, participants in this arm will receive a 1ml dose of placebo at 0-5 days of age.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo. 
Each placebo dose is 1ml cell culture medium with 10% sucrose. Sterile aqueous cell-free solution for oral administration.

Participants in the Placebo Arm will receive 4 doses of placebo, with the 1st dose administered at 0-5 days of age, followed by doses at approximately 9 weeks of age, approximately 15 weeks of age and approximately 23 weeks of age.</comparator>

    <concealment>A computer-generated list of randomization codes will be supplied to the pharmacist involved in the study. At the point of enrolment, the investigator (or delegate) will call the pharmacist and ask for the next randomisation number on the list. That will be the participant number, which will be announced by the pharmacist to the investigator. The investigator and delegates will not be aware of the treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation will be computer generated (by a statistician outside of the study team) using block randomisation, providing allocations for 120 participants in order to accommodate replacement of participants in the event of withdrawal prior to investigational product administration. Randomisation will be stratified by multiple births (single vs multiple).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A phase I clinical trial completed in Melbourne in 2011 found the RV3-BB vaccine to be well-tolerated in adults, children and babies 6-8 weeks of age. The aim of this phase IIa trial is to determine the extent of the immune response (or protection) that is created in babies receiving the vaccine. We are including newborn babies in this trial, as we believe receiving this vaccine at birth will offer the earliest and possibly greatest protection.  We are inviting 93 Dunedin families, with newborn babies to take part in this trial.  
 
Each of the babies will be randomly assigned to groups, so that two thirds of the babies will receive 3 doses of oral RV3 vaccine and one third of the babies will receive oral doses of placebo. In total each babys involvement will include 7 visits, with the first visit in the first 5 days of the babys life, and the final visit at approximately 6 months of age.</summary>
