  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>DMD Subject Inclusion Criteria

          -  Affected subjects must be male and between the ages of 2 and 30

          -  Affected subjects between the ages of 2 and 4 must have a diagnosis of DMD confirmed
             by at least one the following OR have an older male sibling that meet at least one of
             the following criteria:

               -  Dystrophin immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot showing complete dystrophin
                  deficiency, and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy OR

               -  Gene deletion test positive (missing one or more exons) in the central rod domain
                  exons 25-60) of dystrophin, where reading frame can be predicted as
                  'out-of-frame',and clinical picture consistent with typical Duchenne dystrophy.

               -  Complete dystrophin gene sequencing showing an alteration (point mutation,
                  duplication, other) that is expected to preclude production of the dystrophin
                  protein(i.e. nonsense mutation, deletion/duplication leading to a downstream stop
                  codon),with a typical clinical picture of DMD.

          -  Affected subjects between the ages of 5 and 30 must either fulfill the above criteria
             OR show evidence of a dystrophinopathy and clinical picture consistent with Duchenne
             Muscular Dystrophy

               -  Participants who have documented clinical symptoms referable to a
                  dystrophinopathy and direct support of the diagnosis by either (1) a positive DNA
                  analysis for dystrophin mutation, (2) a muscle biopsy demonstrating abnormal
                  dystrophin, or (3) an elevated CK (&gt;5X normal), and X-linked pedigree and an
                  affected family member who meets either criterion (1) or (2) as described above.

        NOTE: Determination of the appropriate clinical symptoms consistent with DMD will generally
        be the responsibility of the clinician. At a minimum this will include progressive loss of
        function, with additional consideration for other clinical features such as a
        characteristic gait, a positive Gower sign and calf pseudohypertrophy. When immunostaining
        of muscle biopsy is used to determining case definition, the clinical reviewer (site PI)
        should confirm that appropriate testing has ruled out a secondary deficiency of dystrophin.
        Affected subjects that do not exhibit the above symptoms consistent with DMD should be
        excluded.

        o Muscle weakness prevalent by 5 years of age

        - Non-affected adult subjects must be Parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of an eligible
        affected subject.

        DMD Serum Biomarker Inclusion Criteria

          -  Participants must meet eligibility criteria for the DMD phenotyping portion of this
             study

          -  For the GC-treatment response cohort, participants must initiate GC treatment within
             the first year of study participation (i.e. between their first study visit and their
             one year follow-up visit)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to establish the largest long-term assessment of people with
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this study, the investigators associated with the
      Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group CINRG) will take a detailed look (for
      a minimum of eight years) at DMD participant's physical abilities, the medical problems they
      experience, and how they use health care services. Physical abilities will be compared to a
      group of healthy controls.

      The second purpose of this study is to find out whether small, normal differences in the
      genetic makeup of people with DMD (called "single nucleotide polymorphisms" or "SNPs") affect
      how their disease progresses and relates to muscle strength/size and steroid response.

      The third purpose of this study is to study genetic variations associated with DMD.

      The final purpose of this study is to determine whether certain biomarkers are present in
      people with DMD and not in healthy controls.</summary>
