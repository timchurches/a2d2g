    <interventions>Brief Triple P Online is a low intensity, self-administered online parenting program. It is designed to promote positive parenting practices and uses the flexibility of the internet to enhance parents learning experiences. It incorporates elements designed to engage participants and improve knowledge acquisition, positive self-efficacy, and behaviour activation. These elements include: i) user friendly navigation; ii) video-based modelling of parenting skills; iii) personalised content; iv) interactive exercises to prompt parental problem solving, decision making and self-regulation. Cultural sensitivity is achieved through the use of multicultural video models and a self-regulatory framework that enables parents to select goals informed by their own values, beliefs, and traditions.
Users receive personal log-in details and complete the online program on their home computers/tablets in their own time. The 5 program modules take between 20-30 minutes each to complete and parents have access to the program for 8 weeks. The module topics cover some of the most common issues presented by parents. The first module introduces positive parenting strategies and makes parents aware of parent traps. The remaining modules focus on behaviour specific (disobedience, fighting) and setting specific (out of home) application of this knowledge. </interventions>
    <comparator>A computer-use-as-usual waitlist control design will be applied whereby half of the parents will be randomly allocated to wait 11 months before accessing the intervention. Participants of the control group are free to search the internet for useful parenting information during the waiting time.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Observed and parent-reported child behavioural and emotional problems, as assessed using direct observation of child behaviour by researchers, the Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory, and the Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale (CAPES; Morawska &amp; Sanders, 2010). The CAPES consists of 30 items rated on a 4-point scale (0 = not true of my child at all to 3 = true of my child very much, or most of the time). Twenty six items assess behaviour concerns (e.g., My child rudely answers back to me) and behavioural competencies (Behaviour Scale; e.g., My child accepts rules and limits), and four items assess emotional adjustment (Emotional Adjustment Scale; e.g., My child worries).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then 8 weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be immediately after completion of the online program. Families will be assessed a final time after 9 months (time 3). Upon completion of the final assessment families in the control group receive access to the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use of observed and parent-reported effective and ineffective parenting practices, as assessed using the Parenting Scale and direct observation of parent behaviour by researchers.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 8 weeks and 9 months after completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental efficacy as measured by the CAPES (Morawska &amp; Sanders, 2010). The Efficacy Scale measures parents' level of confidence in managing child emotional and behavioural problems and consists of 20 items rated on a 10-point scale (from 1 = certain I can't do it to 10 = certain I can do it).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 8 weeks and 9 months after completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental adjustment as assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, and Parental Anger, using the Parental Anger Inventory which assesses anger experienced in response to to child-related situations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 8 weeks and 9 months after completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For two-parent households, conflict over parenting is assessed using the Parent Problem Checklist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 8 weeks and 9 months after completion of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parents are asked to indicate their current level of concern regarding a number of child behaviours (11 behaviours e.g., disobedience, mealtimes problems, homework) on a scale from 1 = not at all concerned to 4= very much concerned. They also indicate their confidence in successfully dealing with these behaviours on a scale from 1 = certain I can't do it to 10 = certain I can do it.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 8 weeks and 9 months after completion of the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While evidence-based parenting programs have been shown to be effective for the treatment of child conduct problems, their effective dissemination is a major challenge for the field. Online interventions can increase the reach and accessibility of parenting support, and reduce the prevalence of child behaviour problems. This study aims to evaluate a brief online parenting program for parents of children with conduct problems. It is expected that program completion of the intervention has the potential to reduce ineffective and coercive parenting practices, and lead to improved child behavioural and emotional adjustment and better family wellbeing. </summary>
