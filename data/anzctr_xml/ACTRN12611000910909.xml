    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through an advertisement which will refer potential participants to their treating physician for screening. Physicians will be asked to screen persons for DSM-IV-TR criterion for schizophrenia; current aggression risk; ability to consent. Physicians will be provided with a phone number to contact investigators. Investigators will contact the potential participant for a prelimninary interview. Informed consent will be obtained and pregnancy testing conducted prior to inclusion in the trial. Participants will be allocated a study number for trial identification purposes.

The capsules for the intervention will be manufactured by a compounding pharmacy and transported to the clinical trials pharmacist in opaque jars. The clinical trials pharmacist will be responsible for conducting the study blinding and central randomization, labelling for clinical trials and sealing of containers. The clinical trial pharmacist will distribute the allocated intervention to the investigator for delivery to the potential participant simutaneously with induction completion and in sequencial order. 

The investigator who is conducting the trial induction and the participant, will be blinded to the type of intervention until after data analysis, unless there is an urgent medical contraindication.</concealment>
    <sequence>The generation of the sequence allocation will be by computer tables. The sequence will be kept in a locked cupboard by the clinical pharmacist until data analysis is completed.</sequence>
