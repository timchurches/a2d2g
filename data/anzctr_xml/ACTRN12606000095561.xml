    <inclusivecriteria>Previous studies show that nearly 100% of patients with asthma also have a nasal inflammation (rhinitis) as part of their generalised airway inflammation, but not all asthma patients have symptoms from their nose. This study, however, evaluates if antiinflammatory treatment of the nose have an effect on sleep, regardless of nasal symptoms or not.Inclusion: medically diagnosed asthma.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A majority of patients with asthma has nasal inflammation but it is not always diagnosed and treated. Nasal inflammation cause sleep disturbances that can be improved by treatment with nasal steroid spray. It has not been studied before if treatment with nasal steroids can improve sleep in patients with asthma. We will investigate 30 patients with asthma to see if their "quality of sleep" and "quality of life" can be improved by treament with nasal steroid spray compared to placebo.</summary>
