    <concealment>Enrollment is decided and permission of the patient is obtained by two of the anesthesiologists during preoperative rounding,.This is a double blinded clinical trial, with blinding of both the patient and the administrating practitioner to the anaesthetic type. Allocation will be managed by a Resident external to the project. The blinding will occur through use of equal amounts of pretreatment drugs (2mlâ€™s) Each syringe will be labeled A ,B,C,D orE according to its contents.
. The drug syringes are handed over to anesthesiologists blinded to the patient allocation to carry out the induction of anesthesia</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: Injection pain and hypotension are two main adverse effects of propofol which 

distresses patient. The aim of this prospective double blind study was to compare the effect 

of ephedrine  -lidocaine    combination  with lidocaine and ephedrine on injection pain and 

hemodynamic changes due to propofol induction.

Methods:  165adult patients, aged 20 to 60 yr, Patients were randomly allocated to one of 5

groups (33 patients per group): lidocaine  0.5 mg/kg(L) ,ephedrine  30microgram/kg (E30), ephedrine 70microgram/kg(E70), lidocaine0.5mg/kg -ephedrine30 microgram/kg(LE) or  2ml saline (S) intravenously.After one minute propofol 
2 mg/kg into a dorsal hand vein was injected. Face pain scale and verbal rating scale, arterial 

blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before induction, just before intubation, and one 

minute after intubation.</summary>
