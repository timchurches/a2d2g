  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study intervention arm is a combined exercise and nutritional program.  It comprises a 12-week physical activity (PA) program of two supervised, tailored 60-minute strength-based exercise sessions in group format per week, a standardised oral nutritional supplement high in protein (Resource Protein, 200ml bottle, which contains 18.8g protein per bottle) immediately following each exercise session (twice weekly), and high-strength fish oil supplements on a daily basis (2g of EPA/day)].  The exercise session will be supervised by an accredited Exercise Physiologist.
Log of exercise attendance, exercise log, visual inspection of oral nutritional supplement consumption and capsule counting to monitor adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Exercise, oral supplement and fish oil intervention arm versus standard treatment arm

Standard treatment arm receive usual care (which may or may not include anti-cancer treatment) as provided by their treating oncologist and team. 

During the study period, if participant(s) from either arm are deemed to be malnourished by their treating team, they may be reviewed by a dietitian and receive additional oral nutritional supplements as part of standard care. Use of additional oral nutritional supplements will be documented.

    <concealment>Pre-randomisation evaluation focuses on patients eligibility for the study.  Once they are deemed eligible they will be required to give written informed consent. Baseline assessments will then be completed prior to randomisation.   Randomisation will be on a 2:1 in favour of the intervention and will be set-up by the studyâ€™s biostatistician. Randomisation of participants will be managed by research staff independent of the study, they will be contacted via telephone to randomise the patient and provide treatment allocation</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a combined nutritional and exercise intervention in patients with inoperable gastrointestinal (GI) or lung cancer, who are at risk of developing cancer cachexia. The ultimate aim is to determine whether the combined intervention prevents or slows progression of cancer cachexia, and improves performance status, nutritional status, and quality of life. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 or over, have advanced incurable upper gastrointestinal cancer (including gastric, pancreatic, biliary), or lung cancer, and a BMI of 20 or higher. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly chosen (by chance) to receive either standard treatment or the nutrition and exercise intervention program. The program involves completing two supervised 1 hour strength-based exercise sessions per week, taking a high protein nutritional supplement drink after each exercise session and taking daily fish oil supplement tablets. The program will last for 12 weeks. Outcomes will be measured at 6 weeks and 12 weeks into the program, and at 6 months. Participants will complete a number of questionnaires, will be asked to keep a 3-day food diary and complete strength and walking tests. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information on the efficacy and feasibility of the nutrition and exercise intervention in cancer patients, with the hope that it will slow or prevent the development of cachexia in these individuals.</summary>
