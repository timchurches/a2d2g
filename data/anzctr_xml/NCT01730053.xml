Active Comparator: Rosuvastatin 20 mg - Participants, who were receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally at baseline, received rosuvastatin 20 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally once daily (QD), placebo for alirocumab SC injection every two weeks (Q2W), and placebo for ezetimibe over-encapsulated tablet orally QD added to stable Lipid-Modifying Therapy (LMT) for 24 weeks.

Active Comparator: Ezetimibe 10 mg + Rosuvastatin 10 mg - Participants, who were receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally at baseline, received ezetimibe 10 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally QD, rosuvastatin 10 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally QD, and placebo for alirocumab SC injection Q2W added to stable LMT for 24 weeks.

Experimental: Alirocumab 75 mg/up to 150 mg + Rosuvastatin 10 mg - Participants, who were receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally at baseline, received alirocumab 75 mg SC injection Q2W, rosuvastatin 10 mg over-encapsulated tablet orally QD, and placebo for ezetimibe over-encapsulated tablet orally QD added to stable LMT for 24 weeks.
