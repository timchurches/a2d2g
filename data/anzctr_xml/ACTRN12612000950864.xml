  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been designed to test the efficacy and safety of an 8 week regimen of subcutaneous teriparatide. A prospective randomised double-blinded placebo-controlled study design will be used. There will be a one-year follow up period. During the intervention and follow up phases, participants will undergo dental examinations, biochemical and radiological investigations, as well as a quality of life questionnaire.</summary>
