  <interventions>
    <interventions>A prototype mHealth (mobile phone and internet-delivered) weight management programme. The programme will be delivered to participants for 8 weeks. Topics covered include nutritional and physical activity information and behavioural support. Text messages will be sent via mobile phone 3 times daily for the first 1-2 weeks, then twice daily for the remainder of the programme. Additionally, a few data collection question texts will be sent to participants.  Participants are able to log on to the study website as they wish (this is not a requirement of the study).  On the website, participants can view their individual progress compared with the group, as well as view and contribute to an online blog, and view other study resources (also provided hard copy to participants).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This feasibility study aims to develop and pre-test an mHealth weight loss programme. 50 volunteers will be recruited from the community and given the prototype programme for 8 weeks. The programme will use mobile phones and internet to provide information (e.g related to nutrition and physical activity) and behavioural strategies to achieve weight loss and maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle.  The primary aim is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the programme (as measured by weight loss at 12 weeks).</summary>
