Experimental: Experimental: ZORBLISA (SD-101 cream ) - All subjects will apply ZORBLISA (SD-101-6.0%) cream topically, once a day to the entire body for a period of up to 1440 days (48 months).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Demonstrate continued long term safety of Zorblisa assessed via monitoring of local tolerability at the application sites, occurrence of adverse events and physical examinations. Results will be summarized - The primary objective is to demonstrate the longterm safety of ZORBLISA in patients, with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa. Results will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics to be used include proportion of patients with complete closure of their target lesion at each visit, mean and standard deviation of BSAI compared with baseline at each visit, and incidence rates of specific adverse events. Additional evaluations may be made to compare responses of patients in this extension study with their responses in SD-005. For those patients randomized to SD-101-6.0 in SD-005, the use of summary statistics as described in the previous paragraph will provide an understanding of the long term effect of SD-101-6.0 in these patients. For those patients randomized to the control arm in SD-005, summary statistics will be used to compare their response to SD-101-6.0 in SD-006 with their response to control in SD-005.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in Body Surface Area (BSA) of lesional skin and wound burden using BSAI - The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of ZORBLISA in terms of the change in Body Surface Area (BSA) of lesional skin and wound burden; as well as closure of unhealed target wounds from the SD-005 study. Change in lesional skin based on BSA estimates compared to Baseline will be measured using the Body Surface Area Index (BSAI). Change in total body wound coverage based on BSA estimates compared to Baseline will be measured using the BSAI.</outcome>
