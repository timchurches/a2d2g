  <interventions>
    <interventions>The WISH Project is a prospective cohort study that will collect neonatal and maternal outcome data associated with very preterm birth occurring in the years 2011 to 2013. The WISH Project is focussed on observing outcomes associated with the increasing implementation of the 2010 National Clinical Practice Guidelines regarding antenatal magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus, infant and child. The WISH Project is also observing more generally the antenatal care of women who present with very preterm labour. 

The outcomes that will be observed in this study will include rates of cerebral palsy, perinatal mortality and other complications of prematurity in babies born very preterm. Observations will also be made about the antenatal care of women who present with preterm labour, including corticosteroid, antibiotic and tocolytic use.

Data will be obtained from medical records and from the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network Data Collection.  As part of dissemination of the National Clincial Practice Guidelines: "Antenatal Magnesium Sulphate Prior to Preterm Birth for Neuroprotection of the Fetus, Infant and Child", posters, information sheets, powerpoint presentations and case note reminder inserts may be used as strategies for implementation.</interventions>

      <outcome>Maternal adverse events related to administration of magnesium sulphate therapy (nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, hypotension, tachycardia, admission to ICU, flushing, headache, diarrhoea, dizziness, drowsiness, need to be given calcium gluconate).  These outcomes will be collected from medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In 2011, 2012 and 2013.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maternal adverse events sufficient to stop therapy. Possible adverse effects include: nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, hypotension, tachycardia, admission to ICU, flushing, headache, diarrhoea, dizziness, drowsiness, need to be given calcium gluconate. These events will be assessed by the clinicians involved in the care of the women. The information will then be accessed from maternal case notes.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall aims of this project are to optimise the care of women at risk of an early preterm birth and so improve the chances of survival and long term good health for their preterm babies. 

The project will provide data from a cohort of mothers and their babies born early that will allow monitoring of the use of a new therapy for the prevention of cerebral palsy, as well as the assessment of changes in mortality and morbidity. It will also provide clinical indicators for care that can be used for quality improvement within participating hospitals.

The specific aims of this project are to nationally monitor and improve uptake of the use of antenatal magnesium sulphate as a neuroprotective therapy immediately prior to imminent (birth planned or definitely expected within 24 hours) early preterm birth (less than 30 weeks gestation) to reduce the risk of the baby dying or having cerebral palsy.</summary>
