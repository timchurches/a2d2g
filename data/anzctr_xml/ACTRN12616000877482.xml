  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study, tracking muscle mass and strength during standard of care chemotherapy treatment. The muscle mass will  be measured on standard of care CT scans. Muscle function will be assessed using grip strength measurement (1 minute) and peak expiratory flow measurement (2 minutes). An anorexia questionnaire will also be provided (2 minutes)</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Number of participants required was determined using a power calculation, based on a similar study, which examined breast cancer patients on Capcitabine. This calculation was based of a power or 20%, and effect size of 30%, and a p value &lt;0.05 required to be deemed statistically significant. All data will be analysed using GraphPad Prism 6 for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Categorical data will be assessed for statistical significance using Chi square test. Continuous data will be tested for normality using DAgostino &amp; Pearson omnibus normality test. When only two groups of data are being compared the unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test will used. The unpaired t-test, with Welchs correction to allow for comparison of groups with different standard deviations, will be used for data with Gaussian distribution (parametric data), and the Mann-Whitney test will be used for analysis of non-parametric data. When there are more than two groups being compared the ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA will be used. Parametric data was analysed using an ordinary one-way ANOVA and non-parametric data will be analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA. When a significant result was determined from either ANOVA test, the unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used, depending of distribution of the data, to compare each of the groups. For all analysis, a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the link between body composition and outcomes in pancreatic cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma within the last month. Study details All participants enrolled in this study will complete a number of assessments including hand grip strength testing, a questionnaire and lung function tests at enrolment and 3 and 6 months later. The researchers will also require access to CT scans which have been collected as a part of your cancer management. It is hoped that the findings from this study will inform researchers on the links between muscle mass and function, and cancer outcomes of chemotherapy toxicity and survival.</summary>
