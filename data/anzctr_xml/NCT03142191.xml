    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life - Saint George's Respiratory - The SGRQ is a quality of life health questionnaire that has been validated in IPF. It consists of 76 items in three domains:
Symptoms
Activity
Impact of disease on daily life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life- University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD- SOBQ) - The UCSD-SOBQ is a 24-item dyspnea questionnaire that asks subjects to rate themselves from 0 ("Not at all") to 5 ("Maximally or unable to do because of breathlessness") in two areas: 1) how short of breath they are while performing various activities (21 items); and 2) how much shortness of breath, fear of hurting themselves by overexerting, and fear of shortness of breath limit them in their daily lives (3 items).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 2, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study evaluating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), quality of life and exploratory
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of two treatment doses of CC-90001, 200 mg and 400 mg, compared with
      placebo, when delivered once daily per os (PO) in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
      (IPF). This study is designed to assess response to treatment by using measures of lung
      function, disease progression, fibrosis on radiography, and patient-reported outcomes. It
      will also assess dose response.</summary>
