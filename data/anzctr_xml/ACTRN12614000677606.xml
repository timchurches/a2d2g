  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with end stage renal failure, undergoing dialysis (in hospital or at home), will be invited to participate. Consenting participants will complete a questionnaire about pruritis (itching). Participants will
complete the Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Food Frequency Questionnaire with an Investigator in a face to face interview. Participants will also complete a 3day
dietary recall and Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PGSGA) during the interview. Blood samples will also be taken at baseline and post intervention to measure C reactive protein and red blood cell fatty acid status.
Also a doubleblinded, randomised placebo controlled
trial will be conducted where each participant will be
assigned to receive one of three capsule types:
* evening primrose oil (omega 6 fatty acids)
*fish oil (omega 3 fatty acids)
*placebo (vegetable oil)
Patients will be randomised to receive 1 of 3 interventions:
1. Active- Evening Primrose Oil, 1gram three times a day, each capsule contains 100mg of gamma-Linolenic acid 
2. Active - Omega -3 Fish oil,1 gram three times a day - each capsule contains 53mg EPA and 250mg DHA, with total omega-3 = 348mg
The patients will be asked to take three capsules each day for 4 months.
Adherence will be monitored by capsule count at the end of the study as well as monitoring of the red cell fatty acid levels. Efficacy of the active groups will be assessed by response to itching, inflammatory markers . </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo- Vegetable oil,1 gram three times a day, each capsule contains 790mg oleic acid (monounsaturated oil) and 110mg linoleic acid (omega-6 fatty acid)
The duration of the study is 4 months,and 3 capsules will be required to be taken daily in each arm of the study.
Efficacy of the active groups will be assessed by response to itching and inflammatory markers . Adherence will be monitored by capsule count at the end of the studyand levels of red blood cell free fatty acids.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does Evening Primrose Oil supplementation in End stage renal failure patients improve pruritis compared with omega 3?
Itch will be assessed using three methods- the visual analogue scale, rule of nines and questions involving quality of life. These are questions used specifically for itching and this is not a validated questionnaire.
The first 2 methods are both validated in assessment of itch.</outcome>
      <timepoint>this will be assessed at 4 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Determine the red blood cell omega 3 status of patients with end stage renal failure.
  Samples will be analysed by flame-ionisation gas chromatography (model GC-17A, Shimadzu) using a 50m x 0.25mm internal diameter capillary column.  One microlitre of the sample was auto-injected into the column, and individual fatty acids were quantified using the Shimadzu analysis software . Fatty acid peaks are identified by comparison with known fatty acid standards and quantitated by comparison to the internal standard (Nu-chek and Sigma).</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Examine whether or not there is an association between omega 3 status and pruritis.
This will be a statistical analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Assess the effect of omega 3 supplementation (using fish oil) on markers of inflammation (C reactive
protein) using a serum assay, standardised in hospital laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Examine the diet quality of a cohort of end stage renal failure patients, particularly intake of polyunsaturated fatty
acids.

Using the Polyunsaturated
Fatty Acid Food Frequency Questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>

      <outcome>Validate the Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Food Frequency Questionnaire in an end stage renal failure population.

      <timepoint>4 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the dietary intake of end stage renal failure patients to current evidence based practice, renal dietary guidelines, assessed  via 3 day
dietary recall  and via Patient Generated
Subjective Global Assessment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pruritis is a common symptom in patients on dialysis and has significant impact on their quality of life.
The pathophysiology is not well understood and treatments are not very effective.
Evening Primrose Oil has been used successfully in eczema and small studies suggest it may be of benefit in uraemic pruritis.This study is designed to investigate whether in fact Evening Primrose oil does has a beneficial effect on pruritis.</summary>
