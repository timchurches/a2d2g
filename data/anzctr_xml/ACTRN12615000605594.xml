  <interventions>
    <interventions>A small container of medical grade silicone oil (dimethyl silicone fluid) with a viscosity of 350 centistokes is used to immerse the operated hand into for 20 minutes while a series of finger exercises are completed.  The intervention commences on day 3 after finger contracture release surgery and terminates at 14 days post surgery when wound healing is achieved. The exercises are taught at the first visit in a single 45 minute session with the physiotherapist. The patient is instructed to make a full fist as able, hold, then slowly straighten the fingers.  Repeat this slowly for 10 repetitions, then rest for 2 minutes. Repeat the above routine 4 times, during the total immersion period of 20 minutes once daily. The patient will have the container of oil at home with them.
The patient will complete a treatment diary to monitor the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group will perform the same protocol of exercises for 20 minutes per day, from day 3-14 post-operatively at home without using an immersion medium.
This treatment constitutes usual care.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will provided with a written information sheet and have an opportunity to ask questions at a pre-operative appointment. Written informed consent documents will be completed at this point to enroll a participant into the study. The assessment will be conducted at the physiotherapy clinic in the week prior to the patients scheduled surgery.The physiotherapy practice receptionist will allocate participants to either Group I or Group II when they phone to book their first appointment. Allocation to the two groups - Group I (usual care-without SO) or Group II ( usual care with SO) will be carried out by the receptionist whereby the sequentially numbered sealed envelopes will determine which arm of the study the participant enters into. </concealment>
    <sequence>Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes will be used that contain the allocation sequence generated from the website Randomisation.com.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>An RCT to investigate feasibility, treatment fidelity and patient satisfaction when SO is randomly assigned into a post-operative home based hand exercise program. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Base line demographics and characteristics of participants will be analyzed with descriptive statistics. The mean SEGUE scores will be compared between study Group I and Group II to evaluate the degree of uniformity in delivery of both interventions using independent t-tests.
How receptive the patient is to the intervention will be assessed using the numerical rating scale for pain, and the Likert scale for level of difficulty.  A comparison between the intervention groups I and II will be made using independent t-tests to identify if the SO intervention was thought to be significantly more difficult, or painful, from the patient perspective. Enactment will be measured by comparing patient diaries with the protocol for daily exercises and number of minutes spent in oil for variances from the protocol. The number of finger flexion and extensions will be counts from video footage compared to the number specified in the protocol and will be analyzed using a t-test.
Acceptability of Intervention from the patient perspective will be determined by the satisfaction survey CSQ-8. Independent t tests between the 2 study groups will be performed to identify if a significant difference exists. Free text from the open ended questions will be analyzed by grouping the data into clusters and themes then classified by frequencies. Qualitative data collected from the focus group will be analyzed using the same method. Quality of life questionnaires (MHOQ and URAM) will be analyzed using t tests.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is assess the feasibility of using silicone oil (SO) for home based hand exercises for the rehabilitation following surgical release of Dupuytrens contracture in the fingers. The study hypothesis states that there will be no difference in patient satisfaction or the actual  exercises performed whether silicone oil is used or not used.</summary>
