  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will use a sequential, comparision group design.  In the first part of the study, a cohort will be recruited into  a Usual Care group (n=25).  The Usual Care group will be delivered standard care for children experiencing cumulative stress and trauma as a result of multiple co-existing and/or recurrent family stress in addition to childhood illness.  The Usual Care group will complete standardised measures (at entry to study and 6 months post-discharge),  participate in qualitative interviews (at discharge from hospital and 6 months post-discharge) and an audit of the child's medical file will be conducted (at discharge from hospital and 6 months post-discharge).

In the second part of the study, a second cohort will be recruited into an Enhanced Care group (n=25).

The Enhanced Care cohort will receive the following intervention:
1) A comprehensive psycho-social assessment conducted by the Hospital Social Work Department.  This assessment will assess the following domains:  family history; family functioning; personal history of parent/s; childs developmental history; parent-child relationship; family networks and supports including past Department of Human Services (DHS) - Child Protection involvement.  The assessment will be conducted by interviewing the parents of the child, and the child, as appropriate.  The assessment will be conducted within 24 hours of recruitment to the study (approximately sixty to ninety minutes duration).


2) A comprehensive medical and developmental assessment conducted by forensic paediatric specialists within 24 hours of recruitment to the study.  The assessment will include both an interview with parents and medical/developmental assessment of the child (approximately sixty to ninety minutes in  duration).

3) The comprehensive psychosocial assessment and the comprehensive medical and developmental assessment wil be discussed in a  multi-disciplinary evaluation and planning meeting attended by Unit medical, nursing and allied health staff as well that the specialist from the Victorian Forensic Paediatric Medical Service who conducted the comprehensive medical and developmental assessment  and the social worker who conducted the comprehensive psychosocial assessment (approximately 30-45 minutes duration).  

4) The recommendations of the multi-disciplinary evaluation and planning meeting will be discussed with the family in a  formal family case planning meeting where a individualised plan for the child and family will be devised (approximately sixty to ninety minutes duration).

The Enhanced Care group will complete standardised measures (at entry to study and 6 months post-discharge),  participate in qualitative interviews (at discharge from hospital and 6 months post-discharge) and an audit of the child's medical file will be conducted (at discharge from hospital and 6 months post-discharge).

The overall duration of the study will be 12 months to 18 months, dependent on the recruitment rate.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The feasibility and acceptability of the model of Enhanced Care from both a parent and a staff perspective.

The impact of cumulative stress and trauma manifests in compromised health and well-being that may impact on the child's cognitive, educational, social, physical and emotional development and functioning.  We will be measuring these variables at baseline and at 6 months post-discharge for both the Usual Care and the Enhanced Care groups.  These variables will be measured via a questionnaire that incorporates a number of standardised measures of child and family health and well-being.

A medical file audit will be conducted to identify the features of Usual Care as well as, for both the Usual Care and the Enhanced Care group,  the family engagement in health services (i.e. attendance at outpatient appointments, further contact with the Hospital, referrals to specialist care which are implemented) and health outcomes for the child .  

The findings of the qualitative interviews with parents, at discharge from hospital and 6 months post-discharge, will give us data about what parents found was helpful and what was not helpful during their child?s hospital admission as well as their suggestions about what else would be helpful. We will have this feedback from both the Usual Care and Enhanced Care group. 

Staff consultations and focus groups will be held to review and refine the current proposed model of Enhanced Care prior to model being trialled.</outcome>

These variables will be measuresd via a questionnaire that incorporates a number of standardised measures of child and family health and well-being.

The audit of the medical files of children in both the Usual Care and the Enhanced Care group will provide data about 1) previous presentations to the hospital (both for inpatient and ambulatory care)
2) assessments of the clinical team during the child's inpatient admission (in which they are recruited to the study)
3) data about attendance at scheduled appointments post-discharge from hospital.</outcome>

      <outcome>Explore the acceptability of measures included in the CAP@H questionnaire to study participants (parents of children expoesd to cumulative stress and trauma).

During the qualitative interviews with parents at discharge from hospital and six months post-discharge, we will ask participants about their experience of participating in the research project including the completion of the study questionnaire.</outcome>

      <outcome>Determine what outcomes measures should be used to measure the impact of this intervention in further trials.

We will  compare the Usual Care Group and the Enhanced Care Group on all measures at six-month post-discharge using Pearson Chi Square or Fisher's Exact Test for categorical data and  analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous data. An examination of the distribution of raw scores may suggest a trend indicating which domains may have been impacted on, and on which domains there appears to be no difference between the Usual Care Group and the Enhanced Care Group. This analysis will give an indication of the most appropriate study outcomes to use in further trials.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare outcomes in terms of child and family health and well being between the enhanced care and usual care groups in order to make an estimation of the variability in outcomes between the enhanced care and usual care groups to help determine sample size for future trials.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effect of cumulative stress and trauma on children and families has been demonstrated to lead to compromised outcomes in health and well-being for the child.  Cumulative stress or trauma can arise from multiple co-existing or recurrent experiences such as poverty, inappropriate housing, unemployment, ill-health or injury, family breakdown, family violence, parental substance misuse, abuse or neglect.

Acute paediatric health services play a unique role in contributing to the maintenance and improvement of childs health and well-being and support of their families.  They have been identified as playing a crucial role in the identifying children as risk of suffering deleterious effects of the cumulative stress and trauma.

This study aims:
1) To describe the health and well-being of children admitted to The Royal Childrens Hospital (RCH) and identified by clinical staff as being vulnerable to the effects of cumulative stress or trauma 
2) To compare the health and well-being of participants in this study to Australian reference data  (using data from Growing Up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children)
3) To trial and evaluate an enhanced assessment and intervention program in an acute paediatric setting for children identified as being vulnerable to the effects of cumulative stress and trauma
4) To identify the interdisciplinary professional decision making processes of RCH health professionals working with clinical presentations of cumulative stress and trauma.

This study will use a sequential comparison group design, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, to address the above aims.  Data will be collected by questionnaire, interview and hospital Unit Record audit at two time points: entry to study (T1); discharge from hospital (T2) and six months post-discharge (T3).  Participating families will be recruited from children admitted to select Medical Units in 
The Royal Childrens Hospital Melbourne.</summary>
