  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Intraband pressure recording system
Other interventions - Conventional Adjustment

Active Comparator: Conventional Adjustment Group - Subject whose band adjustments will be made via conventional standard of care (e.g., volume, hunger).

Active Comparator: Intraband Pressure Arm - Subjects whose band adjustments will be guided by intraband pressure readings.


Treatment: devices: Intraband pressure recording system
Intraband pressure will be measured by a pressure recording system.

Other interventions: Conventional Adjustment
Band adjustments will be made via conventional standard of care (e.g., volume, hunger).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Excess Weight Change at Day 180 - Percent Excess Weight Change will be calculated per subject as 100% times the difference between screening and Day 180 visit weight divided by the difference between screening weight and ideal body weight for a given sex and height of a subject. Excess weight is defined as the Screening Weight minus the ideal body weight. Ideal body weight is taken from the 1983 Metropolitan Life using the upper limit value of the medium frame range.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Static Intraband Pressure at Day 180 - Mean static Intraband Pressure will be automatically calculated by the Pressure Recording System as the sum of all pressure points divided by the number of seconds X 10 (10Hz data acquisition)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 180</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Weight Loss kg/wk at Day 180 - Rate of weight loss = (screening weight (kg) - weight at Day 180 visit (kg)) / (number of days between screening and Day 180 visit / 7).</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>-  Able to comprehend, follow and give informed consent.

          -  Be at least 18 years of age at time of trial enrollment.

          -  Had a pre-implantation BMI between 35 and 55 kg/m2.

          -  Have received a SAGB VC implant 1) 30-60 days (and not undergone first band adjustment
             yet)prior to the date of enrollment.

          -  Willingness to be randomized to intraband-based or conventional adjustments

          -  Willingness to consent to monthly visits and possible measurements of intraband
             pressure (requiring access to the injection port).

          -  Willingness to undergo up to 7 band adjustments within the 6-month period of the
             study.

          -  Able to sit approximately at a 90 degree-angle, from the floor, for IBP measurements.

          -  Willingness to return to office visits around the same time of the first in-study
             adjustment (plus or minus 2 hours)

          -  Willingness to consent to a limited UGI series if the investigator suspects the
             presence of a band-related complication or if the intraband pressure recordings
             deviate from expected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this protocol is to determine how band fill volumes that are based on
      intraband pressure readings can influence the comfortability of the band and to compare
      weight loss with this methodology to weight loss with the conventional approach recommended
      in existing product labeling.</summary>
