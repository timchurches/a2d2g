  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - imatinib mesilate
Treatment: drugs - interferon-alpha (INF-a)
Treatment: drugs - cytarabine (ARA-C)

Experimental: imatinib (STI571) - In the first-line treatment period participants received imatinib 400 mg orally once daily in the morning. Hydroxyurea was permitted in the first 6 months to keep the white blood cell count (WBC) below 20.0 X 10^9/liter. If protocol specific criteria applied, participants were eligible to crossover to receive interferon-alpha (IFN-a) subcutaneous (SC) injections escalated over 4 weeks to achieve a target dose of 5 MU/m^2/day. After the maximum tolerated dose of IFN-a was achieved, participants also received cytarabine (ARA-C) 20 mg/m^2/day (max 40 mg) SC injection for 10 days every month. Maximum study duration was 11.5 years.

Active Comparator: IFN-a+Ara-C - In the first-line treatment period participants received interferon-alpha (IFN-a) subcutaneous (SC) injections escalated over 4 weeks to achieve a target dose of 5 MU/m^2/day. After the maximum tolerated dose of IFN-a was achieved, participants also received cytarabine (ARA-C) 20 mg/m^2/day (max 40 mg) SC injections for 10 days every month. Hydroxyurea was permitted in the first 6 months to keep the white blood cell count (WBC) below 20.0 X 10^9/liter. If protocol specific criteria applied, participants were eligible to crossover to the second-line treatment period to receive imatinib (STI571). IFN treatment was discontinued with protocol amendment 6. Maximum study duration was 8 years.


Treatment: drugs: imatinib mesilate
imatinib supplied as 100 mg and 400 mg tablets or 100 mg capsules.

Treatment: drugs: interferon-alpha (INF-a)
interferon-alpha (IFN-a) subcutaneous (SC) injections escalated over 4 weeks to achieve a target dose of 5 MU/m^2/day.

Treatment: drugs: cytarabine (ARA-C)
cytarabine 20 mg/m^2/day (max 40 mg) SC for 10 days every month.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Overall Survival (All Randomized Participants) - Overall survival was defined as the time between date of randomization and death due to any cause. The time was censored at last examination date for patients who were still being treated and at date of last contact for patients who discontinued treatment. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of participants at each time point was calculated. This outcome was measured in all randomized patients, regardless of whether crossover occurred, i.e., events that occurred in patients, who had crossed over, were attributed following crossover to the original randomized treatment.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan Meier Estimates of Event Free Survival (All Randomized Participants) - Event-free survival is defined as the time between randomization and the earliest of any of the following events on treatment:
progression to Accelerated Phase (AP) or Blast Crisis (BC)
loss of Complete Hematological Response (CHR)
loss of Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) confirmed
loss of Major Cytogenetic Response (MCyR) unconfirmed
increase in white blood cell count (WBC) if approved by the Study Management Committee (SMC)
death (due to any cause when reported as primary reason for discontinuation of treatment).
Kaplan Meier estimates of the percentage of participants with Event Free Survival at the given time point was calculated. This outcome was measured in all randomized patients, regardless of whether crossover occurred, i.e., events that occurred in patients, who had crossed over, were attributed following crossover to the original randomized treatment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Kaplan Meier Estimates of Time to Progression to Accelerated Phase (AP) or Blast Crisis (BC) (All Randomized Participants) - Time to progression to AP/BC is defined as the time between randomization and either of the following events on treatment: death (due to CML when reported as primary reason for discontinuation of treatment) or progression to Accelerated Phase or Blast Crisis and is censored at last examination date for patients without event. No data after discontinuation of study treatment was included. The Kaplan Meier estimates of the percentage of participants with survival without progression to AP/BC at the given time point was calculated. This outcome was measured in all randomized patients, regardless of whether crossover occurred, i.e., events that occurred in patients, who had crossed over, were attributed following crossover to the original randomized treatment.</outcome>
