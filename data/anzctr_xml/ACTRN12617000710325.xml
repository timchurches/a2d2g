  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post-radiotherapy dental decay is a common, chronic consequence of radiotherapy treatment for head and neck cancers. It becomes a significant physical and financial burden for many patients. Left untreated, dental decay may cause severe pain, mouth infections and impact negatively on overall well-being. The World Health Organisation described dental decay as the fourth most expensive chronic disease to treat.

Radiotherapy permanently damages salivary glands, resulting in a decreased salivary flow, which manifests as a dry mouth. The result is a long-term change to the oral environment, including a loss of salivary buffering capacity  ultimately increasing the bacterial load and altering the bacterial community structure. In such conditions, a shift to cariogenic microbes (bacteria that promote dental decay) and the subsequent production of acid from fermentable carbohydrates, may favour the development of dental decay.

Streptococcus mutans is a cariogenic microbe strongly associated with dental decay. It is inhibited by antimicrobial peptides called bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS), produced by S. salivarius. Hence, we propose that the provision of S. salivarius in the form of an oral probiotic lozenge post-radiotherapy treatment may favourably alter the composition of the oral microbial community to reduce host susceptibility to dental decay.</summary>
