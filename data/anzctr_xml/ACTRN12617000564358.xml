  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention (reactive step training) group will walk along a 10-m walkway consisting of 50cm x 50cm wooden decking tiles. They will be asked to step onto step-length black and white vinyl target tiles placed on the walkway with the accompaniment of music with a beat reflecting the desired cadence. Slips will be induced by a movable tile on two hidden low-friction rails with linear bearings that can slide upon foot contact (20cm, 30cm or 40cm). A friction plat will be applied to slow down the slip speed until a participant learns to respond well. Trips are induced using a tripping board (7cm or 14cm height) that flips up from the walkway at mid-swing using a wireless controller. The tripping board and the slipping tile are concealed and can be moved to various locations along the walkway so that proactive adaptation (e.g. changing gait with prediction) will be minimized and reactive stepping response can be specifically trained. Gait speed (40% to 90% of individual's normal gait), slip distance (20cm, 30cm or 40cm) and speed (with/without the friction plate) will be adjusted by a Health Fitness Programmer according to participant's anxiety level and perceived difficulty. Reactive step training will be conducted in three 40-minute sessions (120 minutes in total). Session 1 will train recovery from trips, session 2 will train recovery from slips and session 3 will train recovery from a mix of trips and slips. The 3 individual sessions will be held in 2 days (1st day: training sessions 1 and 2 with lunch break, 2nd day: training session 3) within a week. Attendance of and actual training contents (e.g. gait speed, slip distance and trip height) used for each participant will be recorded. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control (target step walking) group will walk on the same walkway. They will be asked to step on the target tiles, with the accompaniment of music with a beat reflecting the desired cadence but without slip and trip perturbations for 30 times (equivalent to the number of walks in a session for the intervention group) in one 40-minute session.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fall incidence after slip- and trip-perturbations in the laboratory. All participants will be asked to walk at 90% of their normal gait speed. The gait speed will be constrained using the black and white vinyl stepping tiles (adjusted to 95% of normal step length) and metronome (adjusted to 95% of normal cadence). Non-friction 70cm slip and 14cm trip at random locations will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Margin of stability after slip- and trip-perturbations. An 8-camera Vicon motion analysis system will be used to record kinematic data during slip and trip trials. The margin of stability in anterior-posterior direction will be calculated as the distance between an extrapolated centre of mass to a closest base of support limit. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after the intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kinematic characteristics of the balance response (step length/height, slipping distance/speed, extrapolated centre of mass displacement, foot contact angle, etc)  immidediately before and after slip- and trip-onsets. An 8-camera Vicon motion analysis system will be used to record kinematic data during slip and trip trials. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Choice stepping reaction time (CSRT) with inhibitory stimulus. The CSRT system consists of an electronic step mat, integrated with a computer via Bluetooth. The computer unit and monitor will be placed on the ground 50 cm in front of the step mat. Participants will be asked to view the screen that displays the stepping arrows and step onto the corresponding step mat target panel as quickly as possible.

    <statisticalmethods>Forty participants will be recruited. This sample size will be sufficient to detect a difference in the proportion of fallers in the intervention and control groups in the laboratory based on the following assumptions: (10% fallers in intervention group, 50% fallers in control group, alpha error: 0.05, power: 0,80 and allocation ratio: 1:1).

Chi-squared test will be used to examine the between-group difference in falls after the slip- and trip-perturbations. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to examine the time (pre/post) and group (intervention/control) interactions in the continuous outcomes. Paired t-test will be used to examine the within-group (pre-post) changes in the continuous outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls among older adults cause serious challenges for the individual and health care systems, including bone fractures. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that reactive step training (repeated exposure to balance perturbations) can reduce falls by approximately 50%  (Okubo et al., 2016).  However, the methods to generate perturbations (e.g. slips) in previous studies have been considerably heterogeneous and have limitations to training reactive balance control. We have developed a novel overground perturbation system which can generate both slips and trips in random locations. Since this system can provide unpredictable slips and trips, it is theoretically possible to train specifically reactive balance control (as opposed to proactive balance control or prediction). This randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of the reactive step training using this perturbation system in older adults. </summary>
