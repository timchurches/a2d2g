  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of the vBloc Therapy delivered by the Maestro
      Rechargeable System compared to a sham control for the treatment obesity. The Maestro
      Rechargeable System delivers intermittent, electrical blocking signals to the anterior and
      posterior trunks of the intra-abdominal vagus nerve (termed vBloc Therapy) and is designed to
      reduce sensations of hunger and produce satiety leading to weight loss. After approval from
      the institutional review board, subjects provided written consent and were randomized in a 2
      to 1 allocation to vBloc group (with laparoscopic placement of the leads and neuroregulator)
      or the sham group (placement of a custom sham neuroregulator only) on double-blinded basis.
      Both groups received similar diet and exercise counseling. Weight, adverse events, clinical
      laboratories, ECGs, eating questionnaires and quality of life data were evaluated throughout
      the 12 month study duration.</summary>
