  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to use questionnaires to assess the impact of laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis on bladder pain syndrome in women already scheduled for surgery. Laparoscopy, also known as key hole surgery, will involve the removal of endometriosis dependant on the individual patient findings. Duration is variable from 30mins if no endometriosis is found, to a number of hours if there is extensive endometriosis requiring removal.  The study will use questionnaires preoperatively which will be compared at three, six and twelve months post procedure to assess symptoms. This study is observational and does not involve altering surgical intervention that has already been scheduled. This study will only use questionnaires to asses the outcome of patients who are having this intervention as part of their clinical management. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in this study will fall into one of four groups which will enable comparisons between symptoms to be made. 
The group that a participant is allocated to is dependant on their surgical findings, as this cannot be confirmed until after the procedure. 
All patients involved in the study are scheduled to undergo laparoscopy for investigation of chronic pelvic pain. If endometriosis is found during the surgery, it will be removed. If no endometriosis is found then no tissue removal will be performed. These findings will be collated and each participant allocated to one of four groups depending on these findings. 
1) Group 1: Women with endometriosis and bladder pain syndrome
2) Group 2: Women with endometriosis and no bladder pain syndrome
3) Group 3: Women with no endometriosis and bladder pain syndrome
4) Group  4: Women with no endometriosis and no bladder pain syndrome</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is bladder pain reduction at 12 months following endometriosis surgery with bladder pain reduction being defined as a &gt;/=50% bladder pain reduction by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Examine the relationship between women with endometriosis over the uterovesical pouch and bladder pain syndrome. This will be assessed using a combination of the VAS (visual analogue scale), PUF (pelvic pain and urgency/frequency), OLeary Sant Symptom and Problem Index and BPIC-SS (bladder pain / interstitial cystitis symptom score) questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) Compare consistency of bladder symptoms reporting by patients on the VAS (visual analogue scale), PUF (pelvic pain and urgency/frequency), OLeary Sant Symptom and Problem Index and BPIC-SS (bladder pain / interstitial cystitis symptom score) questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 month, 6 month and 12month comparison points</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) Measure the rate of de novo bladder pain syndrome that occurs following a laparoscopy in subjects with pelvic pain but no prior bladder pain syndrome and no demonstrable endometriosis. This will be assessed using the VAS (visual analogue scale) and the PUF (pelvic pain and urgency/frequency) questionnaires. Pre operative questionnaire results will be compared to patients 3month, 6 month and 12 month post operative questionnaire responses. </outcome>
      <timepoint>3 month, 6 month and 12 month comparison points</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4) Measure the rate of de novo bladder pain syndrome that occurs following a laparoscopy in subjects with pelvic pain and endometriosis but no prior bladder pain syndrome. This will be assessed using the OLeary Sant Symptom and Problem Index and BPIC-SS (bladder pain / interstitial cystitis symptom score) questionnaire. Pre operative questionnaire results will be compared to patients 12 month post operative questionnaire responses. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5) Measure the change in bladder pain at 12 months following laparoscopy in subjects with bladder pain syndrome but no endometriosis. This will be assessed using the OLeary Sant Symptom and Problem Index and BPIC-SS (bladder pain / interstitial cystitis symptom score) questionnaire. Pre operative questionnaire results will be compared to patients responses at 12 months post procedure.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1) Pelvic Pain &gt;6months, who have been booked for laparoscopy as part of their investigation.

2) Presence of urinary tract infection as determined by a midstream urine culture or haematuria requiring further investigation. 
3) Women who do not consent.
4) Confusable diseases (except endometriosis) will be excluded or deemed unlikely based on clinical grounds by the treating clinician. Clinical investigations required to exclude confusable diseases may comprise urine cytology, microbiology; or imaging. These conditions include recurrent UTIs; radiation cystitis; chemical cystitis; infective cystitis (schistosomisais; TB; mycoplasma gentalium; chlamydia; ureaplasma;; bladder calculi; urethral diverticulum)

    <statisticalmethods>SAMPLE SIZE
To achieve a clinically significant change of equal or greater than 50% reduction in pain on the visual analogue scale for pain with a full bladder from the median of 6/10 that was determined in the study by Cheng et el, a sample size of 10 was determined. A minimum of 30 participants was chosen to be used in each of the four groups. This will account for drop outs and non responders and to provide adequate representation. Sample size calculation was performed using STATA version 11.0 with a power of 0.9, alpha value of 0.05, SD 1.9. In addition the larger sample size allows a greater opportunity to address some of the secondary outcomes  

ANALYSIS
At completion of the study analysis will involve comparing proportions using Chi squared tests and comparing continuous variable measures using t-test or if variance is not equal the Welchs t-test. If the data does not have a normal distribution then a non-parametric tests such as the Mann Whitney U test will be used.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic pelvic pain is a frustrating condition for many women, having a variety of potential causes including endometriosis, adenomyosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, adhesions, irritable bowel syndrome and bladder pain syndrome (BPS). Endometriosis is considered the main cause with a prevalence of 70-90% in women with chronic pelvic pain. A number of recent trials have found that bladder pain syndrome also is an important differential diagnosis to consider with studies showing 53-89% of women with chronic pelvic pain have bladder pain syndrome. Similarly studies have also reported the high prevalence of having concomitant bladder pain syndrome and endometriosis with a study by Cheng et el in 2011, finding 60% of women with BPS also had endometriosis. 

This study aims to assess the impact of laparoscopy and more specifically surgical treatment of endometriosis on bladder pain syndrome. The study will use questionnaires preoperatively which will be compared at three, six and twelve months post procedure. The primary outcome measure will be bladder pain reduction at 12 months following endometriosis surgery with bladder pain reduction being defined as a &gt;/=50% bladder pain reduction by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
