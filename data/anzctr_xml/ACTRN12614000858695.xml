    <statisticalmethods>There is limited literature on how best to manage this group of patients.  Due to the relative rarity of this clinical scenario, the study investigators felt that 20 evaluable patients was sufficient to provide some prospective experience and data which will lead towards investigating the safety and tolerability of the regime.  This it hoped that this experience will lead to a larger multi-centric study across Australia and New Zealand.

Baseline characteristics will be summarised in frequency tables and by the use of descriptive statistics for quantitative variables (CTCv4.0). The type I error rate is set (alpha=0.05) with 2-sided testing of p-values. The ChiSquared test with Yates correction and students t-test will be used for this purpose.

Time-to-event curves for acute and late toxicity, and overall survival will be constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test used to determine the magnitude of differences.

The primary endpoints will be assessed using a validated quality of life tool EPIC (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index) considering bowel &amp; bladder domains only. A change in mean score by over 1/2 a standard deviation is considered clinically significant, called the minimum reported difference. The number of patients who achieve the minimum important difference will be presented as a percentage of total number of patients.

Cox proportional hazard models will be used to determine independent significant prognostic factors effecting disease extent.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to prospectively evaluate the palliative benefit of a split course of pelvic radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer whose disease is no longer responding to hormone therapy.  

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or above who has been diagnosed with castrate resistant prostate cancer, and are able to commence radiotherapy within 6 weeks of trial registration. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will undergo split-course pelvic radiotherapy, which consists of 10 treatment sessions over 2 weeks, followed by a planned 1 week treatment break, followed by a further 12 treatment sessions administered over 2.5 weeks. 

Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire at 6 months post treatment to assess bowel and bladder related quality of life. They will also be monitored for up to 3 years in order to evaluate acute and late side effects of treatment, local symptom response rate, rates of catheter removal, blood transfusions, trans-urethral prostate resections, and overall survival.</summary>
