  <interventions>
    <interventions>Through the compilation of a brief on-line questionnaire were collected informations on years of experience, behaviour in two critical clinical cases and knowledge/use of clinical tools or tests selected using Evidence Based Practice criteria to discriminate serious conditions of pain that is nonmusculoskeletal in nature</interventions>

      <outcome>The purpose of this study is to identify and emphasize which factor leads physical therapists choice the most, experience, measured with years of work or expertise assessed using the knowledge of clinical tools referred to answer on two critical clinical cases.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify if there is a relation between years of practice and knowledge of clinical tools selected following Evidence Based Practice criteria. Experience as years of work was assessed with 4 different categories (from 1to2, from3to5, from 6to10, more than 10). To assess the knowledge/use of clinical assessment tools a 0 to 5 point scale was used (0= never heard about; 1= have heard about but never used; 2= use it rarely; 3= use it sometimes; 4= use it often; 5= use it every time). Pain drawing/body chart, ULTT and Spurling's tests knowledge/use was asked.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>A cross-sectional mail survey was conducted through personal mail lists of physiotherapists known and on-line network pages of physiotherapists groups. A purposive sample was used. The sample size was not calculated because this is the first exploratory study in this field, but we referred as minimum sample size to the largest sample of experts in physiotherapy ever reported in a published study (55 physiotherapists). Spearmans Rho test for correlation between all the variables was performed. Mann Whitney U test to assess the correlation of the years of practice and the clinical answers, and sample will be also dichotomized in four different ways in subgroups. A multinomial logistical regression will be performed for assessing the validity of the model considering all variables assessed referred to correct clinical answers. No assumption was formulated because of lack of knowledge on this field. Statistical significance was set to P = 0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to identify and emphasize which factor leads physical therapists choice the most, experience, measured with years of work or expertise assessed using the knowledge of clinical tools referred to answer on two clinical cases. Secondly we wanted to identify if there was a relation between years of practice and knowledge of clinical tools. At the moment ther are no studies that investigate clinical decision making process using clinical critical cases nor studies that explores if expertise in physiotherapy use clinical tools.</summary>
