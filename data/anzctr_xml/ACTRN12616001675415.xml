  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients from the medical and surgical departments who require a peripheral intravenous catheters (PVC) for longer than 24 hours will be eligible for inclusion in this study. Consenting patients will have their PVC inserted by a Vascular Access Specialist (intervention) or a generalist clinician (control). 

Arm 1 (control): PVC inserted as per hospital policy by a credentialed PVC inserter (generalist approach).
Arm 2 (intervention): Vascular Access Specialist (VAS), defined as a registered nurse with advanced knowledge of vascular access including catheter technology, dressings, modalities of catheter access and intravenous therapy management.

Cox regression will be used to assess the effect of patients and treatment differences as well as for group comparisons.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Successful peripheral venous catheter (PVC) insertion and the decrease of catheter related complications that result in device failure is an important clinical objective and patient outcome.  Although previous studies have identified the level of skill of the PVC inserter as a risk factor for catheter failure there is a paucity of information investigating the impact of a Vascular Access Specialist (VAS). 

We will use a single centre, randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and economic outcomes of PVC inserted by a VAS against those inserted by a generalist inserter (standard care). As this is a pilot study, the primary aim of this study is to establish feasibility of the protocol and the planned processes. This will help to budget and plan correctly for the larger definitive trial. We will collect data on the success of screening and recruitment strategies; test our data collection processes and technology; cost the Research Nurse time required for the trial; and finalise sample size requirements for the larger trial.
Participants will be eligible for inclusion in this trial if they are a medical or surgical patient over the age of 18 and are having a peripheral intravenous catheter inserted as part of their therapy (which is expected to remain in place for at least 24 hours).

All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to have their PVC inserted by either a Vascular Access Specialist or a generalist inserter. Daily follow ups will then be carried out by a (blinded) Research Nurse until the time of device removal.</summary>
