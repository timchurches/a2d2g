  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will be scanned by a MRI scanner. The total time of a scan session is about 45 minutes and data of structural and functional images of the subjects brains will be collected. In the functional part, the subjects will perform a cognitive task.
Children with ADHD will be scanned twice. About 1 hour before one of the scan sessions, the patients will take a single dose (10 mg) of MPH orally, which is a drug commonly used in the treatment of ADHD. Then the patients will be scanned. (About 1 hour before the other scan session, the patients will take the placebo, which is described in the Comparator / control treatment part of the form.)
The order of the two sessions will be counterbalanced across the patients. The interval between the two sessions will be about 1 week, which is thought to be enough for the clearance of the drug.</interventions>
    <comparator>About 1 hour before one of the scans, the patients will take the placebo (Vitamin-B6, 10 mg) orally. Then the patients will be scanned.
 Healthy controls will be scanned only once, with the same types of imaging data to be collected, but no drug or placebo will be involved.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: structural imaging results: volume of different brain regions</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after the scans are finished</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 2: functional imaging results: activation level of different brain regions</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after the scans are finished</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accuracy and reaction times of the cognitive task.
The cognitive task is operated with Presentation (a stimulus delivery and experimental control software system for neuroscience, see details in http://www.neurobs.com) on a computer which is connected to the MRI scanner. When the subjects are performing the task, the accuracy and reaction times will be recorded simultaneously by Presentation in the computer used in the experiment.</outcome>
