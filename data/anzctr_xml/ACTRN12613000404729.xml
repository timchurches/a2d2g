  <interventions>
    <interventions>Extubation to nasal prong oxygen at 6L/min versus facemask oxygen at 6 L/min. From extubation until discharge from recovery ward (approximately for 1 hour).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comfort/ tolerance rated as a cumulative score by patient/ theatre nurse/ recovery ward nurse. Rated on 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient will assess comfort/ tolerance at discharge from recovery ward (for their conscious time post anaesthetic). Approximately at 1 hour post extubation.
Theatre nurse will assess comfort/ tolearnce at 1 minute post extubation.
Recovery ward nurse will rate comfort/ tolerance for the duration of time in recovery at the time of dischrge from recovery ward. Approximately 1 hour post extubation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of attempted or actual removal of oxygen delivery device by the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cummulatively from extubation until discharge from recovery ward. 1 minute post extubation until approximately 1 hour post.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time from extubation until discharge criteria from recovery ward met</outcome>
      <timepoint>This would be expected to be 30 minutes until 1 hour post extubation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Need for intervention:
Anaesthetic circuit and mask
Application of PEEP
Additional oxygen</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time is recorded if any of these outcomes occur. These could occur at any time from time of extubation until approximately one hour post extubation. They are most likely to occur in the first 20 minutes post extubation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minimum recorded haemoglobin oxygen saturation as recorded using a digital pulse oximeter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pulse oximetry will be recorded for the duration of the study. This is expected to be from extubation until approximately 1 hour post.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To see the tolerance patients have after a general anaesthetic of nasal oxygen as opposed to facemask oxygen (which is normal). Previous studies show that compliance with oxygen therapy is better with nasal oxygen than facemask oxygen. Also we believe this technique gives patients as effective oxygenation. Therefore potentially improving patient safety.</summary>
