  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a type of psychotherapy known as the transdiagnostic Unified Protocol for the treatment of emotional disorders. The intervention is designed for 1 hour duration sessions on a weekly basis to a maximum of 18 sessions. The intervention will be delivered one-to-one by a qualified Masters level psychologist. 

The transdiagnostic Unified Protocol for the treatment of emotional disorders is comprised by seven modules: (1) a preliminary module focusing on enhancing motivation and readiness for change and treatment engagement, as well as an introductory module educating patients on the nature of emotions and providing a framework for understanding their emotional experiences, (2) increasing present focused emotion awareness, (3) increasing cognitive flexibility, (4) identifying and preventing patterns of emotion avoidance and maladaptive emotion-driven behaviors (EDBs), (5) increasing awareness and tolerance of emotion-related physical sensations, and (6) interoceptive and situation-based emotion focused exposure, and (7) the final module is devoted to summarizing the relevant techniques attained and developing relapse prevention strategies. Each module may take 2-3 sessions to complete, duration will vary and will be carried at discretion of the psychologist in collaboration with the participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>Randomization to the enhanced usual care group will receive an education package delivered by the study coordinator consisting of the beyondblue fact sheet regarding anxiety, depression and coronary heart disease. Participants will be also advised to seek assistance for achieving mental wellbeing and directed to clinical services (psychologist, psychiatrist or their primary physician who will be informed of the screening results). This conforms with the National Heart Foundation of Australias depression screening guidelines for CHD. There will be no restrictions on usual care. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Planned Statistical analysis: Analyses will be performed blinded via numerical code according to intention-to-treat principles. The psychosocial battery will be analyzed with SAS mixed models procedures comparing between-group differences (randomization arm), incorporating data collected at multiple time points and random effects. These analyses account for individual differences in baseline severity and change in trajectory over time in the primary outcomes (depression and anxiety) and secondary psychosocial outcomes. Importantly, we will be able to model effects for treatment group, time, and their interaction terms. Primary depression and anxiety disorder response determined by blinded MINI rating, and psychosocial measures, will be analyzed using logistic binomial models and calculated numbers-needed-to-treat. Rates of patient MACE will be compared with log-binomial models presenting risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. 

The results of two systematic reviews in chronic diseases suggest that effect sizes d = 0.40 would be of clinical interest for this interventions impact on psychological health. The proposed sample for this feasibility study of 50 patients (25 in each arm) was set to detect a difference between UP and EUC arms in depression and anxiety outcome at a = 0.05 with 40% power to detect a 0.5 SD difference in means between groups on self-report psychosocial measures, which is the cut-off for clinical importance. In terms of emotional disorder remission the study is powered to detect a difference of .30 between UP and EUC assuming a 70% vs. 30% remission rate. This study is not sufficiently powered to detect a reduction in MACE, however this CVD endpoint is standard practice in recent psychosocial RCTs.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of CHAMPS is to perform a feasibility trial to determine whether treatment of common mental health problems in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is feasible by comparison to enhanced usual care (EUC). The treatment arm concerns cognitive-behavioural therapy, specifically a type of transdiagnostic treatment of common mental health problems known as the Unified Protocol (UP). The findings will establish an estimate of treatment effect size to inform a larger definitive RCT. 
We hypothesize that the CHAMPS intervention arm will reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress, reduce the number of psychiatric disorders, improve quality of life and cardiac endpoints in comparison to EUC at six months post-baseline (post-treatment in the treatment). The study seeks to randomise 25 persons to each study arm transdiagnostic UP vs. EUC. The CHAMPS intervention arm will consist of 12 to 18 weeks transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioural therapy. The EUC arm will consist of information regarding depression in CVDs provided to patient and physician, in accordance with the National Heart Foundation of Australia's recommendations. 
A secondary objective of CHAMPS is to determine the incidence of emotional problems such as affective disorders in persons without mental health problems at baseline. Therefore a cohort of patients will also be recruited whom have no emotional distress at baseline, and this particular group will serve as a non-distressed control group in order to evaluate the incidence of mental health problems in CVD patients. This methodology is similar to recent depression RCTs in CVD populations. Importantly, the non-distressed control group will form a reference population to determine whether longer term emotional functioning and other aspects of CVD functioning in the UP and EUC groups is comparable to a group who were not-distressed during hospitalization for CVD.
