  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aboriginal children living in remote areas of the Northern Territory have the worlds highest rates of eardrum perforation reported in the medical literature. The disease can have significant effects on a childs hearing, language, education and associated social disadvantage.

Studies show that a child with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) requires frequent daily ear cleaning and antibiotic drops. This may be needed for many months.  Regular review of the eardrum is required to monitor progress and provide treatment. Families living in remote communities struggle to provide the level of care needed for effective cure of perforations.  Our research will look at ways to increase the rates of Aboriginal children with a history of eardrum perforation participating in follow-up exams. We will randomise families caring for a child with CSOM to receive regular reminders by mobile phone calls, text messages or standard practice.  Clinic attendance rates will be the primary outcome.</summary>
