    <interventions>High dose fish oil group receive 10mL / day liquid fish oil concentrate (BLT Incromega TG3525) providing 5.5g/d EPA+DHA. Incromega TG3525 has 35% EPA and 25% DHA. Taken orally. Duration of therapy 3 years.

    <comparator>Low dose group (control group) receivd 10 mL / day liquid sunola oil : capelin oil (2:1) providing 400mg/d EPA+DHA. Sunola oil is a monounsaturated oil, capelin fish oil has 6.6%EPA and 5.7% DHA a low dose of which is added to the sunola oil for the purposes of masking smell and taste but with little addition of EPA+DHA. Taken orally. Duration of therapy 3 years.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The design of this RCT has allowed the effects of fish oil to be assessed in the context of modern disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) treatment for RA. A structured treatment algorithm responsive to disease activity and tolerance, allows drug use to be used as an outcome measure for the effects of fish oil. Specifically, doses of combination DMARDs (methotrexate, sulphasalazine, hydroxychloroquine) are increased until the target disease activity is reached (a treat-to-target strategy). The primary endpoint is time to failure of this triple therapy, requiring addition of another DMARD leflunomide. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can suppress synthesis of the omega-6 pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4. Meta-analysis of 10 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in 1995 reported that fish oil supplementation reduced tender joint count and duration of morning stiffness. Meta-analysis in 2007 of 17 RCTs of fish oil in inflammatory joint pain included 14 RA studies and reported a benefit of fish oil for patient assessed pain, morning stiffness, number of painful and/or tender joints and NSAID consumption. Collectively, these studies determined that symptomatic benefits were seen above doses of 2.7g EPA+DHA per day after a delay of 2 to 3 months. 

There were at least two features common to these RCTs that are problematic for demonstrating the potential for use of fish oil in RA. Firstly, participants had established disease with the average disease duration being 10.2 +/- 5.2 years across all studies. Secondly, DMARD use was not real life. DMARDs were held constant with the need for change being a withdrawal criterion, or if drug variation was allowed, it was not according to pre-defined rules.
This is an investigator-initiated, double-blind RCT with fish oil in recent onset RA with disease duration &lt; 12 months, using a study design which addresses some of the shortcomings of previous RCTs of fish oil in RA. A treatment algorithm for DMARD use that is responsive to disease activity and tolerability / toxicity, according to pre-defined rules, allows the extent of DMARD to be used as an outcome measure.
