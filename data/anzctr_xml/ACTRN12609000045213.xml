  <interventions>
    <interventions>Epidemiological study using the Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Nepean Dyspepsia Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score, the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity Index, and the ReQuest Patient Diary. The Patient will complete the surveys providing information of their gastointestinal symptoms, psychological and emotional status, lifestyle and sociodemographics. Surveys are mailed in the post at time points zero, 2 months and 6 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess patients outcome in a routine clinical care setting in a follow-up over 6 months. To determine possible predictors of response/non-response using an overall symptom score, social and demographic factors in patients with reflux symptoms in two big health care centres in a metropolitan area. The outcomes of this study will be evaluated using well-established multiple regression techniques and the statistics program called Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Estimated time of completion is May 2009. Two interim analysis already were performed in May 2008 and September 2008 on participants which finished the 3 surveys after 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our secondary aim is to evaluate factors which may be implicated in the efficacy of treatment with proton pump inhibitors using an overall symptom score, social and demographic factors in patients with reflux symptoms. The outcomes of this study will be evaluated using well-established multiple regression techniques and the statistics program called Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical observations suggest that the endoscopic grade of reflux oesophagitis varies significantly in patients presenting in two different hospitals A and B. These Hospitals are located in socioeconomic diverse areas, which has a big impact in health care utilization and patients follow-up. But this difference and a reason have not been studied prospectively so far. This is an epidemiological study using questionnaires for patients with symptoms Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease such as heartburn and regurgitation. Symptomatic patients referred for endoscopy will be asked complete the surveys providing information of their gastointestinal symptoms, psychological and emotional status, lifestyle and sociodemographics. Surveys are mailed in the post at time points zero, 2 months and 6 months. The aim is to assess patients outcome in a routine clinical care setting in a follow-up over 6 months. We like to determine possible predictors of response/non-response, symptom improvement and efficacy of the common treatment with proton pump inhibitors.</summary>
