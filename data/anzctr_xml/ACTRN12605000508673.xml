  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study, markers of growth hormone (GH) doping will be measured in healthy volunteers in response to administration of GH and/or testosterone. Healthy male and female recreationally trained athletes will be randomised to growth hormone/placebo. The duration of intervention with GH is for 8 weeks in total. For the first 3 weeks, the dose of GH will be increased in a step-wise manner then maintained at the final dose for 5 weeks. Males will also be treated with testosterone/placebo for the last 5 weeks, in addition to GH/placebo. After the treatment period there will be further 6 weeks follow up.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurements of biochemical markers of GH in blood samples collected throughout the treatment and wash-out phases</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured when all subjects have completed the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcomes are measurements of body composition and performance and assessment by questionnaire of mood state.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured as subjects participate in the protocol</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other novel markers of GH doping in blood and in urine will be investigated in samples after all the subjects have completed the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at some time after all subjects have completed the study</timepoint>
