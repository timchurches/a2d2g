  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) of Patients - To compare Overall Survival (OS) of patients who receive 145 mg/m2 NKTR-102 given once every 21 days (q21d) with OS of patients who receive Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC). Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients will be followed until their date of death or until final database closure. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up or are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut-off for OS analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 3 years from study start</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (Outside the Central Nervous System) - Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest evidence of documented Progressive Disease (PD) or of death from any cause. The date of global deterioration or symptomatic deterioration will not be used as the date of PD.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival in Brain Metastasis (PFS-BM) - Progression-Free Survival in Brain Metastasis (PFS-BM) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest evidence of documented Progressive Disease (PD) per Response Assessment in Neuro-OncologyBrain Metastases (RANO-BM) in brain metastases or death from any cause. The PD will also be determined by the investigator's assessments.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (Overall) - Progression-free survival (CNS and peripheral) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest evidence of documented PD in either the CNS or peripheral (using RANO-BM) or death from any cause. The PD will be determined by both the investigator's and the central imaging facility assessments. The same statistical methods that were used for PFS and PFS-BM will be used for PFS (Overall).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rates (ORR) of the NKTR-102 Treatment and the Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC) - Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (RECIST for lesions outside the Central Nervous System (CNS); RANO-BM for CNS lesions) based upon the best response as assessed by the central imaging facility. As a secondary analysis, ORR will be calculated based on the Investigator assessment of response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - Clinical Benefit Rate will be defined as the proportion of patients having a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD) for at least 4 months (= 120 days). The SD duration of 4 months is selected to reflect the shorter life expectancy of study population. CBR will be calculated based on both the central imaging facility assessment of response, progression and stability of disease, as well as the investigator's assessment of these parameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For at least 4 months, with an expected average of 1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DoR) - Duration of response (DoR) outside the CNS will be defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until the earliest evidence of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause. DoR will be calculated based on the central imaging facility assessment of response and progression as well as the investigator's assessment of response and progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>WBRT - To compare the incidence and cumulative frequency of WBRT after date of randomization by treatment group.

      in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting (prior anthracycline may be omitted if medically
