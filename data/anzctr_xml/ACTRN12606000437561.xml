  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with brain injuries often experience problems with prospective memory. Prospective memory is memory to complete future tasks, such as recalling to pick up milk on the way home, or remembering to keep an appointment.  It is common for people with poor prospective memory to use a memory device. With improvements in technology increasing the use of Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) in the non-brain injured population, anecdotal evidence suggests that PDAs would allow people with brain injuries to recall important information.  Despite their increasing popularity, no studies have determined the effectiveness of PDAs for promoting prospective memory recall after brain injury. Results of the study will provide clinicians with evidence to support or refute the use of PDAs for the management of memory impairment in adults with brain injury.</summary>
