  <interventions>
    <interventions>The FRIENDS programs (Fun FRIENDS, FRIENDS for Life, My Youth FRIENDS, Adult Resilience; Barrett, 2012) will be utilised. The parent resilience format will provide the Adult Resilience (a one-day *8 hour program) to parents of children completing the FF, FFL or MYF programs. Allocation to the groups of Fun FRIENDS, FRIENDS for Life or My Youth FRIENDS is determined by age, groups are 4-7 y/o, 8-11 y/o and 12-15 y/o respectively. Classrooms will be randomized to determine the timing of parental intervention (either during the child intervention or 6-months following intervention). The FRIENDS programs are robustly supported anxiety treatment programs with over 50 published articles supporting their use in children and adolescents. Strategies are based on a cognitive behavioural framework and delivered in a group clinical setting. The frequency of sessions is weekly over 20 weeks for the standard format. These will be a 50-minute session conducted by a classroom teacher accredited in the programs (having received a minimum of one-day training). The FRIENDS programs (including all 3 children and the adult program) incorporate physiological, cognitive, and behavioral strategies to assist children and adolescents in coping with stress and worry. The behavioral component includes exposure, relaxation training, assertiveness training, coping and problem solving plans, and conflict resolution. The cognitive component teaches children and adolescents to recognize their feelings and thoughts and the link between them. It also teaches them to identify faulty cognitions and incompatible self-statements, and to elaborate alternative interpretations of difficult situations. Through the program, protective factors such as self-esteem, self-concept, coping skills, hope, and social support are enhanced. The treatment integrity of the child component of the program (FF, FFL, MYF) will be monitored via self-report forms using a Treatment Integrity checklist. The treatment integrity of the adult component of the program (AR) will be monitored by independent reviewers checking the treatment integrity checklist in vivo.

Overall there will be two modes/arms of intervention:
Arm 1: FRIENDS program only (see active comparison below; these will receive the conjunctive adult component at 6-month followup)
Arm 2: Standard FRIENDS program and conjunctive adult resilience component (over 20 weeks)</interventions>
    <comparator>An active control is being utilised which is the FRIENDS programs in their standard format. As noted above, the standard format will be 20x50minute sessions conducted on a weekly basis. This will only include the parent resilience component at 6-month followup.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The etiology of mental ill-health is commonly complex and can often involve not one but a chain of genetic, environmental, social and psychological risk factors. Understanding these risk factors is essential to being able to identify children at risk of developing future mental health difficulties, planning appropriate timing of an intervention and ascertaining necessary treatment components for any intervention. Risk factors may be individual, familial and environmental characteristics that increase the likelihood of adverse developmental outcomes. Although no single risk factor is either necessary or sufficient in the development of a specific disorder, the commonly indicated risk factors in young children are parental psychopathology, temperament and prior symptomology. 

Parental psychopathology is commonly accepted as a risk factor for both genetic and environmental pathways towards childhood mental health problems. Family aggregation studies of both the offspring of clinically diagnosed parents and parents of children with mental health difficulties have demonstrated the heritability of mental disorders  Connell and Goodmans meta-analytic review investigated the associations between parental psychopathology and internalizing and externalizing disorders in their children. Based on the 230 articles identified on parental mental health concerns and childhood internalizing difficulties, the authors found that both maternal and paternal psychopathology significantly predicted childhood symptomology. It should be noted, however, that weighted mean effect sizes in this study were small. Additionally, it was found that effects were moderated by child factors, including age and gender, as well as type of parental diagnosis. These findings suggest that the relationship between parental psychopathology and child psychopathology is not a simple direct linear association. Rather, the interaction of parental influences and child influences is more likely to determine future symptomology.

Despite an exponential increase in resilience research for children, there is currently a lack of evidence exploring how adult resilience affects the development of childhood resilience. As the link between vulnerability factors, protective factors and wellbeing in psychopathological pathways is unclear, it cannot be assumed that the heritability and modeling of psychopathology between parent and child directly indicates a similar link relationship for parent and child resilience.  As such, this study will to explore both the relationship between parent-child resilience and symptomology and how resilience enhancement in parents affects childrens resilience and symptomology intervention outcomes.</summary>
