  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients receive 5 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride as a standard fluid loading regime.
The intervention group receives a further  10 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously.

The intravenous fluid is administered until each patient has reached the specific amount calculated by thier weight. The spinal anaesthesia is performed once the fluid loading and the transthoracic echocardiography has been completed.</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients receive 5 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride as a standard fluid loading regime. The control group receives no extra fluids.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to find out what dose of intravenous fluid maintains enough fluid volume in the body after a spinal anaesthetic. Particpiants in this study are randomly assigned to have a high dose of intravenous fluid or a low dose of intravenous fluid. We find out how much fluid is in the body by doing an ultrasound of the heart before the the intravenous fluid is given, after the intravenous fluid is given, after the spinal anaesthetic is given and at the end of the operation.</summary>
