    <studytitle>Using telephone and text-messaging to improve an integrated cardiac and diabetes self-management program: A cross cultural international collaborative project</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Cardiac patients with diabetes in Australia and in Taiwan who received a cardiac-self-management program incorporating telephone and text-messaging have higher levels of knowledge, self-efficacy, self-behaviour and quality of life compared to those patients who received usual care.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention  Cardiac-Diabetes Self-Management Program incorporating telephone and text-messaging (T-CDSMP) consists of three face-to-face sessions as well as telephone and text-message follow-up. The face-to-face sessions will be commenced within 48 hours of admission. They will be provided by a trained Research Nurse and be conducted while the patients are in hospitals in either Australia and in Taiwan. Follow up will be once a week by telephone call (at 1 week after discharge home), and by text-messages which will be sent a week after the telephone follow up.  The length of intervention is 4 weeks.</interventions>

    <concealment>Baseline data collection is blinded and will be undertaken before randomisation. Allocation will be concealed by using sealed, numbered, opaque envelopes; list generation will be provided by researcher off site, after randomisation. Patients are not blinded to ‘intervention’ and surveys do not have group ID, thus data entry is blinded.</concealment>
