  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the efficacy of surgery without radiotherapy as treatment for low risk cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have low-risk cutaneous head and neck squamous cell carcinoma for which you have previously received no treatment. 

Trial details
All participants in this trial will undergo surgical treatment without additional radiotherapy. Surgical treatment includes removal of all relevant lymph nodes of the neck.


You will be assessed for a period of up to 5 years to determine disease specific survival, the incidence of recurrence and associated consequences [assessment will be done by regular clinical examinations plus/minus ultrasound].</summary>
