  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise Group:
Participants randomized to the exercise arm will receive 12-weeks of supervised and home-based exercise
training.  For the first 8-weeks, supervised training will take place twice weekly.  The supervised exercise will take approximately 60 minutes, and will include resistance training (6 exercises; 12-6 RM), and aerobic training (walking; 60-85% HRmax).  Home-based walking will be progressively prescribed during this time (from 1-3 times a week).  For the final month participants will undergo one supervised exercise training session, and one home-based resistance training session, as well as home-based walking up to three times per week.  The exercise program will be individually prescribed relative to the individuals health and fitness, but will be based on a standard program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group
Participants in the usual care control group will be asked not to change their current exercise behavior. Following the  3 month assessment, the control group participants will be  offered the home-based exercise logbook, a supervised educational training session, and home-based exercise equipment.</comparator>

    <sequence>Subjects are randomised after the baseline assessment has been completed to: 1. Exercise training or 2. Usual care control. Randomisation is at the level of the individual patient.  Patients will be stratified on gender
(male/female) and age (&lt;55 / greater than or equal to 55) The list will be generated and maintained by a research assistant not otherwise involved in the study. The sequential treatment assignments are based on a computer-generated randomisation scheme (by using the Web site www.randomization.com set up by Dr Gerard E. Dallal).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the effect of supervised and home-based exercise training in lung cancer survivors.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you have been diagnosed with lung cancer and are no longer on treatment.

Trial details.
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will undergo supervised and home-based exercise training. This involves resistance (lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (walking), three times per week over a period of 3 months and then will be monitored (without training) for a further 3 months. The other group will be assigned to no treatment for the first 3 months. After this time participants in this group will be given a home-based exercise program and equipment.

Participants will complete some tests of physical function and questionnaires about fatigue, and physical activity levels, and have their body composition measured at these time points. It is thought that the exercise program will improve physical function when compared to no training.</summary>
