    <interventions>This study will look at the 'real world' effectiveness of a novel approach to treating overweight/obesity with co-morbid binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa or other specified feeding and eating disorder by way of the HAPIFED program. HAPIFED stands for a Healthy APproach to weIght management and Food in Eating Disorders and combines multidisciplinary behavioural weight loss therapy and enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy. 
HAPIFED will be conducted in groups of up to 10 individuals over 30 sessions of 90 minutes duration, on a weekly basis. The administration of HAPIFED as a treatment will not form a part of this study. Rather, this study will involve the collection of data from consenting individuals who are receiving HAPIFED treatment as recommended by their healthcare professional, regardless of this study.
HAPIFED treatment will be administered by a multidisciplinary team of clinical psychologists, counsellors and dietitians.
The majority of data will be collected through the use of online questionnaires at baseline, week 30, week 52, week 104 and week 156.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study will look at the 'real world' effectiveness of a novel approach to treating overweight/obesity with co-morbid binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa or other specified feeding and eating disorder by way of the HAPIFED program, which combines behavioural weight loss therapy with enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy.
It is hypothesised that the HAPIFED Program will result in an average weight loss of greater than or equal to 5% of body weight in the group overall and in at least 50% of participants. In addition, it will result in a global score on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) of less than 1 standard deviation above Australian community norms (i.e. below 2.46) in at least 40% of participants, at 52 weeks after commencement of treatment.</summary>
