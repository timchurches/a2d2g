  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF582, compared to
that of Lucentis (registered trademark) in patients with neovascular AMD. This will be done by assessment of vital signs, physical examination, laboratory blood tests and adverse events. Possible adverse events include: eye irritation/discomfort, redness/itching eye, eye dryness, abnormal sensation in eye; lens clouding; pain/irritation at injection site; increased tear production; floaters; sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, joint pain, flu, fatigue,
breathlessness, dizziness, pale skin, anxiety, cough, nausea and allergic reactions.
Because PF582 is very similar to Lucentis it is expected to have similar adverse effects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate the biosimiliarity between PF582 and the
reference compound (Lucentis) based on pharmacokinetics (PK). This will be done by collection and analysis of PK blood samples.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Collected at Day 1 (pre-dose, 1, 2, 4 &amp; 24 hours post dose), Day 7 (predose), Day 14 (predose) and Day 28 (predose)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate the biosimiliarity between PF582 and the
reference compound (Lucentis), based on pharmacodynamics (PD) parameters. 
This will be assessed by measuring retinal thickness or central foveal thickness (CFT), assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT)), Leakage from choroidal neovascularization (CNV) assessed by fluorescein angiography (FA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At screening, Day 1, Day 28, 56, Day 80, Month 6 and Month 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess immunogenicity by collection and analysing blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1, Day 28, 56, Day 80, Month 6 and Month 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preliminary analysis of efficacy.
This will assessed by change in visual acuity and proportion of patients with a change in visual acuity of 15 letters or more. Visual acuity will be measured using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>between Day 1 and Day 80 assessment</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical summaries will primarily be descriptive in nature (e.g., means, standard deviations (SDs), and percentiles). Conclusions concerning the risks and benefits of PF582 will be based upon these descriptive analyses.
All patients who receive any amount of study drug will be
included in the analyses, including those who withdraw
prematurely from the study. 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of ophthalmologic
and systemic adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), changes in laboratory test results, and changes in vital signs. Laboratory data will be listed, with values outside of normal ranges identified. Vital signs, weight, and other disease-specific data will be listed by patient number and scheduled measurement time. Changes from baseline will be summarised by treatment group.
Efficacy and PD parameters will be listed by patient number and scheduled measurement time. Changes from baseline will be summarised by treatment group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to test if PF582 (ranibizumab) is safe and similar to Lucentis (ranibizumab).
Participants will have a screening visit to check for eligibility. Eligible participants will receive either PF582 or Lucentis, by injection into one eye on study Day 1, 28 and 56. Visits will be conducted on Day 2, 7, 14 80 and at 6 and 12 months. During the study participants will undergo the following procedures: height, weight and vital signs
(blood pressure, pulse, temperature, breathing rate) measurement; medical and surgical history and concomitant medications; adverse event monitoring; physical examinations; eye tests (reading chart, measurement of retinal thickness [via pictures of the retina] and examination of the eyes blood vessels, via pictures taken following
injection of a dye into the arm), blood collection and a urine pregnancy test, where applicable.</summary>
