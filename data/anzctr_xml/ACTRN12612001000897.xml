  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study, we will pilot test an internet-delivered intervention to address co-occurring depression and alcohol use for people residing in rural and remote areas. Participants reporting elevated depressive symptoms and alcohol use exceeding the current Australian guidelines will receive ten sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy delivered via an internet-based program, with weekly telephone support from trained members of the project team. The sessions take approximately one hour to complete and participants will be asked to complete two sessions per week, over a five week period.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be recruited from the Australian Rural Mental Health Study (ARMHS). Participants of ARMHS are those that reside in rural or remote areas (non-Metropolitan) in New South Wales, specifically the Greater Western, Hunter New England or North Coast health regions. They were recruited to ARMHS using random selection from the electoral roll and had to reside in a house. Potential participants for the present project will be identified from the information gathered in the 3 year follow up assessment for ARMHS. Potential eligibility will be met by those with: 
- elevated depressive symptoms (as indicated by a Patient Health Questionnaire-9, PHQ-9, with a score greater than 5) or current suicidal ideation (indicated by a score greater than or equal to 1 on item 9 of the PHQ-9);
and,
- Hazardous consumption of alcohol (indicated by an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score of &gt;= 8) at the time of assessment; and,
- Access to telephone and internet</inclusivecriteria>
