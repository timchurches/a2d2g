  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Intervention or "Pedalling" group will be given a modified physiotherapy protocol with the main exercise being stationary pedalling on a set of floor pedals, it will also include gait retraining and walking as well as a knee extension (straightening) stretch. A senior orthopaedic physiotherapist will be delivering both the Intervention and Control group physiotherapy protocols. In the hospital setting, the twice daily 20-minute physiotherapy session will consist of 2 exercises (pedalling and a knee extension stretch, gait retraining &amp; aid prescription and practice of functional activities such as transfers and stair climbing. 8 minutes will be dedicated to the bike pedalling activity, 2 minutes to the extension stretch, and the other 10 minutes towards gait retraining and achievement of functional goals for discharge such as independent transfers and mobility. Once discharged the patient will continue with this home exercise program twice daily for 20 minutes and will be given a diary to tick off daily to calculate compliance, they are asked to return the diary to the assessor at their 2-week review.  As patients will be independent with transfers and mobility on discharge, an increased time can be spent on their home exercise program which consists of the same exercises in hospital and should be split, 10 minutes on pedalling, 5 minutes of knee extension stretching, and 5 minutes spent on gait training with an emphasis on heel-toe strike.

Both the Intervention and Control groups will commence physiotherapy on the day of surgery and undergo the same twice daily inpatient physiotherapy sessions post total knee replacement surgery, the time of each session will be approximately 20 minutes. This is no different than the standard frequency and duration of current inpatient physiotherapy sessions. Patients are instructed not to see an outpatient physiotherapist between discharge and their 2 week follow up assessment.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Control or "Multi-exercise" group will be given a standard multi足-exercise physiotherapy program which includes seated knee bends, Inner range knee strengthening exercise and functional strength exercises such as mini squats and calf raises. The control group will also be given the knee extension stretch and gait足 retraining, however, they will not be given any stationary pedalling exercises. A senior orthopaedic physiotherapist will be delivering both the Intervention and Control group physiotherapy protocols. The 20 minute session for the control group will consist of 10 minutes dedicated to the mult-exercise handout which is the same as their on-going 2 week home exercise program. The other 10 minutes will be spent on gait retraining and achievement of functional goals for discharge such as independent transfers and mobility. Once discharged the patient will continue with this home exercise program twice daily for 20 minutes and will be given a diary to tick off daily to calculate compliance, they are asked to return the diary to the assessor at their 2-week review. As patients will be independent with transfers and mobility on discharge, an increased time can be spent on their home exercise program which consists of the same exercises in hospital and should be split, 15 minutes on multi-exercise handout and 5 minutes spent on gait training with an emphasis on heel-toe strike.

This may include, but is not limited to, a history of dementia or short-足term memory impairment. Participants will also be excluded if they have a predisposition to be discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation (or hostel) facility due to lack of social support (for example, the patient would otherwise return home with no carer availability) or other physical impairment that would mean they could not perform a home exercise program without hands足on assistance. 
Participants will also be excluded if they have a physical condition following surgery that makes them unable to participate in testing, i.e an extreme nauseous reaction following anaesthesia or a severe medical complication that would limit mobility such as a pulmonary embolism, or syncopal event.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>60 participants (30 in each group) is based on the existing research publication "The immediate and long足term effects of a walking足 skill program compared to usual physiotherapy care in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA): a randomised controlled trial" (Bruun足Olsen V, Heiberg KE, Wahl AK, Mengshoel AM. The immediate and long足term effects of a walking足skill program compared to usual physiotherapy care in patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA): a randomised controlled trial. Disabil Rehabil.2013;35(23):200815. 
doi: 10.3109/09638288.2013.770084.) 
In total, this study included 57 patients in its analysis, 29 in the walking足skill group and 28 in the usual physiotherapy care group, in the primary outcome measure, 6MWT, a statistically significant difference in change scores between the two groups was seen. In addition, further sample size estimates will be calculated using G足Power, utilising the appropriate primary outcome measure.

The quantitative data will be analysed using the Statistical Package SPSS. A repeated measures ANOVA (analysis of variance) will be utilized to assess the relevant and specific outcome measures across the data collection time points of 3 days, 12 days, and 4 months postoperatively. Additional post hoc comparisons and analysis will be utilised where appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research investigation into physiotherapy treatment after Total Knee Replacement surgery. This trial is specifically designed to compare two different types of physiotherapy exercise groups, to evaluate whether they provide equal benefit to patients in regards to both physical measures and patient reported satisfaction.

The treatment group will be given a modified physiotherapy protocol with the main exercise being stationary pedalling, it will also include gait retraining and walking as well as a knee extension (straightening) stretch. The control group will be given a standard multi足exercise physiotherapy program which includes seated knee bends, Inner range knee strengthening exercise and functional strength exercises such as mini squats and calf raises. The control group will also be given the knee extension stretch and gait 足retraining, however, they will not be given any stationary pedalling exercises. 
A selection of outcome measures will be recorded at 2 days, 12 days and 4 months post-operatively in conjunction with the participant's Orthopaedic surgeon review.
Outcome measures will include: 
Time of which the patient is deemed safe for discharge from hospital by the treating physiotherapist 
Timed Up &amp; Go test functional measure test 
10 Meter timed walk test 
6-minute walk test 
Knee Range of Motion Measurement 
Subjective measurement tools including the EQ5D survey (incorporating a VAS pain scale), and the Oxford Knee Score.

The significance of the results of this study would be to provide evidence for substituting a standard physiotherapy protocol, which includes a variety of treatment modalities and exercises, with a simplified one which can be mostly patient driven. If the results of the simplified bike pedal group are better than or no different than the standard multi足exercise physiotherapy group then there would be implications for greater time efficiency for treating physiotherapists and an overall cost benefit associated with this.
