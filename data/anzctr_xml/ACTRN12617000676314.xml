  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: There are many factors which may effect intraocular pressure.Tourniquet, which is used in extremity surgery, also effect intraoculary pressure.There many studies about the effect of tourniquet on intraocular pressure, that were performed in patients went on general anesthesia.There was no study about the
effect of tourniquet on intraoculary pressure that was performed in patients who go on spinal anethesia.
Material and methods : Intraocular pressure was measured on patients who went on lower extremity surgery with or without tourniquet under spinal anesthesia.Measurements were performed before spinal anethesia, 5 minutes after spinal anethesia, 5 minutes after surgery started and at the end of the surgery.All measurements were performed in the supine position.Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, intraocular pressure and bleeding volumes were recorded.
Results: In both groups, 5 minutes after spinal anesthesia intraocular pressure measurements were lower than the baseline intraocular pressure measurements.However, the measurements which were performed after tourniquet
insufflation were higher than the baseline.
Conclusion:Intraocular pressure decreases in patient who went on spinal anesthesia but, tourquet insufflation increases intraocular pressure also in patients who went lower extremity surgery with tourniquet.
