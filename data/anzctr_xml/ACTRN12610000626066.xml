  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Auricular acupuncture, one form of acupuncture, targets specific points on the auricle to treat various conditions. It was first reported in the mid-1950s by Nogier, but probably dates back to the Stone Age. Nogier hypothesized that all internal organs are represented in the external ear and found distinct measurable changes in the radial pulse of patients when certain points on the ear were stimulated.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of auricular acupuncture for flat warts and to demonstrate the proper application and effective technique of this method.</summary>
