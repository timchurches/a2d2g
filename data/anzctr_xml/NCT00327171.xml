Aflibercept 4.0 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once every 2 weeks.
Aflibercept could be reduced by 1 dose level ( to 2.0 mg/kg) or 2 dose levels (to 1.0 mg/kg) in case of uncontrolled hypertension or urinary protein &gt;3.5 g/24 hours. Intrapatient dose escalation was not to be permitted. Participants requiring more than 2 dose level reductions would be withdrawn from study treatment.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response (OR) as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Based on the Analysis by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) - Simon's Cohort - OR included Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR). Per RECIST, CR was disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, or normalization of tumor marker levels (for non-target lesions) and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with baseline sum LD as reference.
Tumors were assessed by an independent third-party core imaging laboratory evaluating the chest, abdomen, and pelvis by Computerized Tomography (CT) scans or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans; and responses were confirmed by repeat tumor imaging 4-6 weeks later.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response (OR) as Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Based on the Analysis by the IRC - Efficacy Evaluable Population - OR included Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR). Per RECIST, CR was disappearance of all target or non-target lesions, or normalization of tumor marker levels (for non-target lesions) and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with baseline sum LD as reference.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Clinical Benefit Response (CBR) as Per RECIST Based on the Analysis by the IRC - CBR was defined as having a Stable disease (SD) for &gt;= 6 months or a confirmed OR (PR or CR). Based on RECIST:
SD was neither a sufficient shrinkage of the target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive disease (PD), the persistence of non-target lesions or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits (for non-target lesions)
CR was the disappearance of all target or non-target lesions; and PR was at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, with reference to the baseline sum LD.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response (DR) Based on the Analysis by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) - DR was defined as the time interval from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of tumor progression (or disease progression) as determined by RECIST, or death from any cause, whichever was earlier.
Based on RECIST, progressive disease was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, the appearance of one or more new target or non-target lesions, or the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</outcome>

      <outcome>Tumor Marker Response Rate (TMRR) Based on the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Definition - TMRR was the proportion of evaluable participants achieving a cancer antigen -125 (CA-125) response based on GCIG definition. A response to CA-125 occurred if after two elevated levels before therapy there was at least a 50% decrease in a post-treatment serum sample, which was confirmed by an independent sample collected 21 days or later that was =&lt; 110% of the post-treatment serum sample.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) as Per RECIST Based on the Analysis by the IRC - TTP was defined as the time interval measured from the date of randomization to the date of tumor progression as determined by RECIST. TTP was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves.
For a participant who did not reach tumor progression during study, the censoring date was the date of the last valid tumor burden assessment or the date of study cut-off, whichever was earlier. If the participant had no valid post-baseline tumor burden assessment due to early termination, the censoring date was the date of randomization.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluated outcomes in participants with advanced ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma
      receiving aflibercept.

      The primary objective was to compare the objective response rate of Aflibercept
      (ziv-aflibercept, AVE0005, VEGF trap, ZALTRAP速) 4.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg, administered
      intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks with historical control in participants with advanced
      ovarian epithelial (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) adenocarcinoma resistant
      to platinum and topotecan and/or liposomal doxorubicin.

      The secondary objectives was to further assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, potential
      biological and pharmacogenomic markers of study drug activity, and health-related quality of
      life.

      This study employed an Independent Review Committee (IRC) for radiological tumor assessments.
      For all tumor assessment-related efficacy variables, two analyses were performed: the primary
      analysis was based on Independent Review Committee (IRC) reviewed data and the secondary
      analysis was based on Investigator evaluation. If an endpoint was evaluated by the IRC, the
      IRC reviewed data is reported for this study.</summary>
