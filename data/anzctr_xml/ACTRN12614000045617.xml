    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study which may be expanded depending on preliminary results. A minimum of 20 IBR patients and 20 delayed DBR patients would yield a point estimate for the difference between groups on a given continuous outcome parameter with a 95% confidence interval that extends no more than +/- 0.7 of a standard deviation (with 80% probability). This level of precision is considered sufficient to yield adequate estimates of the plausible effect size to inform the design of any subsequent expanded trial.

The aim is to recruit 40 immediate breast reconstruction patients, 30 delayed and as many non-reconstruction patients as possible.

Multi-level modelling in SAS v9.3 will be used to compare the three arms (immediate reconstruction, delayed reconstruction, no reconstruction) of the trial longitudinally over the 9 assessment points.  This analysis will be conducted using both the primary and secondary outcomes as dependent variables listed above.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the quality of life in women with breast cancer, from a surgical oncology practice in North Sydney, Australia, who undergo mastectomy and post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT).

Study details
All participants in this study will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires over a period of 5 years post-mastectomy in order to assess quality of life, pain, aesthetic outcomes and clinical outcomes. If immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is found to improve the quality of life of patients who are undergoing mastectomy and subsequent adjuvant treatments, then IBR could be offered as an option to breast cancer patients who are reasonable candidates for this procedure. This will be the first prospective cohort study in Australia to assess the quality of life of women undergoing mastectomy and PMRT, and allows for comparison of outcomes according to breast reconstruction choices - immediate, delayed or none.
