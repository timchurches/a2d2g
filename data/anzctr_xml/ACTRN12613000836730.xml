  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>we will study the effect of adding aerosolized albuterol to lung recruitment maneuver during the managment of ALI due to surgical and non-surgical causes e.g acute lung injury following aspiration pneumonia , abdominal sepsis, pancreatitis, chest trauma , lobectomy,and so on </healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>we will test the value of adding aerosolized albuterol sulphate 5mg dissolved in 10 ml sterile saline and nebulised by connecting the nebulizer to the endotracheal tube  during mechanical ventilation of patients with acute lung injury (ALI) together with lung recruitment maneuver which is done in the form of increasing the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 10 cm H2O above the lower infliction point for 15 minutes or 10 cmH2O above the pre-recruitment PEEP  to be repeated every four hours for five to seven successive days  in a trial to improve alveolar fluid clearance and improve oxygenation in these patients  </interventions>
    <comparator>  the control treatment is  Placebo (Saline) 10ml nebulised by connecting the nebulizer to the endotracheal tube during mechanical ventilation of patients with ALI together with lung recruitment maneuver). </comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>aveolar fluid clearance measured by protein concentration in alveolar fluid lavage in broncho-alveolar samples will be  collected just before RM. and  ,1 and 4 hours after RM using A 14 French 51 cm catheter  passed through the endotracheal tube and wedged into the distal airway with contentious suction was applied to it (-400 cm) to obtain edema fluid at least    1 ml which was collected in a sterile Eppendorf tube for immediate analysis ( Eppendorf SA, Hamburg , Germany) in the clinical pathology Lab.</outcome>
      <timepoint> alveolar fluid samples will be withdrawn before recruitment maneuver , one hour after recruitment maneuver and four hours after recruitment maneuver and sent to the lab for protein concentration measurement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>mean arterial oxygen tension will be measured by arterial blood sample from the radial artery</outcome>
      <timepoint>  arterial blood gas (ABG) sample analysis is done just before lung recruitment maneuver , one and four hours after lung recruitment maneuver </timepoint>
