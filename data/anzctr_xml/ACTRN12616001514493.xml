  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention for this study is anatomically directed upper airway surgery with the aim of resolving obstructive sleep apnoea.
The specific set of operations performed will be tailored to each patient based on a comprehensive assessment of upper airway anatomy performed by staff specialist Ear Nose and Throat surgeons at Monash Health - a tertiary university teaching hospital.
The operations may include one or more of: turbinate surgery, septoplasty, modified uvulopalatopharyngeoplasty, adenoid surgery, palatine tonsil surgery, lingual tonsil surgery, tongue channelling.
Typically the combination of surgical procedures will be performed in one separation but in certain circumstances the combination of operations may be performed over 2 or more separations.
The duration of the operating procedure is contingent upon the combination of procedures performed but would typically occur over 1-2hrs.
Surgery will be conducted at Monash Health by staff of The Ear, Nose and Throat/Head and Neck Surgery Unit, Monash Health.
Follow-up to determine effect on obstructive sleep apnoea will occur 3 months post surgery.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 24 OSA patients will give 80% power with an alpha=0.05 to detect a reduction of 15+/-25 (SD) in AHI (values calculated from the mean reduction in AHI during application of mandibular advancement devices - another anatomically based treatment, in a previous study by our group). Therefore, in order to allow for participant attrition (~30%), 30 patients will be enrolled.

Significant improvement in AHI and the OSA traits pre- and post-surgery will be assessed using paired Students t-test. If our data are non-parametric, the appropriate nonparametric tests (i.e. Mann-Whitney) will be used. 

Data from the research polysomnogram (PSG) will provide baseline pathophysiological information for each patient. Multiple linear regression will be conducted to determine which baseline clinical and physiological variables are independently related to the greatest therapeutic reduction OSA severity (measured by apnoea-hypopnoea index, AHI). Furthermore we will conduct a 'responder' versus 'non-responder' analysis. Briefly, patients will be classified as a responder to surgery if they demonstrate a 50% reduction in their AHI &amp; an AHI on therapy of less than 10 events per hour. Independent samples t-tests (or non-parametric equivalent) will then assess which baseline clinical and physiological variables separate 'responders' from 'non-responders'.
Changes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics pre- and post-surgery will be assessed using paired Student's t-test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) affects 1.5 million Australians and results in significant morbidity and mortality. However, half of patients cannot tolerate the leading treatment, continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP). For those intolerant of CPAP, a common treatment alternative involves upper airway surgery (UAS). Unfortunately, a significant number of patients referred for this treatment do not respond and suffer from residual OSA with its inherent cardiovascular and neurocognitive consequences. Furthermore, current clinical predictive tools are poor at identifying responders to UAS and there are no proven additional therapies to offer those patients failing UAS treatment.
The key to providing better predictors of OSA resolution with UAS is to understand how these interventions affect the physiology responsible for OSA. It is clear that UAS improves upper airway anatomy/collapsibility. However, poor upper airway anatomy is not the only factor contributing to OSA. Recent evidence suggests that several additional, non­anatomical, physiological traits contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA including: 1) an oversensitive ventilatory control system (i.e. high loop gain), 2) a low respiratory arousal threshold, and 3) poor pharyngeal dilator muscle effectiveness characterised by an inability of the pharyngeal muscles to hold open or stiffen the airway during sleep. However, it is not known how UAS alter these non­anatomical traits and whether abnormalities in these traits are the reason for the variability in the success of UAS treatments. Furthermore, it is also not known if targeting non­ anatomical traits with additional treatments (i.e. combination therapy) will improve outcomes for those patients who have had only a partial response to UAS. Our goal is to be able to accurately identify which OSA patients are good candidates for UAS therapy by identifying robust predictors of OSA resolution with these interventions. Furthermore, we aim to offer additional treatments to salvage those patients who have failed to respond completely to UAS.</summary>
