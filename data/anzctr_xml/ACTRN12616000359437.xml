  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most colorectal surgery is now performed laparoscopically. Therefore most pain is deep inside the abdomen rather than the small incisions on the abdominal wall. 
This study would like to use a pain management technique that uses local anaesthetic infused via plastic catheters into the intraperitoneal space in the abdomen, close to the internal incisions. It is hoped that by doing this patients will need to use less opioid drugs and thereby avoid the side effects of these drugs and possibly recover more quickly from the surgical procedure with less pain.

Currently there are many different pain management techniques used after surgery and include:
-Intravenous pain medication with opioid drugs such as Morphine or Fentanyl.
-Epidural (small plastic tube inserted near spinal cord where medication can be given) with a combination of local anaesthetic drugs +/- morphine-like drugs.
-Local anaesthetic blocks via small plastic tubes placed between the abdominal muscles at the time of operation and allow for local anaesthetic to be given between these muscles.
-Oral pain medication such as paracetamol and oxycodone.
-A combination of any of the above techniques.
These techniques can have side effects especially with the Morphine-like drugs that can be a problem in patients having surgery on the bowel and include:
-Nausea and vomiting
-Reduced bowel function (constipation or bowel temporarily stops working - ileus)
-Drowsiness or sleepiness
-Slowed respiratory rate and reduced cough
-Reduced mobility leading to prolonged bedrest
-Increased risk of blood clots due to immobility

Because of these side effects the study is designed to see if the local anaesthetic infused intraperitoneally will result in improved pain relief, mobility, earlier return of gut function and less complications,
