  <interventions>
    <interventions>People who are admitted to a metropolitan hospital and newly diagnosed with heart failure and referred to the heart failure clinical nurse specialist clinic will be invited to participate in the study. Recruitment period will be over a three month period. Non-probability sampling will be used for this research.  This research will be conducted in a metropolitan hospital in New Zealand.
The educational intervention will be a one off educational session prior to discharge from hospital. The session will take place in inpatient wards where patients with heart failure are admitted to and being assessed, diagnosed, educated, referred and discharged home. The post discharge questioning will take place over the telephone once participants have discharged home within 48 hours from the researchers office and at an outpatient clinic at two weeks following discharge. . 
Participants recruited to the educational intervention will be given additional education by the heart failure clinical nurse specialist (researcher). An appropriate time will be made with the participants, family members and researcher to go and provide a brief focused educational session on heart failure self-monitoring. Each session will take approximately between 10 to 20 minutes. The session will include focusing on the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand weight diary resource given to patients and the researcher will explain the importance of daily weighing, monitoring for changes in breathing and checking for any oedema. 
The participants will be advised that the heart failure clinical nurse specialists will be in phone contact with them (both groups) within 48 hours following discharge and booked into the heart failure clinic at two weeks following discharge (both groups). Participants will also able to ask any questions at that time. 
The collection tool intended for use for this study will be a heart failure phone questionnaire. The questionnaire includes initial referral information including if patients have already received heart failure self-management education and if they have received the heart failure resources. A set of 10 questions will be asked based on self-management principles and NYHA functional classification at a 48 hour and two week time intervals. The questionnaire is in the form of a yes/no tick box in each time interval section. This questionnaire will be used to reflect the aims of the study.  Participants recruited to the control or usual care groups will be followed up and questioned at time intervals by other heart failure clinical nurse specialist other than the researcher to avoid any bias

</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants recruited to the control group or usual care, will be given discharge education by the ward nurses prior to discharge home. This involves basic heart failure education on furosemide diuretic education, giving patients the Heart Foundation of New Zealand weight diary and ensuring patients can self-manage including monitoring daily weights and changes in breathing. This session may take approximately 10-30 minutes.  Patients are then given a pack that includes information about heart failure and referred to the outpatient heart failure clinical nurse specialist clinic. Participants in the control comparator group will be followed at timely intervals and questioned as is the intervention group at 48 hour and at the two week clinic appointment.

    <inclusivecriteria>Patients who are admitted during the three month recruitment period to a metropolitan hospital, treated and newly diagnosed with heart failure meet the initial criteria for recruitment..

    <concealment>The sample will be sourced from the referrals made to the metropolitan hospital’s heart failure clinical nurse specialist clinic. Patients who meet the criteria will be given an information sheet about the study and invited to participate by the researcher. The researcher will make a time to go back to see patients and obtain written consent. Once consent is obtained participates will be randomised into the control or intervention groups. The researcher’s medical secretary will have  40 envelopes which will have either intervention or control group labelled once opened. The medical secretary will hand an envelope to the researcher and the researcher will open the envelope at the bedside with the consenting participants. If participants are recruited to the control group no further information will be provided by the researcher during the discharge process until the post discharge questioning  at 48 hours. If participants are recruited to the intervention group, another time will be made with the participants for the researcher to commence the bedside education. </concealment>
    <sequence>simple randomization will be used for this study. Once participants are consented, a computer generated system will assist in randomizing participants to one of two groups. </sequence>

Descriptive statistical analysis describes and produces raw data and shows trends and patterns. Data will be condensed and summarised into meaningful units to show mode, medians and means of questionnaire answers. Data will be presented in the form of percentages and raw figures and to allow variables to be analysed were  in a measurable form of numbers and scores. Nominal measurement will be used to classify answers into categories and frequency distribution to group answers </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>
This research will determine if a focused educational session by a heart failure clinical nurse specialist prior to discharge has any significance on the patients self-adherence to medications, self-monitoring and any change to their condition.  Data collected will be able to be used by clinicians working in areas of heart failure and highlight areas where heart failure patients may require more specific education during the delivery of education at discharge. This research may assist in the development or teachings required for health professionals working in areas of heart failure in order to promote heart failure patient outcomes. </summary>
