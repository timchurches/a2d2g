    <interventions>Description of Intervention/Exposure

The treatment proposed in this clinical investigation plan is to repeatedly administer intra-arterial chemotherapy to hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer when the blood flow to and from the liver has been isolated via balloon catheters. The objective of this study is to evaluate the tumour response, progression-free survival, morbidity and mortality of repeated and isolated intra-arterial hepatic infusion of oxaliplatin compared with the gold standard 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) treatment.

The treatment proposed in this study is based on the hypothesis that direct arterial infusion of chemotherapy to metastatic tumours of the liver whilst the blood flow to the organ is isolated could potentially yield benefits that cannot be achieved with existing treatment regimens.

There are three treatment stages; implantation of a vascular access device (known as the AVAS), intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions, and explantation of the AVAS.

Implantation: the participant is admitted to hospital and the AVAS is surgically implanted under general anaesthetic. The AVAS is an implantable large bore cannula with one end that can be anastomosed directly onto a peripheral vessel and the opposite end exiting the patients skin. The device can be opened to access the patients vasculature when required and closed when the device is not in use.  In accordance with the manufacturers Instructions-For-Use (IFU), the AVAS will be implanted in the axillary artery (i.e. the upper pectoral area) or in the common femoral artery (upper thigh) by a trained vascular surgeon. The implantation procedure takes around 2 hours. After implantation, the participant is monitored overnight.

Intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions: the participant is admitted to the angiography suite and under general anaesthetic or conscious sedation, intra-arterial hepatic isolation chemotherapy infusion is administered by an interventional radiologist. The first infusion can be administered 2 days after device implantation and infusions are spread out over an 8-week period at a maximum such that the patient receives 5 to 7 infusions in total, has at least 2 full calendar days between each infusion, and there are no more than 2 infusions over any 7 consecutive days. Each infusion can take between 2-3 hours during the first few infusions but should only take 1-2 hours for the remaining infusions as the radiologist becomes familiarised with the patients vascular anatomy. During the Phase Ib stage, the starting dose of the oxaliplatin infused will be 50mg/m^2 and this dose will be escalated by 5mg with each patient until an optimal dose is established. The optimal dose will be used for all patients enrolled during the Phase II stage. 

Explantation: the final infusion session is followed by the device explantation immediately, or at a later time depending on the availability of operating rooms and the condition of the participant. The surgical removal of the device takes approximately 1-2 hours, the participant is monitored overnight and discharged the next day.

In addition, capecitabine will be administered orally as per standard care (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily in 2 week cycles) throughout the study treatment period (from enrolment to 4-5 weeks after the AVAS explantation) as a form of systemic disease management. The oncologist may modify the capecitabine dose/frequency based on the patients response to the medication. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is a PhaseIb/II study.

The Phase Ib study is a dose escalation study to establish a safe and recommended dose that will be used in the Phase II stage of the study. This stage is comprised of an accelerated stage and a confirmation stage. During the accelerated stage, patients will be treated one-by-one and the dose escalated after each patient until dose limiting symptoms are observed. From here the confirmation stage is initiated and patients can be treated with the same dose in groups of 3 until the dose limit is confirmed. The last dose used prior to the observed dose limit will be the dose used for the Phase II stage of the study. The number of patients required for the Phase Ib stage of the study cannot be reliably estimated. 

The Phase II study will assess the study treatment against historical information of comparable populations to provide binary endpoints (H0: non-clinically significant improvement in response rate; H1: clinically significant improvement in response rate). Based on the known response rate of approximately 50% (P0 = 0.50) for comparable patient cohorts, it was decided that the study treatment needed to yield a response rate of at least 70% (P1 = 0.70) with a statistical power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05 to be considered as a clinically significant improved response rate. The null hypothesis must be rejected for the study treatment to be considered successful.

Sample Size &amp; Stage Design - For ethical and safety reasons, the Phase II study will be split into two stages. Stage 1 will be completed once the primary endpoint (tumour response 4-5 weeks post-explantation) for the first 23 patients (not including those in the Phase Ib component) have been assessed. A minimum of 13 patients must respond to the treatment for the study to continue. If the number of responsive patients at the end of Stage 1 is less than 13, patient enrolment will be ceased, the study shall be terminated, and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Stage 2 is complete once the primary endpoint for a total of 37 patients (not including those in the Phase Ib component) has been assessed. A minimum of 24 patients must respond for the null hypothesis to be rejected.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of delivering chemotherapy treatment through the arteries directly to the liver, bypassing the main blood supply throughout the body. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you are aged over 18 years, have hepatic metastases from histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon/rectum, and have had some systemic chemotherapy. 

Study details
Once enrolled, patients will have baseline scans and will have the AVAS device implanted. The patient will be admitted to hospital up to twice a week to be treated with the liver directed therapy until they have received 5-7 treatments of oxaliplatin, after which the device will be explanted. Oxaliplatin is approved in Australia as chemotherapy treatment for liver metastases from colorectal cancer (via IV infusion), but has not previously been approved when delivered to through the arteries to the liver using the AVAS study device. All patients will also receive Capecitabine from enrolment to 4-5 weeks after the AVAS explantation as a form of systemic disease management. The patients tumour will be scanned 4-5 weeks after explant of the device, and the patient will be followed up for two years. 

The treatment proposed in this study is based on the hypothesis that direct arterial infusion of chemotherapy to metastatic tumours of the liver whilst the blood flow to the organ is isolated could potentially yield benefits that cannot be achieved with existing treatment regimens.</summary>
