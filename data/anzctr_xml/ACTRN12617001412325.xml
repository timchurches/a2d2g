  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program will involve 13 un-structured mentoring sessions of up to 3 hours each, ideally completed fortnightly, over 6 months. Mentoring activities are guided by each individualised mentee "Wellness Plan" formulated during Session 1. This focuses on the mentees short-term goals in the following domains: living circumstances and skills, health, self-care, social relationships and connectedness, creative interests and hobbies, work/career and education, identity and sense of self, community roles and responsibilities. The Wellness Plan also outlines the mentees current recovery strategies (e.g., thoughts, feelings, behaviours, characteristics, personal qualities, interests, activities, relationships)  that support the mentee to remain healthy as well as articulate warning signs (e.g., symptoms, thoughts, images, feelings, mood, behaviours) that indicate additional professional support or treatment should be sought. Mentors will also complete their own amended Wellness Plan which allows them to document self-care strategies and identify potential risks to ensure that program staff can support and ensure the mentor role is not detrimental to their continued health and wellbeing. 
Sessions 2-12 of the mentoring activities focus on supporting the mentee to work toward their identified goals through community-based activities such as supermarket shopping, self-care activities, reconnecting with community or navigating social interactions involving food. Mentors share aspects of their own recovery stories to promote hope and provide an empathic response to the challenges associated with recovery.
Mentees will be assigned to one mentor. However, mentors may be assigned to more than one mentee.
All mentoring sessions will ideally be face-to-face. When face-to-face sessions are not practical, sessions may be completed over the telephone. Sessions 1 and 13 will be completed on-site at EDV, with sessions 2-12 being delivered in a variety of community settings i.e. local shopping centres, parks, cafes. Mentees and mentors will not be permitted to meet in either persons home. 
Adherence to the mentoring sessions will be monitored by EDV staff who will assist in scheduling mentoring sessions and providing support to mentees and mentors.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Fourteen partiicpants in the mentor group will berecruited. A minimum of 14 participants in the mentee group will also be recruited. This will enable sufficient power to identify differences between time points. 
Using qualitative estimates of sample size, the proposed participant numbers is deemed be sufficient to capture the variance in information that occurs within each participant group. Guest and colleagues (Guest et al., 2006) argue that data saturation, the point at which no new (additional) information related to the research aims and objectives is found in the data, occurs after as few as six interviews, with all information (themes) fully elucidated after 12 interviews. Our prior clinical-based qualitative research (Pritchard et al., 2016; Warren et al., in press-a; Warren et al., in press-b) indicates that this varies considerably based on the population under study, but typically occurs after 7 and 14 interviews.

Quantitative analyses will include within-groups analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and non-parametric assessments between time points, for mentees and mentors separately. Using the six-stage approach described by Braun and Clarke (2006), thematic analysis will be undertaken to identify key themes in the data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eating Disorders Victoria (EDV), the Austin Hospital and St Vincents Hospital are partnering to develop, pilot and evaluate a peer mentoring program for people with eating disorders exiting hospital programs. This program is intended to address a service gap for people who require additional support to sustain recovery while living independently. It uses a peer support model, harnessing the experience of people who have recovered from eating disorders, with regular de-briefing and supervision. The aims of this research are to evaluate the outcomes of the pilot program on both mentees and mentors.
Patients leaving the Austin Hospital or tranisition to/from BETRS day program will be linked with an EDV peer mentor who has recovered from an eating disorder. They will participate in a semi-structured mentoring program with regular activities and one-on-one mentoring (3-hour, fortnightly sessions). These sessions will run over 6 months. In addition, participants (mentees and mentors) will undertake feedback and de-briefing sessions throughout the program.</summary>
