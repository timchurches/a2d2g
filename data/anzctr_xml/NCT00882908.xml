    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 4 different regimens of TMC435 in
      combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (PegIFNa-2a) and ribavirin (RBV), defined as the
      proportion of patients with sustained virologic response at Week 72 (patients with
      undetectable plasma HCV RNA [less than 25 IU per mL undetectable] at the end of treatment and
      at Week 72), compared to the control group receiving PegIFN and RBV in combination with
      TMC435-matched placebo.</summary>
