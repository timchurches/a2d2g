  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigational product pentosan polysulfate (PPS) has various effects which suggest it may be useful in osteoarthritis.  Preclinical (laboratory and animal studies) and clinical (human) studies have supported its potential role in OA. PPS has been shown to:;
1.Inhibit the cartilage degrading enzymes which play a key role in OA progression 
2  Have anti-inflammatory effects including blocking the effects of the pro-inflammatory cytokines which are involved in osteoarthritis
3.   Have antithrombic, antifibrotic and antilipidaemic effects which may assist with improved blood circulation in the bone.

In this trial, patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee and associated Bone marrow lesions, who meet the study inclusion criteria, will be treated with either PPS or placebo, in a ratio of 1:1 according to a computer generated randomisation.  The treatment will be given in double-blinded fashion (so that neither the patient, nor the person administering the treatment and assessing responses will know which treatment the patient received)  

The treatment will be given by subcutaneous injection, twice weekly for 6 weeks.  Patients will visit the clinic according the the study schedule for the duration of treatment and up until Day 81, for monitoring and assessment of treatment responses, safety and adverse events recording.  

Treatment responses will be measured by changes in symptom scores according to KOOS questionnaire and NRS pain score at various time-points, and evolution of MRI images before treatment and at day 53.  

Patients will be further followed up with a phone call and symptom questionnaire on day 109 and 165.</summary>
