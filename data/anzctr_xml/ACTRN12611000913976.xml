    <studytitle>The Impact Pain, Anxiety and Stress Levels Have on Acute Burn Wound Healing in Children</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A prospective randomised control trial in children 4-12 years with an acute burn injury will determine the effect of the Ditto (Trademark(TM)) virtual reality-based intervention on time to healing (re-epithelialisation) when compared to standard practice (e.g. parental soothing, toys, books, TV).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>At every dressing change, before the wound care procedure, the child engages in the procedural preparation story called "Bobby gets a burn" on the Ditto(TM) device.  This takes place in the waiting area during the 20 minute waiting period for medication to take effect.  Then in the treatment room, during wound care procedures the child is distracted through engagement in touch and find stories or games on the Ditto(TM).  The child begins to use the distraction phase of the Ditto just before the nurse commences the wound care procedures and continues to engage in games/stories until the completion of the wound care procedures. 
This is repeated at every dressing change until healing.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard practice - the nurse may inform the child and describe what they intend to do during the wound care procedures.  Standard distraction includes the nurse chatting and distract them, parental soothing, toys, books and TV.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound healing (re-epithelialisation) measured through the Visitrak(TM) (performed every dressing change to track the size of the wound, marking wet and dry areas) as it heals over time; blinded review of photos; and consultant clinical judgement will also be used to determine days until re-epithelialisation.  

A scan will be performed with a laser Doppler imager on the first change of dressings to measure wound depth for comparison of wound healing and to assist in determining whether skin grafting is required.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured every dressing change until re-epithelialisation.  (Dressings are usually changed every 3 days).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stress will be measured through collection of saliva samples using Salivettes to be analysed for cortisol and alpha-amylase.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Collected every dressing change at:
1) Entering waiting area 
2) 0 minutes post dressing removal
3) 10 minutes post dressing removal
Then 3 months after re-epithelisation, a baseline saliva sample will be obtained.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain levels measured though self-report from the child using the faces pain scale revised and observational/behavioural FLACC scale (faces, legs, activity, cry, consolability) from nursing staff.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain ratings collected every dressing change at intervals:
1) upon entering waiting area of outpatient burns clinic (baseline)
2) upon entering treatment room
3) after dressing removal and wound debridement (retrospective score)
4) after new dressing application (retrospective score)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety will be measured using a VAS-Anxiety (visual analog scale) with children 8 years and above.

A Children's Trauma Screening Questionnaire (CTSQ) will be performed to determine long-term effects of anxiety and stress.</outcome>
      <timepoint>VAS-A will be measured alongside pain levels: 
1) upon entering waiting area of outpatient burns clinic (baseline)
2) upon entering treatment room
3) after dressing removal and wound debridement (retrospective score)
4) after new dressing application (retrospective score)

The CTSQ will be completed on the first dressing change and then 3 months after re-epithelisation.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Children presenting at the Stuart Pegg Paediatric Burns Centre (SPPBC) at the Royal Childrenâ€™s Hospital (RCH) Brisbane will be screened on admission for eligibility to this Prospective Randomised Control Trial.  

All children will continue to receive standard pain medication protocols and standard medical treatment throughout the study.  Children presenting for their first dressing change who meet inclusion criteria and give informed consent will be randomly allocated to the Ditto treatment of control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>A portable random number generator will be used with an odd number representing Ditto treatment group and an even number representing the control group.

A Qld Health staff member will be asked to check the random number generator and inform the primary researcher which group the child has been randomised to.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine whether the use of the Ditto(TM) device (a virtual reality based portable console, involving procedural preparation and distraction), used during acute burn wound care procedures with children 4-12 years, will result in reduced pain levels, stress levels and anxiety.  In addition, determine whether its use will improve the wound healing of children with acute burns compared to standard practice.</summary>
