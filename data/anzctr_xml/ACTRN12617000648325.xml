  <interventions>
    <interventions>Coronary microvessel function is evaluated in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary stenting. Index of microvascular resistance (IMR) represents microvascular function and is derived from measurements taken using a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped wire. These measurements are taken before and after coronary stents are deployed. The procedure is performed by the treating interventional cardiologist. Blood samples are collected to measure the inflammatory markers. Patient demographics and procedural characteristics data are collected.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the association between serum hsCRP level and coronary microvessel function. Index of microvascular resistance (IMR) which represents coronary microvessel function is assessed using a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped wire during coronary intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serum samples are collected from the coronary catheter at the start of the coronary intervention procedure. Baseline IMR is measured prior to coronary artery stenting. IMR measurement is repeated after coronary stenting.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Myocardial injury as assessed by peak serum troponin and creatine kinase (CK) levels. Troponin and creatine kinase (CK) were sequentially measured every 6 h up to a maximum of 24 h following coronary intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hours after coronary intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the impact of different antiplatelet medications (clopidogrel vs. ticagrelor vs. prasugrel) on microvascular function. These antiplatelet medications are routinely given to cardiac patients prior to coronary intervention. The choice of antiplatelet medications are at the discretion of treating cardiologist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Antiplatelet medications are commenced by the treating cardiologist at least 24 hours prior to coronary intervention. Baseline IMR is measured prior to coronary artery stenting. IMR measurement is repeated after coronary stenting.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis is performed using SPSS statistical software system. Continuous variables are summarised as mean+/-SD and are compared with the Student t test. Non-parametric tests are used where appropriate. Normality of data is assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smironov statistic. Logarithmic transformation of data is performed for non-normally distributed data. A Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is computed to assess the relationship between HsCRP, peak troponin and IMR of culprit vessels. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Myocardial infarction (Heart attack) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite re-opening blocked heart arteries, there is still a group of patients that have a worse outcome due to disease of smaller arteries, not visible with conventional diagnostic  x-ray imaging. A tool that directly measures involvement of the smaller arteries at the time of the initial heart attack would therefore be desirable.  The index of microvascular  resistance is such a technique that uses a special pressure wire to look at changes in flow in heart arteries in order to calculate resistance within the smaller vessels. We plan to use this tool in patients with heart attacks to assess the small vessel (microcirculatory) involvement. We will  also take a small amount of blood to look at specific blood tests that show degrees of inflammation and the function of blood cells. The blood sample will be stored in -80C freezer for various inflammatory markers tests at a later stage. We will also assess the effect of medications given for heart attacks on the small blood vessel function. The goal of this study is to investigate factors that influence the function of the small blood vessels. We will utilise this technique in order to improve treatment for all patients who have a heart attack and improve our understanding of the disease process and ultimately provide new treament options that may benefit the Australian community. </summary>
