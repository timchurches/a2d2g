  <interventions>
    <interventions>To compare the efficacy of additional doxycycline or Microdacyn gel with standard practices for prevention of intra-operative wound contamination in clean orthopaedic and pacemaker insertion surgery.        Patients will be randomly allocated to either the Doxycycline, microdacyn or control arms.
Doxycycline arm will receive 100mg orally twice daily for the two days before surgery and one dose on the morning of surgery.
Microdacyn arm will apply 20-40mls of Micodacyn gel to the surgical site four times a day for the two days before surgery and two doses on  the morning of surgery. 
Compliance of the regime will be monitored by the research assistant asking the patients about compliance and reactions etc</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> Incidence of Post-operative wound infection in the three study groups.
This will be assessed clinically and based on the definitions of wound infection  by the New Zealand Health Quality and Safety Commission Surgical Site Infection improvement programme, which in turn are based on the National Healthcare Safety Network definitions (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention 2015. Procedure-associated Events. www.cdc.gov/nhsn/PDFs/pscManual/9pscSSIcurrent.pdf?agree=yes&amp;next=Accept).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be routinely followed up at 21-28 days and one year post op via the research assistant asking them questions.  If they experience symptoms at other time points they will also be assessed and included in the data.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE)  in the three study groups will be recorded via the research assistant asking them questions. 
Examples of the TEAE's for doxycycline are indigestion, heartburn, feeling sick, vomiting, stomach upset or diarrhoea, vaginal thrush,  headache, sunburn, rash and dizziness 
TEAE's for Microdacyn is skin irritation

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The recruitment target for the study is upto 200 patients to account for dropouts and to increase statistical significance..  The primary outcome measure is quantitative bacterial contamination of the wound.  Based on previous data, we are expecting to grow from 0 to 1000 bacteria per case.  Based on a sample size of 150 participants (50 in each arm), the outcome of mean number of contaminating bacteria isolated from each wound, a possible reduction in bacterial load of 75 to 95% with one or both treatments, and a significant reduction in contamination deemed to be 50 to 75%, we have been advised by a statistician that we might achieve a statistically significant result if the participants are considered together.  The participants, however, will have undergone a variety of procedures so subgroup analysis based on procedure is unlikely to achieve statistically significant results.  We also do not expect to be able to achieve a statistically significant result for the outcome of wound infection rate, given that the rate of infection is likely to be less than 2%. 

 Interim analysis of the results will be undertaken once a month.  If the study shows a significant difference in efficacy or safety between the three groups at interim analysis then the study might be terminated. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Protocol: Randomized trial of doxycycline and Microdacyn versus standard care for prevention of intra-operative wound contamination in clean orthopaedic and pacemaker insertion procedures

Trial sites: Nelson Hospital, and Manuka St Hospital,  Nelson 7010

Laboratory: Medlab South, Nelson Hospital,

Background :This trial investigates the effect of pre-operative doxycycline or Microdacyn on intra-operative wound contamination.  

Objectives of the trial
To compare the efficacy of additional doxycycline or Microdacyn with standard practices for prevention of intra-operative wound contamination in clean orthopaedic and pacemaker insertion surgery.         

Trial design:  A randomized, unblinded, three-armed, parallel trial of efficacy, including 100 to 200 patients.   This trial is designed to be run according to the quality standards of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki for human trials.

Primary endpoint
1.	Bacterial contamination of intra-operative wound swabs. 

Secondary endpoints
1.	Post-operative wound infection.
2.	Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE).

Hypothesis: Prophylactic treatment with topical or oral antimicrobials reduces contamination and colonisation of surgical fields  </summary>
