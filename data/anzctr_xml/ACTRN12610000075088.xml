  <interventions>
    <interventions>Speech Pathology intervention, tracheostomy cuff deflation on ventilation, use of speaking valve.

This is early Speech Pathology intervention which involves cuff deflation during mechanical ventilation (limit positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) &gt;=10) and insertion of a Passy Muir Speaking valve into the venitaltion circuit.  The valve will be used for up to 1 hour day 1; 2 hours day 2; day 3 up to 4 hours and day 4 onwards up to 8 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Speech Pathology intervention, tracheostomy cuff deflation off ventilation, use of speaking valve.

Standard Speech Pathology intervention involves awaiting medical team referral to assess the patient for communication/swallow, at which stage the patient has been established off the ventilator - tracheostomy cuff deflation only occurs off mechanical ventilation.  The assessment involves assessment of facial muscles, deflation of tracheostomy cuff, swallow asssessment and attempts to voice.

The frequency of this treatment is delivered daily (Monday to Friday) and is delivered until complete cuff deflation is achieved and decannulation of the tracheostomy.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to verbal communication - this is defined as the ability to count aloud 1-10.</outcome>
