  <interventions>
    <interventions>Third generation hybrid contact lens. They are to be worn by study participants full time, for at least 8 hours during the daytime and removed before sleeping, for a total of 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) contact lens. These lenses have been previously worn by the study participants as their current mode of ocular correction. They are worn daily and removed before bedtime. Subjects are to have worn these lenses for at least 8 hours a day for a total of 6 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comfort. This will be assessed by questionnaires filled out by the study participant with help from a study investigator to answer any queries. This questionnaire has been specifically written for this study including some questions adapted from the The Contact Lens Impact on Quality of Life and the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire 2000.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 and 6 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Contact lens complications. This will be assessed using a non-invasive microscopy technique (slit lamp biomicroscopy). This will include temporarily staining the cornea with a harmless coloured dye (sodium fluorescein) to assess the corneal health. Contact lens complications will be graded with the Efron Grading scales.
Corneal thickness will be measured using an ultrasonic pachymeter which uses a probe that gently contacts the centre of the cornea. As it is a contact procedure, a short acting topical anaesthetic eye drop (benoxinate hydrochloride 0.4%) will be instilled.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 and 6 weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual acuity. This will be measured at high contrast with a Snellen letter chart and low contrast with a Bailey-Lovie reduced contrast chart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 and 6 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease of fitting. The ease of fitting will be assessed by comparing how many diagnostic lenses were ordered and trialled until a suitable fit of the lenses was achieved. The fitting of the lens is assessed by the positioning, coverage, movement, size and surface quality of the lens, and the dye (sodium fluorescein) pattern underneath the lens.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the initial fitting of the SynergEyes (trademark) contact lens.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1) All subjects over 16 years of age, previously diagnosed with keratoconus in both eyes.
2) Keratoconic subjects who are prepared to try SynergEyes (trademark) hybrid contact lenses as a form of visual correction.
3) Keratoconic subjects who have worn RGP contact lenses for at least 8 hours a day for at least 6 weeks before commencing this study.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate satisfaction with SynergEyes (trademark) hybrid contact lenses and gather information to design and power a larger study to investigate clinical effects. We will measure and assess the ease of fit, comfort and vision, as well as monitoring changes in eye health throughout the project. This will give an indication of the success of fitting SynergEyes (trademark) hybrid lenses in comparison to RGPs. We will also monitor any adverse side effects from SynergEyes (trademark) hybrid lenses.</summary>
