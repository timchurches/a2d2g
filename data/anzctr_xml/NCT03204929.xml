             to screening visit

          -  Use of amantadine and/or anticholinergics allowed provided dose is stable for at least
             8 weeks prior to screening visit

          -  Use of CNS-acting medications allowed provided dose is stable for at least 4 weeks

          -  Women and men with partners of childbearing potential must take effective
             contraception while on study and women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test and be non-lactating at screening</inclusivecriteria>

          -  Taking = 3 dopaminergic medications

          -  Exposure to typical or atypical antipsychotics or other dopamine blocking agents
             within 6 months prior to screening visit

          -  Exposure to any other investigational agent within 6 months or 2 investigational
             agents within 12 months prior to screening visit

          -  Known immune compromising illness or treatment

          -  History of brain surgery for PD, including deep brain stimulation and stem cell
             transplants

          -  History of cognitive or neuropsychiatric conditions

          -  Inability to swallow oral medications or presence of a GI disorder (eg, malabsorption)
             deemed to jeopardize intestinal absorption of study drug

          -  Active GI disease (excluding GERD) within 30 days prior to screening visit

          -  Presence of any of the following clinical conditions:

        any significant non-PD CNS disorder; drug abuse or alcoholism; unstable cardiac, pulmonary,
        renal, hepatic, endocrine or hematologic disease; active infectious disease; AIDS or
        AIDS-related complex; malignancy within 3 years of screening (other than fully excised
