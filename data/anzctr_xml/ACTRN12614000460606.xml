  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study duration is a total of 16 weeks; 2- week lead in, 4-week intervention, 4 week washout, 4-week intervention, and final 2-week follow-up.  The cross-over design will be completed using the kiwifruit intervention (2 green kiwifruit per day (Actinidia deliciosa var. Hayward), compared to a positive control intervention of psyllium  (11g  of psyllium per day providing 6g fibre).  Compliance to the consumption of the kiwifruit will be monitored by measuring plasma vitaman C levels over the course of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be asked to consume 11g of Psyllium daily (mucillage) as the control for this study.  This treamtent phase will be four 4 weeks.  The psyllium will be supplied to participants as a powder which they can either sprinkle onto food or consume with liquid. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary measurement of the trial is Complete Spontaneous Bowel Motion frequency (CSBM /week) as a measure of overall bowel function in constipation.
The number, or occurrence, of CSBM is recorded by all participants in a daily diary recording bowel habits.
A spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) is defined as a stool not induced by rescue medication, whereas a CSBM was defined as an SBM associated with a sensation of complete evacuation
</outcome>
      <timepoint>CBSM will be measured daily across the 16 week study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A range of additional measures will be made via the daily diary questionnaires.  There will be a series of questions related to bowel habit and function:
1. frequency of BM 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily for the entire 16 weeks of the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. ease of defaecation

Will be measured by a question in the daily diary.  e.g Did you have to use any strain in order to defecate at any of the times you had a bowel movement?

This will be asked daily for the entire 16 weeks of the study</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily through daily diary over the entire 16 weeks of the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. stool form (Bristol Stool Scale)</outcome>
      <timepoint>measured daily through Bristol Stool Scale included in the daily diary over the entire 16 weeks of the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4.stool volume  (rated scale)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured subjectively through daily diary over the entire 16 weeks of the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bowel transit time.  Meaured in a sub group of main cohorts.  10 participants from each group of healthy, functionally constipated and IBS-C participants.  Measured using SmartPill technology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured during week two of each intervention phase (kiwifruit and pysllium treatment).  Each participant measures it twice</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>An initial calculation has been completed using available data. Based on a previous studies the standard deviation for the primary outcome (number of CSBM per week) is 1.41. In order to detect an increase in CSBM of 1.5 per week in the treatment group compared to the control group, with 90% power and 5% significance, 16 subjects are required to complete the trial. In order to account for an expected 25% dropout, 20 subjects will be recruited for each of three subject populations, or a total of 60 subjects. Further statistical analysis will be done by an independent statisitican. Statistical analysis will describe the relationship between the consumption of kiwifruit and the parameters of bowel habit and digestive comfort measured.  In addition the analysis will compare the effects of the 2 treatments (kiwifruit and psyllium), and determine the effects of these treatments in all groups (healthy, FBC and IBS-C).  
P values =0.05 will be considered significant.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Constipation is a common problem affecting up to 20% of the Worlds population. Laxative treatment for this condition is not without side effects and currently, there is a need for natural and safe alternatives.   The consumption of Kiwifruit is frequently used to treat constipation and digestive discomfort in New Zealand.   Clinical trials in this area are limited but some have shown significant improvements in digestive health (stool frequency, reduced constipation and well being) in both healthy and constipated individuals as well as those suffering from irritable bowel syndrome.  This study aims to examine the effect of daily consumption of two green kiwifruit in healthy individuals and in individuals with functional constipation and IBS as part of their everyday lifestyle to determine if the product is effective at improving bowel regularity, digestive discomfort, digestive health and function and gut health.  It will compare the efficacy of kiwifruit with psyllium (mucilage), a bowel bulking agent that has been shown to be an effective treatment for constipation.  The trial will be a randomized, single blinded cross over study where participants will consume either two green kiwifruit daily for four weeks or 11g psyllium powder for four weeks.  There will be a four week washout period in between and then the participants will swap over treatments for a further four weeks.  The trial will start and finish with a two week washout period.  Participants will be asked to complete a daily study diary (either online or by hand) to record daily bowel movement and general wellbeing during the study.  Faecal and blood samples will be collected at the beginning of the trial and at the end of each treatment period. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire relating to bowel health at these time points.</summary>
