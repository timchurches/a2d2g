  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention arm will undertake the comprehensive assessment at the commencement of the study, allowing allocation to one of three diagnostic sub-categories. These include 1) Slow transit alone; 2) Slow transit and delayed outlet; and 3) Delayed outlet alone. For each category, general and targeted interventions appropriate to the patient population will be trialed. These include general interventions such as hydration, exercise, toileting position and prescribing a toileting routine. Specific interventions for slow transit for example, will include the use of stimulant laxatives and for outlet delay will involve the prescription of a regular suppository. 

Participants randomised to the control groups will receive laxatives as recommended in the management of constipation by Australian Therapeutic Guidelines.

The Australian-modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS) will be used to assess eligibility. All patients will undergo the Bowel Symptom Questionnaire (BSQ), Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) and the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) on entry into the study regardless of which group they are allocated to. Family distress questionnaire will also be collected on entry into the study.
Clinical data and diagnostic interventions will also be collected with the investigations including measurement of colon transit times, and assessment of the structures of defecation with balloon expulsion and anal manometry. The investigations will require one week to complete.
For those randomised to the intervention arm, participants will undertake the diagnostic interventions prior to commencing the 14 day study period. Whilst this is underway, participants constipation will be managed as per usual care, and they will be asked to complete a 7 day bowel diary.
For those randomised to the usual practice arm, participants will be invited to participate in a sub-study where they undergo the same diagnostic interventions as the intervention group.
All participants will be assessed at day 14 with the PAC-SYM and the PAC-QOL, and family distress questionnaire. Whilst on the study, all people will be asked to fill out a daily diary which includes a bowel chart that records actual bowel movement and type, abdominal pain or bloating, and laxatives used. Finally, the ROME III Questionnaire to allow quantification of the numbers of people who come to palliative care services with a past history of functional constipation, and will allow an assessment as to whether this impacts the severity of symptoms they now experience. People will be stratified according to whether they had a feeling of complete evacuation less or more than 2 days per 7 days. Such stratification will allow a comparison of this with the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL. The Symptom Assessment Scale (SAS) and any adverse effects will be collected as part of this diary. Participants will also receive a telephone call on day 7 to collect data on diary compliance, side effects and medical care. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be laxatives as recommended in the management of constipation by Australian Therapeutic Guidelines.: Palliative Care (2010) as detailed below:

    <concealment>All people with a life-limiting illness and a diagnosis of constipation should be referred to the study. The clinician will undertake the initial discussion regarding participation. Obtaining consent for this study will be a process of information exchange between the study staff, the potential participant and any other person the potential participant believes should be included in the discussion.   The participant information sheet will be used as a basis for the discussion, which will cover all procedures, benefits, burdens and side effects expected or possible during the study.  The participant will be given opportunity (in time and physical capacity) to consider the study and formulate questions.  Any questions will be addressed and answered fully.
Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>The unit of randomisation for this study will be by participant. Individuals will be randomised to either the usual practice arm or the intervention are in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation tables are developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry).
The study nurse will be aware of treatment allocation and will assess participants after 14 days of treatment. The statistician will be blinded to participant’s sub-category and intervention.

Participants at each site will be allocated a series of identifying numbers. A two digit study number, a two digit site number, and a sequential three digit screening number will be allocated on referral to the study. This ID number will be used for all subsequent study documentation for that participant. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Constipation is a common, distressing and serious symptom, affecting between 50-90% of people referred to specialist palliative care services, with 40-70% of people failing to achieve adequate symptom control. The number of people failing to achieve satisfactory symptom relief is not acceptable as inadequate symptom relief is responsible for adding to individual and societal burdens. In palliative care, decisions regarding the prescription of laxatives are based predominantly on clinical experience and institutional approaches. Many of these do not consider the pathophysiological basis that underlies the symptom of constipation. This approach is very dissimilar to that adopted by gastroenterologists in the treatment of non-palliative care patients. The most striking difference is the limited information to categorise the palliative population into the groupings that gastroenterologists would routinely use, thereby limiting the ability to tailor interventions to improve symptom control. This study will aim 
1). To develop an approach to constipation that enables the underlying problems (slow transit of colonic contents, delayed outlet of colonic contents or an overlap of these problems), to be quantified in palliative care patients using well-tolerated and validated diagnostic methods;
2). To compare whether the constipation severity of those patients randomly allocated to a mechanistic approach to the assessment and treatment of constipation within different sub categories have better patient outcomes than people palliated using standard current clinical care.</summary>
