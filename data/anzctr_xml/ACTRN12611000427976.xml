    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and a parent/guardian consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment doses will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, and 28.</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Therapeutic  Efficacy Testing For Artemether Lumefantrine in treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 3  sentinel sites (Katete, Mansa and Chipata) in Zambia.

Background: Therapeutic efficacy studies will be done in Zambia to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The participants will be febrile people above 6 months except female aged 12-18, inclusive. Patients will be treated with artemether-lumefantrine twice a day over 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Zambia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum.</summary>
