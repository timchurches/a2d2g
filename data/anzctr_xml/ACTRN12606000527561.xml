  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ATAC trial is testing an alternative, new agent, to tamoxifen for women with early breast cancer.  The new agent, Arimidex, is an aromatase inhibitor which acts to reduce the level of circulating oestrogen in post menopausal women. This drug seems to be well tolerated and also effective against breast cancer. 

The ATAC trial is a double blind study comparing 5 years of tamoxifen, with 5 years of Arimidex, and with 5 years of tamoxifen plus Arimidex. In addition, there are three very important sub studies which investigate the effects of the treatments on bone, the endometrium and quality of life (QOL). Australia had a high rate of recruitment to the QOL sub study and is also one of the few countries contributing to the endometrial sub study. 

The ATAC trial is one of the largest (over 9000 women internationally) and most rapidly completed breast cancer studies in the world. Active accrual to the main study and sub-studies was completed internationally in May 2000, and patient follow-up continues.</summary>
