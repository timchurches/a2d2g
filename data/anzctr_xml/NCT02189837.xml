  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL) Apolipoprotein B-100 Fractional Catabolic Rate (FCR) - The fractional catabolic rate (the percentage of apolipoprotein B-100 in LDL which is replaced, transferred or lost per unit of time) was measured at Baseline and Day 50 over 5 consecutive days using the stable isotope tracer, D3-leucine. LDL particles were isolated from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, and isotopic enrichment was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mathematical modelling of the protein enrichment data was used to estimate protein catabolism.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (5 days prior to Day 1) and Day 50; plasma samples for fasting lipids were obtained at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min, as well as at 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 hours, and 2, 3, 4 and 5 days after D3-leucine administration.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in LDL Apolipoprotein B-100 Production Rate (PR) - The production rate of apolipoprotein B-100 in LDL was measured at Baseline and Day 50 over 5 consecutive days using the stable isotope tracer, D3-leucine.

      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Lipoprotein (a) Fractional Catabolic Rate (FCR) - The fractional catabolic rate (the percentage of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) which is replaced, transferred or lost per unit of time) was measured at Baseline and Day 50 over 5 consecutive days using the stable isotope tracer, D3-leucine. Lp(a) was isolated from plasma using an immunoprecipitation method employing immunomagnetic beads and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isotopic enrichment was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mathematical modelling of the protein enrichment data was used to estimate protein catabolism.</outcome>
