    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified and screened at the pre-admission clinic at the Launceston General Hospital and include patients who are booked for total knee or hip arthroplasty.  Pre-admission clinic occurs prior to a planned admission for elective surgery and is an opportunity for patients to be screened for conditions which may impact on their operative suitability and be prepared for surgery with the necessary pre-operative care.
Randomisation and preparation of trial drugs will be conducted by the pharmacy department at the Launceston General Hospital.  The pharmacy is utilising central radomisation by computer. At the beginning of each week pharmacy will prepare randomisation packs for the number of participants who are booked for arthroplasty that week; this information will be provided to them by the research assistant. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary sample size has been calculated based on length of stay, as a key outcome for resource utilisation, and a surrogate outcome of post-operative recovery and hence immediate post-operative patient outcomes.  

Using existing data which has been collected by the PI from a previous study in a similar population, in order to detect a 20% reduction in length of stay from an expected value of 6.4 days (SD 2.7) with a power of 80% a sample size of 71 is required for each group.  As loss to follow up is not likely to be a significant issue in this study, we will aim for a sample size of 142.  </statisticalmethods>
