  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both child and parent/carer who are randomised into the vibration arm of the study, will be instructed by the treating  physiotherapist to use the Juvent vibration plate. They will be asked to undertake a 12 months program, to stand on the plate for 20 minutes daily.
Frequency is at a low-level (30Hz) as these forces are less than the skeleton experiences through normal ambulation,as such unlikely to result in adverse skeletal events.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment group:- children randomised into the control arm of the study will continue their normal level of activity with standard care, investigations as per treatment for Osteogenesis Imperfecta(brittle bones)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle and Functional Measurements:-
*Peak Jump Force (PJF), Peak Jump Power (PJP) &amp; Jump velocity, performed on the Leonardo Jumping Platform, includes a computer program for analysis.
*Maximum Force in relation to body weight, where the children are asked to do multiple one-legged jumps on the Leonardo Jumping Platform.
*Chair Raising Test, (5 time in ane cycle) sit to stand on the Leonardo Jumping Platform.
*Grip Force, using a standard hand dynamometer.
*Functional Assessment for gross-motor and self-care abilities.
* Mobility using the Bleck Score e.g 0 (does not walk - 3 (able to walk in the community).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 and 12 months
Functional Assessment is also done at baseline, 3, 6 &amp; 12 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Densitometric Measurements:-
1. Peripheral Quantitive Computer Tomography (pQCT) using 3 sites of the non-dominant Tibia, analysis of total and trabecular volumetric bone mineral density.
2. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)using total body and lumbar spine, analysis of bone mineral content, projected bone area and lean tissue mass.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Radiological Measurements:-
*Antero-posterior and lateral thoraco-lumbar spine. Cobb angle (AP) and vertebral morphometry will be assessed.
Additional x-rays only as clinically indicated e.g follow-up fractures, performed 6th monthly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, (6) and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Chemistry Measurements:- the following biochemical measures are to be performed:-
Whole Blood (Full blood count), Serum and Urine. Analysis of biochemical homeostasis</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exploratory and Safety measurments
*Patient Questionaire, to evaluate the acceptibility of the whole body vibration trial.
*Physical examination, at each visit a physical will be performed, this includes weight and height measurements. growth rates will be calculated from the height  measurements.
*Fracture Rates, diagnosed according to radiological evidence. Parents are asked to report by telephone within 24 hours.
*Skeletal Pain, a dairy is to be kept to record episodes of pain. The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating scale will be used at each visit.
*Quality of Life, using the PedsQL questionaires, according to specific age groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims of this project: 
*To investigate if whole body vibration training is effective and well tolerated over the short-to medium-term.
*Medium-term home based training program will evaluate if whole body vibration training influences:- mobility, muscle power and force, muscle mass &amp; bone mass.
The hypothesis:-
*Is that over a six month period the aims of effectivness and tolerance can be noted in children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.</summary>
