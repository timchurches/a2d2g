  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The B-VAX Project proposes to support an accredited nurse immuniser to deliver the HBV vaccine to approximately 150 PWID 'in the field' (Footscray, Frankston and Melbourne Central Business District) by using assertive outreach methods and contingency management (small motivational cash incentives) to maximize vaccination course completion.  The study will be designed as a randomised control trial (RCT) that will compare the efficacy of two differing vaccine schedules. 

PWID who have been serologically confirmed as susceptible to HBV infection will be identified from the Melbourne Injecting Cohort Study (MIX) and approached to participate. Consenting participants have already established good rapport with the field researchers, increasing their likelihood to participate in the study. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to either of the two arms of the study and be provided with the HBV vaccine adhering to either the standard schedule of vaccine delivery at 0, 1 &amp; 6 months, or an opportunistic accelerated schedule, receiving the vaccine at a minimum of 0, 7 &amp; 21 days, with a booster dose 12 months after the third vaccine at ~21 days depending on their immune response to the first three doses. 


Participants will also be provided with health promotion and prevention education.  Participants will have a blood test after each vaccine dose and 6 weeks after the completion of the vaccine schedule to determine their body's immunological response to the vaccine. A sub- set of participants will be invited to answer questions exploring the enablers and barriers for HBV vaccination in a set of open ended questions.
