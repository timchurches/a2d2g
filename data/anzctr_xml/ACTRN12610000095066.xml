  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention conditions receive ONE of ethier an internet-based tailored decision support intervention, or internet-based non-tailored decision support intervention.  In each intervention, participants answer questions concerning their perceived susceptibility to Colorectal cancer (CRC) and attitudes towards CRC screening.  Tailored responses are then generated for the 'tailored group' which are designed to correct misaprehensions where they exist.  For the non-tailored group participants do not receive tailored messages but rather generic information brochures concerning Colorectal cancer.  This intervention is accessed once only and participants work through it at their own pace.  The overall duration of the study will be approximately 12 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of participants completing a colorectal cancer screening test per group.  All participants receive a free Colorectal Cancer screening test and the number of kits returned per study arm is recorded upon return of the kit</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Usability of the decision tool.  This will be assessed by phone interview at the conclusion of the study.  Participants will be asked about how well they thought the decision tool operated and will be asked to identify issues which they thought were difficult etc.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of utilisation of an internet-based personalised decision support (PDS) tool on screening behaviour for Colorectal Cancer.  Our hypothesis is that individuals who are provided access to the PDS will be more likely to participate in screening than those who are not provided access.  The study fits in with the aim of improving participation in CRC screening nationally, and if effective the PDS can be implemented on a large scale; for instance, as part of the Department of Health and Ageing's national screening program.</summary>
