  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This surveillance study is a one-arm prospective evaluation of the clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated malaria. The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumfantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 3 sites Luang Prabang, Khammoune and Attapeu provinces in Lao PDR.  The WHO 28-day in vivo protocol will be used.  People with uncomplicated falciparum malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with the ACT artemether-lumefantine and monitored weekly for 28 days. The follow-up consists of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure during the follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy of the study drug. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence or reinfection.  The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Lao PDR in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.</summary>
