    <interventions>Hysteroscopic morcellator for removal of submucosal leiomyoma

A rigid tube 7mm in diameter is introduced into the uterine cavity.  It has a light source, camera head, and inflow and outflow valves, and channel to allow the morcellator to be inserted. The hysteroscopic morecellator is a rigid tube with a oscillating blade contained within a metal sheath. It works by sucking material into the open tube and the blade cuts the material and sucks in one movement. 

The hysteroscopic morcellator to be used is the Myosure (Registered trademark)

Distension medium is normal saline. The maximum amount allowed to be absorbed by the patient is 2500ml.  This will be controlled by aquasence (registered trademark) that will measure the inflow and outflow of normal saline

The procedure will be performed by a certified gynaecologist or trainee under their supervision.  All gynaecologists involved are experienced in the use of this device. 

The procedure will be undertaken under general anaesthetic

The duration of the procedure will depend on the type, number, and location of leiomyoma.  It is expected the average resection time will be 24 minutes. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>Monopolar electrosurgical hysteroscopic resection

The resectoscope is a rigid tube 10mm in diameter and it is introduced into the uterine cavity.  It has a light source, camera head, and inflow and outflow valves, and an operating channel to allow the instruments to be inserted into the uterus to undertake resection.  The monopolar loop is the instrument being inserted into the operating channel.  Using electrosurgery, the monopolar loop directly cuts into the leiomyoma and removes it in pieces under direct vision.  

Distension medium is glyciene. The maximum amount allowed to be absorbed by the patient is 1000ml.  This will be controlled by aquasence (registered trademark) that will measure the inflow and outflow of glyciene

The procedure will be performed by a certified gynaecologist or trainee under their supervision.  All gynaecologists involved are experienced in the use of this device. 

The procedure will be undertaken under general anaesthetic

The duration of the procedure will depend on the type, number, and location of leiomyoma.  It is expected the average resection time will be 30 minutes.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial is cost effectiveness. As the 2 procedures are identical in their initial approach, the 2 determining factors are cost of the device, and the operating theatre costs.  To identify the cost difference, the resection time of the leiomyoma is of primary importance. </outcome>

4.	Unintentional trauma to the genital system e.g. Perforated uterus
5.	Glycine Deficit &gt; 1000ml or Normal Saline &gt; 2500ml with resulting electrolyte disturbance

Major complications that may occur with resection of a submucosal leiomyoma include:
1.	Unintentional trauma to bladder, ureter, intestinal tract, fallopian tube, and ovary
2.	Trauma to the vascular system &gt; 500mL requiring blood transfusion
3.	Unplanned removal of organ e.g. ovary, fallopian tube, uterus, appendix
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Timepoints to identify adverse events include:
1. At the time of surgery

    <concealment>Point of entry into the study will occur during clinical consultation where hysteroscopy and removal or a leiomyoma is deemed necessary by the clinician.  There is no benefit to the clinician to enrol women without a leiomyoma.  As enrolment will occur after outpatient consultation, it is expected that women would present with symptoms relating to the leiomyoma.  If an incidental leiomyoma is identified sonographically in the absence of symptoms, this woman would not be eligible for inclusion in the study since determination of outcomes is not possible in this clinical setting. Following a decision to list a woman for a hysteroscopy and removal of a symptomatic leiomyoma, all women will be offered participation in the study subject should they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  </concealment>
    <sequence>After women have been enrolled into the study and completed their pre-operative documentation they will be randomised to treatment allocation. Randomisation of women into treatment groups will occur via phone to an automated service that uses simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>From an RCT of hysteroscopic resection examining clinical outcomes, resection time was reported with a mean of 49.4 minutes and standard deviation of 29.4 minutes. The surgeons in this RCT were all experienced consultants and other studies have reported a wide range of mean monopolar hysteroscopic resection times for submucosal leiomyomas ranging from 23.2min (SD 8.2min) to 42.2min (SD 2.5min).  When these studies are pooled, the mean hysteroscopic resection time is 30.6min (Variance 192.15, SD 13.9min).  
Accepting an estimated mean monopolar resection time of 30.6min, a sample size of 81 women in each group would be needed to detect a conservative 20% decrease in resection time with 80% power at the 5% significance level.
Analysis of all primary and secondary outcome measures will be on an intention-to-treat basis.  Demographic data will be compared using appropriate parametric and non-parametric statistical tests following the assessment of the distribution of the data by the Kolgarov-Smirnov method.  
An economic evaluation will be conducted to determine the relative costs and benefits of hysteroscopic morcellation versus electrosurgical resection. Medical costs will be estimated using the relevant MBS fees to each occasion of service; in-hospital treatment costs for the original procedure (hysteroscopic morcellator versus electrosurgical resection) and any repeat procedures carried out during the follow-up period will be estimated using standard hospital cost weights; and any pharmaceutical costs (for example for the treatment of fluid overload) will be estimated based on standard prescription protocols and pharmaceutical product prices.  Out of pocket costs will be measured as the difference between average fees paid by women for medical practitioner services, hospital services, pharmaceuticals and alternative therapies and any health insurance rebates (including Medicare) available to women for those services.  Costs directly associated with the trial (i.e. procedure and pharmaceutical costs) will be available from the treatment protocols and womens medical records.  The services of a health economist have been retained for the purposes of consultation at the time of initiation of this protocol and for analyses of data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the use of a mechanical hysteroscopic morcellator to monopolar electrosurgical
hysteroscopic resection to remove submucosal fibroid in symptomatic women. We hypothesize the hysteroscopic
morcellator may reduce intraoperative time and allow additional procedures to be performed in a single operating
list. The primary outcome of this study is to determine the difference if there is a difference in cost between two devices used to to resect the leiomyomas.  As the operating time will is the most likely to have an impact on this, the time to resect intrauterine pathology between these two different instruments, from insertion of the hysteroscope to removal of instrumentation will form part of this primary outcome. Secondary
outcomes include: Fluid deficit, Completeness of resection, and adverse events

This is a prospective, randomised, single blinded
study, with a minimum of 162 patients to be enrolled over a 1year recruitment period. All cases must satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and will be followed for 6 months after
surgery.

Following decision to list a woman for a hysteroscopy and resection of fibroid, women will be considered for the
study and offered participation. Women who qualify will be randomised to one of two groups: Hysteroscopic
morcellator (Myosure, Registered trademark) with normal saline distension medium or monopolar electrosurgical hysteroscopic resector
with a glycine distension medium.

To ensure concealment, randomisation of women into treatment groups will occur via phone to an automated
randomisation service. At the time of surgery, a diagnostic hysteroscopy will first be performed to confirm
requirement for resection of a fibroid. Those that do not require resection will continue to have outcome data
collected during the operation and followup
but will not be included in analysis.

Data collection will occur at: recruitment, on the day of admission for surgery and intraoperatively, postoperative
review at 6 weeks after index surgery, and postoperative
review at 6 months after index surgery. An economic
evaluation will be conducted to determine the relative costs and benefits of hysteroscopic morcellation versus
electrosurgical resection.</summary>
