    <summary>The purpose of the feasibility study is to examine audiological outcomes (audiometry and
      speech perception) and safety (adverse events and adverse device effects) with the Nucleus
      CI532 cochlear implant in group of adult subjects (n=12) who meet current criteria for
      cochlear implantation.</summary>
