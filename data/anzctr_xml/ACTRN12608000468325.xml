2. Radiographic evidence of OA will be based on the Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic system (either grade II or grade III severity primary tibio-femoral OA as a condition of inclusion). 

3. Fluent in the English language or able to give informed consent and complete study assessments with the assistance of an interpreter.

4. Provide written informed consent to participate in the study and be willing to comply with the study procedures.

2. Secondary OA or rheumatoid inflammatory or any other type of arthritis.

3. Previous and ongoing treatment with oral symptomatic slow acting drugs in OA (SYSADOA) treatment within 2 months before the study (e.g. glucosamine sulphate, chondroitin sulphate, diacerein, piascledine).

4. Requiring arthroplasty within 2 months or anticipating any need for a surgical procedure on the involved joint during the study.

5. Have received intra-articular treatment of the involved joint or joint lavage in the previous 6 months (e.g., corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid).

6. Knee surgery during the previous 3 months.

7. Hypersensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

8. Taking any regular prescribed medicine for OA during the trial except for medications pain that are taken as required for break-through pain. 

9. Any significant systemic illnesses or medical conditions that could lead to difficulty complying with the protocol;
