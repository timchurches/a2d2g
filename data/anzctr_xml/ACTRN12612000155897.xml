    <interventions>Emotional Engagement (EE) Treatment: EE treatment focuses on the affective dimension of parent-child relations, and is designed to be administered as a brief adjunct to best practice interventions for disruptive children (e.g., Behavioral Family Intervention).   It has been created specifically to boost warmth in parent-child relationships, and remediate deficits in eye contact by enhancing the salience of the eyes for high CU children.  The treatment involves parents engaging in simple love interactions with their children.  Specifically, parents will gently look into their childs eyes, help the child to return their gaze, and tell the child that they love them.  Each interaction is recorded, and reviewed with a therapist such that parents can discuss their experience, and set goals for improvement.  Parents are also required to practice Emotional Engagement exercises with the child every day, and are provided with a list of activities they can use at home.  

Behavioural Family Intervention Program - The Integrated Family Intervention for Child Conduct Problems (Dadds &amp; Hawes, 2006) program will be administered.  It focuses on managing child aggression, non-compliance and disruptive behaviour.  It aims to modify unhealthy parenting practices by targeting negative reinforcement contingencies operating in the family.  Parents are taught to encourage good behaviour by giving positive reinforcement and rewards, and discourage bad behaviour through the provision of consistent, emotionally neutral punishment.  The program consists of other modules (parental mental health, marital adjustment, family communication) which can be administered if needed.  The program is administered by a clinical psychologist to one or both parents/primary caregivers. 

Duration:  The EE treatment will be administered in conjuction with a Behavioural Family Intervention (BFI Program.  The BFI program is conducted over six weekly 1.5 hour sessions.  Each EE session will take place directly after each BFI session.  EE sessions will take approximately 15 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Child Centered Play (CCP): CCP is a well-established parenting strategy designed to help children be more independent.  It involves teaching parents to play with their children in a non directive way.  For example, letting the child direct play, following their lead, commentating their actions and not being prescriptive.  These practices increase child autonomy, independent learning skills and creativity.  Each play interaction is recorded, and reviewed with a therapist such that parents can discuss their experience, and set goals for improvement.  Parents are also required to practice Child Centred Play exercises with the child every day, and are provided with a list of activities they can use at home.

Duration:  The CCP treatment will be administered in conjuction with a Behavioural Family Intervention (BFI Program.  The BFI program is conducted over six weekly 1.5 hour sessions.  Each CCP session will take place directly after each BFI session.  CCP sessions will take approximately 15 minutes.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Levels of disruptive behavior

Levels of disruptive behavior will be assessed in three ways:

1. DSM-IV-TR diagnostic status for Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder as determined by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Adolescents and Parents (DISCAP; Johnson, Barrett, Dadds, Fox, &amp; Shortt, 1999).  

2. Oppositional and conduct symptom severity, also assessed with the DISCAP.

3. Independent observations of disruptive behavior from video recordings of a ten minute free play procedure with parents and child.  Videos will be coded using the FOS-VII coding schedule (Pasalich &amp; Dadds, 2009).  Videos will be coded for child non-compliance, criticisms, oppositionality, complaints and withdrawal.  Both the consistency and intensity of variables are coded, along a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (no occurrence of the behaviour) to 4 (behaviour occurred a lot of the time and/or was of very high intensity).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Pre-treatment assessment

2. Immediate post treatment assessment (e.g., within a week of completing treatment)

3. Six month follow up assessment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: Changes in child eye gaze

Changes in child eye gaze will be assessed in two ways:

1.  Independent observations of eye contact from video recordings of EE interactions.  Videos will be coded using the FOS-VII coding schedule (Pasalich &amp; Dadds, 2009).  Videos will be coded for mother/father and child eye contact, initiated and rejected.  Variables are coded along a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (no occurrence of the behaviour) to 4 (behaviour occurred a lot of the time).  

2. Eye tracking data taken whilst participants perform a computer based emotion recognition task.  Participants will be presented with facial stimuli expressing seven emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, neutral, surprise), and asked to label each emotion.  Eye gaze is tracked and recorded during the task.  Data is analysed for frequency and duration of eye fixations, and number of first foci to the eyes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Pre-treatment assessment

2. Immediate post treatment assessment (e.g., within a week of completing treatment)

3. Six month follow up assessment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome: Changes in levels of relational warmth between parents and child

Changes in levels of relational warmth will be assessed in one way:

1. Independent observations of warmth from video recordings of EE interactions.  Videos will be coded using the FOS-VII coding schedule (Pasalich &amp; Dadds, 2009).  Videos will be coded for mother/father and child level of comfort and genuineness during the interaction, as well as verbal and physical expressions of affection and positive affect. Both the consistency and intensity of variables are coded, along a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (no occurrence of the behavior) to 4 (behavior occurred a lot of the time and/or was of very high intensity).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Pre-treatment assessment

2. Immediate post treatment assessment (e.g., within a week of completing treatment)

3. Six month follow up assessment</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a new treatment for disruptive children with callous-unemotional traits.  The treatment is called 'Emotional Engagement' Treatment, and focuses on the affective dimension of parent-child relations. It has been created specifically to boost warmth in parent-child relationships, and remediate deficits in eye contact by enhancing the salience of the eyes for high CU children.  The aims of the treatment are twofold  to increase parental warmth and to increase the childs attention to parental warmth.  It is believed that improvements in these areas will translate to reductions in disruptive and antisocial behavior.  It is hypothesised that following treatment:

1. Children will show lower levels of disruptive behaviour
2. Children will show higher levels of eye contact
3. There will be higher levels of parental warmth</summary>
