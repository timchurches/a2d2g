  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ambrotose AO Glyco-antioxidant Therapy.  Two tablets were taken orally morning and night.  The active medication contained 18 international units vitamin E, 113 mg Mannatech AO blend and 333mgs of Ambrotose Phyto Formula.  The medication was taken for 5 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The trial is placebo controlled and the placebo is of the same excipient base as the active treatment and is identical in size, shape and colour. Two tablets were taken twice a day for 5 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ex vivo changes in serum oxygen radical absorbance capacity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured over an 8 week period at baseline (week -2) week 0, week 1, week 3 and week 5.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In vivo changes in lymphocyte subsets, lymphocyte activation, Phagocytosis of Granulocytes and Monocytes, and Cyclo oxygenase (COX 2) (anti inflammatory) activity.  Participants had blood samples taken at weeks -2, 0, 1, 3 and 5 to measure these outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This was measured over an 8 week period at baseline (week -2) week 0, week 1, week 3 and week 5.</timepoint>
