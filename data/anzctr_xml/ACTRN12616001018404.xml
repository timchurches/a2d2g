  <interventions>
    <interventions>CFT (Compassion Focussed Therapy) for Depression study; Participants in the CFT intervention will receive and complete a CFT workbook for targeting depression and have 8 x individual 1-hour Skype sessions,  once/ week for 8 weeks with a Provisional Psychologist. The CFT intervention will focus on completion of weekly modules within the provided workbook, providing psychoeducation about the onset of depression and emotion regulation, mindful self-compassion exercises, and adapting thinking and behaviours to become more compassion-oriented. A focus of sessions with therapists will be the practicing of skills in session, problem-solving difficulties in engaging in skills, and providing support and encouragement for participants to complete workbook content. Provisional Psychologists are all enrolled in post-graduate Clinical Psychology degrees. The intervention will occur in the participants home and the La Trobe University Psychology Clinic using Skype software. Intervention adherence will be assessed by a Research Assistant; the therapist will tick a checklist each session of required topics and exercises completed (e.g., review of homework between sessions, completion of a mindfulness activity), which the Research Assistant will check weekly. Treatment fidelity will be improved by regular supervision from a Clinical Psychologist informed of any reductions in adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Guided self-help bibliotherapy. The control condition will receive and read selected sections of a self-help for depression book (Feeling Good, Authored by David Burns), while having 1 x 1 hour Skype session with a Provisional Psychologist four weeks into the eight week guided bibliotherapy to assess compliance and troubleshoot any difficulties in completing the tasks. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using SPSS analysis software. Data analysis will include ANOVA and follow-up t-tests.  To conduct the mixed between (groups) - within (time; pre-post-follow-up) ANOVA's at power = .8, alpha .05, and a small effect, we would need a total sample of at least 42 individuals. Thus, our sample of 50 individuals will be sufficient to analyse the effectiveness of the treatment, accounting for attrition. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) study aims to develop and evaluate a first-ever mindfulness-based compassion intervention to treat depression in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Australians, a high-risk, underserved population. Participants will be 50 LGB adults aged 18-25 with mild-to-moderate depression, who will be randomly assigned to either the eight week compassion-focussed intervention which will be delivered via Skype, or to an active control condition whereby participants will work through a self-help book for depression which has been evaluated in prior research as effective, over an eight week period. Therapists will be Provisionally Registered Psychologists, with training and supervision from Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Chris Pepping. Participants will complete pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up assessments to evaluate intervention effectiveness. Study outcomes include depression and anxiety symptoms, suicidal behaviours, internalised homophobia, self-compassion, and shame-proneness.</summary>
