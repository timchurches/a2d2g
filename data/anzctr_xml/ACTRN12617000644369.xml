  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention (Activate-CP) will be an 8-week program of FES-powered cycling (FES-cycling), goal-directed and task-specific sit-to-stand transfer training and a home-based exercise program for children with CP who use an aid or wheelchair to mobilise. 

The Activate-CP program will consist of 3 x 60 minute training sessions per week for 8 weeks (a total of 24 sessions, total dose of 24 hours). Two sessions per week will be conducted by a qualified physiotherapist who is the principal investigator (EA) at the Queensland Paediatric Rehabilitation Service (QPRS) at the LCCH, or at Griffith University, Gold Coast Campus. The third session each week will be completed as a home or community-based exercise program, supervised by the childs parent/guardian. Each onsite visit will be broken into 30 minutes of FES-C (detailed below) followed by 30 minutes of goal-directed sit-to-stand (STS) transfer practice using a variety of progressive exercises and transfer tasks. The home exercise program will consist of up to 30 minutes of cycling using an adapted cycle and 30 minutes of context-specific transfer practice. Participants will be able to use their own adapted tricycles/bikes if they have access to one or will be provided one on loan. The adapted cycles and various attachments will depend on the child's functional abilities and needs. Cycles may range from a simple recumbent bike with a backrest, to an upright tricycle with a high back rest, looped handle bars, a lap/trunk strap for support and foot straps to keep the child's feet on the pedals. The treating physiotherapist will attend a home visit prior to the study to assess cycling equipment and arrange necessary adaptations. To ensure adequate recovery time, training days will be separated by at least 24 hours.

FES-C training parameters will be as follows:

Frequency: 2 x sessions per week for 8 weeks;
Intensity: &gt;60% of peak heart rate (or &gt;40% of HRR) as determined using the peak HR reached in the incremental cycling test;
Duration: sessions will commence starting at a duration of 15-20mins, increasing to 30 mins;
Progression: Initially, some participants may need to start with shorter sessions while they become accustomed to FES, before progressing to sessions that are greater than 20 mins. Participants will begin cycling for as long as they can before fatigue (up to a maximum of 30 minutes), with the intention to progressively increase the resistance, cadence and cycling duration and reduce the level of motorised support. 

FES will be delivered bilaterally via adhesive surface electrodes (as tolerated) to the quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteals, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles/muscle groups. The stimulation parameters for FES-C will be similar to those used in preliminary feasibility research on adolescents with CP and adjusted based on the participants tolerance (1-3). A global starting frequency of 40Hz - 50Hz will be used for all muscle groups. 40Hz is the default frequency on the RT300, however Harrington (2011) found that 50Hz was well tolerated by adolescents with CP (2,3). For smaller muscle groups such as the gluteals and gastrocnemius, a frequency closer to 40Hz may be more feasible. 

A target amplitude of 40mA will be applied, if tolerated, and overall stimulation intensity will be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the pulse-width between 90-200 microseconds (1-4). Based on feedback from clinicians at our treatment facility, some children may tolerate a low pulse-width and a high amplitude while some prefer a high pulse-width and low amplitude. It may be necessary, therefore, to adjust the pulse-width and amplitude based on participants tolerance, while ensuring that the overall dose is sufficient to induce a motor response.  

STS training parameters will be as follows:

Frequency: 2 sessions x per week for 8 weeks (as per FES-C training);
Intensity: 1-3 sets of 6-15 repetitions of each transfer-related task, or 50-85% of 1 rep max;
Duration: 30mins (following FES-C);
Type: Specific to individual participants and dependent on COPM goals. Examples include practicing transfers from different chair heights (incremented for difficulty by starting from a high chair height to low stool), transferring onto different surfaces (i.e. hard plinth vs a soft couch) or sit to stand practice, incremented for difficulty with weighted backpacks/belts. Activities will be designed to maintain participant motivation and provide enjoyment and sense of achievement.

In addition to the prescribed program, participants will be encouraged to increase the frequency of STS transfers at home and at school to consolidate training effects and to participate in recreational cycling beyond the prescribed training dose, if this is a form of physical activity that participants enjoy. 

Training/treatment fidelity:
The treating therapist will be a physiotherapist registered under the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. The therapist will be trained in the administration of the Gross Motor Functional Measure (GMFM-66) by a senior therapist who is a qualified GMFM assessor. The study therapist will also have completed training in the use of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure and the RT300 cycle ergometer in addition to attending multiple workshops and demonstrations run by an experienced physiotherapist. To maximize participants engagement in the home program, the treating physiotherapist will have appropriate knowledge of adapted cycling equipment/community funding for  equipment. 
Treatment fidelity will be monitored by: Video recording training sessions (with parent/caregiver consent); having one therapist conduct all sessions to ensure consistency; having participants complete training/usual care logs to track the home exercise training dose in addition to other training or therapeutic activities completed throughout the study. Due to the nature of the goal-based STS training, the content of the STS program may differ between participants, although efforts will be made to ensure a similar exercise dose.

    <comparator>Participants in the immediate intervention group (Activate-CP) will be compared with a wait-list control group, who will receive the intervention after 18 weeks (After the immediate intervention group has completed baseline testing (week 1), 8 weeks of training (weeks 2-9), an 8 week maintenance period (weeks 10-17) and follow up testing (week 18)). Both groups of participants will continue to receive usual care throughout the study. Usual care refers to any therapeutic treatment or service that the child would normally receive outside of the intervention study. A usual-care log will be used to record in detail, the types and frequencies of interventions being received by all participants throughout the duration of the study. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations:
The sample size was determined based on GMFM-66 change scores detected in previous studies in children with CP including (i) stationary cycling, (ii) a goal-directed, activity-focused training program and (iii) an intensive upper and lower limb training program which included transfer tasks. Taking into account the proposed treatment dose of 24 hours and severity level of participants (GMFCS levels III - IV), we propose a mean GMFM-66 change score of 3 logit points (100pt scale) as the minimum difference likely to indicate a meaningful clinical improvement. A sample size of 34 participants (17 in each group) are required per group to detect a mean change score of 3 points with 80% power (2-sided test at p&lt;0.05).  We require 40 children (20 participants in each group) to account for any attrition. 

Data Analysis:
Standard principles for RCTs will be followed, using two-group comparisons on all subjects on an intention-to-treat basis. Imputation techniques will be employed to avoid any bias as a result of missing data during follow up. The primary comparison will be after 8 weeks (at T2) on the GMFM-66 between groups using general linear models, with terms included for stratification and confounding variables (e.g. age and functional severity at baseline). Similar methods will be used to determine between group differences at 18 weeks, following an 8 week maintenance period (T3). For dichotomous outcomes, comparison will be by chi-square tests and multiple logistic regressions. Where continuous data exhibit skewness not overcome by transformation, non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney U) will be used for simple comparisons.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The broad aim of this multi-site, randomised wait-list controlled trial is to determine the effectiveness of the 8-week program of FES-cycling and functional sit to stand (STS) training (2 x per week) and a home exercise program (1 x per week) of recreational cycling and STS training, to improve gross motor function (GMFM-66), perceived performance and satisfaction of transfer-related occupational tasks (COPM) and cycling performance (peak power output, resistance and peak HR) in 40 children with moderate CP (GMFCS levels III-IV). Secondary aims are to determine the effects of the intervention on STS performance; the ability to ride an adapted tricycle at home or in the community; quality of life and habitual physical activity levels. A qualitative evaluation will independently examine engagement of children/adolescents and their families in the program. 

This randomised wait-list controlled trial of 40 children with CP will compare an immediate intervention group, to a waitlist group, who will continue to receive usual care then receive the Activate-CP training. Children/youth with CP who are/have: aged 8-18 years; functioning at GMFCS levels III or IV;  currently using a walking aid/wheelchair; goals to improve cycling ability or STS transfers; adequate range of motion (ROM) in the lower limbs to cycle will be recruited.  Activate-CP will consist of 3 x 60 minute training sessions per week for 8 weeks (24 hours over 24 sessions). Two sessions will be FES-C and STS training. The third session will be completed at home including the STS training and recreational cycling.  All FES-C training will be completed on an RT300-SLSA cycle (Restorative Therapies Inc.) designed for users to cycle while sitting in their own wheelchair. FES-electrodes will be applied to both quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteal, gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles as tolerated, A global starting frequency of 50Hz will be applied with a pulse width between 90-200us and target amplitude of 40mA, however these will be adjusted based on participant's tolerance. Participants will undertake STS transfers at home and at school to gain context-specific practice. Adapted and recumbent tricycles will be customised to meet individual needs for use at home and in the community. 

The primary outcome is the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) where an improvement of more than or equal to 3 points following the 8-week intervention is proposed (T2);  along with greater perceived performance and satisfaction ratings (by more than or equal to 2 points) on Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and improved cycling performance (increased peak power output) immediately following the intervention (T2).  Secondary outcomes will test their STS transfer duration (Five times STS test); STS performance (Motor Assessment Scale  STS item), quality of life (CP-QOL) and 7 day habitual physical activity (HPA) levels. </summary>
