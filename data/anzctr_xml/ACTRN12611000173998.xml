  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients in the intervention group recieve the endoscopy LDRf type to observe patients living rate after EVS therapy. Endoscopic variceal scleotherapy (EVS) was performed with 1% ethoxysclerol(4-10 ml each) 2 to 3 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction to eradicate the varices by intravariceal injection 20 minutes each once a week, until esophageal varicosis has disappeared.
The LDRf type is considered to be an advanced endoscopic methods for GI variceal. LDRf type characterize it: L:Location;D:Diameter;Rf :Risk factor;The therapeutic method are decided by Location and Diameter; The therapeutic occasion is decided by Risk factor.Japanese type is a conventional type. Because LDRf type can decrease the risk after esophagus variceals therapy (e.g. rebleeding,mortality,degree of varices; etc).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many articles have showed that LDRf is a safe and effective alternative type for endoscopic esophagus variceal. But there is still no one,which is prospectively randomized and controlled trial , So our purpose is to compare Survival between LDRf type and conventional type for endoscopic therapeutic esophagus variceal after EVS therapy.</summary>
