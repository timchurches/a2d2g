    <interventions>The clinical study will investigate the efficacy and safety of a nasal spray delivered whole plant derived cannabinoid (CBD) extract. The patient will be instructed to initially administer 5 mg of CBD active ingredient, per spray per nostril, prior to commencing chemotherapy providing a total dose of 10 mg. Administration of additional sprays will be a maximum of 6 sprays per nostril over the next 24 hours for a total of 70 mg/day on chemotherapy day and 60 mg/day (6 sprays per nostril) on days 1 4.

Schedule Dose: Day 0 / Chemotherapy Day: Administer 1 nasal spray per nostril prior to commencement of chemotherapy and thereafter 1 nasal spray per nostril every 4 hours [maximum day 0 dose is 70 mg] 
Schedule Dose: Days 14: Administer 1 nasal spray per nostril every 4 hours [maximum day 14 dose 60 mg / day]
Total Dose to be administered over one chemotherapy cycle is 310 mg of Whole Plant CBD Rich Extract

Duration: Up to a maximum of 3 chemotherapy cycles
Methods and tools used to monitor adherence and capture information for endpoints: 1) Rhodes Inventory of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching (RINV) 2) The Functional Living Index-Emesis-5 Day Recall (FLIE-5DR) 3) Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) 4) Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) 5) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and Fatigue (Facit-F) subscale 6) Treatment Adherence Questionnaire/Table

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We anticipate that the proportion of patients who experience CINV with adjunctive cannabinoid therapy will be approximately 20% better, that is approximately 70%.

Using Fishers exact test for comparing two proportions, power set at 80% and a two-tailed significance level of 0.05, the number of participants required in each group will be 93.  Accounting for an attrition rate of 20%, the required sample size is 112 per group (n = 224 total participants to complete clinical trial)

*	Analyses will be conducted using intention-to-treat principles i.e. the consent process will maximise outcome data collection and attempt to assess nausea symptoms for everyone, and will retain original group allocation despite compliance levels.
*	Descriptive statistics will be presented as mean ± standard deviation, or median with range, as appropriate. 
*	Parametric analyses will be used for all continuous variables.  Non-parametric equivalent will be used for data that are not normally distributed.
*	Chisquare analyses will determine associations between categorical variables and will allow assessment of whether the incidence, severity and type of nausea differ between the two groups. 
*	Pearson correlation analysis of continuous variables will be performed. 
*	Repeated measures ANOVA will be conducted to detect between group differences over time as per our statistician recommendations. 
*	Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05 level (two-tailed). 
*	Data will be analysed using Stata 13.1 MP for Mac or later.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial aims to compare the safety and efficacy of Cannabinoid Nasal Spray Micelle as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy-naive oncology patients. 

Who is it for? All chemotherapy-naive patients receiving moderate-high emetogenicity chemotherapy aged 18 years or over. 

Study details: All participants in this study are randomly allocated to one of the two groups. Participants in one group will use a cannabinoid derived nasal spray in addition to standard nausea and vomiting treatment for five chemotherapy days. Participants in the second group will use a nasal placebo spray in addition to standard nausea and vomiting treatment for five chemotherapy days. 

There is a 50% chance of being assigned to one of the two groups. Participants are expected to have routine blood tests as standard of care provided by the medical oncologists. In addition, participants are expected to complete multiple questionnaires provided by the study investigators. The questionnaires will include 1) One RINV questionnaire per day (one on the day of chemotherapy, and one each of the 4 days post chemotherapy. 2) Two FACT-G/FACIT-F questionnaires per cycle. 3) One FLIE-5DR questionnaire per cycle. 4) Two ESAS questionnaires per cycle. 5) One Adherence Questionnaire for each day the participant receives the study medication. 

This study aims to see a 'complete response', where 'complete response' is defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue medication.
