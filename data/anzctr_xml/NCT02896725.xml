  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Venous leg ulcers (VLU) are the most common leg ulcer, can be painful, and limit work,
      lifestyles and activity, especially in older patients. Compression bandaging is the main
      treatment but there are few added treatments for patients with slow healing VLU. About 50% of
      patients with VLU may be slow healing. Research suggests using keratin dressings as well as
      using compression may help healing in patients with show healing VLU, but the current
      evidence is not enough to change clinical practice. The investigators will conduct a
      randomised controlled trial to test whether using keratin dressings is better than usual care
      for slow healing VLU.</summary>
