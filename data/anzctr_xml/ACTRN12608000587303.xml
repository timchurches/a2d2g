  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants with diabetes type II and depression will be randomly allocated to Intervention Group 1(depression focussed CBT) or Intervention Group 2 (integrated CBT &amp; diabetes education)
Depression focussed treatment covers relationship between thoughts and feelings, thought challenging, behavioural activation, problem solving, mindfulness, schema therapy and relapse prevention. 
Integrated treatments cover relationship between thoughts and feelings, thought challenging, behavioural activation, problem solving, mindfulness, schema therapy and relapse prevention, understanding diabetes and the diabetes pathway, medications, foot care, dietary information (Glycaemic Index, fats, sodium &amp; sugar), label reading, health plans.
Both interventions are delivered in small groups, for 90 minutes sessions once a week, over eight weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Minimal intervention involves fortnightly collection of  measures (Beck Depression Inventory-fast screen (BDI-FS) and Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID), and Fasting glucose for that day . Phone calls are brief, around ten minutes in duration. 
The participants for minimal intervention are provided with basic depression information handouts and a self help book on depression after BDI at week 4, when their scores fall below fifteen, and exclude them from randomisation to intervention groups. Self help information and resources are mailed out.</comparator>

    <concealment>All participants undergo comprehensive assessment and then are tracked for fasting BGL, scores on BDI-FS and PAID Scale measures each two weeks for four weeks.
At four weeks participants with BDI-FS&lt; 15 will be allocated to the minimal intervention, and those with BDI-FS &gt;15 will be randomly allocated to either depression alone or integrated treatment conditions. A computer generated sequence has been given to a central register person(blinded).  Allocation for participants is made by phone call to this register.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has shown that people with Type II Diabetes are at increased risk of developing depression, and the combination of both disorders increases the likelihood of the development of diabetes related complications. Diabetes related complications often means increased need for medical interventions, increased hospitalizations and generally poorer health outcomes for patients. 
This research projects aims to evaluate interventions for depression in patients with Diabetes type II. Minimal intervention (self help resources and regular monitoring) single focused intervention (depression alone treatment) and integrated treatment (depression intervention and diabetes education) will be compared.
Participants in the depression focussed or integrated treatments will attend small group sessions for 90 minutes each week over eight weeks. Outcomes (depressive symptoms, self care beahviours and HbA1c) will be measured post treatment, three and six months.</summary>
