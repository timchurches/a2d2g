  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at 12 Weeks - Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the 23 hour 15 minute and 23 hour 45 minute post-dose FEV1 readings. Mixed model used baseline FEV1,baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) Focal Score After 26 Weeks of Treatment - Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) captures changes from baseline. The TDI score is based on three domains with each domain scored from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), to give an overall score of -9 to +9, a negative score indicating a deterioration from baseline. A TDI focal score of 1 is considered to be a clinically significant improvement from baseline. Mixed model used baseline TDI, baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life Assessment With St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score After 26 Weeks of Treatment - SGRQ is a health related quality of life questionnaire consisting of 51 items in three components: symptoms, activity, and impacts. The lowest possible value is zero and the highest 100. Higher values correspond to greater impairment in quality of life. Mixed model used baseline SGRQ, baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>26 weeks</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Moderate or Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation During 26 Weeks of Treatment - The time to the first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation was the study day on which the patient experienced first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation. COPD exacerbations are considered to be moderate if treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics was required. COPD exacerbations are considered to be severe if treatment for moderate severity and hospitalization were required.</outcome>

      <outcome>FEV1 at Each Time-point on Day 1 and Week 26 - Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. FEV1 was measured at all time points up to 4 hours post-dose, and at 23 hours 15 min and 23 hours 45 min, by visit. Mixed model used baseline FEV1,baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough FEV1 and FVC at Day 1 and Week 26 - Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the 23 hour 15 minute and 23 hour 45 minute post-dose FEV1 readings. Mixed model used baseline FEV1, baseline ICS use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of SABA, and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.

      <outcome>Change in 24-hourly Mean Heart Rate at Day 1, Week 12 and Week 26 - The mean heart rate was collected with a 24 hour Holter monitor in a sub-set of the safety population. The change between baseline and day 1, week 12 and week 26 was calculated. The analysis of the Holter recordings was performed by a central facility. Data on heart rate, heart rate variability, supraventricular and ventricular ectopy were collected and assessed.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Moderate or Severe COPD Exacerbations Over the 26 Week Treatment Period - One overall rate is calculated for the entire study population. Rate is the number of moderate or severe exacerbations per year = total number of moderate or severe exacerbations for all participants/total number of treatment years for all participants. COPD exacerbations were considered to be moderate if treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics was required.

      <outcome>Mean Daily Total Symptom Score Over the 26 Week Treatment Period - The daily symptom score was calculated as the sum of the worst of the morning and evening assessments for each symptom (symptoms, cough, wheeze, sputum color/production, and breathlessness). The score can range from 0 to 18 with 0 indicating no symptoms. The higher the score, the worse the symptomatic status. A negative change (lower number) indicates improvement.
Mixed model used baseline symptom variables, baseline inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use, FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting beta-agonist (SABA), and FEV1 45 minutes post-inhalation of SABA as covariates.</outcome>
