  <interventions>
    <interventions>The transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) machine is a small device (approximately 20 cm x 30 cm), connected to 240V power source. It has two independent channels of current. We use electrodes that are small sticky pads of 4 cm x 4 cm (pure silicon). The device delivers an interferential current with a carrier frequency of 4 Hz, a beat frequency sweep covering 80 to 160 Hz, with an adjustable intensity less than 33 milliA. Individual pulses have duration of 250 micros (constant alternating current). 
Two pairs of electrodes are placed on the front and on the back of the inferior abdomen. Stimulation will be delivered daily for 1 hour, either mornings or evenings, for 2 months, at home, by the participant themselves or their carer.
Patients will be in contact by phone each week and asked if they have used the TES each day and for how long. TES use will be recorded on the daily bowel diary. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of faecal incontinence (based on the bowel diaries). The bowel diaries will record frequency of bowel movements, time spent for defecation, need for help for evacuation (digital stimulation, laxatives, enemas), feeling of completeness of evacuation, associated pain, frequency of faecal incontinence, incontinence for solid or liquid stool, incontinence for gas, need to wear a pad or a plug. It is a composite primary outcome: this will allow us to obtain a score of faecal incontinence (St-Marks faecal incontinence score). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily diaries will be completed by the participant during a two times two-week period, during the 2 months of baseline measurements and then during the 2 months of the intervention (stimulation), .</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>This phase II study will provide data about the distribution of the incontinence frequency in the population of children with spina bifida who failed treatment with retrograde continence enema. The population is foreseen to be heterogeneous.
We will compare the severity of faecal incontinence and the quality of life before and at the end of 2 months of transcutaneous electrical stimulation. After this study, the range of confidence intervals could be estimated.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine if transcutaneous electrical stimulation can reduce the severity of persistent faecal incontinence in a group of children with spina bifida previously unsuccessfully treated with retrograde continence enema.
Faecal incontinence in children with spina bifida is currently treated by retrograde continence enema. Transcutaneous electrical therapy will be proposed as an alternative therapy to children with spina bifida aged 8-18 who have failed retrograde continence enema treatment.
We have not tested transcutaneous electrical stimulation on children with spina bifida. There has been one study using transcutaneous electrical stimulation to treat faecal incontinence in children with spina bifida but there were no quantitative outcome measures that could be used to predict the number of patients needed in a randomized control trial.
A baseline period will be followed with a therapy (stimulation) period.
Outcomes measurements will be compared before and after stimulation. Outcomes are severity of faecal incontinence, quality of life and colonic transit time.
