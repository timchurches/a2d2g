             .Patients requiring revision surgery of a previously implanted total hip replacement
             system or patients requiring a conversion surgery from a previous fracture fixation or
             hip fusion.

        5. Patients with presence of malignancy in the area of the involved hip joint. 6. Patients
        who, as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or are reasonably unlikely to be
        compliant with the prescribed postoperative routine and the follow-up evaluation schedule.

        7. Patients with other concurrent illnesses that are likely to affect their outcome such as
        sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring dialysis.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study design comprises a randomized trial of patients undergoing primary total hip
      arthroplasty using the G7 acetabular system and Taperloc Complete stem comparing regular
      plasma porous spray with HA coating using Bonemaster (BM) in an uncemented cup. DEXA scanning
      will be used to measure periprosthetic bone mineral density. Clinical evaluations will be
      conducted .</summary>
