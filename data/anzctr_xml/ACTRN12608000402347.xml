  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim is to achieve tight glycaemic control with supplemental subcutaneous insulin, either Novorapid, or Actrapid. For subjects randomised to Novorapid, they will receive supplemental Novorapid if their glucose level is &gt;8 mmol/L at a standard testing time (before meals/after meals/2200), in accordance with an algorithm which takes into consideration the subject's weight, glucose level and time of day. Subjects randomised to Actrapid will be administered supplemental insulin if their glucose level is &gt;10 mmol/L, in accordance with a similar algorithm. The intervention will continue until discharge, or the occurence of an event which mandates withdrawal (eg becomes nil by mouth, insulin infusion commenced). This is a hospital based intervention only.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a comparison of 2 active treatments to determine which gives the greatest efficacy with the fewest complications.</comparator>

      <timepoint>This will be assessed over the entire period of the person's involvement in the trial, and determined on the basis of blood glucose measurements by fingerprick performed at standard times before and after meals, bedtime and 0200-0300.</timepoint>
