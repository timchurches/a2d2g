    <summary>1. Background / Scientific Rationale

      The VEW (Vomiting, Eating, and Weight Loss) Questionnaire has been developed as a method for
      the assessment of post bariatric surgery patients, as well as a research tool into the eating
      behaviour of these patients.

      Objective VEW Questionnaire Premise If used optimally the VEW score is a valuable tool for
      patients who have had Laparoscopic Gastric Band Surgery (LAGB). The VEW score will be able to
      assist clinicians treating patients with a LAGB, specifically the Swedish Adjustable Gastric
      Band (SAGB), by providing them a tool to enhance patient outcomes. By using the information
      gained from the VEW questionnaire we can assess many areas of the eating behavior, and
      adjustment outcomes in patients with Gastric Bands.

      Hypotheses:

        -  The VEW questionnaire aids in the assessment of the need for gastric band adjustment (up
           or down in volume)

             -  Comparison of patient factors in those who have had a

                  1. good outcome (increased weight loss)

                  2. bad outcomes (vomiting, low weight loss, maladaption), from a gastric band
                     fluid addition

             -  In patients who have had a bad outcome, which factors are more predictive?

        -  Fewer Complications associated with Gastric Band Adjustments

             -  Obstruction

             -  Need for urgent deflation

             -  Pain on eating

             -  Lowering incidence of inappropriate fills

             -  Lower incidence of maladaption

        -  Eating behavior can predict long term outcomes

           o By comparison of factors in the different quartiles of weight loss (particularly top
           25% cf. bottom 25%)

        -  Maintenance of weight loss after 12 months is best achieved by use of behavior
           modification via improved food tolerances and better eating behavior than by increasing
           restriction of the band by further adjustments. 12 months is chosen as an arbitrary time
           where the majority of expected weight loss (45% of expected 50-55% 0f EWL) has been
           achieved. It is also a time frame by which patients have learnt to use the band
           appropriately, and the gastric band has had time to be adjusted into its optimal range.

        -  The VEW questionnaire can help predict poor outcomes from a SAGB adjustment.

             -  By analyzing the factors in patients who have returned both acutely (days) or at
                subsequent visits (weeks) and had fluid removed from their bands. These factors
                would include pain, vomiting, length of meals, maladaption score, fluid added, etc.</summary>
