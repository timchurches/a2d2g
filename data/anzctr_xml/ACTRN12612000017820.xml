  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will inhale 4mL technetium-99m DTPA radioaerosol in random order throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes for each of the regimens on two separte days: 1. Standard nebulisation period of 20 minutes, or
2. Nebulisation period of 20 minutes with the addition of a positive expiratory pressure device.
The two study days will have a minimum of 48 hours washout between them and not greater than 7 days (to ensure clinical stability).
After each nebulisation a gamma camera will perform a 20 minute deposition scan incorporating a transmission scan to outline the three-dimensional margin of the lung fields. This data will be reconstructed to determine the distribution of the deposited radioaerosol in the lungs.</interventions>

      <outcome>The 3-dimensional map of the lung fields will be divided into unit volumes (voxels). The amount of radioactivity in each voxel will be calculated.

    <concealment>Potential participants will be invited to read an Information for Participants document, and sign a consent form to participate in the study. Eligibility will then be confirmed with reference to the willing participantâ€™s spirometry in standing according to the most recent American Thoracic Society criteria Participants will then be randomised via a coin toss by a blinded investigator to regimen "1. or 2." for the first study day (but will be unaware of the associated  regimen) to one of: 1. Standard nebulisation period of 20 minutes, or 2. Nebulisation period of 20 minutes with the addition of a positive expiratory pressure device. Participants will be requested to adopt this strategy and maintain a normal tidal breathing pattern during the subsequent standard study inhalation. When participants return for their second study day, they will adopt the other inhalation regimen.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research question: To determine whether the addition of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) improves uniformity of deposition of an inhaled aerosol in upright sitting in participants with cystic fibrosis.

Methods: Inclusion criteria: greater than or equal to 18 years of age, confirmed cystic fibrosis, stable lung function. Participants will inhale a 4mL radioaerosol in two stategies in random order throughout the nebulisation period of 20 minutes:
	1. Standard nebulisation period of 20 minutes, or
	2. Nebulisation period of 20 minutes with the addition of a PEP device.

After each nebulisation a gamma camera will perform a 20-minute deposition scan incorporating a transmission scan to outline the three-dimensional margin of the lung fields. This data will be reconstructed to determine the distribution of the deposited radioaerosol in the lungs. A 15% improvement in uniformity of deposition is the proposed minimum difference that would make further investigation of the PEP strategy worthwhile in patient populations.

Significance of project: In many patient populations (eg, cystic fibrosis, HIV and bronchiectasis), the pattern of deposition of inhaled medication is poor and non-uniform. The ability to deliver a drug more uniformly to the lung using the addition of PEP may have a significant impact on treatment efficacy for people with lung disease. Data from healthy participants will aid interpretation of subsequent studies in patients.</summary>
